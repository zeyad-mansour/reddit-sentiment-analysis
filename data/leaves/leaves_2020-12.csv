I’ve been smoking daily for two years and it used to really help calm down my thoughts and keep me happy at night, but over the past couple of months it’s only been making my mental illnesses worse. I’m constantly dissociating, my depersonalization is awful and my motivation is non existent. My doctor is suggesting quitting so my medications have the opportunity to work at their full capacity as well as her worry that I’m on track to develop psychosis. At this point the cons of me continuing to smoke outweigh the pros so it’s a no brainer that I need to quit in order to get my life on track. The last time I tried to quit went very poorly and I put my life in danger by the second night. It feels almost impossible for me to quit considering my circumstances and I was hoping someone who’s struggled with these same issues has any tips on how to make quitting less of a horrid experience.

Simple of joy of living.. being content being myself and with others without the need of alteration.  Without the need of numbing or escaping or enhancement.  I miss laughing till I cry over silly friends and the excitement of learning something new, meeting new people without paranoia and creating easy friendships.  I miss all the times I could have hung out with my nieces and nephews when they were little but I chose to spend my time getting high instead of getting to know them and being close.. they are all now adults and I've lost that opportunity. 

I don't miss the dull feeling of emptiness when I smoke all day.  I don't miss the isolation and the stigma. I don't miss the coughing and the wheezing.  I don't miss the anxiety attacks when I don't have enough money in my budget for weed or the anxiety of simply running out of weed. I don't miss the friends I had who were there because our singular thing in common was smoking.  

20 years is a really long time to waste on a habit that's essentially killing me physically, emotionally, and mentally.  What's left for a person to fill themselves up with when they've been hollow for so long?  How can I restore 20 years worth of waste?  How can I get myself back? Honestly I don't even know who I am anymore. I'm sad because I moved away from my entire family 15 years ago so I could live my stoner life without anyone to call me out on it.

I made a post at day 10 to let you know where I was, and how I was doing. As before, I would like to thank all of you for your posts and support. Without you, I do not think I would have made it this far. I also want you to know that I am much happier now that I am sober and haven't smoked for 1 month. 1 month is achievable, and if I can do it so can you!

Here are some of the things that have helped me stay focused and stay strong:

\- Working out and doing consistent exercise has helped immensely. Taking time each day to put effort toward goals in physical strength and fitness has helped me want to stay away from marijuana, as I know if I started smoking again I would never attain my goals. I have always been fairly unfit and weak for my size, and I am finally starting to change that. When I was in University I tried working out but stopped abruptly after smoking, as I lost interest and motivation even though I was seeing progress.

\- Support has been a huge factor for keeping my head above water. This community and the support I receive from my brother and family has been nothing short of amazing. When I have urges, or am feeling down, I know my brother will listen to my thoughts and feelings giving support when I need it most. When I feel I need to realize how bad my addiction is, I can read posts of those struggling with a similar problem as myself, and also read those who have been able to achieve long periods without marijuana as motivation for where I can get myself. I know when I was getting through the first 5 days of sobriety, it was extremely tough and I struggled with a lot of symptoms. Sometimes it can be difficult to remember how bad my addiction was, but your posts help me remember the struggles I had and the pain of withdrawals.

\- Reading books has always been a hobby of mine, which I neglected while smoking because I could not concentrate or remember the books very well. I also spent a lot of time re-reading sections because I lost focus easily. Reading a new book (A Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson) has been very fun and has taken my mind off smoking. I enjoy being able to once again sit for multiple hours at a time to read a book and completely submerging myself in this fantasy land. 

These are the things that have helped me the most, and even though our struggles our different, we all desire the same outcome. So thanks again, and I wish you the best of luck on your journeys. Thanks for reading, and I hope to submit another post at 6 months.",10

Sometimes I feel I’m being dramatic and just maybe I should put off quitting until I’m older, and I’ve really had all the “fun” I could with weed.

2020-12-30 18:16:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kndbxm/day_1_venting_why_im_quitting/,Day 1: Venting/ Why I'm Quitting,"So it's day 1 without weed after smoking almost daily for a few years now. This is really hard. I'm typing this to keep my hands busy so I don't text my dealer. 

It all started back in 2016 when I met my ex who was a major stoner, he always kept weed and his stash was my stash while we dated. I smoked a few times back in college before him but never on a regular or daily basis. So basically I got hooked on it from him and when we broke up I started buying my own weed. 

I've always been a lightweight with weed and I think by a lot of y'all's standards I probably still am. When I first started buying weed, a dime bag would last me a week, then it became a dub, now it's an eighth. I have a roommate who smokes about an eighth a day so even at my most stoner-ish I just never felt like I was really that bad of a smoker by comparison to those around me. I roll a joint and it lasts me all day just taking a few puffs at a time as the high wears off. 

Last year I got my masters degree and started my career. It's a very professional conservative work environment in an illegal state so obviously I'm not supposed to be smoking weed. When I first started the job last year, I quit for that first three months cold turkey bc I really wanted to put my best foot forward. As I got comfortable at the job though, I started to smoke again after work. 

This was all fine while we were working in person. I had to get up at 5:30 am each day, commute for 1.5 hours, work in a shared office where my boss checks in a bunch since I'm new, etc. I didn't have time to smoke until around 5pm when I got home from work and then I had to be in bed by 10ish to be up for work again the next day. I couldn't really get out of control.

But now we're working from home. We set our own schedules so I can roll out of bed at 8:30 am, for that first mandatory zoom at 8:45 and then set up however many clients I want to meet with that day. This freedom is really bad for someone like me who has self control problems. There's times I've set up a couple sessions in the morning and then smoked the rest of the day away, it's sooo bad. Or I'll set up a few in the morning, give myself a two hour break to smoke and then meet with clients after. 

I feel so guilty sometimes when I do it because I know I shouldn't but when that urge comes it's hard to say no. I only take a few puffs, so that the high will be over by the time I have to get back on camera, but still, they're kids so it feels even more taboo. I feel like such a fail, I'm supposed to be an adult who is responsible and capable of making good decisions, I'm supposed to have self control. That is what I'm teaching my students/clients to do anyway, but I can't even abide by it myself. :(

Just for context, I need my memory to be working well in my field, as a school counselor, I wouldn't want a student to feel like they're repeating what they said last time or that I'm not listening. But at the same time that's what session notes are for. It's very easy for me to just search the student and pull up all the notes I ever wrote on them and solve that whole issue (yayyy technology!) But is that the best way? Idk. 

Then there's the lack of motivation, the sticky resin/thc residue on things in my room, the ashes and ashtrays, the cost, purchasing fronto leaf, papers, lighters, all the time etc. Saying things I don't mean just from being stupid and high has almost cost me two good relationships in my life this year and that's the main reason I want to quit. 

I keep trying to find reasons why it wouldn't be so bad to smoke like ""ehhh, a lil eighth that lasts a week ain't nothing compared to the real stoners"" and ""hey, mental health professionals deserve to smoke after dealing with everyone else's issues"" and ""hey you don't really need your memory to be pristine, you can just look it up in the system, work smarter not harder"" and ""c'mon girl all you're doing is hopping on Zoom with teen high schoolers and letting them talk about their feelings, it's not that serious, it's fine to smoke"". Then you have new states legalizing it all the time which makes me feel like it's not that bad. It's just a whirlwind of confusion for me. To smoke or not to smoke?

Tl;Dr I'm trying to quit again so I can be more present at my job, retain my memory, and stop being a blabbering idiot",1

I'm 30 days weed-free, 209 days alcohol-free. The alcohol has been a breeze for me but I was a heavy smoker for years. I used weed and alcohol to cope with general anxiety, social anxiety, and depression. I used to smoke so I could feel comfortable around friends, smoke so I could make my thoughts slow down, smoke so I could zone out and do my chores/errands, etc.

At first I was irritable, anxious, sweaty, paranoid, I had no appetite, things like that. On day 11 a family member was rushed to the hospital and died a week later. It was awful. But I was really grateful to have quit in time to go through initial withdrawal symptoms and be present and supportive for my family.

It's about to be two weeks since that death in my family. This past week I've been consumed by my anxiety and depression. I'm back to irritability and so much aggression. I've got no motivation to do anything. Before my family member was rushed to the hospital, however, things were feeling really good and I was improving in so many ways. But since then, the grief changed everything.

Thank you.","Hi, thanks for stopping by. I want to declare my intent to someone and this subreddit seems like a good place to do it. 

I've decided to stop smoking , more on than in a bit. 

Nice to meet you, I'm A. You could say I'm a typical guy in his 20s. I'm in good health, I've recently graduated dental school and I'm looking forward to enjoying my career. I'm  blessed with a couple of loving family members and close friends. I try to take good care of my physical and mental wellbeing, although so far, I've not been able to maintain stable results in my life. I've suffered for some of my decisions over the years, one of which was to continuously prioritize being high no matter the damage to my social and professional life, my mental health and the risk to my future self. I've been getting high almost daily over the past 8-9 years. 
It's truly a gift that I've managed to lead a fairly normal, functional life, despite the drug-related risks I've taken over the years. I'm grateful to be here, writing this after everything. 

After reflecting on the events of my life, I've come to the conclusion, that while getting high was once benefitial to me socially, mentally, spiritually and emotionally, now my life is different. Getting high is now has the opposite effect for me. I'm inhibiting myself, living a lackluster life, mostly alone and demotivated. And I also have had a hard time stopping this activity so far. 

Recently, I began paying attention to just how much I dislike the ""getting high is a priority"" lifestyle and all the things I sacrifice in order to sustain it. I do not want to be this kind of person anymore. I want to shift my life's focus from getting high to spending quality time with loved ones, advancing my career, exploring the other opportunities of the world. 

Unwinding with a joint and some friends is alright for me. Every now and then, on a few occasions in the year. It's a culture, and I love that. In the right circumstances. 

Where I'm at right now, I know in my heart that I want to create a better life for myself and the people around me. I cannot do that if I continue to suppress myself by getting high. I've decided to withdraw smoking from my daily life with the exception of a few special occasion over the year. 

The intention I put behing this decision is that I want to commit to becoming a more open, uninhibited, loving and caring person. I want to become a better version of myself and face the world and what it offers with passion and curiousity. I want to make better use of my time. I do not want to be addicted to getting high.

I’ve learnt a lot through my use and abuse of weed. The feeling of getting high has been uncomfortable these past few weeks. I was 49 days sober, had a traumatic re-engagement with ex partner and somehow lost my sense and fell back into old thinking patterns so quickly which led to me creating an excuse to smoke - and a trail of other actions (drinking excessively, taking Ritalin, porn, sex with stranger, partying, use of other amphetamines, MDMA, catching corona, making out with people, sleeping alone, excessive smoking, weed, drinking, cocaine, more weed). Basically I went from what I thought was an untouchable state of mind - releasing all drugs, and within the space of 1 day up until now I managed to enact all these regressive behaviors. Oh poor me ;) 

But I feel a change in the tide. I have been sober twice this year for a month at a time, and learnt so much in that time. I know I don’t need weed at this stage in my life, and feel that from tomorrow from New Year’s Eve I will be setting ahead sober. Of course I feel nervous, but I will feel so much better (and worse) - worse with more clarity, then better. I feel more at ease, and I feel that the third time will be the charm, as I smoke my last joint tomorrow. Even with the uncertainty of these times I know I have to move beyond this fully and step into a greater character.

After finding myself a new house, becoming fit, starting to date again and improving my mental health I wonder sometimes if it's possible to ever enjoy a smoke again.

After finding calm in my life again after a borderline abusive relationship I would like to know if anyone has had a similar experice where they were able to enjoy perhaps one small joint every other month or so at social events etc.

I’ve been lurking and posted a few days ago about my folks finding out I’m deeply addicted to weed. This community has helped me so much to talk about and get my ideas and thoughts out on this whole ordeal and I can’t thank y’all enough. 

Today I go without any edibles, joints, bowls, vapes. Nothing. And I don’t feel terrible. Something I’m wondering, has anyone else had this experience when trying to quit? I think my tolerance is so damn high that I haven’t been getting that super duper crazy high from what I’ve been intaking. Before this week, it took me 250mg edibles and several grams of good flower before I could really get high. So the amount of actual “high” I was getting was low, and as a result, quitting doesn’t feel that different. Maybe I’m just in the early early phases of this, but I’m finding it easier every day. Tomorrow I might have a small bowl, only because weed did a lot of good in my life and I feel like it deserves a proper send off, and the last day of 2020, but after that I think I’m going to be sober for good. 

Again, thanks to everyone here for the support and help. Every message, every person on here sharing their stories, it all makes this much easier. I smoked so much just to cope with loneliness. I had thoughts about wanting to end it because I didn’t see a way out and I was just letting myself waste away. My motivation to become better was gone. 

Having a community to rally around during this is truly the biggest change in my life as of late and I’m tearing up writing this because y’all are a group of random strangers around the world and y’all are so damn nice and supportive. Thank you thank you thank you. 

Much Love, and I’m here if anyone wants to talk about quitting pot, music, or just anything. Have a lovely day and wish me luck!",3

I start college January 25th. I'm excited but also anxious about the work load/life balance as I'll be doing both school and work full time. 

Other than college, I would like to be more motivated and just more mentally there. 

My main worry and deterrent for quitting is my trouble sleeping. When I first tried smoking, it was a Godsend that it helped me sleep. I also take medication for depression now that ups your adrenaline and makes it harder to fall asleep, even with smoking. When COVID first hit, I couldn't get anymore so I spent about a month and a half sober. It took forever to fall asleep. It was never deep sleep. It sucked. 

So, I'm looking for advice on how to quit with all this in mind. 

I don't want to take another medication, especially since sleep meds are infamous for causing a chemical addiction. 

I have tried other anti depressants and they do not work for me. 

I take melatonin right now in tandem with smoking. Took it without smoking during the COVID dry spell and it did not help.

2020-12-30 12:30:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kn6jrm/revelations/,Revelations,"Hmm, where to begin...

Hello r/leaves. I have a problem with addiction. That’s the most straightforward sentence I can give to introduce myself. 

I’ve been on and off with different vices over the years, including alcohol, cocaine, mushrooms, mdma, and of course cannabis. 

I quit all of the drugs other than cannabis about 5 years ago. During my drug use, I also developed a drinking problem (see my post history). Thankfully, and with a lot of help from r/stopdrinking I managed to quit completely (381 days alcohol free so far!)

Cannabis was something I’ve always had. I always said “unlike alcohol and other drugs, weed doesn’t have the ability to completely fuck up my life.” I first smoked weed when I was 16, and was casual with it for the first year or so. Once I realized I could smoke whenever I wanted, and had friends of the same mindset, that’s when I went hard, as most teens/early 20somethings do. I got to a point where it wasn’t helping me anymore, and I was about to start my last year of college which was really important. I ended up quitting for a year and a half before easing back in because I had new non chronic pothead friends, college was over, and I moved into my own place. 

Cannabis has always been a thing in my life (30 years old now) and I think it’s time to take a serious break. Now that I’ve rid myself of alcohol, cannabis is next. I don’t want to be “alcohol free”, I want to be “sober”! 

My wife and I have been seeing a marriage therapist as we have been having some communication breakdowns recently. We also have a toddler who is almost 2, and things have been crazy this year. One of the things our therapist has us focus on is putting the other person first. I thought I did a pretty good job of that until I thought about my weed use. Weed is straight up putting yourself first. Getting high trumps everything else, even if you don’t think so. I’ve realized our communication issues are as a result of my either being high, or being cloudy from coming down. 

I will say that weed was a tremendous help for kicking booze, but at this point I believe I used it as a crutch, or have just traded one habit for another. 

If you try to quit everything all at once, you are setting yourself up for failure. It’s one of the main concepts in the book “The Power of Habit”. I think now that I’ve kicked my alcohol problem, weed is next. 

I owe it to my wife and my son. They deserve to interact with a husband and father that is clear headed. 

It’s funny because I am doing well career wise, have a house, 2 cars etc. But it doesn’t mean I’m stunting my personal growth. 

I’m not saying I’m quitting forever, just not today. Thanks for reading, I’ll be frequenting this sub for a while.",2

Reporting morning of day five.,"I would like to begin by saying holy heck. This community is as amazing and resilient as it is helpful and inclusive. I'm seriously proud of all of you and if I could give ONE piece of advice to any it's keep going, just worry about the next hour. Don't think about how long you're quitting for, how long it's been, how long it's going to be. 

Anxiety thrives in the future where it can hide behind the unknown, and Depression thrives in the past where it can hide behind what is (usually well and worn) known. If you spend your time in these realms, you compromise time in the present to, well, be present. 

I've been smoking heavily/daily since age 18/19, did dabs for the first time probably around the same time. Had a bad, but quick bout with heroin addiction from the ages of 21-23 (three years clean at the end of next month), kicked it in a detox/locked facility then halfway house for three months. I have depression and adhd diagnosed in childhood. Oh, also a cigarette smoker since 18. 

End of 2018 up to around August 2019, got reeeeal heavy into dabs/carts with a partner of mine, their father was an alcoholic that had been terminal for 4 YEARS at the time. Partner in question had also become an alcoholic and was finishing a sleeve, sometimes two per day of whiskey. My partner was one of their fathers' only supports (Good Father turned old shitty drunkard, to be fair his wife died in a car accident when my partner was 7 months old) Really dark relationship. I dabbed to sleep through it as much as possible. We were spending about ~60 usd every 2-4ish days at one point. Let me just say that no human should be able to take two fat dabs upon waking and go drive for Lyft at 7am.

All this background is important because my (forced) situation of quitting at that point was I had something of a mental breakdown and I could NOT figure out why. Partner broke up with me because they felt I was using them for weed (fair and unfortunately true in a way). I had no job at the time, I had been preparing to move with them to FL from MA. 

Good thing I didn't, because I spent the next near m o n t h plagued by the worst anxiety of my life. I remember my thoughts were really only 'ok, now what, now what, what now? Now what do I do?' all while sitting on the bed, pacing, staring at the wall. There were days I physically could not form full sentences. I was running my tongue along my teeth so much that my tongue was bleeding. I would sleep 2-4 hours each night, only to wake up at 4-5am and vomit. Incredibly constipated (which was bad/lack of diet I think). Would pretty much just puke up anything I ate. Every. Day. For a month. Went to the hospital twice for fluid replacement. I thought I was losing my mind, just a mental break from all the shit I was dealing with, but after reading about peoples' DT experiences on here I'm realizing over a year later that it was THC withdrawal, y'awl. So, thank you for solving that mystery for me! 

So, fast forward to now. I got serious with my husband during the end of previously mentioned DTs. Besides maybe my brother, he has been THE MOST positive influence on my life so far. He doesn't care for smoking and has caught me twice now, I got back on the carts when the pandemic lifted bans on dispensaries and have been at it strong for these last 8-10months. I feel like shit for lying to him when he's been nothing but loving and supporting. Even after I admitted I'd started smoking after saying I'd stop, he thanked me for my honesty and willingness to change. 

The first day I read this thread, I was in disbelief, so angry that society lied to me, my brother, and my dearest friends. A drug that makes you ok with being bored and complacent  in this wild world is all too tempting, and a prescription for a life lacking. 

My husband (who has had no addiction in his life) made a good observation- likely in about 30-60 years when the next generations come along, society will find out what the real dangers of weed are. I'd like to add to that and say this: Until that time comes along, you have only your own emotions and experiences (and others going through it, thanks for sharing your experience) to show for this. Your mother, best stoner friend, your boss, society- they're not gonna get it. This is YOUR journey. Please stay strong 💪

TL;DR Thanks adhd. Ex heroin addict coming to terms with the fact I replaced my addiction with something else- and doing something about it, with all your help. Many thanks and best of luck. IT'S TEMPORARY, NO MATTER WHAT YOUR BRAIN TELLS YOU.

I recently took a 14 day break (before ultimately smoking 2 times in 21 days)... then Christmas break comes along (off for work) and I go on a 6 day binge - I knew this was coming.  Every time I have off work for extended periods I always go off the rails.  Now, I am stopping before I am too deep in.

While its been 3 years since I've been an everyday smoker, even the whole ""weekend smoker"" just doesn't cut it for me - smoking Fri/Sat/Sun worked on and off for the last 3 years (in that time span, I quit completely multiple times, reaching 100+ days at my best, 70-something days, and I believe one more extended period within that time frame of say 70+ days). However, even smoking 3 days a week is just too much - Monday's are brutal after a weekend of smoking and I feel like I don't get my ""sharpness"" back until Thursday... and by that time I'm only a day away from Friday (AKA smoking day). I did the whole kSafe thing to moderate usage - I strongly recommended against this.

**Some things that have worked for me previously:**

1. Reading the book ""The Power of Habit"" - highly recommended everyone do this. This gave me control/techniques to control my bad habit
2. Regularly (meaning everyday) posted on r/Leaves while also lurking on this sub.
3. Keeping the ""Streak"" alive - sometimes just not breaking that X day streak is enough to keep you sober that day. Download one of those tracking apps.
4. Stay busy - especially the first couple of days.  Talk a walk, go to the gym, read a book, do yoga/foam roll, practice deep breathing techniques (all of these will help you out greatly in other aspects of your life).
5. Eat good food - plenty of veggies, lean protein, healthy fats.
6. AVOID ALCOHOL - especially the first week or two.  Alcohol (even 2-3 drinks) will lower your ambitions enough to cause a potential relapse - for my personally, it is the biggest trigger next to performing old smoking routines (i.e., smoking every Christmas break).
7. Tell all your friends that you're quitting. If they don't support it / try and convince you not to, kindly tell them that they either need to support you, or you have to move on from the friendship.
8. Keep a jar - everyday, put the daily amount of money you spend on weed into the jar - before you know it, you'll likely have a nice chunk of cash.  Buy yourself something nice with this - something that can also be used as a ""trophy"" of your success.

&#x200B;

**My Top 8 Reasons for Quitting:**

1. I can't stand how I am go from being so intelligent, to literally an AIR HEAD within days of smoking weed. The cloudiness/slow reaction/ability to think critically kills me. 
2. My girlfriend is not a huge fan of stoned me - and I completely get it.  I go from being a fun, intelligent, outgoing person, to a dumb, airhead, trapped in my head person within a day of smoking. It doesn't cause major issues since I've only been smoking on the weekends , but it definitely causes issues directly sometimes, and indirectly causes issues e.g., I am irritable and short tempered because of the weed which can make me get snippy with her etc. When I'm high, I'm not exactly the most emotionally available person
3. Going along with #2, it makes me irritable and short tempered - not a fan of that.  I am so much happier when I don't smoke. 
4. Unable to control my thoughts/causes Anxiety - guarantee this stuff does indeed contribute to psychosis and schizophrenia as has been the thought as of lately with enough usage. When I quit for a while, I am able to control my thoughts much better - if something bad pops in my head, I can just basically tell myself to let it go/not let it bother me. Not the case even when I am a weekend smoker.
5. Messes with my sleep and also quality of sleep - even smoking on weekends (including fridays) means smoking 3x nights a week - plenty enough to make it hard to fall asleep on Monday at the minimum, if not Tues/Weds. When I quit for an extended period of time (i.e. > 10 days), I literally fall asleep within minutes of hitting the pillow - and its good, restful sleep. 
6. I get so much more shit done -  instead of getting high in my free time and not doing ANYTHING but scrolling through social media/watching TV/surfing the web, I will knock out my chores list (entirely, not just half), and be proactive about non-pressing things that can ""wait a couple weeks""
7. HEALTH BENEFITS - for some reason this seems to be overlooked by many, including myself sometimes.  I don't care what any weed smoker says, smoking weed is awful for your mental health as well as physical health.
8. I'd much rather sit at home most of the time when I can smoke as opposed to going out - while I've always been a homebody, the addition of weed made me cancel many plans that I normally would have attended if I didn't have the option to smoke instead.

&#x200B;

Once you build and engrain new habits (typically takes up to 90 days but the research varies), life becomes easy to live without weed. I know this because I personally experienced it.

I have taken breaks when it hasn't been available to me and it's never a problem. But whenever I try to quit when I have it around, that never works. I have to ask my boyfriend to hide it during the week and then give it back to me on weekends, and that sort of works. But, I work from home and being a little bit high all day doesn't affect my productivity too much so I have a mini stash for the week. It helps more than it hurts my anxiety, I tell myself. But very often, I get the munchies and am overweight because of it. I exercise and generally eat healthy but those munchies always win (usually in the evening). This as a side effect is not enough for my brain to decide to fully stop. I feel like I want to quit but I feel more strongly that I don't. It has been like this for years. I like the benefits so much but feel like a masochist that the negatives don't compel me to quit. I understand those whose lives have fallen apart finding motivation to quit, but for those of us who are only slightly negatively affected... how do we find a compelling reason WHY to quit?

I have made it to day 27 and I'm very proud of myself. The mood swings have continued to be insane, and I have to admit since Christmas Eve I've been craving smoking a little bit more. I thought it would taper off once the holidays passed, but it's been intense.

Last night I threw away my bowl (which I didn't use as my main way of smoking, but at least it's gone) as a symbolic goodbye to the relationship I shared with weed. 

I have a lot of issues going on aside from quitting weed, and now that I don't have weed as a bandaid for dealing with these issues it's really challenging. At times, I want to give up and smoke again. BUT, I wouldnt.  It feels too good to feel these real feelings again, even if they're so painful and confusing sometimes. I don't want to go back to numbing myself.  I don't want to go back to smelling like a skunk mixed with a dog poop.  I don't want to. 

I've been ignoring some of my real-life problems in favor of dealing with withdrawal from weed. I think now that the withdrawal is getting a little less intense, and my real-life problem worries are trickling back into my mind, I just feel overwhelmed. 

I have a list of a few things I need to get done today, and once the new year passes I really want to get a stable job.  I feel like having my own income, my own insurance, etc will be a good distraction from overthinking and bring me a feeling of safety and independence that I am desperately lacking right now. 

Oh and yes, everyone I live with currently smokes weed and/or cigarettes and I have not had a single puff of either in 27 days now. The smell is gross and horrible and it makes my throat burn. It seems like some people are being respectful and trying to minimize the smell, while others aren't. It's ok though, I can't control other people's actions.",3

So I smoked about a gram of high strength ""skunk"" as we call it in the UK. Actually had a very nasty run in with a random person in the street who hit me in the face (completely unprovoked attack - this just how it be in London sometimes). Anyways I felt very deservent of a spliff after that.

So after having it, felt great stimulated dopamine rush feeling. I continued smoking for around 4 hrs and then stopped. I decided I was going to experience the comedown naturally instead of blazing myself to sleep. Ended up being like a stimulant crash. 

Really strong craving genuinely felt a comedown / strong burnt out feeling. Awful night's sleep. 

Conclusion: weed is just an addictive drug like any other, the creative benefits are completely gone for me, it's sole function is to disengage me from reality. 

Since I'm working so hard to try to be present in everything I do, I'm removing from my life effective immediately the obvious thing that couldn't be more of a hindrance to my social, psychological and spiritual development.",5

&#x200B;

I've tried to quit, relapsed after a day, tried again and went for around 3-4 weeks (I wasn't keeping track exactly because it made me think about weed every day)

Now I'm back into my old habits, I go to work and do really well, my boss is super happy and is considering just ending my probation period and giving me a raise (I recently started around 3 months ago)

But whenever I'm off work, I just rush to the grocery store, grab whatever unhealthy food I want, go home maybe clean a little bit (I've at least made some progress and try to do some productive things before smoking) but after doing the bare minimum I always end up smoking.

The end result is always the same, I smoke, eat way more food than I actually need to and gain weight. I don't hang out with friends to play video games or really communicate with anyone. I'll get text messages and just ignore them for days.

I've been wanting to learn drums but obviously the second I smoke its back to watching stupid youtube videos and other random stuff.

I've been wanting to pick up a third language for a long time, started learning some Japanese while I was sober and actually doing it every day (you get bored really fast when you are not high, so might as well do something) after I found out that moving abroad (big dream of mine) is out of the question without a university degree or 5-10 years of work experience, I just got depressed again and went to smoking.

Now I have 20g at home again, smoking daily, being unhappy every day because I feel like I'm just standing still and not moving forward in life. Smoking weed makes me not take care of myself and my appearance, which makes me demotivated to even try to start dating again. So here I am, smoking weed every day, by myself alone in my apartment with no goal in life to work towards to just living day by day. It's funny how this one life decision that I thought would greatly change my life to the better actually spiraled me into depression and made me a weed addict. Makes me wonder what my life could have been if I didn't go that route.",10
2020-12-30 03:37:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kmykra/i_cant_stop_thinking_about_getting_high_again/,I can't stop thinking about getting high again,"It's been 14 months since I've quit now. Not counting one nightmarish relapse that happened a month into quitting. That's when I felt I like I can never smoke pot again.

I was living alone in a new city where I knew no one and couldn't manage to make any friends. I started smoking because it helped me function, do chores around the house, go out and get groceries, stuff like that. Soon, it became a crutch, if I needed to fold the laundry 'let me take a hit', if I needed to take a shower 'let me take a hit'. 

I'd spend most of my free time high, and when I was at work I'd be aching to get back home and get high again. I stopped answering my phone. Didn't speak to my parents or my boyfriend for months. I'd pass out at random places in the house at random times, I couldn't sleep without getting high.

This went on for a year. My friends and colleagues got through to me and helped me want to get out of this rut. The seizure I had also helped lol. I kept all the pot I had with me, and just didn't ever smoke it. Things started looking good, I started working out and that made me tired enough to fall asleep. And the thought of ever smoking pot again made me super anxious. I would have nightmares about relapsing. Just a lot of nightmares in general lol. But work, cooking and the gym were good enough distractions to keep my mind off shit. 

And then Corona hit. I could work from home so I moved back into my parents' house to save some money. I don't get along too well with them, but they'd leave me alone under the pretence of work. The nightmares got worse and each day blurred into the next. I'd work at odd times of the day, I stopped exercising and started eating trash. There were days when I couldn't even get out of bed and take a shower. And that's when I started missing pot. 

When I got sober I managed to apply and get accepted to study masters. I moved and I'm in quarantine right now. It's day 8 and I've probably showered twice during this whole duration. I haven't been able to do shit. I sleep for 14-15 hours a day. I get up to eat and then go back to sleep. I terribly miss smoking up because getting high was at least a reason to get out of bed and carry on with my day. 

Before I started smoking up, I was a tight wound straight A student. Weed helped me loosen up and relax. It made me really happy for a while. Right now I feel really depressed and I think I could use some. Part of what's kept me going is the thought that, if I want to smoke up at any point, I can just get some and do it. Moving a new place again, where I don't know anyone and can't score some easily, makes me even more anxious. Because now I know that I'll probably never smoke pot again for long time. I spend a huge part of my waking hours remembering all the times I got high and all other stuff I experimented with. The feeling consumes and almost cripples me. I don't know what to do 

Sorry for the long post lol",7

I'm a weed addict. I've been in a relapse for the past 4 years. Hiding smoking weed and doing edibles all day everyday from my partner, family, friends and at work. My partner has caught me smoking this year and has insisted I go into recovery...I've been lying to my partner and telling them I'm going to MA anonymous when I'd just sit in my car smoking weed until 'meeting time' was over and head home. So many lies, so many secrets, so much denial, so much anxiety and stress. Just after Xmas my partner let me know she knew I was using again and said she could not trust me and asked me to leave our home (we have a 10 month year old son together)....I freaked out, booked a motel for two days and smoked and drank to block out what had just happened. I just couldn't face that I'd be caught and could not continue to lie about being addicted...I felt so much shame, anxiety and overwhelming grief. I felt like I'd lost everything I'd worked hard to build in my life...I knew I had to face the reality about being an addict...I went to my dads and sobbed my eyes out....dad was amazing and told me to stay with him, that he'd help me stop using, that he loved me and respected me and said "" I know you feel bad, but STOP IT, there is no need, we will get through this together""...I cried my eyes out again, I felt like I was 10 years old (I'm 40) and heres my 76 year old dad supporting me like he has always done...That was three days ago...I've not used weed for 3 days now.

I want this to stop. Weed is a nightmare for me and I'm badly addicted to it. I've been in denial for so long about this....but only now am I completely in surrender and accept that I am an addict and will need to commit to recovery for the rest of my life....sometimes things have to come crashing down for us to accept the reality of this addiction.

The most effective thing to do would be to not hang around them as much, but we are a very tight knit bunch, and I frankly will never do that; they're my closest friends, I love them, and outside of weed, they're fucking amazing. 

I keep saying yes to when the joint gets passed round. I've managed to say no several times, but I caved after a few days and take roughly every other toke in rotation. Que me forgetting things that happened seconds ago in conversations and media, general retarded feeling etc. 

I know once I get back to my place I'll be fine, (stopped keeping weed about my place) but I don't want it to be the situation that I can't see my uni friends without lighting up. I know it's supposed to be as easy as saying no, but I'd be super grateful for any rationale or motivation in learning to stay strong, stick with my decision and say no.",3

I made a new account just to participate here.

I haven't been able to find any serious support irl about quitting and I've been dismissed constantly about the struggle I have in moderation of my habit (I actually mean addiction but it feels awkward to admit it that way). That's the consequence of using marijuana as a social identity, being a persuasive smart ass about my use, and making stoner friends as to surround myself with pro-weed minded people to enable myself.

""Just don't smoke""

""There's no such thing as withdrawal"" 

""It's not addictive"" 

I'm so sick of these justifications and how I've deluded myself in them. I adopted the talking points to enable my use. I can't just not do it. I am suffering the worst stomach distress I've ever felt after 3 days of cold-turkey. I have accidentally smoked. I pack bongs in a mental haze and smoke without even realizing it. I get home after work and smoke until I wake up forgetting when I made it to my bed. It's automatic and reflexive now. It's constantly knocking at my mind. Nagging and relentless. 

It's made things so bearable. God damn it's a good crutch. Holy shit I'm invincible with it, nothing I can't ponder, no problem I can't work through. No stress weighs on me. It dissolves my bad days and throws my good days into ecstasy. I am water in a stream. 

It's been 12 years of daily use. 12 fucking years. I can't do this anymore. I smoke to wake up, smoke to sleep, smoke to eat, smoke to cook, smoke to exist. 

I smoke to endure the pain I've harboured for years. 

I have a daughter. I do the best I can for her, everything in my life since my seperation has been for her, to provide and nurture her. But for fuck sakes I smoke to play with her, I smoke to watch cartoons. I smoke to tolerate the stress of being her dad. I use it to melt the time when I'm not with her but then, when she's with me, I hardly remember the time we spend together. ""Why do you go to your room before we play a game/watch a show, daddy? What's that smell? It's disgusting"" 

Fucking hell. 

I could keep smoking and it would be ok. I do the bare minimum in my life and that passes the expectations that are placed on me. I don't know if quitting would make my life any better or help me work towards more for myself but I have been drifting through my own life as a passive observer and I want to be participating in it now. I want to find new love, I want to make more money, I want to buy a house. I want to stop convincing myself that it's ok to NOT work towards those goals. I want to stop making excuses to let life pass me by. I want to feel stable and I want to have clear memories. I want dreams again. I want to stop forgetting to plan for my future and care for myself now and tomorrow. But God damn it, above all else, I want to hit a bong right now. 

My grandfather died yesterday. Here and gone in three weeks, not covid related. This is why I went cold-turkey, unexpectedly working for my family to be an active informant and communicate what was going on, and why I realized that I have a problem here. 

2021 brings my 30th birthday. I hit my first bong at 17 and never stopped. I don't want to have these thoughts again at 40, 50, 60. I have to try this time.

2020-12-29 19:45:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kmr3we/checkin_23_days/,Check-in - 23 days,"Hey all,

23 days sober💪. I wanted to share my progress and experience.

After the first two weeks, my cravings dissapeared. I still smoke cigarettes, my sleeping pattern is far from where it should be, my obsessive behaviour shifted from drugs to physical exercise and sometimes my mind is so foggy I barely get any work done or do impulsive actions I regret later.
But screw all of that, I made 23 days.

Right now, I'm delighted with my progress. I got to enjoy Christmas sober with my family. I spend the days after visiting friends and other relatives and I loved each minute of it. I felt like I experienced happiness, maybe the first time this year.

I started taking better care of myself by drinking water and focussing on healthy foods. That was a small change I could make, but the results are tremendous. Taking good care of myself has led me to developing more confidence and a better self-image. 
It's not the food that's doing the magic, but the improvement of my self-image helps me to see that drugs are no longer worth my time.

My pitfall is that my obsessive behaviour is still very much there. I have a strong urge to catch up on everything I missed out on in the past 15 years. I notice a lot that I'm trying to set expectations that aren't realistic. 

I'm  trying to prevent this by 
 actively flag when I set these expectations. If it were up to me, I'd tackle all of my remaining bad habits tomorrow (or rather, yesterday).
However when I evaluate this further I have to admit it's not realistic. So I'm accepting these flaws for now.

I've decided to get 30 days sober before tackling another bad habit. Not sure whether that should be smoking of a better sleeping pattern and steady routine. (Any advice?)
I want to have a  stronger foundation before taking the next step. 
My biggest fear is that I'll fail such a challenge, and that the resulting dissapointment leads to a relapse.
My emotional palette is still very much that of an addict. I'm either very positive or very negative, and it leads me to take impulsive actions.

I quit just in time. When I see the work I've done in the past couple of weeks I've did a lot of last minute saves that would have ended catastrophically if I were still abusing drugs.

That said, I'm very grateful for the progress I've made. I read stories from this community daily as a way to spend time combating my addiction. Your experiences and stories have helped me immensely.

I don't have any specific questions to ask right now. Just a check-in I promised myself I would do this week. However if you have any experiences that may help me, I'd be very interested in reading them.

Thanks all, keep fighting if you're struggling. It's worth it. See ya in 2021!",5

I've also gone 15 months without vaping cannabis, but my last relapse with flower was December 30th 2019.

Before I start, I want to say it took dozens of attempts to get to this point. It took 7 months of continuously trying to quit for it to stick.I used to smoke and vape all day everyday. I stopped getting high eventually, and it was used to make me less anxious. I was sneaking hits at work and school, and wasted so much time smoking several times a day. I was spending my entire paycheck from my part time job and more  on at the local medical dispensary and was always broke and eventually racked up debt. I was stealing vape hits and weed from my parents to try and save money (still feel like an awful daughter for that). I was constantly sick and coughing up tar.The last time I used a vape pen, I had a psychotic episode and was hungover for days. I finally realized I needed professional help beyond the regular therapy I was already going to and I joined outpatient group therapy. My last relapse involved another psychotic episode and I think that's what finally got me. I'm too afraid to find out if I'll have another psychotic episode if I use again. '

So what's happened in the year I didn't use cannabis?

I saved enough money to get out of my small debt and to move out of my parents' house and into my first apartment with my boyfriend of over 4 years. I graduated from outpatient therapy. I adopted a cat. I went back to college after having to withdraw for a semester while recovering from my psychotic episodes, got on the Dean's list for the first time and graduated!! Yesterday, not even two weeks after graduation, I was offered a full-time job in my field of study. I have to get drug tested for this job, and I don't even have to worry about it!If someone told me my life is like it is now I wouldn't believe it.

So if you're struggling to stay sober, don't give up! Quitting for good won't happen all at once. It might take you a few tries, or even a few dozen like me. I hope this doesn't come off like bragging, I'm proud of myself and wanted to show that good things can happen from quitting. I hope the good things that happen to you guys are exactly what you all want.

Stay safe and have a happy new year!

2020-12-29 18:50:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kmq373/question_about_tapering_off/,Question about tapering off,"So a quick rundown on me.  Back in 2013 I thought I got really screwed up by taking prednisone.  I stopped smoking after a like a 5 year straight daily habit.  Felt horrible for a while.  Went on and off it through the years. 

Started again in the summer, got my medical card and have been hard at for 6 months or so, and I’m taking about packing another one up just because it’s empty kind of habit.  Felt bad a few weeks ago, stopped, and all this horrible stuff started back up. 

Then I learned about marijuana withdrawal.  I had no clue it was a thing.  I’ve been to the ER and had a brain scan because of this stuff, and now I’m confident it’s withdrawal because the only times it’s happened, I’ve abruptly quit smoking.

This is both the best and worst thing I’ve learned.  It’s good because I almost instantly felt better anxiety wise because I know I’m not dying and nothing it’s really wrong with me.  It’s bad because after a week of not using, I started again very minimally, just to test if it helped and to maybe feel a little better on Christmas. 

Well, it’s now been a week since I’ve started again and I keep going back just to ease the way I feel, but no where near what I was doing earlier this month.  Is it even possible to taper off or am I doing more harm than good?  I don’t even enjoy the feeling from smoking really, I just feel a little closer to normal.  

Sorry this turned out so long, but I’ve just been kind of racing around my head with all this newfound info and had to get it out somewhere.  I’ve always got back into smoking, but I want to be done for good now that I know the weed is doing this to me and I don’t want to be a slave to it. 

Basically my question is this, is my body still “fixing” itself if I’m using very minimal amounts?  Does anyone have success tapering off?  Or is cold turkey the way to go?",1

I quit ahead of shoulder replacement surgery to make that go better, but I think in order to help me quit pot I posted lots of reasons on here like the harm it did raising my children, wanting to be an example for my grandson, the worries about COPD and lung cancer from smoking pot, etc. - you name it I had convinced myself to quit.  Well now my shoulder's better; I spent xmas at my daughter's where they all either drank or sneaked a joint, and I and my wife sat there drinking root beer.  My wife has no problem not drinking and smoking but I do.  I'm stone cold sober now and frankly I'm bored to death.  I'm afraid to start drinking again cause I got so drunk and looked like hell but at this point I'm thinking of starting pot again.  It doesn't help to see all the billboards by pot shops showing old couples enjoying life.  I'm rationalizing the health risks.  I really want to smoke ""a little"" but I know it will quickly turn into a 2 joint a day, all day long thing -  I could tell my wife I'll just smoke now and then but I know I will be sneaking it most of every day.. . Hard decision.  But this may be of help to some of you:  I can tell you that mentally I feel young, and I don't look more than 60.  I am plagued with idealizing my past ; i.e., missing all the fun I had when I was 18-20.  Missing all the old friends, girlfriends; the fun things of my youth.  It seems like yesterday, not 50 years ago.  And here's the point I'm getting to:  I think I'm obsessing about the life I had 50 yrs ago like ""it was just yesterday"" is because I spent those 50 years basically stoned.  Do you see what I mean?  That is, instead of Living those 50 years NOT stoned, they went by real fast:  i.e., had I lived all those years in a clearer state of mind I would feel like I SHOULD  be 73 and more at peace with my life, because I actually lived all that time instead of being high.  Does this make sense?  So I would say that by staying stoned every day, youre missing out on life, and when you've gotten to my age and feel like it was just yesterday, well in your baked mind it probably is just yesterday.  So I'm just sayin', live life with a clear mind and one day you will feel like you have lived it instead of feeling like it was just yesterday.. no I haven't caved in and gone to the pot shop yet.  The jury's still out.  Hope this perspective helps someone.  Bob",478

I’m no stranger to the process of quitting weed so I knew what to expect this time. 

I’m on day 8 and I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I feel like this time I did a few things to quicken the process that I would like to share. 
1) sweat, sweat, sweat, I am very fortunate to have a sauna and I’ve been in it every night, that on top of lots of running and working out, I feel like I’ve speed up the detox process, THC stays in your fat cells and since Christmas I’ve lost 8 pounds of it. 
2) Keto/carnivore diet- I’ve stuck to a strick all meat diet including organ meat, I think some of the negative thinking is inflammation of the brain, Keto seems to sooth that right down, my mind feels much more at ease on it. I bought Keto strips to check my urine, it’s been a fun way to stick with it. 
3) meditation/wimhoff is a very important part to help you recognize that the mind you have during detox isn’t really you. 
4) Admitting to my myself and others that I’m an addict has been a massive help, every time I went back to smoking  I think I can moderate myself but I can’t, if your reading this is means you probably can’t either and that’s ok!! Being an addict means you have a unique mind and overtime you will learn how to use it to your advantage. 
This is my third big addiction I’ve had to kick l, been booze and cigarette free for over three  years now. Weed was by far the hardest. Anyway I hope this helps, I know it seems a little extreme but so is being a pot head! Stay strong my friends, hope this helps",19

I started smoking weed when I was 15 years old, immediately having a new and exciting world opened up to me. Years followed and my devotion to lady Ganja grew stronger. Good times when I smoked with friends seemed infinite and I was convinced the soothing high would never wear off. 

Years later,  the inevitable paranoia and anxiety followed from abusing weed, causing me to still deny that it was ruining my mental health. The fear of separating myself from friends who smoked and my mental attachment to the plant stopped me from cleaning up.

After years of quitting, starting up again and justifying my actions, I've finally ran my weed use into the ground and cannot even process the high anymore. I literally exhausted my bodies tolerance to weed and now feel nothing when taking it.


I've swapped my habit for meditation and clean eating, feeling a much stronger connection to the universe. My speech has greatly improved and I no longer feel the crippling social anxiety associated with getting high.

Other days, I feel like I'm coming out of a cocoon and trying to figure out who I actually am.  Parts of me are the same, parts of me are unrecognizable not only to me, but to the people that have known me for a long time.  Sometimes I want to push my limits and see what I'm truly capable of.  Sometimes I just want to lay down and give up.  Sometimes I have ALL THE ENERGY.  Sometimes I have absolutely zero.  Sometimes I want to stop and bask in every single moment and experience.  Sometimes I want to fast forward through it all like Adam Sandler in Click.

What's gotten me through is a tool a friend passed over to me.  I lay down, put on some sort of calming music, and try to put my brain in 3rd person mode (for lack of a better term).  I let the thoughts come, try to see where they came from and where they're going.  I don't try to control them, I just let them do their thing.  I've found almost every time, what's actually affecting me is some sort of other coping mechanism from growing up.  A drive to control others because I feel out of control of myself.  A drive to avoid reaching out to other people because I don't feel worth reaching out to.  A drive to hyperfocus on tiny problems because the bigger ones are too scary to want to look at.

Usually these realizations come with another wave of emotional overload and mental defenses.  I argue with myself, try to convince myself that what I feel is how reality actually is.  I let myself watch the conflicting emotions and reasoning play out, and poke holes in my weak arguments one after another.

I am a whole person.  I am complete without drugs.  I am worth being around.  I am worth taking care of, physically and mentally.  I am worth fighting for.

I don't have many friends because let's be real; stoner life is lonely AF. Therefore I am kinda battling with this on my own.
I have spoken to my father about this addiction though (very questionable decision I made while high) which did not go very well.
I have also thought about getting professional help; but I am really sceptical about it. If anyone of you has any experience on those I would like to hear from you.

I want to stop, because I also believe it increases anxiety/depression for me specifically. I am unsure if it is the actual cause, but I have been smoking every single day at least 2 joints before bed.

I have half a joint in my possession right now, and that is the last bit of weed I have. I wrote my dealer that I want to buy 5grams.

Should I quit all together? how do I do that? I feel weak because I crave it and I have no clue what to do because I feel like I really need it to sleep..

I haven’t felt truly down and depressed now since I’ve smoked. Smoking made me hold on to those depressive thoughts. For example: I had an issue with my car and I was really stressed about it. When I was smoking I KNOW I would put off getting it checked out, wait too long, then allow the problem to get worse. This week I got it checked out, looked up solutions online, and got it fixed myself and it was really no big deal at all, took a few hours. If I was still smoking my brain would just say “well fuck I guess we’re screwed, let’s go smoke and forget about it.” Actively handling my issues has done wonders for my depressive thinking and my confidence. Like I have control again. I now fill all the time I would be smoking with things I NEED to do, and god does it feel so much better than smoking it off and waking up the next morning in despair. Day 9, here’s to many many more sober days. I say this every time I post here, but truly thank you all for your posts and insights. Being around stoners, they’ll sometimes make you feel dumb for saying you want to quit. Having stories I can personally relate to (some of these post felt like I had written them myself) has made quitting feel like such a huge weight off my back. Only thing im really dealing with is being a little too “up.” I was talking to my mom on the phone and I can tell she was a little overwhelmed with my talkativeness but she’s very happy for me. A big reason I smoked is because I’m like that a lot: really energetic, talkative, feel like I’m annoying people, but I’m really glad to have myself back as I truly feel more happy overall.

I haven't smoked relentlessly all those years but it's beyond time to stop.  I've had serious intentions to quit all this year and have made some good steps....but I'm still struggling.  I'm not a waste of space despite smoking all these years :)  I work FT, have my own business, and I'm a FT single parent to 2 great kids, 12 & 15.  So I don't have hours to fill when I'm not smoking.  My struggle is more finding the time, energy, and consistency to create some new good habits to help me along the way.  I've been getting hammered by life in recent years and I lost my mind in 2018 from all the stress (difficult relationship with spouse descending into major mental illness, floods in 2017 and 2018 resulting in catastrophic loss of my business, primary caregiver for my mother with dementia......and on and on).  It's been a long road back and I've made slow and steady progress in many areas of life.  But not the weed so much.  I had a streak going much earlier this year, but then crumbled.  Things got tough in June..... my mother died at the end of June, the isolation from covid pushed her over the edge and she was put in long term care and just gave up.  My one sister was conspicuously silent during our mother's passing, she emailed me 3 days after the event to advise me to seek legal counsel because she was lawyered up already to contest the will.  Same week I  found out I needed to find new premises for my business and the townhouse I rented was put up for sale and aggressively pursued.  So in one week I felt like I lost my mom, my sister (still not speaking), my workplace and my home.  Sigh.

&#x200B;

I'm happy to say I have mostly landed on my feet.  I've moved my workplace and my home.  I've done 8 moves in the past 3 years with dealing with my mom, separation, flooding...... so done with moving.  I've made more steps along the quitting journey.  Found this sub in September, been lurking lots.  Probably been sober for about 2/3 of past 3 months.  But that's not good enough.  I've crumbled over the holidays.  Not a major relapse, but a relapse nonetheless.  Huge anxiety about my ex being basically bankrupt and still living in the house we own together.  I've been bailing him out for past 2 months.  He is a hoarder and the house is a nightmare.  There is a reason the kids are with me FT.  Dealing with a mentally ill ex is a special kind of hell.  And this is what has triggered my most recent overwhelm and relapse.  Or is that just an excuse?

&#x200B;

So it's day one again.  I bought myself a beautiful mala for Christmas to help with meditation.   And it does.  I'm very tactile, having the beads helps me focus on my breath somehow.  I'm set up for exercise at my workplace.....just need to do it.  And I hope to start reading more.  I was a major bookworm before kids and I'd like to get some of that back.  I've observed my sober self likes to waste too much time in the evening scrolling useless stuff on the computer.  Wish me luck.",5

I got sober about 2 years ago and then relapsed a year ago but I wasn’t using 24/7. My aunt passed away from cancer and left me about 2 ounces of weed and that’s when I got to my lowest. I’ve been smoking within an hour of waking up, within minutes of going to bed, and regularly in between. 

Withdrawal has been bad but not horrible. I think the worst part about all of it has been my partner. We talked about me quitting and he was so so so on board but I don’t think he knew what that really meant. I’ve gotten short with him on occasion and apologized but he retaliates which makes the whole thing worse. That’s been tough, to be made to feel bad when you already feel pretty awful. I’ve told him that sobriety comes first and I understand if it’s too hard for him, but he wants me to give him a timeline for withdrawal and to set his boundaries for how I’m allowed to act within this period, but I’ve done this before it’s not even just the withdrawal it’s the relearning how to deal with pain and anger that takes a while.

Only thing that's still irritating me is this intermittent buzzing/ringing tinnitus in both my ears, and it's been persistent for a good couple of weeks now. Its very much like the sound an old tube TV makes when its switched on, except its inside my skull. I'm addition to this, I get pressure around my head (like a tension headache). I notice it a lot more when I'm in bed trying to sleep or when I'm at home in a quiet room. Had my ears checked, they're fine (no damage to my eardrums) and my BP is also normal, so from what I've read & gathered in this group I can only put it down to me being constantly high for an extended period of time, going cold turkey and my brain going through the motions of essentially rewiring itself, but I could be wrong and please tell me if I am.

Is anyone else currently experiencing this since quitting or has gone through a similar pattern? Does it eventually go away? Is it anything to be worried about? I guess I'm worrying myself a little too much and thinking that this might last forever, and it's down to me dealing with anxiety on a regular basis - and more so since I have quit.

Enjoy :),"Coming off 2 relapses in the space of 6 weeks after getting 8 months free from weed. It was 4 months clean before that. I'm still trying to have my cake and eat it, still thinking there's a cheat code around abstinence whilst recovering from weed addiction - kind of like trying to dive upwards, and being amazed that you sank afterwards. 

The poem is just tapping into this, the power the addict brain has to delude you, and to get you to believe its lie that there isn't any hope in this, or that life is somehow less fulfilling sober. It's very cunning, very skilled at what it does. If you don't stay on top of it, it can erase the pain of active addiction from your memory until it gets you balls deep in it again. That's its job. 

I've found from being at this for about a year and a half, that it takes a very long time, and a lot of emotional work - the very kind of work that we are completely shit at - for you to realise how blind you've been, and that a part of you will linger in this self-delusion for a long time, maybe forever. Just see that bit of you for what it is, and know that you're not falling for it anymore.


Waiting Wings 

I'll be waiting in the wings for you,

Spring fragrant through your dreams de jure. 

You'll cling to me well-tight and sure.

However long it's been there's more.

There'll not seem much that can be done,

I'll brainwash you through run after run.

And when you're rinsed of cleanliness,

Steps and alleys soothe your spiking chest.


It could be months, it could be years.

You'll still turn grey from light and colour,

You'll wish it were all that I appear.


You'll clutch me tight in disarray.

I'm lighter than air, thicker than clay.


You'll heave me on your sullen head.

I'll face you as you wake in your sweat-soaked bed.


There'll not seem much that can be done,
'til you retreat from

-cajole your smoldering feet from- avert singed sight, from the Sun.

I dreamed my car was running away driving itself.  I was standing  in a circle of people I used to know, smoking some kind of a steam roller that was combined with a bong.  Borrowing a car to go look for my car that hit the road on its own.  Was bemused when I woke up.  Not really relieved I didn't smoke, just sort of still hurting from the stupid regrettable text and phone calls I made that ruined a relationship when I was ripped on a gummy and some wine.  Sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I had 154 days off the bud.  Then floundered.  It started with a gummy on my birthday.  Not such a big deal.  I quit drinking too.  Then I started to have a bit of wine and some pot.  Couple times.  Before you know it I was drinking and smoking every day for a week.  My tolerance was pretty low because I had not been drinking for 7 months or smoking for 5 months.  Downing a gummy and a bottle of wine was a very ugly scene.  Super yuck.  Boyfriend gone.  Turned into Mr. Hyde.  All I can do is move forward.",2

Just an observation.....I am 69 years old and started smoking in 1969. I had many years sobriety but decided I could handle pot again.....WRONG!  But my observation is this...the weed of today is so much stronger than many years ago. This stuff today is toxic....so powerful. It should, in all honesty, be regulated like any other prescription drug. I abused ""downers"" at one time....but modern THC is far stronger. 

But I can assure you...after smoking for 20 years, after I got sober I resumed a promising career and scored lots of successes and happiness in life. If you are new....you will get your brain back. You can and will go on to have a regular life. Do not spend valuable recovery time on beating yourself up or convincing yourself that you will never regain your sanity. Instead spend your time on staying sober and by helping others to get sober. Help the newcomer. Encourage him and her and show your support. 

Supporting other addicts and helping them is the number one thing you can do for your own sobriety. There is life after pot. And it is rewarding if you work for it.",17

Some of us had tried a smoke or two previous to that but this trip got us absolutely hooked and we went heavy on it after that, meeting up and smoking daily with the amount gradually increasing over time - I never thought I'd end up living my life around it. 

Smoking helped me get through some tough times in life that I'm not sure I would have made through without it at the time. The issue is that I never realised the damage it was doing to me in keeping me comfortable with everything, comfortable not making effort with friends and family - I would have been happy to be by myself all the time and before you know it, years are passing by in the blink of an eye. 

I somehow managed to get through college and get my degree and after several jobs I have finally got into a top tech company and have been promoted within 8months. I don't know how though because I feel like I've stagnated from the get go and sales is a tricky place with the side affects of a weed addiction. I know it'll only be a matter of time before I'm found out unless I get this out of my life. 

The passage of time, the destruction of my memory, the social anxiety, the mental and emotional wounds that have never been properly addressed, and the feeling of being a complete outcast who is cut off from the rest of the world are all motivations to kick this out of my life. I have been in a relationship with a fantastic girl for 3 years now and I can't believe she's put up with this and Ive been too high to realise. I want to have kids some day and always said that I couldn't do it unless I get my act together and remove this drug from my life out of fear that I wouldn't be fully present to care for them and watch them grow up.

Sweet sweet Mary Jane, you have helped me so much in certain areas of my life and I'll always be thankful for that but you have out stayed your welcome to the point that you have become a Cancer of the mind. I consider myself so lucky to have found r/leaves as it has awoken me to what my stoned brain couldn't comprehend - I was blind but now I can see..",58
2020-12-29 10:04:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kmg1qy/its_officially_been_3_days_7_hours_and_28_minutes/,"It’s officially been 3 days, 7 hours, and 28 minutes since I last smoked weed and I’m way less excited than yesterday.","And that’s okay, because I have internalized that this won’t be forever.. I woke up DRENCHED in sweat, four times throughout the night, each time waking up having a nightmare. keep in mind I am a relatively fit 22 y/o M. I got maybe 3-4 hours of sleep and ended up waking up at 5 am. I had a pounding headache, nightmares up the ass, and absolutely no one to talk to about it, with some absolutely real anxiety and depression to start my morning at 5 am 😂. Something that I wish I had was daily documentation of weed withdrawal, and honestly, it helps a lot to write about my symptoms and what I’m doing to help mitigate them. 

What they say about dreams is true as fuck, I’m a guy who always has dreams even when I was high so I never understood why some people would say they didn’t dream as much when stoned, but HOLY CRAP, my dreams are much more intense, much more real, and have a lot more content to them. 

I’m taking vicks 2-3 times a day to help with the headaches. Drink lots of decaffeinated teas and eating healthy Whole Foods. I’ve felt pretty shit so I haven’t been excercising as much as I should, but I have been stretching and meditating for 20ish min a day. 

Keep in mind I’m also on two different antidepressants, and have always had some problems with anxiety and depression so YMMV. I tried to quit prior to going to a therapist and psychiatrist and I couldn’t, but that’s just me. If you’ve tried and failed many times, there really is no shame in getting the help you need. Im a grown ass man and I cried when I realized how badly I actually needed help. Having a support network is crucial. Thankfully, I have you guys, my parents, one supportive cousin, and one friend that supports my decision, and the rest of the people think I’m being dramatic. Fuck those people man, i just stopped contacting all of them until I’m solidified in my new lifestyle. Whether it is a month, 3 months, or one year idgaf. I have been stoned for 2 years straight (although I smoked on and off heavy since I was 12 years old) , and I have never felt more alive than right now despite all the shit I’m feeling. 

You guys are my motivation, my crutch, and I am forever grateful for all the kind comments my last post received. Quitting is a fucking rollercoaster, and I want nothing more than to drive to the dispensary and smoke a fat joint and forget my problems and misery. But that’s the old me, and I can’t fail the 6 supportive resources I have anymore. I’ve made to many false promises. I won’t give up and I won’t smoke today. One day at a time. Love y’all. 

P.S if you made it this far and read my rant I really appreciate you. For the past 4ish months, I’d go through a half gram cart a day, and/or 2 infused 1 gram joints ($20 each from dispensary wrapped in keef and wax).",3

2020-12-29 08:55:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kmeupo/waitwas_quitting_the_answer_all_along/,Wait...was quitting the answer all along?,"Hey friends. I’ve been a pretty constant heavy smoker for the past 7 or 8 years on and off but almost always on. Ages 17/18-25. 

I mostly enjoyed hanging out on the couch by myself high listening to music or watching stoner comedies, sex while high and even going to work or school high. Life with all of its stress and anxieties were just so much easier to deal with but y’all know that.

Anyway, the most frustrating part of these years were my lack of growth. When I had weed that’s what I was most interested in. Plans with family and friends? Not interested. A decent job with plenty of opportunities and steady income? I’d rather stay home and smoke and then stress about making more money to continue smoking. I was unemployed, alone and at times homeless but I kept smoking because it’s widely socially acceptable and I just didn’t think what I was doing was bad.

Around the age of 23 I went to rehab to kick a really serious drug habit and I felt proud of myself (and still do) because I was able to quit using opioids but I still smoked weed because again I didn’t see a problem with it.

This past year kinda shifted things. I’ve been with my boyfriend for two years and at first I was this chill stoner chick but eventually he saw the issue with my use and brought it to my attention. I couldn’t find a balance with smoking it was all or nothing. He never made me feel bad about it outright but he didn’t have to because now I was smoking and feeling guilty/shameful/disappointed in myself.

I live next to a state where it’s legal so it’s about a 30 min drive to the dispensary so I’d have the time and money to go up there, KNOW that I shouldn’t because I had bills, groceries, issues with my car that I should be putting money towards but I went anyway. Guilt, shame, disappointment ensues.

I guess I’m rambling at this point but I stopped smoking on October 20th of this year. I threw out all of my paraphernalia and I definitely still get cravings and there’s times where I really wish I was high but IT GETS EASIER. I turned 26 earlier this month and I felt a change in myself. I’m more ambitious, my work ethic is better, my depression and anxiety is improving, I can actually connect with others oh and my relationship is better than ever and my ass really just thought it was because I was 26 but I think the real reason is because I stopped smoking and I could have had all of this years ago.

Keep going, keep pushing and may all of your 2021 be smoke free",8

On September 30th I decided to give up weed and alcohol. Alcohol wasn’t as big of a problem for me as weed but as an addict I knew I would just replace my weed consumption with alcohol. I wanted to post this to one, to get it off my chest but two hopefully let those who are struggling know that they are not alone. This first month of sobriety was actually the worst month of my life. I had debilitating anxiety, feeling depressed, hopeless, shame, guilt and of course all of those pleasant physical withdrawal symptoms as well. The second month the physical withdrawal symptoms went away but the mental and emotional symptoms were still there just a little less. As I’m wrapping up my third month I can finally say I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Don’t get me wrong, I’m still struggling with some anxiety (not nearly as much) and some negative thoughts but I’m learning to cope. If you find yourself struggling just know, it gets better. Your recovery journey is unique in its own right. Some people feel better in a week, some a month, some six months and some even a year. Just know it gets better but you have to work on yourself.

Super quick back story. Daily usage about 5 years. Last two years have been almost exclusively carts. Smoking 5+ times a day. Easily spending $60-80 a week. 


I always gave myself multiple reasons of why I couldn’t make it without weed. Suicidal ideation/ hospitalization (twice), years of trauma, and a deep seated pessimistic view on life. My attitude was something like “Fuck it all. With the cards I’ve been dealt, I DESERVE this. No one can judge me for how I deal with my pain. etc”. Valid view point, but very limiting. Eventually, the signs were there of full blown addiction. I’m ashamed to say there were moments where I could have been caught by law enforcement, smoking near my children. Not all in their face but you get it. 

Then I lurked on this sub. And realized people have been using way longer than me. And that life fucks us all, in different positions. I began to realize I can do it. Fast forward to Day 4. Only symptoms have been intense nausea, some irritable and insomnia. I’m waiting for the devastating withdrawal some of you are experiencing and it doesn’t seem to be coming? 

It makes me feel bad because I made it seem near impossible to quit. It seems like all excuses now. I would like to mention I am on antidepressants, and using a 0 THC product. Is this why withdrawal isn’t hitting me?",2

Since quitting weed I've been drinking almost every night with friends. It seems I've just replaced one habit with the other. 

My original goal was to make it to 60 days without weed and then hopefully I wouldn't want to smoke anymore, but the cravings haven't stopped. Every day I want to smoke and I think about how I dont enjoy things like yoga, food, sex, or nature as much as I did when I was high. 

I bought weed on Christmas eve but I haven't smoked it yet. I got low thc sativa strain, promising myself I will have more control over it this time, keep my tolerance low by only vaping and not smoking bongs. I can be very productive with weed if I stay disciplined enough. 

I'm trying to remind myself of why I dont want to smoke: I am paranoid and anxious sometimes, I get lost in my head,  i give into food cravings, I cant stay focused on reading, etc. But ultimately I'm lacking motivation to keep abstaining.  Can we really not be in a healthy place with weed? Or is this my addicted brain trying to convince me I can?

Quiting has been hard. On one hand, I feel weed really does help me, in terms of simply taking the edge off and relieving stress. It’s just not worth the downsides anymore unfortunately.

I've been smoking for the better part of a decade now (weird to think about) and I've been sick of it for most of that time. It's tough to think about all the hours and days I've wasted. All the relationships I've neglected. All the opportunities I've missed because I was high. All the times someone needed me but I was scared to answer the phone because they might know. 

So I'll realize all of this and finally quit. For a weekend, maybe even for a month. I think so clearly. I'm funny again. I'm interested in things. I make plans. I even start building some good habits that I sincerely enjoy. I explicitly recognize that this life is so much better than the murky, sedated one I'm used to. 

But then, without fail, I just know in my bones that this time is different. I know that this time the lesson has been learned and learned well. I can have a few hits and just have some fun. Just chill and play some video games. What's the harm in that? There's no way I'll fall into that lifestyle I despise so much again. I know too much.

Then I blink and it's another 3 month wasted.

I was smoking 1-2 gms a day, usually about four joints a day for over two years.

First off and most notably atm, my B.O. is extremely bad. I can't tell if its because my sense of smell is stronger or if my body is taking the opportunity to flush. I like to visualize my lungs going from a dark shade of brown/red bong rez to a lighter and lighter color each day. It helps. I am feeling short of breath and have an intermittent cough. I feel peaceful and was grateful to only have a handful of cravings today, but I am feeling very emotionally sensitive and am also grateful that I can be selective right now about who I socialize with. That really helps too.

I really want fast food. My digestion is improving so I indulged yesterday. I have read this is a really common one for some reason, go figure.

I had a dream last night (that I remembered), for the first time in a long time. I dreamed I had picked up and was smoking and I woke up feeling sad and disappointed in myself. Then immediately I was very relieved that it was dream. I tried to hold on to that throughout the day, because its a reminder that I am glad I am doing this, even if I feel low. Based on previous experience, I can expect that there are many more dreams on their way from here on in. I am kind of looking forward to this. I miss dreaming. In the past though, the dreams come along with intense night sweats, which haven't let up in the past. I have never made it long enough before relapsing in the past to see the end of the night sweats, so I am mentally steeling myself to push through at least 60 days of soaking the sheets. Hahahaha I hope not, that is so long, but my previous quit attempts have taught me to reign in my expectations.

I've heard suggestions to lower the temp in my room or take a shower before bed, but this one might be unavoidable for me.

Anyway if you are out there experiencing any of these things, I'm right there with you. I will keep on going!",5
2020-12-28 21:20:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/km4v52/1_week_today_felt_mentally_unstable/,"1 week, today felt mentally unstable","This is my first time posting. I've been a huge stoner about 10 years, age 25. I'm a musician, so most of my social circles know me as a big weed smoker. For 10 years I've liked the identity that's given me and the way weed has made me feel. I'd smoke probably about a gram a day, and it got worse in quarantine. At least when I had a job, I wouldn't get stoned until I got home at the end of the day. Next thing I know in quarantine, I'm back to waking and baking every day and panicking when stash is running low. So anyway I went and visited family over christmas and used that time to get a head start on quitting, with the goal of going all of January. The first 7 days were good, and I felt a lot of clarity in my thoughts and emotions. 

But now on day 8, things are starting to surface. Really bad feelings that I don't usually have. I began today by getting really angry at my roommate over something minor. I stewed in anger all day, thinking about how annoying my roommate is, and how annoying everyone around me is. And I started to realize that I'm actually angry and annoyed with myself for letting my addiction get this bad, to where I felt like I needed it to function.

But Im not really functioning, I'd say I'm probably at 60% functioning. I've been unemployed since I lost my job in March, and I feel guilty for making little effort to change that. I feel guilty for traveling and putting people at risk of covid. I feel guilty for simply existing and taking up space. Why do I feel this way? There doesn't seem to be any logical reason, yet the feelings persist and I can't ignore them. I'm having thoughts of violence towards people who I haven't thought about or interacted with in years (not killing or anything, but just like damn I'd like to beat that person up for fucking me over, or cheating me, or disrespecting me). A lot of these people who I have these thoughts about I would consider friends. I also could not stop looking at news and headlines which elicit outrage (police murder of Andre Hill, language used about domestic terrorist Tony Warner). I am not usually like this-- I'm usually stoned. I like to think of myself as a kind, happy person. Today I am not stoned, and I feel cruel, angry, and horrible. In fact, today I feel so bad, I wonder if quitting is even the right decision and if I shouldn't just smoke up to numb these feelings.

I definitely get a lot of music done even when I'm stoned, but I still can't find a paying job, and it's making me really insecure. I'm paying bills with savings that I should not be blowing through, and im also spending hundreds of dollars of those savings on weed. This is not sustainable. I feel like something has to give. I already feel myself rationalizing a relapse, wanting to blame it on the economy and overall state of the world. At this point I can pretty much admit that the addiction is bad, so I guess it would be a relapse if I smoke again. What do I do? Can someone tell me it's worth it to keep going?",1

ive been discouraged reading about how if you used weed prior to 25, damage if irreversible. The irony of me using was that I always felt ""slow,"" not comparable to my peers because I always struggled. So naturally I thought numbing myself would be a cure. Finally after smoking on and off from age 18 to 30, I decided to stop.

Its been 4 months, and I have no pleasure in life. Not motivation. No desire. No happiness. Just floating through life. I refuse to take psychiatric medication, and I just want to heal. Can anyone relate?",7

22 days ago I started vanlife and decided to quit at the same time. I've had depression and anxiety in the past and weed did help me rediscover myself to an extent but overall it made me sick and angry over time. 

I've quit before and usually return out of boredom or sleep issues but vanlife has had a way of solving the underlying problems for both of the chronic concerns. 

My main issue is I think my sleep quality is making me tired and numb. I definitely am going through symptoms of withdrawal. I am past the worst of it but I just don't feel good, I often have random bouts of anxiety and meditation doesn't really do anything for me anymore since I feel chemically labotomized. 

I've been having nightmares and waking several times in the night. I'm generally looking for someone to relate to and share their timeline for recovery. Also points if u meditate and noticed a change as well. 

Thanks",3

I stayed in a bedroom and just drank water and watched movies, within a week I felt normal and my old self back. 

Even though I decided to quit weed, a few weeks later my friends were doing a rotation and I wanted to have fun with them and thought ‘smoking’ would be a different experience than the edibles, I was terribly wrong.

It’s been a month and I’ve felt disconnected from my whole body and memories just don’t feel right or nostalgic. Thoughts like “are my memories fake” and “is life a simulation” have tripped me out really bad. I’m scared I’ll feel like this forever and I need advice on what I can do to be normal again and be my old self. Both my parents have tried weed and were fine and there’s no history of schizophrenia so what’s going on with me?  I’m going to college soon and that’ll be mentally demanding so I need advice on what I can do to be normal again.",4

Actually the only reason I made a reddit account is for this thread. I've been lurking on here for the past 9 days... which is also the amount of days I have been sober. (You guys on this thread really made this experience more bearable). 

I really enjoy being sober so far (except the first several days were absolute hell). Before this I  have been smoking every single day for the past \~3 years. Multiple dab rips and J's to the face every day. Finally for once I feel clarity of mind and actually believe I can accomplish any goal I set for myself. The power I feel with this new state of mind is unreal to be honest.

The reason I'm writing this is because well, I don't know where to go from here. If I'm being honest with myself, no I don't want to be sober for the rest of my days. I love to party and obviously weed feels good, but being so damn dependent on it doesn't!! How do you smoke again without developing a dependence? Do  you even smoke again? At age 21 I stopped smoking cold turkey after 2 years of dependence. It wasn't until age 23/24 when I dabbled with weed again. Started off smoking every once in a while until it turned into every day, aggressive amounts each day. Now here I am going on 27 about to finish grad school and go out and get a job.

So my question is... Can people like us smoke again without becoming dependent? Can we ensure we don't develop a dependence? If so, how?",2

From being able to only make it one day, to a few days to a week, to a few weeks, to a month.

Due to covid it was hard to leave this job even though it was fueling my addiction. On top of being paid really well and it being a chill job, I stayed. I get free gifts from my job, vendors, brands, etc. Not to mention a fat discount. At first I would use the samples given to me, now I just give them away. I havent bought anything in like 2 months from my job. 

I can see the grip weed has on my coworkers and customers. I was once there, coping with my issues through heavily abusing cannabis from potent edibles to strong concentrates. That's not to say that there aren't healthy ways to use cannabis or its bad for you, I like many others was abusing it. Now, for the first time in my life I'm learning how to deal with my issues. 

If I can do it you can. I'm surrounded by it 40 hours a week and I finally can say no to it. 

My life has gotten exponentially better and I got accepted into IT school. I would also abuse stimulants and alcohol and finally have stopped using those as well. I actually have days where I'm hopeful for the future. I still struggle with my depression and anxiety, but now I finally have a fighting chance to get better. I also started therapy that helps a bit too. 

I hope this provides help to anyone struggling. Thanks to this sub for helping me tremendously, I made way too many posts about my struggle with cannabis addiction. I finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

This year I went vegan, quit sugar, quit porn, quit weed,  quit benzodiazipines,  quit stimulants. Next year I want to start meditating, start reading, quit alcohol, work towards a career, obtain healthy hobbies, semen retention, deepen my understanding of occultism and esotericism, and achieve the highest form of consciousness I can work towards. I know I'm destined for absolute triumph and solar victorious nobility. My demons no longer have a control over me. I will succeed. I must. 

The best part is I'm not hopelessly depressed. Using vape pens from morning to night had me in a depressed funk I couldn't escape. If I hit the pen once, I felt shameful, hopeless, lugubrious, and in a daze.

I noticed that once I began smoking after prolonged breaks, I'd overuse weed and end up smoking 2-3 times a day (a lot for a high school athlete). Anyway, I'm on my second time quitting this trash substance and I noticed a weird side-effect that I'm not sure is related or may be common. 

So I had baseball practice earlier today, and when I got there I felt like absolute shit. Obviously, I knew this would happen as I had been full-throttle smoking every day for the last 3 months. The practice consisted of an hour of hitting, hour of throwing (pitching), and an hour in the weight room (leg day). I struggled through the entire thing (I'm a decently athletic person with a strong frame), and after the workout I came home and felt like I was about to die from soreness and fatigue. My whole body aches (writing this 6 hours after coming home) and I have cramped in almost every muscle in my body. I'm not dehydrated nor have I not eaten enough, and the work I did today was nothing out of the ordinary from what I do 4-5 times per week.

25 y o male here, started to smoke at 16...
I was thinking that I've been smart enough in my addition to not have been caught by laws for this stupid thing, partially because I knew I wouldn't have been able to limit my consumption, I knew if I had weed I'd smoke since the morning, that'd make me lazy and i wouldn't accomplish anything, partially because I was scared of getting caught by my parents or I was scared of legal consequences...

I decided to let my best  friend own the weed at his apartment, pay him for the dose and smoke only in the evening the majority of the times, which unfortunately happened almost every evening for the last years... This has been a good choice to me because otherwise I wouldn't have done anything in my life probably and I'd have charges on me for something that to me isn't worthy of being accused for...
My best friends have all had little problems with the law because of weed, one of them has to speak regularly with a pshycologist because he's been caught 3 times with weed on him, nevertheless almost all of them are Disadvantaged in society, If I were an employer and I saw 2-3 charges for drug possession, I wouldn't trust that person, even if that's weed (categorized as bad as coke or heroin in my country)
Does this thing made me feel better?
In part, yes, that means I've been self aware and attentive, even if I was addicted I never lost the vision of what was really important and what was not, I've been smart despite the bad addiction which is stupid in itself.

Is this egoistic? Yes, but I preferred to pay a premium to buy my dose only when needed than carry extra risk for nothing.

I still feel bad overall for my friends, they're good people, I feel bad to have been an egoist but in hindsight it:s been a good thing",2

I realized how much more anxious, anti-social and depressed I am and that I lost so much of my confidence in this time period were I smoked every day. Then I decided to stop and everything got so much better and normal again - now I am around 17 days clean with 1 relapse.

I have a very very bad case of oneitis and 3 days ago I was at a little party with 5 people, and of one them is a good friend of mine who is also one of the best friends of my oneitis. I got drunk and told her everything, that I had a serious crush on this girl for over 5 years and that I always, really always think of her and stuff. I knew that my oneitis has a boyfriend and they are extremely happy together but I always thought there was a little chance. My friend called Paula told me that they are so happy together and that I should really forget it - no way around. I was crushed because she really opened my eyes and this little voice that always told me that you still have a chance was suddenly dead. 

So next day I decided to get some weed and try smoking at night. I smoked and was extremely high, like out of my mind high. Then I jacked of for an hour lol. After that I felt something, an extreme emotional pain, I really realized she's gone, every thought was wasted, and I could never be with her. I started listening to music and it was the most emotional moment I can remember in a long time, it was so painful and I cried hysterically for 10 minutes, but it was so unbelievably real that I could even describe it. The first time in 5 years that I realized I can never get her. It was crazy but it felt so freeing. I could let out all of my emotions and I think this is important for getting over a girl. It sounds dumb but I thought I could do this once a week because this really was like therapy. But maybe my brain plays a trick with me and experiencing this emotions only makes the situation harder for me. I tried everything: lifting, sleeping with other girls, blocking her, time with friends, everything. But nothing works, I always come back to her. She is fucking perfect. Fuck. Here it is again.

I'm so impressed with you! 

I've been using cannabis medically for PTSD, but it also seems to help with the "" noise"" in my head. Repeated words and phrases. I tried to quit one night, and the voices were so bad the next morning I could hardly think and function. 

Today, I am irritable and not feeling great, which is to be expected. The repetitive words aren't too bad today, but they are there. When I am high they are not. It was nice to have them gone for the most part. 

I'm quitting because of my lungs. I had thought about edibles, but often times they make me depressed when I eat them the days afterward. 

I just need some support. My breathing has been better today even tho I'm still smoking cigs. ( that's next, quit drinking the way I was, and now off weed. One thing at a time).

I had an urge to smoke about an hour ago and got through it, but I'm having trouble focussing and doing my work. So... Like I said, just need a little cheerleading. I had quit smoking for about 20 yrs until the nightmares and spousal abuse started, so I know I can. He is gone now, left ugly mental scars, but that is so much better that I feel like I don't need it to get through the day and night. 

When will it start to get better? I have little patience today, which is not good for my social work job. 

I'm taking meds for my other issues that are working, so I have a plan to call my doc if I can't live with the voices. 

Any encouragement will help.

I no longer feel the nice effects from it, only dissociation, numbness and fatigue. 
As of right now I haven’t smoked in over 24 hours and I feel like I could start crying any second. Massive anxiety and heart palpitations, no appetite, complete loss of interest in anything I usually love, it was near impossible to fall asleep last night, irritable etc... I just feel awful.
And the worst part is I love smoking, I’m extremely socially awkward (possibly on the spectrum but undiagnosed) and smoking with other people is the only way I can socialize « normally ».
I’m just really torn because I love cannabis and I love some aspects of it but I don’t think it’s working for me anymore and it makes me sad. 
I’ve been reading a lot of posts about other people’s experiences and some give me hope but idk it feels like I’ll always miss it somehow. 
I was also one of those people who completely glorified weed and although I still think it’s an incredible plant and can do so much good, I’m still worried about the long terms effects on my mental health especially seeing how potent the stuff I smoke is.

Today my mom asked me if ide want to go on this trip out of town to see my family. At first I thought about it and though it might be good to get some fresh air. But then a second thought occurred attached to the anxiety which made me remember it’s to good to be true. I thought how I would hate for my extended family to see me like this and think of me differently. And while sad, that though is very rational. In a regular state of mind, no drugs, no withdrawal I’m able to control how I’m perceived but right now I can’t even control what comes out of my mouth, or how I feel about things. 

It makes you think why do we even put ourselves though this hell, wheather it’s weeks or months? And the answer is hope for a better future, the future without anxiety, one where I can look forward to the next thing that’s going to happen. But despite that, the truth is I’m so tired. I’m so so so so tired of living this way I don’t know how much more I can do it. I wanna cry all the time but emotions still elude me. I’m 15 and I’m happy I quit now but I just wish I never picked up that joint 5 months ago. My confidence is 1/8 of what it used to be, I lost my humor. That was my best trait.

Addictive behavior moving into different domains,"I haven't smoked since two sundays ago. Thankfully I'm in a spot where I am 100% on board with quitting, and turning down all of the opportunities at christmas with my family were easy. Although, I have to acknowledge there are many layers to my family's smoking / smoking with my family. I wish my parents didn't smoke, I wish none of us smoked. The hard part will be when I'm by myself with all the associated activities weed has traditionally played a part of.

Anyway, I am finding myself turning those addiction claws to other things. Like buying books. I love reading and I love books, but when I'm smoking I don't really read. My attention span / ability gets wrecked for (what feels like) a few days after smoking, and if I am smoking every day, that math is easy.

Now over the last several days I have found myself buying books. A lot. Way more than really makes sense. A good metric to gauge if an activity is healthy (at least for you, the individual) is to check and see if you would be comfortable if a loved one or stranger could see it. I spent like $400 dollars on books in 3 or four transactions, and I feel like I wouldn't want to let anyone know that. I don't even know my neighbors, but I really don't want there to be a pile of packages out front on the porch. This isn't putting me into crazy debt or anything (although I have definitely done that before), but I am dipping into savings that were not made for this purpose. At all. I will be happy in the future that I own these books, but right now it feels like a manifestation of a weakness.

I guess I am just putting to paper the fact that I am letting myself make poor decisions and justifying them with ""at least I'm not smoking"". A big problem that I have had with quitting before was the thought of ""I hate myself when I'm smoking, I'm such a huge piece of shit. If I could only manage to quit, I would become a superhuman and all my problems with who I am and where I am in life would disappear"". And then I manage to quit, and I don't turn into that superhuman. And then I'm like ""well, I quit, but all these miracle improvements to myself aren't here, so why again did I quit? May as well smoke since I kinda like it and it's kinda familiar and I'm kinda used to it"".

One of the big troublesome patterns I have recognized with times when I have quit before (a few weeks, a month or whatever) is I will feel like I'm doing great and that I can handle a smoke. And then I smoke and that initial rush of the high says ""Man, you are actually awesome and you really shouldn't be depressed. You have the capability to actually make the improvements to yourself. The path is clear, make the commitments and the changes"". And then a week or so later I am smoking again and not making the improvements. I don't know what happens in between that initial ""realization of my own awesomeness"" and my ""return to pattern land"".

Anyway, I didn't smoke for the last two weeks. I'm 37 and I feel like so much of my life has passed me by. I am definitely not where I would have imagined myself / wanted to be when I was younger",3

This is my first post. I have been smoking weed for 43 years. And I am really sick of it. I also have been an off and on fairly heavy drinker for most of this period. After an alcohol-caused Thanksgiving episode that was very painful, I have not drank since. No cravings, no regrets. I’m done with booze. Easy.

But weed. That is a different matter. Much harder to quit for me. The lack of physical damage from it (hangovers, organ damage) makes weed tougher. I’m sure I could continue smoking for the rest of my life and feel just fine – physically – and be very healthy, running, hiking, lifting. No problem.

But. But. The mental health and life satisfaction are the thing. When I smoke I am afraid of people. I hide. I isolate. I can’t form or maintain relationships. And I do nothing. My guitar-playing languishes. I do nothing.

Life doesn’t last forever and I am sick of wasting it. I get almost no pleasure from weed. The only real pleasure is it stops the ‘I gotta smoke’ thoughts that race around my brain. Fifteen minutes after I smoke it I wish I hadn’t. I often say that if I could take a sobriety pill while stoned I’d pay for it. Because I almost never feel glad I smoked. I record videos of myself saying the worst times of my life are when I’m high.

I buy a joint at a time from the weed shop. Smoke half, throw the rest out. Within a day or 2 I’m at the weed shop. Wash rinse repeat. 

This is all so bizarre. I have never admitted any of this psychological torment to anyone.

I turned it down really without a second thought, other than that it was odd how easy it was to turn down. I didn't make a big deal about it, just a simple ,""im not smoking these days, thanks tho"" and a smile was all I needed to do.

First, don't worry. Yes, theres a likelihood we caused some changes to our brains from smoking so long from a young age, but nooo we are not doomed! The human body and brain are incredibly resilient and amazing in their capacity to heal. 

Try some of these things that improve brain function, learning, memory, and mood:
 
1. Learn a new language! I learned my 2nd language to a near-native level as an adult (I have lived abroad for 7 years). Learning a new language is the number one best thing to improve brain plasticity and function. Start with duolingo, get into some classes, watch TV in your new language with the subtitles on in that language so you read and listen at the same time. Seriously learning my 2nd language has been one of the most rewarding and amazing experiences of my life. Having relationships in 2 languages, music in 2 languages, and understanding another culture deeply is soooo beautiful. 

2. Learn a new skill such as dancing, playing a musical instrument, chess, coding, cooking, baking or anything else like this. Novel learning and activities are amazing for the brain. 

3. There is a reason old people do the crossword puzzles lol... doing crosswords, sudokus, and other types of puzzles help with memory and learning.

4. Read books! Lots of books! Buy yourself a Kindle with that money you are saving. Its ok to start with 10 minutes/ 100 page books. Fluffy fiction or page-turning thrillers. Doesnt have to be dense stuff. Read what you are interested in and keep going. 

5. Make meditation a daily habit! So much research shows how much it improves your brain health!!! 

6. Read articles / listen to podcasts about improving brain health. Your brain can be exercised and get healthier just like any other part of your body, my friends. 

Hope this gives you some ideas and hope :)

After being diagnosed with a form of IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) when I was 18, I was in a lot of pain everyday looking for the right medication. Living in Oregon I was soon gifted some weed edibles from family friends, and it ended up helping my condition immensely. I eventually also found the right medication for myself and started to be able to live a semi normal life again around the time I was 20. By that time I was smoking weed almost everyday after my college classes, as well as using edibles.

Fast forward to now, I'm almost 26 and graduated college a year and a half ago in 2019. Up until that point I was still using weed pretty often, and was not experiencing any anxiety or problems related to using it. However upon graduating college and getting a full time engineering job, my life changed a lot. My girlfriend and I moved in together with along with a friend of mine, and I started to develop really bad anxiety that I had never experienced before. It made me super tense in my neck and back, and eventually all over my body, so much that I was seeing doctors to try and see what was happening.

It took a few months of this suffering to realize what I had was anxiety, not being able to turn my brain off and constantly overthinking everything that happened to me. Of course through all of this I was still using weed heavily, even more so than in college because my job wasn't very mentally taxing. Fast forward through this shit show of a year 2020, and my pains had only gotten worse.

A few weeks ago someone turns me onto a book, **The power of Now by Eckhart Tolle**. I read it in a few days and came to the realization that while I had this inkling of a feeling in my mind that weed was now bad for me and in fact could be the source of my anxiety and problems, I was never able to disconnect it from being the substance that I discovered all those years ago to save me from my chronic illness. In my mind the weed was still helping me feel better, still relaxing me, when in fact it was doing the opposite. Reading that book changed my whole mindset on my life, and made me realize that I needed to quit weed for good.

There's no denying that weed did help me when I was younger, and still helps many people to this day.  Don't let people tell you that you can't get addicted to weed, *the mind can get addicted to anything.* I know I only briefly mentioned the book that helped me come to, but if you suffer from anxiety and overthinking, especially because of weed, give it a read. It's not for everyone but it could change your life.

I'm now 3 weeks sober from weed and feel like a new human being. My mind is clear, my anxiety is much better than it has been in a long time, and I'm finally feeling like I can move on from this dark time in my life. It only took 15 months of suffering to make me finally wake up to my reality. Not everyone needs to suffer like I did, and if you relate to this post, maybe it's time for you to quit too. It hasn't all been easy, but it's damn worth it.

TLDR; Developed a chronic illness (IBD) when I was younger and became dependent on weed to help me feel better. After years of abuse it started to give me really bad anxiety, and after making some realizations due to a book I read (see above), I was finally able to see that weed was the main source of my anxiety. I was finally able to disconnect weed from being something helpful (which at one point it was) and see it for what it was now, an addiction that was holding my mind hostage.",14

I've been actively trying to stop weed since August with many months before that where I was trying to cut back or take breaks. I actually had just shy of 3 months clean this spring but went back to it and then in August I fully came to terms with how addicted I really am which i never fully accepted before. 

Before August I always looked at stopping as a break, till I got some things in my life in order and could use in moderation. I now realize i can probably never have a healthy relationship with weed and I havent lasted past 2 weeks since then. The knowledge that if i ever make it past the withdrawals I may never smoke again is heart breaking and terrifying for me. With this thought i keep going back to it while im still in withdrawal because if the pain hurts and i might go back to it later i might as well go back to it now before i finish suffering through the whole withdrawal process. 

I am going back to work on Tuesday after a 2 week vacation where i smoked as close to 24/7 as i could. Ive been getting steadily more and more depressed throughout the year and the thought of going back to work while still stuck in this depression honestly scares me alot. I know weed makes it harder for me to process tough parts of my life. Ive been hanging on by what feels like a thread for months which has both been caused in part by weed but also been what makes it so hard to stop for any length of time. Im hoping to get through the worst of the withdrawals for a couple days before going back to work. 

I'll be honest i have about 1% confidence that ill actually succeed this time or the next 10 tries after this but im feeling good about the desire to quit right now so im taking it and hoping.",3

The entire time all I could think about was how it was a perfect metaphor for what Im going through with my sobriety. 
We couldnt see an end to the dirt and bushes but we knew we were close to the road up ahead based on the car noises jn the distance. We kept pushing and pushing and eventually topped out, all scraped and drench in sweat. The feeling of reaching the top and seeing that concrete road was one of the greatest things I’ve felt in years, with or without weed. It gave me a small glimpse of hope for what joy lays in store ahead, without the crutch of smoking herb.

It's been a tough road. During Xmas this year I moved back home in to my parents with my partner. We both smoked everyday and every night, we made the decision to pack in for good. For me this is after 6/7 years of constant use. 

Today (Sunday) marks 7 days sober. 
Sleep seems easier,
My appetite is somewhat returning,
Yet I have a crazy hatred burning inside me, I get annoyed with things that dont even concern me.
I'll think nasty thoughts about people I don't know based on their appearance or their actions, I'll reach crazy levels of anger with inanimate objects, and I'm so short tempered with the people I love.

I noticed this first after around 4 years of use, and I guess I thought as my head cleared so would the hatred, but it hasn't. 

Has anyone else experienced this? I'm so worried I've permanetly damaged my personality. Should I see a doctor? Am I expecting a change too early? 

I just want to feel normal again, I just want the constant anger to subside. 

What should I do?

I entered treatment in June for severe depression and destructive self medicating with alcohol, pills and weed. I was in NYC when COVID struck, and my whole world came to a screeching halt. My business was shut down, and I was essentially trapped in my apartment! I already wasn’t doing well with depression, but this just put me over the edge. I needed help so I went and did it.

Now 6 mo later, I’m still super depressed. I thought that complete abstinence would at least add clarity so I could focus on my mental health without the variables of all the substances. I’m still trying to dial in the right meds, but it’s frustrating. I’ve been on so many meds already it’s getting concerning. 

I quit a really nasty cocaine habit 4 years ago, and was “California Sober” for about a year after. That was when I was at my best, personally, professionally and physically. I still fell back into depression and drinking to cope, I just think the med combo stopped working.

I don’t know what to do. No one on my treatment team is going to give me the go ahead on mj. I also am the first to admit I will not be using in moderation, though I’m able to limit use around work and responsibilities. It’s not ideal, but better than the way I’m living now, basically harm reduction at this point. 

I don’t know what I’m looking for with this post, not expecting permission to get high again, haha. I’ve found a lot of motivation from this thread, you guys seriously rock! Would appreciate any advice and support you can offer.",6

I remember perceiving what I thought was an enhancement of the experience of listening to music. Music is a big part of my life, and so this was a very welcome effect. I also perceived a reduction in anxiety. I didn’t use it too often, but one day, after about two years of occasional use, something changed. I’ve come across anecdotal reports on Reddit of this happening to other people as well, though it’s apparently a very rare phenomenon, and no research studies have been done on it to my knowledge. 


One day, marijuana unexplainably and suddenly “turned on me.” That is, it no longer was pleasurable at all. What used to be a once cherished moment of relaxation and peace turned into hours of anxiety, which often resulted in a panic attack, and a drop in my mood. 
I’ve tried everything to remedy this, including getting a new high-tech vaporizer, switching to a different strain, reducing the vaporization temperature to the lowest setting possible, and simply using less. None of this has solved the issue - and it is with great sadness that I feel I must part ways with marijuana, possibly indefinitely, as it seems that for whatever reason, my mind and body can no longer tolerate it. I used to view this as some sort of horrible curse - the notion that I may have to say goodbye to it forever - and that things will never be the same.

But, there’s also an alternate way of looking at it - maybe all of the time I otherwise would have spent lying down and listening to music, “unwinding” after a long day, I can now devote to something else, possibly something more productive. And, if the marijuana seemed to decrease what I thought was anxiety, maybe using it once in a while was fine, but, it never did address the root cause of my anxiety. It was only a temporary distraction, not a long-term solution.


Maybe my sudden intolerance to it, however unwelcome and difficult to come to terms with, could be perceived as a “blessing in disguise.” Maybe I can now say with greater certainty that I won’t end up dependent on it. Maybe I can now also liberate myself from the fear of what it might do to my brain in the long-term after years and years of use. Maybe it all adds up - I wouldn’t want to fall victim to some sort of structural changes or other potential neurological abnormalities that might occur in my brain after a lifetime of use - after all, though marijuana is now legal in many states, no one seems to have the answers as to what exactly the future holds for frequent users in terms of how it might affect their brain in the long run. I’m no expert, and maybe they’ll be completely fine. 
But for now, I’m parting ways with marijuana.",22

Just wanted to vent a little and share my experience quitting weed.

Those past 2 month have been a hard and intense experience on my side. 

I dicided to quit because I wanted to manage my anxiety better and sadly I feel like it is worse then before these days. 

My only clean escape has been guitar all my life and I can't really play due to my wrist being messed up ( been seeing a PT for that) and it's not getting that much better. That has take a big toll on me emotionally.

I also drink a beer or two in the evening and I see that im just crossing addiction and have trouble just getting sober for real. 

I feel like I'm getting some kind of depression or something because I'm often very down/sad/angry and negative way more than before even if I present myself as a positive person while at work or in front of my friends. I can't even be with my dad witout wanting to cry because I feel like I'm losing myself.

I don't really wanna chill with my best friend now since he smokes all the time. He is a succesful person and I love him but I can't chill around smokers anymore. 

Fortunatly I began working again recently and it really put my anxiety down since I'm not in my own head so that has been a blessing in a way.

I also have back problems that are hard to manage and I try to do sports and stretching the most I can but its scaring me.

I smoke cigarretes and feel like they just kill me in the inside but have a really hard time quitting.

I'm still proud of me for stopping weed but I know weed was just a mask for the real problems I have in life. 

I'm going to call a psy tomorrow and give it a chance again. This is madness and I don't want to live like that forever.

Ive decided to quit as i dont really know why i am smoking and my usage was increasing and increasing and honestly i just cant be bothered with it any more too much stress when it runs out, costs too much money, and i believe its holding me back as when i first started smoking i was convinced it was helping me. But now it gives me 30 mins of feeling alright before making me tired and making me want more.

Ive attempted stopping a few times b4 but each time failed miserably maybe max a day. This time i basically have no way of getting it or at least it would be very hard with my dealers stopping selling. If anyone has any advice on things thatll help, for me ive found that excersize and showers seem to help, however im really struggling with sleep i just wont feel tired and the boredom drives me crazy, ive got a few hobbies to fill the time, thinking about trying to brew my own cider, makes some music and even attempt to make my own video game. 

Wish me luck and if anyone has any wisdom theyd like to share id be very thankful :)",3

I decided that I am going to use this new account for one purpose: keeping a logbook to keep track. For myself, but hopefully it'll be useful for others as well. 

**My smoking habbits**

I've smoked since the age of 13 (27 now). I used to smoke at least one gram a day, during the evening before going to bed.

It started out harmless but it soon became a getaway for multiple experiences: the divorce of my parents, the cheating of my girlfriend and later it was just a getaway from anxiety and responsibilities. 

I used to smoke 'heavy' strains like amnesia and others, which resulted (I think) in my first mental problems. 

**Mental issues**

Aside from the 'normal' anxiety many experience, I had some phases that I think came close to paranoia or psychosis. 
There was a period of a few months when I was about 18 that I was completely freaked out about global warming: how everyone was doomed, over population etc etc. I couldn't think about anything else. Had shivers, couldn't think straight and my close family was very worried. It came to a point I even was too afraid to smoke, which helped end this phase. 

Of course, I started again not so long after.

When I was about to finish university and was writing my thesis something similar happened. I got so stressed I was shaking all the time, couldn't sleep, was crying all the time, restless.. this too, faded once I quit. 

But of course, I started again. 

**Quitting for good, I thought**

About three years ago I had a burn out at work. At work I suddenly got dizzy and I thought I just needed to eat something, but it didn't help. I want to the GP and he couldn't find anything at all! I was also experiencing blurred vision/visual snow(?) when I looked ay the sky and couldn't focus my eyes. I also had mild tinnitus.

My GP thought it was all tress related. And I think I agree to an extend. After a year of sleeping 10+ hours a day, spending a lot of time in nature and not working, I felt better. The tinnitus, blurred vision and the visual snow remained. 
I got glasses, which fixed my vision but that was it. I started working again and of course, 1,5 years ago, during summer, I was like: I can smoke a joint on the beach again! 

Haha... What a joke. 

**My current try to stop for good**

One thing was different this time: I turned to hasj and avoided THC-heavy strains like Hazes. It reduced the chances of bad trips like mentioned above. Why on earth I still kept smoking is beyond me, but I did. 

Last month I ate a kiwi while smoking, not knowing I was allergic. I ended up at the ER and boy did I feel shit. It made me quit, again. Cold turkey. 

**My symptoms so far**

The first week:

* I slept horrible. I couldn't fall asleep and woke up 4 hours later unable to sleep again. 

* I was nauseous in the morning, including throwing up and not being able to eat in the morning. 

* I was feeling either cold or warm and sometimes it felt like I had a fever. 

The second and third week:

* I could fall asleep more easily but I couldn't stay asleep: as soon as my girlfriend would move an inch in bed, I was completely awake. My sleep quality is still terrible

* I got emotional for no reason: reading something on Reddit or seeing an act of kindness on a TV show got me in tears. Sometimes there wasn't even a clear cause: I just felt like crying

* I got more irritable at everyone around me. And I was restless: my heart was beating intensely and I got dizzy without being able to calm myself from time to time. The only remedy I found so far is going on a hike for 5-10km. 

Week 4:

* All of the symptoms of week 3

* I have had two migraine attacks this week. The days prior my blurred vision got worse and I felt weird. After the attacks I felt weird, weak, and I slept for 14 hours straight.

* Currently I am experiencing fever like symptoms but I'm not sure whether this is related to me quitting weed or not. 

* I still have tinnitus when I'm laying in bed/ when its super quite around me. And my vision still has those sparks whenever it is very bright around me. Especially the blue sky looks like a disco. 

**Last words**

I've quit before and all the aforementioned symptoms are familiar to me, yet they still keep freaking me out from time to time. 

It has become a long ass post, but I wanted to elaborate more on the entire story. Also to empty my own mind. 

Overall I'm feeling well and I know it all will pass. But boy oh boy am I stupid for putting myself through this once again. Addiction is fun!

There is a lot more to write about:
I quit tabacco at the same time, reduced cafeine and alcohol. I have had help dealing with traumas I mentioned at the start of this post and what not. 

Maybe another time. 
I'll give an update in about a week. 

Good luck y'all!",5

I smoked everyday and did other substances too, a lot.
Weed was always there. So in january this year after a deep experience, forced me to see, that i have to stop smoking, i realized that numbing the pain only makes things more worse and that life only goes in the direction I want when I stop numbing my pain. So there I was and I stopped for 4 months. 4 months into it I had the big need to smoke some hash and thought 'fuck it' better smoking weed, than always thinking about it. I simply switched my addiction to other stuff at that time, so I started smoking again. I thought I could do it moderation but it just took a week and I were at the exact same dosage as i quitted. 
It's december now and after a Breakup with my Girlfriend i stopped smoking again, weed only triggered my biggest fears and pushed me into doing nothing everyday except smoking.
I'm now exactly 14 days sober and my depression got stronger and stronger. The first week was terrible but things got a lil better, now there's a big down again. The urge to smoke and forget it all is big, but I know it will only trigger the repetitive hell I was going thru all the years. It's hard boys and everyone around me is doing in the first place weed. I know the only way for me to reach my goals ( which i didn't really indentified except that I want to be sober ) is to completely stay sober from everything. But as man who loved numbing himself, its incredible hard. All I can pretty much think is the breakup and the lost i experience.

I miss that numbness 
I miss that girl.

tl;dr: not all forms of rest are the same; smoking is an exhausting form of rest and consumes a ton of my time

A lot of this is probably obvious to most here, but these have been some of my experiences as a nightly smoker of 2-3 years who is now 4ish days into not smoking at all.

The classic characteristic of smoking is that time slows down. But the cycle of work, smoke, eat, sleep, repeat actually made my days fly by. It made me feel like I was always either working or sleeping, which was extremely stressful. The time I was smoking I enjoyed in the moment, but there wasn't ever really anything to look back and reflect on except for thoughts / activities that felt profound in the moment only for me to discover how... not-profound they actually were the next day.

On paper, I was spending a ton of time ""relaxing"" after work. I mean this in the least-fulfilling way possible to describe the act of relaxing.

At this stage in my life, I'm finally starting to realize that not all ""rest/relaxation"" activities are equal. There are so many different flavors of rest, and you actually do have to ""listen"" to what your body needs in that moment. (Side note: I used to HATE when people said ""listen to your body,"" but I think I get it now?). I consider smoking to actually be a very exhausting form of relaxation now.

Some examples of situational rest:

1) when I have a cognitively heavy day of a lot of deep thought activities at work, it's best to close my eyes and rest up for 15-20 min laying down on my bed. If you think about it, even just having your eyes open and processing / filtering the information coming into your brain from the amazing sense of sight is a pretty intensive brain activity. I don't even listen to music. I just sit there with my eyes closed in silence like a psycho. When I open my eyes I tend to feel SO much better.

2) when I have to socialize (I'm an introvert) a lot or wrangle/train people at work, then I find it's nice to rest with a thought provoking book. Doesn't matter if it's fiction or non-fiction. Or maybe even clean my apt, which tends to energize me, strangely enough.",8

I just want to know has this happened to anyone else? It was only one time that I smoked after initially quitting so it kind of shook me that it would trigger me to withdraw again. I’ve been experiencing increased anxiety again (the type where my heart rate increases and I have to calm myself down), I have absolutely no appetite and my hands and feet are sweaty.

Here's what I'm (28, m) actually here to say, though:

This community is the reason I made a reddit account. Starting to participate in this community 7 years ago was one of the first and most important things I did in my journey to freeing myself from a horrible and crippling addiction and form of slow suicide. But here I am, 5 years from actually quitting cold turkey, a couple days into a breakup so painful it's doing utter violence to my mind and body, and there's absolutely no chance of me getting high.

The message of this post is not mixed, though my feelings right now are obviously complicated, and in so many ways, absolutely awful.

But here's the point: I was high every day for 5 years, numbing pain, trying and failing to quit, failing to process the emotional pain I'd stored up, and thereby never working through it. I finally quit because my partner at the time told me she'd been sleeping with one of my best friends, and this was so shocking and awful that it woke me the fuck up and I was finally energized to change my life. I used anger and spite to motivate me a lot at the beginning, though of course you have to find different ways the deeper into sobriety you get.

And I knew by that point that there was no way past all that pain except to go through it, so I chose to look at it as a gift, an opportunity, to suffer and to love that suffering and to let that awful pain pass through me in great huge terrible waves so that leftover in its place there would be something clean and clear and strong and stable and beautiful.

And though I wasn't completely certain that there would be something like that on the other side, I put my faith in the fact that there would be--I trusted, not in god, but simply in the fact that the only way past this stuff was through it, and that this amazing clarity and strength would come.

Lo and behold, it did, which is the *only* reason why I was able to share the last 4 years of my life with this beautiful amazing incredible funny outgoing openminded strong outspoken huge-hearted adorable wonderful spontaneous hilarious woman. We broke up because we want and need different things, and unfortunately we've realized our different wants and needs are incompatible. But we will always love each other and I am so so so fucking sad right now--now I'm sobbing as I write this, which, I wasn't before.

But, 5 years ago today, my having trusted that there was beauty and clarity and stability and strength on the other side of the dark terrifying violent tunnel, and also my having continued every day between then and now to make the choice to trust in that, is also the reason why she and I had the strength to part while still loving each other, to know that it's the right thing to do and make the choice to do it and follow through with it even though it hurts like absolute hell.

**tl;dr**

And it's why even though this hurts so fucking unbelievably much, I know that on the other side of this pain, as long as I allow myself to feel it and process it, as long as I accept it and love it and go through it, there is something amazing on the other side--*there is so much world*.

edit: Oh my god, I've never received such a prodigious outpouring of love and support in a single post before. You people are amazing and beautiful and now I'm crying tears of joy at reading all your responses. Whether you're 5 minutes clean or 5 years, you're already healing. Keep it up.

So when i asked her she said yes that’s all true, so I told her I am packing my bags and today is the last day you’re seeing my face.  I been living in my car in the cold for the last 2 days, it sucks but I go back to work 8 days so it’s temporary.  I work off site so they give me a hotel.
 They haven’t called me or anything I miss my brother my cat, my mom my house.. I didn’t even say bye just left and never came back.. yes it’s my addiction that caused this. That’s my story as of now. Wish me luck or any advice is always welcome.",50

You can have good days and bad days.,"There are many posts saying that 'it all gets better after X day or week' and I personally have had a different experience. I am not making this post to talk down on those people because it's so amazing that your journey of recovery was a positive trend.  


However, just as they say 'weed isn't addictive' this idea that each day gets better isn't entirely the truth for some people. I am presently 24 days off the THC. I would smoke an ounce of concentrates every month.   


I have good days and I have bad days. I started having a lot of bad days, such as nausea, intense nightmares, night sweats, terrible anxiety and panic attacks. Steadily, the symptoms do get better and less intense. I am taking steps forward most days, but then once a week or so I will take a step backwards. I will have a really intense panic attack and be unable to participate in activities, etc. All I can do is meditate and breath while I experience it and wait for it to pass.  


The point of the post is that you should not be discouraged if you see all these people getting better everyday. That is amazing for them. But, know that there are people who are also having bad days among the good ones during recovery.  Healing is not linear - it is a journey.

A year ago, I got high right before my wife's water broke. I slept it off a bit while we waited at home but ended up taking her to the hospital after just a few hours, groggy and confused and stoned. Not the husband or father I wanted to be. I look back on that moment with some regret and sadness but also a lot of love for myself, I was out of control with this habit but I was ready to change and I made sure that was the last time.

I thought I would have a lot more to say at the one year mark but sobriety really feels normal to me now rather than exceptional, so it's hard to know what to offer. Telling my story here was so helpful. Therapy was and is really helpful. I got high as often as possible for all of my adult life, about 16-17 years, before I finally quit. I never knew a sober year as an adult until now. My emotional development has some catching up to do and the things I've achieved on that front are oftentimes subtle and don't make for good stories. I'm more in control of anger and frustration with family and friends. I'm able to describe my feelings and process them instead of pushing them away. I can have tough conversations with coworkers. It's not exactly James Bond stuff but it's important.

An old friend called me late last night, spur of the moment. A year ago I would have been high and sent that call to voicemail, and maybe returned it or maybe not. Sober me was just hanging around at home, clearheaded, and happy to reconnect. We talked for an hour and a half about life.

This afternoon I took a walk in the frigid cold with my family and was feeling annoyed about nothing in particular. When we got home I stayed outside with my oldest and we played in the yard, then sat together in the sun and meditated for a few minutes, because why not? It made me feel better and more centered, it was good. It sets a good example for her too. A year ago I would have raced into the house to sneak off and get high.

The anxiety of imagining quitting and the withdrawal symptoms felt so huge to me when they were happening, but all that was over for me within a couple months. Since then it has been about this far more subtle stuff. I can't think of a single thing in my life that's gotten worse with the absence of weed. Most things have gotten a lot better.

Long time lurker here, finally decided to make a new account and share my experience. I'm 20 yo, started smoking at 16. Classical story, first it was only every few months, then only every few weeks, then only on weekends.. Over time, I started to loose my motivation more and more. Things I used to be enthusiastic and good about became somewhat boring/old. Maybe it's not all weed's fault, but damn me if it helped hahaha.

When it came time for college, I was so unmotivated, i basically decided to quit after a few weeks and decided to enjoy my time in a new, big city. Started smoking every day, lost all concept of day and night, basically I was rotting away. After a few months, I found a full time job which I really liked and it helped me alot. Got my daily rithm back, but still smoked almost daily with a friend. Fast forward through covid, quarantine etc. the next academic year is here. I decide to really do it this time. Quit my job and all. The year starts, and it's like history repeated itself. The second I had to do something I didn't enjoy on its own, I became lazy idiot and started smoking alot again.

A few weeks ago I basically decided to escape to my hometown, to mom's place. I can still go out and smoke with friends, but I'm trying to end this year sober. I'm now at 5 days, and the idea is if I don't smoke through Christmas Eye and New Year parties, then it will be much easier to resist in 2021.

Should I taper off or quit cold Turkey? I’m a pretty heavy user at 1g of concentrate per day. 

Should I pick a date and commit to it? When is the right time? 

I’m concerned mostly about my job. My work requires a lot of emotional labor and requires me to deal with tough shit. I’ve used weed as a way to numb myself through the heavy shit I deal with so that I can “get the job done”.  I’m worried now how not smoking will impact my ability to do so.  

I can feel the fear of “lifting the veil” and forcing myself to face the reality that I’ve smoked away the first years of my daughter’s life (6yo). So many moments and milestones that I floated through that I’ll never have the chance to really experience clearly. So much missed opportunity for connection that I’m sure she has felt at some point. The guilt I feel for that alone seems insurmountable.  

Putting that into words makes it seem pretty clear that fear of facing reality is what is holding me back from taking the next step.",1

I just wanted to post in here to express how proud I am to have made it to Day 9. I can finally eat, and I’ve actually been sleeping better than I was when I was chiefing 24/7.

This is coming from a person who constantly repeated/postponed my Day 1. For me, cold turkey sucked so bad, so I opted to wane off of weed by training myself to eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner without smoking, and only smoke at night if absolutely needed. I would try to go the whole day without smoking and only smoke when I wanted to pull my hair out. 

Eventually it got to the day where I had to sleep without it and I had to constantly tell myself these withdrawals are normal and to keep pushing through. And here I am. 

What really helped me was taking naps throughout the day, and meal prepping easy things to eat like overnight oats, oatmeal, and yogurt. I had to force myself to eat and needed something that I could just swallow easily to get food down.

I hope this helps! I’m feeling so much better and normal now, and I don’t have any temptation anymore. Fuck withdrawals I’m never going through that again.",3

Body aches, stomach aches, chest pain, back pains, headaches, lack of appetite, nausea, general malaise like if I was sick, nightmares, sense of falling when trying to sleep, and some other stuff. 

My mind is much clearer now, I can breath a lot better, I’m eating much healthier. I’m still dealing with anxiety attacks but I’m learning how to control them so it doesn’t get out of control. My biggest struggle now is being able to get some sleep. I start feeling bad mostly at night around 9pm. The rest of the day is pretty much normal for me now, as to the first weeks where I felt sick pretty much all day.

Been reading posts here for the last 13 days and its been extremely helpful.

I’m 35 and I’ve been a daily heavy smoker for the last 15+years with occasional use a few years prior to that.  Ive never taken much time off except a week or two here and there when traveling.  I also got clean for life insurance a few years ago and it took me 64 days to pee clean (shows how much I was actually using as a 110lb female).  I’m a fully functioning addict with a great job, marriage, own a home, etc.  Due to this I feel like I’ve been flying under the radar and no one really knows how much I’ve abused marijuana.

I decided it was time to quit for a laundry list of reasons and surprisingly don’t have cravings and I’m sleeping very well (two things I had trouble with when I became clean last time).  This go around however, I have crippling anxiety and depression.  I’m also very fatigued.  Some days I just cry, some says I’m kind of ok, some days I’m hiding under the blankets in a panic attack.  My doctor wants to give me anxiety meds but I want to work through this without putting anything else in my body.

I’ve been trying to work out, meditate, and do yoga but the depression makes it hard.  I guess I’m just waiting for the point where this all subsided and  i can start to live my new, sober normal (which im very excited about).

I appreciate everyone on here and the stories ive read...I don’t feel quite alone.  I have zero desire to use again but I’m hoping this will get better soon and any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks for listening (reading) 😊",2

2020-12-26 15:48:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kkpmr6/1_year_sober_i_did_it/,1 year sober! I did it!!,"I wanted to preface this by thanking all of the wonderful people on this sub. Early in my recovery, reading other peoples stories and struggles helped me feel like I was not alone. It gave me a baseline. Interacting with others was a sort of cognitive behavioral therapy for me. I am grateful I found this community when I did. 

My journey started like most. Towards the end of my drug usage, I started to indulge a little too much, which resulted in regular panic attacks. I have never experienced them before, same with anxiety. I honestly did not believe they were real. Exactly 1 year ago today, as I held my daughter and started singing her rock a bye baby, I started to believe I was having a heart attack. Feelings of panic and paranoia set in almost instantly, as I felt like I was dying. Tunnel vision, constricted airways, tightness in my chest, rapid heartbeat. My wife immediately understood what was happening and managed to calm me down. After that dreadful experience I made a promise to myself and my family I would never do that again. I didn't want my daughters early childhood memories to consist of her dad getting high to the point where I couldn't function. What would follow, would be mentally one of the hardest things I've ever had to perform in my life.

When my sobriety adventure began, I had just about every symptom in the book. It was very difficult for me, because I never experienced drug withdrawal before. I started using weed as a substitute for drinking alcohol. I did not research anything weed related. I went in blind and came out an anxious wreck. So those feelings of withdrawal I was having was very foreign to me. I always felt like I was one step away from a psychotic breakdown. One night, my family and I went to Sonic for dinner. I remember sitting there eating our food, we were laughing and enjoying each other's company. I remember staring at my daughter as she was making a funny face, and I felt this weird brain zap. I felt disoriented for a minute and shortly after that, my mood spiraled downwards. I played it off when my wife asked me what was wrong. Later that evening I started googling my symptoms and discovered my body was going thru weed withdrawal, which led to the discovery of this group. 

It was right around the 6 month mark when I started feeling progress. My brain started to mellow out, I was sleeping better, and my mood was stabilizing. I had bouts of PAWS around the 8-9 month mark, and very briefly into the tenth month. I still get anxiety and the very occasional panic attack but they are very manageable, and I've learned to deal with them appropriately. I can probably attribute those issues to the absolute depressive state our world is in currently.

Presently I feel great. I had some constructive and supporting people that helped me thru my early recovery. Sometimes I would feel ashamed because I would read where people were saying weed withdrawal wasn't real. I would see people mocking withdrawal as ""you just can't handle weed bro."" It made me feel isolated and not validated in my feelings. I was initially hesitant to go to other people for help regarding my issues, because I was afraid I would garner that same reaction. Thankfully I was wrong. Im proud of myself for maintaining my sobriety during this crappy pandemic. I have learned to be more cordial to my body, both mentally and physically. I have surmised there is a lot I need to work on. Becoming sober was the first step. I need to work on my communication next, and as soon as this pandemic is over I want to go to the gym regularly.

Thank you all for reading. If I could offer any advice, cut out or lower your caffeine intake. Your anxiety will thank you. The energy drinks I consumed was fueling my anxiety. Be compassionate to your body. Meditate, go for walks/runs, sleep, go outdoors and into nature, work out at the gym, etc. Writing down how I was feeling helped too. Detail your journey so you have something to look back on. 

I will continue to read this sub and participate in any way I can. Love you all.

2020-12-26 14:11:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kknyix/110_days_mental_health_does_return/,110 Days - Mental Health does return,"It's been a struggle - I'm not going to lie.  
I've been a heavy smoker since I was a teenager and as such I have to accept that I'm not getting better overnight. Smoking while your brain is still developing appears to cause more problems than those who abstained until later life.   

Anyway the borderline psychosis, depersonlisation, intrusive thinking, anxiety and apathy all seemed to have settled over the last week or so.   

Things that have helped my recovery:  

1. Meditation - I decided to get serious about this. Instead of half assing it I've brought 'the mind illuminated' and I'm working through it slowly. I'm making sure I meditate every day and it really helps with overwhelming thoughts and cravings. I'm pretty sure I would be using right now without this tool.  

2. I've gone gluten and sugar free. Turns out it's not just a 'terrible' diet that can play havoc with your health, but even a mediocre one can too. I'm sticking to meat and veg, and no processed foods at all. This decision was off the back of a food intolerance test. 

3. Limiting caffeine - Green tea only for me know. It stops the lethargy but doesn't give me the anxiety coffee did.   

The point I'm making here is - quite often you can't just stop smoking and expect everything to just get better. It doesn't work like that. Sobriety gives you the mental clarity to make other life choices which can improve your life. Of course quitting is the first step but after the initial withdrawal, real change needs to happen. 

I still have a long way to go. I still have nightmares involving relapsing, and my mind still gets stuck on 'looping stoner paranoia thoughts' but they are MUCH easier to deal with.  

Feels like I've lost 20 years of my life but hey ho - what's done is done. We only have today.  

Good luck on your journey everyone",71

2020-12-26 13:52:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kknmlg/one_week_sober/,One week sober!,"TLDR: addicted to pot and smoking daily since 2016 but I've finally managed to quit for an entire week!  Never want to smoke daily again.

I posted on here five months ago about how I was struggling to quit and still smoking daily.  Since 2016 I have been addicted and dependant on marijuana.  I've tried to quit so many times.  I quit for exactly four days before smoking on July 4th to celebrate.  Before that I intended on quitting for a LONG time but I ended up falling right back into my addiction.  I've smoked several times a day every single day since July 4th...up until last week.

First good news is that my girlfriend and I are back together!  We've been together for over a month now and it's been going really well.  That is until I kept smoking a strain that I wasn't reacting well with.  I smoked it for about four days and on the last day I ended up punching myself in the head while having a mental breakdown.

After this I made an agreement with my girlfriend that I'm going to quit.  I promised her that I'm going to get this under control.  I'm promising myself too that I'm going to get this under control.  I can't believe I've made it an entire week without smoking.  This feels like a huge accomplishment.  I would have a hard time imagining myself not smoking everyday.  I felt like I could make it a day or two without smoking but there's no way I could make it a week.

I'm not going to stop smoking forever but I do want to stop smoking daily.  I never want to smoke daily again.  It ruins me.  Now is my chance to be better for good.  

If you are trying to quit it is crucial that you identify why you need to quit.  You'll use those reasons to combat the temptation.

I have a lot to talk about but I'll leave it at that for now.  I'll post an update later.  Stay strong everyone!",16
2020-12-26 13:38:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kkne5a/another_turn_of_the_wheel/,Another turn of the wheel,"Hi everyone,

I’m on my 5th or 6th attempt to quit now since 2015, Day 3! I have smoked regularly since 2011 and realized it was a real problem for me back in 2016, when I ended up stealing weed from my roommate to try to cope on the day my parents got divorced. 

Despite that, I smoked all the way through grad school. I am highly functional and was a star student, despite being absolutely miserable and without confidence or long-term goals. No one can decide whether you are healthy except you, is what I learned. 

I tried to quit again after visiting a friend in Mexico City who had started to grow his own. His home was a shambles and he told me he would worry for hours a day over whether or not the cops would smell it from outside. His work and interests weren’t progressing and I could see the mirror image of this in my own life. He had brought his partner and many of his friends into a circle of dependency on those few plants. I was shook by this and made another attempt to quit.

All this time, even now, the circumstances of my life have felt too stressful to deal with without pot. I have been conscious that this is a kind of chicken-and-the-egg problem, where weed was giving me a way to cope with the stress but also caused many other ones, like having low motivation, isolating myself, being paranoid that others held negative opinions of me, and being short of money to spend on things I enjoyed (except for weed). 

I think most harmful was that I have always struggled to feel I had something valuable to offer of myself to others, and weed is what I used to address that. Rather than having to be known by others and deal with the ongoing problems that are part of having connections and relationships, I had pot, and anyone who cared about me enough could prove it by working around it. Many have, and I am grateful for how much I have been loved, but I have lost or abandoned other relationships as well, and sometimes the sadness of knowing this is enough to push me back to smoking, as if I could validate all the sacrifices I’ve made for my relationship with weed if I just keep going down the same path. It his hard to face. 

The struggle gets exhausting. If I have learned anything from my other attempts quitting, it isn’t going to go away or necessarily get easier. Part of me is very bitter for the experience of life being so unrelentingly difficult, and that humans are capable of being so negligent and hurtful to one another. When I stop smoking, I have to face negative emotions and feelings that don’t seem to have a limit, like an ocean of sadness with no ocean floor. An abyss. 

I don’t think that my life is singularly about dealing with this sadness, but it has been an enormous part of it. When I feel resentment towards this, thinking that others have it much easier, a smoke has provided me an escape to a more peaceful place. I’m grateful for this, but now that I have grown enough to balance my values, I know I can live in this peace while being without. 

In my mind weed allowed me to be a gentler and more patient person, but this is simply not tru. I am a gentle and patient person when I take the time to dress and heal my own wounds. When I thought of weed as medicine, smoking felt like loving myself and alleviating the pain. But but when I consistently choose escape for myself, I lose connection with the reasons that things hurt: that I care, that I love, that I have desires, and that I have suffered disappointments and setbacks. 

I am here, in this experience, and these things are part of it.

Wishing you all well on your way, thanks for your posts.",4

Last month I just kind of stopped. I had been thinking about trying to restrict my consumption, or just stop all together for a while. One evening I just kind of decided not to partake, and now it’s already been over a month. I don’t really even have a strong desire to smoke again.

But the weird thing is that I thought stopping would make me procrastinate less and be more productive in my life. But I actually feel like I have less motivation to do things then I did before. Before I had weed to blame for that. If I lost a whole day it was because I was stoned. Now I lose a whole day and I really only have myself to blame. 

I thought stopping would make me feel better, and while I don’t have a desire to start again right now, I don’t really feel like my life has gotten better over the past month.

I don’t know if anyone has any advice or can relate, but any sort of thoughts would be appreciated.

I used to be one of those people who would roll their eyes at the word meditation, thinking it’s some hippie thing people do and it would never work for me. But trust me, go on YouTube and type in meditation (I highly recommend Aaron Doughty) and see what a difference it makes. Aaron Doughty also has other videos that have helped me a ton on this journey too, he helps you “expand your consciousness”. I found him because of a video in which he explains why he quit weed and that’s when I started exploring the rest of his videos.

Long story short, I got into weed with a couple good friends during quarantine because I thought why the heck not, I've worked hard to get a great job and lifestyle but never done anything outside this blueprint so I thought that now is finally time I get to ""experience"" life for the first time through weed. 

Well, that only once a few weekend thing turned into me using it every weekend before bed, then it turned into every night before bed, then eventually turning into me smoking everyday, multiple times a day for 9 straight months. 

If it wasnt for my upcoming wisdom teeth appointment, I wouldn't be here right now. Because I wanted to make sure I'm fully under during my appointment, I was told that I should not smoke 2 weeks prior. Well just to be safe I start at the month mark. 

Today is day 7 for me. I never imagine how hard weed have affected my life. My withdraw symptoms are originally the reason why I consider myself to be addicted. I was very emotional this past week, lots of stuff that I've put off have come bubbling up and the worst thing for me is the inability to sleep. This is my second night during my first week that I'm unable to fall asleep. But what really broke me is my gf telling me how I've been treating her since I started, it really sadden me knowing that I let the person who believes in me the most down.

So I wont give up no matter what. I want to be a better boyfriend to my gf, better son to my parents, better role model for my little brother who is addicted to weed, and better support for my friends in my life. So I will never give up, even if it takes all of me to beat this.

Its like I enjoy being brain dead,  eating a bunch of crap til I puke and then dealing with my worsening depression the next few days and repeat. I love running away from the world but at the same time, I'm so done with being high. Its taken me nowhere but backwards. It changes absolutely nothing. Why do I keep running back to shit that's bad for me and keep self destructing


I don't know what to do anymore",4

The withdrawals were very intense for me physically. Days of vomiting day and night, sweats, headaches, stomach pains. I couldn’t hold food or liquids down for days. Nothing i could do to help myself but pep talks and the vision in my head of the life I truly wanted for myself. I kept reminding myself that I was sick because of the weed, and that smoking to alleviate  my symptoms will just prolong the inevitable of another withdrawal later. So I hung on although I Literally felt like dying for those 100s of hours. So often I wanted to give up cause I just couldn’t imagine how I could actually live past this or get my appetite back but then today.. it came back!!! So I didn’t even have to miss out on my moms amazing cooking for Christmas 😁😁 So often this week I wanted to give up, especially cause I had no idea when it would get better. But I didn’t cave and noww holy I’m so happy I can’t believe I can eat fine again! Yeah I’m a bit foggy and obviously there’s mental aspects to quitting this I’m gonna have to tackle along with some sleeping issues too but to be done with the debilitating part feels SO FREAKING GOOD!!!!!!

Anyways I really want to say that if you’re going through bad physical withdrawals, HANG IN THERE! The end is right around the corner I swear!! Please don’t give up! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

This sub was my lifeline this week, thank you so much !!!!!!! Merry Christmas, Happy holidays :) !!!!!",19

I had a month clean a bit ago, then I was really stressed out and relapsed right back into being stoned basically 24/7 for about 6 weeks until today. Yesterday, I finished off a half-smoked joint (I was weening off the stuff) and then was up for like 30 hours and it was a rollercoaster all day.

I've tried to quit a few times in the past two weeks, but then the insomnia got me to cave a couple times, but this time I made it through and managed to finally fall asleep.

Today is day 1 with absolutely no weed. I feel pretty drained, mentally, but maybe I'll fall asleep easy.

I really just want better mental functioning back. I still perform well in my university classes, but I don't retain the knowledge.

Yesterday, I was looking at a thread talking about a book I've read. It was a good book, but I then realized that I couldn't really remember any of its details, even though I only read it like a month ago and really enjoyed it.

I have impulse control problems, but I just can't go through life being this mentally dull.",13

Life is hard, it's Christmas, and I feel like I have every excuse in the book to put off quitting. But I feel like I have a tiny new community to reach out to. Hi folks, I appreciate/need you. 
Today I woke up and cried, showered and cried, drove to work and tried not to cry (put on makeup to feel good I guess). I felt useful at work so that was nice, but had to come home and there it was again: all the reasons I have to give up and give in. Instead I came here and read that my emotions will settle and -what I want the most- my energy levels will return and mental clarity will come back. This gives me so much hope because I feel like a lifeless blob of shit most days lately and just use weed to be minimally functional. I miss old me: she was sharper and creative. Weed me just procrastinates creativity and trades in sharpness for numbing the pain, and numbing the good too.

He usually gets me my weed and we smoke together everytime we see each other while our wives watch the kids. I know tomorrow he’s gonna ask me if I want to smoke but I don’t have any weed in the house. He usually comes with a joint or something but I just know how he is. If I say no he’s going to tear into me and call me a pussy and put that peer pressure on me. I don’t wanna start over from day 1 again cause I know I’ll feel guilty and the cycle will continue and the last 5-6 days will have been for nothing.

How do you respond to someone who asks you to smoke when ur really actively trying to just be clean for a little while? I can’t say I’m done for good or I’ll never smoke again bc I know I prob will at some point. I never wanna go back to 3-4 times a day every day but I’d for sure like to make it at least 60 days. But by then there will be no point to smoke if I can just keep going to build myself up.

A woman I started seeing (who is incredibly tolerant) asked me simply: “why do you smoke?” She had no intention of getting me to quit (or she is very clever).

And the only honest answer I could come up with? “I don’t know how to cope.”

Before this conversation I was sneaking out to my car on the days I stayed at her place to toke up. I’m 37 and I was sneaking down to my car like an addict (and like I’ve been doing since 8th grade) to smoke every 2 hours, without fail.

One night I just sat there and thought: what the hell am I doing this for?

Anyway: I’m on day 6 and I swear to god I’ve never had a tougher time expressing myself in my life. Two days ago I began to cry for bo discernible reason and had an extremely visceral feeling of loss, sadness, and crushing anxiety which sounded a bit like: “god, I literally suck at everything. I’m good at nothing. I just want to quit.”

I simply CANNOT gather my thoughts, or my words ... I cannot concentrate at all. Like a dense DENSE mental fog. 

Is this normal? Did I smoke for too many years to reverse this symptom? Because this is hell. 

Today (Christmas) she is at work (she’s an emergency room nurse) and I’m sitting here and had the most intense urge to smoke of my entire life. 

I thought rather than try to find the dispensary that is open on Christmas, I should try to find a place where other “quitters” are hanging out. 

I do NOT want to smoke again. Weed is such a bad friend. Anyway, could use some support, I guess. Although it makes me feel a little silly to say that.

Thanks for being here, stoked I found this sub.

A tip which has helped me and others quit nicotine, drugs, food etc. Remember when you get a craving it only actually lasts for 20 seconds to a minute. What makes it go on and on is that we revisit the craving in our minds constantly. We keep picking the scab so to speak.  When you feel a deep craving....immediately switch your thoughts to something entirely different. The craving will return...again, switch your thoughts. You truly can control your cravings.....your mind gets sick of serving up the cravings as they are eventually serving no purpose. They become weaker and weaker. This helped my 81 year old mother give up cigarettes. It has saved my ass several times. You are stronger than your mind. Think about it.

The herb was like a mistress that I could no longer fuck. Excuse my candidness but I must keep it G. I had to let her go before she ruined my relationship because there was no successful future with her. Though she was so fun and turned me into this different person in her presence, it was just a mirage in the desert of my true desires.

Just reflect on good times but hold the reality of the now and the impact it would have to try and make that old friend new again.

Today marks my 71st day of sobriety (since Oct. 14). I really don't have an idea on what's going on in my body since the day I quit smoking weed cold turkey. I did some research and found out that I'm on a withdrawal and PAWS process. The first month is kinda hell and horrible. The anxiety, depression, panic attacks, chest pains, heart palpitations and the list goes on were so horrible. But now, it seems like my anxiety subsides. I don't even drink alcohol because of fear. But since it's Christmas, I drank 4 bottles of beer. 5 minutes after midnight of Christmas Eve,  I got a panic attack. But this time, it just lasted for awhile. I believe panic attacks also subside since it only lasted for awhile, not unlike my first week or month.

I got 2 questions guys which I need to know, for my peace of mind. :)

First is that, what are these withdrawal/PAWS symptoms? 

Second is, is it ok to drink some alcohol while on withdrawal/PAWS?

PS: I'm taking a beta blocker to prevent this heart palpitation, which I am worried the most.

Thank you in advance guys, any response will be deeply appreciated. Merry Christmas again!",9

So things have been getting better. I went to tons of doctors this past month (because I had been eating well, working a 9-5, and excersizing consistently and my symptoms didn't improve). And I finally found a good psychiatrist that didn't just want to stick me on antidepressants. I got put on a mild sleep aid and for the first time in a long time I've been sleeping the whole night (most of the time). I'm making progress and starting to think I don't have brain damage. I still feel a bit slow and my memory still isn't the best but hopefully that continues to improve in the coming months. I still have deficits in cognition but things are getting better. I have hope and my doctor says in time and with the right routines I can expect a full recovery. I had serious fears for my future and that made me feel much better. Stay strong and feel free to message me. I had the worst withdrawl symptoms for months I thought I was dying. I don't know if science backs up PAWS but some sort of protracted withdrawl seems to be very real.
Until next month",17

Started smoking at 20, now 37. I could probably keep going. If all that’s true, why do I feel so guilty anymore and why am I here writing this!?

Went on vacation with the family for a week, no issues. No smoking when I travel for work or pleasure and don’t have a problem without it.

But when it’s around (ie in my shed)...it calls me. Day 3 for me, probably the 15th time over the years I’ve tried to stop. Made it over a month for a drug test, other than that a week is probably the longest. 

Sorry for the rambling...not sure what my point of this is. I think I want to stop, but I think I’m going to miss it. The smell, the process - I think I like this more than the actual feeling, and certainly more than the bag of chips and guilt of eating as much as I do.

To be honest, Christmas Eve is making me really want to get high. My family all drink and get high, and part of me thinks that I’m missing out. There used to be all this excitement and joy, and weed was the icing on the cake; it amplified the moment. I had lost interest in all holidays by the time I was 13, and now I’m 27 and feel the same way. 

I have posted before about this, but I am starting to relapse into a depression. I feel it, and I keep telling myself I’m going to change course, but I’m too tired to do much lately. I just want to lay in my bed, and snuggle my sugar gliders. I am having trouble taking a shower everyday, it’s starting to take a lot of effort to. take care of my hygiene, and do what I need to. I’m starting to sleep more, and I’m also becoming less motivated at my job. 

There is a part of me that can’t wait for life to be over. I’m not suicidal, but life is definitely long.  I’m tired of the rollercoaster, but I know if I get high the rollercoaster will get worse; and I will become suicidal again. I don’t see a point of torturing myself with suicidal thoughts when I’m on the fence about doing it every time. 

I know my life will become unmanageable if I get high, and I wish there was a way for me to get high without consequences. Sometimes I have to re-accept that I’m an addict on a daily basis, but it’s really difficult to do- especially today. 

I just can’t delude myself into thinking that being sober is the greatest thing ever. It has its good moments, but it definitely has its bad ones too.",2

Before I hit the 3 month mark a man was shot 5 times right in front of my house.  I looked outside right after I heard the gunshots and watched him stretch his arms out in his last movements before stumbling into the street and falling down motionless.  I called 911 as I watched him bleed out and die.  It was the most horrific thing I've ever seen.  I was first on the scene and first to call 911, with my beautiful girlfriend at my side.  

Since quitting weed I had been getting dreams again in my sleep, and after this incident the dreams turned into nightmares.  I'd see his bloody face in my dreams and watch him die all over again.  I'd fear for my life as the shooter was trying to kill me next.  Shooting through my windows or trying to kill me in parking lots.

Not even this was enough to push me back to weed.  I've been getting help for the PTSD that I've suffered.  Have turned to reading books, watching shows, playing Mario Maker, and confiding in my loved ones.    Have had some therapy too, and can't believe that even after that I didn't turn to weed.  

Not only that, but I haven't had a drop of alcohol or any nicotine since I quit weed.  The last few months have been hard as a completely sober man, but I've stayed strong and am getting stronger as time passes.  Now if only the headaches I've been having since the shooting would go away.  

I love you all, remember that no matter how hard life gets you don't need to turn down a path of drugs and it's actually much better to cope by finding healthy alternatives that don't involve being in a weed coma.",91

I first started smoking last year in November when I was about to be 15. I got scammed all of that shit, then that continued till I found a plug that's serious.  So depending on the week I don't smoke much. It could be 3 times in one week, 1 time in one week or 1 time in a month. Even though I'm a light smoker it's kind of effecting my life. 

So even though weed is good it can cause anxiety and stress but not from the weed it's self from your situation. Because I'm not 18 and still live at home I have to go through a shit show to smoke it. Getting it from my plug is the easy part and that part isn't a big deal. It's having to hide the weed, hide the shit I use to smoke like my pipe etc etc, hiding anything that has residue on it to throw it away. 

And all of this causes anxiety. But if I was 18 and even if I lived at home I'm an adult I wouldn't have to do the full shit show. I would have more freedom to leave whenever I want. I did get raw papers as a gift and ideally I would roll inside then smoke in the garage and come in whenever I wanted to and not worry about if my dad is gonna be awake, and if my dad's awake but my dad is still in his room. I have a security camera homemade but it's just gonna tell me if my dad is outside his room thats it.  

Also I love when people be like ""weed is a medicine"" yes it is but it shouldn't be an excuse not to get a job, to get fired from a job, to get kicked out of school because you showed up high. People are saying weed should be treated like alcohol which means not showing up to school/work high. Just like with alcohol you can't show up to work drunk at most places. So should I quit?",3

I saw a post that said any lurkers should open up, so here I am to tell you all my experience: why I started, why I quit and my experience during the quitting phase. This is especially for those still debating to quit or not and are having a hard time letting go of weed. This is going to be quite a long post, but please stick with it!

Why I started:

The first time I smoked weed was when I was 20, after one of my best friends told me to try it. Ngl, the first high was one of the best moments in my life. We were laughing over stupid shit that wasn’t really that funny but just the memory of it all was hilarious. For the next 2 years I smoked like once or twice a week, and everything was really good for awhile. This drug made me feel so good and made everything so much cooler. I really love music and it made music x10 better which was really cool too. Part of me will always remember this era of my life. I don’t regret this phase of my life, weed really opened my mind up and gave my self awareness and more appreciation for more things like nature and music. It also made me become more empathetic as well and helped me realise I had anxiety and cooled it down for while (more on that later). It felt like weed will always be there make my life better and was great to have to unwind after a hard day at work. Being young and blazed was so fun and everyone around you was doing it too, so I saw no harm in what I was doing to me over time.

When it became a problem:

Over time, as many of you have experienced as well, my habit got out of hand. I eventually started smoking daily and built a habit of expecting to smoke at the end of every day. Me and my friends found a really nice open beautiful spot that allowed us to smoke freely and mess around, so it became a habit to go there everyday. Smoking used to be some kind of reward after getting my shit done, but after awhile I’d start skipping shit like gym and studying just because my friends would hit me up to smoke. I would smoke with my friends every time at that spot before we’d go somewhere and then come back to smoke again after. I don’t know about anyone else, but when I get high I can't do anything else for the rest of the day. There were so many days I’d get high by midday and the day would essentially be over. I'd wish I was one of the those productive high types but I wasn’t, I would just become a couch potato. I would also look forward to listening to music and watching TV only when I was high, and if I was doing these things sober I would always think of how much better it would be high. I would see spots around my city and be like damn that would be a good spot to smoke 😂. 

This is when things got a lot harder. Overtime, my highs became really bad and I’d spiral into negative thoughts. I would get intrusive thoughts and become super critical over everything. My friends, the people passing me by in the street and most of all, myself. I would become super spiteful and would start trusting people less and less. I would chill with my friends and start to nit pick their flaws. I used to  feel so bad because I knew this wasn’t me but the thoughts were so hard to control. One thing I noticed was well was my anxiety was super crazy at this point in my life. I’d always be super paranoid about getting caught high, people looking at my red eyes and my family catching me as well. It made me want to avoid crowded areas and avoid going into any stores where I’d have to talk to anyone working there. I became a lot more “hidden” if that makes sense. My brain was so cloudy and I could never think straight. I'd doubt myself and my self-esteem plummeted. I realised over time that if I was making myself feel this everyday, It would eventually become a permanent state of mind.

It’s really weird to say, but for me weed actually helped me realise I had anxiety, but then took that anxiety and cranked it up so much to the point I felt frozen. I started getting random aches all over my body, intense back pains and I couldn’t even sit down while I was high. These were all clearly underlying issues I had to deal with that maybe weren’t to do with being high. For a drug that's meant to chill you out, it was doing the opposite. I decided to just put up with it and deal with the risks I was putting my mind and body through. Every high was 50/50, some good ones and some terrible. It wasn't always bad and that's why I stuck around longer than I should have. I still loved it so much and wanted to recreate the initial perfect highs I used to get. I didn’t want to quit, and certainly with it being all around my friendship groups I didn’t want to miss out either. All my friends, even ones I hadn’t seen in years started smoking as well and we could socialise over it. So for 2 years more I carried on smoking, even though my body was “telling me” not to. Funnily enough looking back I wasn’t even doing it for myself and my own enjoyment anymore. When I’d get high I’d always tell myself I want to stop, this drug doesn’t serve me anymore but when I was sober all I’d want to do is get high just to pass the time. It was a really weird time this phase. Everything was cloudier and I was going through something but I didn't know what. For 2 years I knew it needed to quit to get better but with me not wanting to give up and it being all around me in my friendship groups, I couldn’t escape it. I can call it peer pressure or call it boredom, but at the end of the day I still made the choices to carry on and I wasn’t ready (and strong) enough to quit it just yet. I was definitely addicted but didn't believe I was. It's funny how the people who say it's not addictive are the ones who are addicted to do it. I can see it now in all my friends who I used to agree with. Looking back, I spent 2 years smoking more than I should have. 2 years of anguish that my brain and body really didn’t need to go through. 

Why I quit: 

On to the quitting part now (finally 😂). It’s funny, but after 2 years of my body “telling me” to quit, one day I just did. I had a conversation with a close friend while we were ironically both high and he told me as well he doesn’t know why he gets high anymore, it doesn’t bring him the joy it once had. It just fills the boredom and wastes time at the end of the day for him since he had nothing else to do. It’s funny but after 2 years I telling myself to quit, all it took was the experience of someone else to finally make me quit. I think people are really comparative and seeing yourself in other people can help you understand something more than you can alone. His experience helped me realise how much shit I avoided as well because of smoking, all the gym sessions I’d skip, books I wouldn’t read, family time I avoided because I couldn’t be around them high. It was making me miss out on what real life was actually like and at this point I had just turned 24, I just felt like a bum. Weed is all fun and cool when you’re 20 but when you get to a certain age it becomes kind of sad. I don’t want to shit on anyone who still smokes, I’m happy for them as long as they are happy with it, but for me struggling to go a day without smoking and building your life around it becomes is kind of sad. Needing to get high to because you can’t enjoy your sober life enough isn't how I want to live anymore. I don’t want to be that guy.

I started to realise how fast time flies and how going to the same spot everyday wasting 3 hours of your life to get high was hindering me. It’s funny but I was passing my ""amazing"" spot last week and I realised how shitty it actually was. Being high just made it look better but in reality I’ve spent maybe 500+ hours somewhere that has had no real value for me or my growth. I came to realise how negative this drug actually was for me, it was wasting my time and energy. Having to worry about getting caught, spraying yourself endlessly and chewing gum all to hide smelling and looking high. It all becomes too much effort after a certain point. It would also numb me, make me waste the days, make me comfortable being bored doing the same things, letting life pass me by and wasting my energy instead of using it to do better things. I know some people are capable of balancing it better and still be productive while they are high, but that’s not me and I have now come to accept that. 


Quitting phase: 

After that conversation, I started reading up more and more on the bad effects of weed. I found this subreddit that confirmed so many issues I had and how so many people were also having them. The anxiety and paranoia etc. I finally decided no more. It's been a month and honestly so much has changed, good and bad. I used to smell weed in the street and take it all in, now I can’t stand it and have to cover my nose if I smell it. It’s strange, for something I use to love so much I developed an incredible 180 hatred for it within a few days. I can now see better the negative effects it had on me so much clearly now.

The good: 

The good things are that I no longer feel as much brain fog. I don’t have to worry about looking or smelling high. I feel less unnecessary guilt and shame. I am more confident in my thoughts. I can breathe better. I can spend more time being with my family. I am more present. My mood doesn’t change so much. Real life is clearer to me and I am ready to take it on then just escape in some false reality. When I was bored, I’d go get high, now I can sit in the boredom instead of needing a quick fix. I’d rather be boring than be high now. When I’m feeling productive, I use that time to just run instead. I can even run more because I don’t have smokers lungs holding me back. I am more focused on myself and my future instead of focusing on my friends as much. 

The bad: 

Quitting obviously isn’t a miracle fix for all your problems, I am still prone to negative thoughts and being unproductive. I still have anxiety and can be irritable at times. It’s actually also been really hard with all the withdrawal symptoms. I don’t really feel like myself as much, I don’t really enjoy music or nature as much as I used too. A little light in me has died and I feel kind of empty, BUT I refuse to believe that this is permanent. It’s just the motions of withdrawal phase. I still have cravings to get high and think it may help this but everyday I tell myself no. I still hang out with my friends but I don’t join in. I actually force them to play football and move more instead of sitting down at the spot for 2 hours since I can’t physically stand that spot anymore. If they tell me to meet them then there I refuse. I really don’t want to lose my friends but if I all they want to do is smoke everyday I may need to outgrow them, but only time will tell! 

Before getting one month sober, I tried going sober for 2 weeks before and then having 2 hits, thinking it maybe I can still smoke in moderation. I INSTANTLY regretted it. That high feeling just brought back all negative attributes I was once felt. So for anyone thinking a break or doing it in moderation improves anything, it doesn't!

Conclusion:

I am now a lot more stable mentally to deal with the underlying issues that I have and was hiding behind with weed. At least now I’m in the right headspace to deal with them. Quitting isn’t easy, you will have urges and won’t feel like yourself for awhile. If there is one thing I want anyone to take out of this, it's that please don't waste your time debating whether you should quit or not! That ALONE should be enough evidence to quit. Listen to your body, if any part of you is telling you to quit, than spare yourself the anguish and just do it! Don't torture yourself longer than you need to like I did. I hope this post acts as the same push my friend's experience gave me.",19

Ive had 2 suicide attempts (1 when sober and 1 using) - i am in a serious relationship that gets overwhelming cos im too needy. But whatever comes I will handle it sober.

Had an episode where i did not remember who i am and felt i was going crazy. Told my parents about everything, went to psych hostipal (just short visit for 1 hour). Feeling normal now. Read my previous post also to see the progression.","I think it started on day 7 of quitting weed. Day 1 - 6 i felt depressed, as i have been for a long time, but it was a managable depression for sure and i had my head straight, as i always have had. From all the smoking my paranoia and anxiety had gone through the roof. This is why i quit to begin with. The paranoia was more about mental things rather than physical things. The problem i had with the anxiety and paranoia is that once i had a thought i thought it was true and i could not loop myself out of it.

So on day 7 i was watching a movie with my parents. The movie was about whats real and what is not. So it sparked the idea in my head that ”what if this is not real right now”. Just a normal thought. Now sober me would have been, ofcourse this is real, and i didnt think about it more. But the paranoia made my loop that thought over and over again. It is important to notice that i knew all the time that this was reality, it was just the THOUGHT that keep looping in my head. ”Is this real”, ”are you going crazy?”, ”are your head voices schizofrenia”, etc. This made me think i was going crazy, and i have never felt so bad in these 2 days. I did not sleep anything the night between these two days.

I broke down and told my parents, told them i wanted help. It was middle of the night so we went to the hospital. The doctor did a diagnosis on me and everything was normal. No psychosis, no schizo, just forced thoughts. Once the doctor told me everything was fine after a real diagnosis process, EVERYTHING went away. I felt normal in the matter of minutes (but still beaten and exhausted. I get in to these INSANE mind loops were something surreal gets repeated over and over again. Before i had convinced myself i had heart problems because my heart was besting fast and hard due to all the stress and anxiety, but this has passed aswell.

Right now i feel very good and like my normal self. Im going to start medical care to treat my depression. Weed withdrawal is real. Will probably update soon again about my progression.",4

I have never been a lazy stoner, getting out and about early, walking my dog, working hard and having many hobies like surfing, wild swimming, climbing, hill walking and running. But my addiction has been slowly making me depressed, grumpy, unhealthy, lose touch with good friends and fail to give my fantastic girlfriend the love and affection she deserves. And family and friends more time. I was becoming a hermit. It has ruined many a party or festival when I lack confidence and am to stoned to talk to people and get paranoid as. Let alone the £3-4k a year wasted on a smelly weed. 

I have been irresponsible, being stoned when it's dangerous to be so - at work as a tree surgeon (responsible for the groundstaff lives!), driving, rock climbing etc.

I have always been stoned and dulling myself to the beautiful world and all the opportunity life has to offer. I have failed so many times trying to give up. But now after losing my driving licence, my job and almost my long time girlfriend. Having my 30th birthday and now finally kicking the tobacco, I think the time has finally come to say good bye to Mary Jane, the love and hate of my life. Good luck to me and all others addicted to this bitch.

Note. I'm sure a lot of the habitual addiction came from nicotine, being in the UK, like most others I mixed. I gave up tobacco two months ago (have been vaping since and slowly cutting back to evening only) (weed alone does not cut the mustard or scratch the itch) and only now has giving up weed seemed possible. I have learned to listen/look for how I HONESTLY feel deep down and not what chemical addiction and habits are telling me.",34

They now see this as me needing to be observed 24/7 by them so I can prove that I’m an adult. 

I told them “Sorry guys I’m 21, I’ll get a job and pay my own rent.” So I went and got a full time job a few days ago, and they flipped when they heard. “WELL WE ARE TAKING YOUR CAR SO YOU CANT GO BACK”

So now, I’m without a car, still on the hook for 6 months of rent, a job with no way of getting to it, and parents who legit want to start recording whether I’m: “ waking up on time, working out everyday, eating healthy, etc” They are so over controlling and the fact that they just took away the car that they gave to me is truly saddening to me. If this happens after just not passing two classes, I’m just scared that they will try to threaten me with the same shit anytime I mess up in their eyes.

It’s the middle of a fucking pandemic, so I didn’t do well in two classes because I’m not used to online instruction. I’m a mechanical engineering major for god sake, cut me some slack.

Along with this habit I’ve also gained 40lbs and have forgotten who I was a year ago. At first it was something I would use to unwind after a long day, until it became my life. All I would do for days on end is be high the whole day and consume whatever gave me dopamine: food, porn, tiktoks, staring at my screen the whole day, etc. After online classes or after doing an assignment/exam I would smoke right after as my reward. This habit unfortunately caused me to be the laziest, heaviest, and most unfulfilled I’ve ever been in my whole life. Not to say that weed is inherently bad, but it’s the way that I’ve been using it. It was a really really fun run and I loved the life of not giving a shit about anything and being a “real” stoner, but I’m sick of being lazy all the time and frankly feeling like shit.

What can I say. I definitely had a weed withdrawal that lasted like 10 days. And I am a firm believer in post-acute withdrawal syndrome. I don't miss it anymore--it smells foreign to me now, and reminds me of people being zombified. I don't miss the borderline psychosis anxiety from it either.

I literally took a dab before taking my pregnancy test because I was stressed over my missed period. Turned out even though I was on birth control I was in fact pregnant.

I just looked it up today: 169 days ago.

I've been lurking in this sub for a while, been trying to cut down / take a break for some time. Every time I try I have a really hard time and start again, worse than before. Finding some excuse. Trying to think of pros.

Truth is, I'm tired of being tired. I'm 23, been smoking on and off for the last 7 years but increasingly in the last 2 years. I feel like I don't exist. I have a lovely partner at home living with me, for the last 6 months, we'll be celebrating our 2 years in February. And I don't even feel present. I can function, go to work, do chores. But otherwise? I don't do anything. I'm high and I'm bored too, even while high. It's not even fun. I eat a lot due to munchies and being in some limbo world where I don't care about anything, but I have a history of an eating disorder... thus this gives me an immense amount of anxiety. 

I always want to find a perfect balance with weed but always lose control and end up quitting from fear of being fat. This time around however, withdrawal is so terrible. I feel I'll miss weed and always fear regretting choosing to stop. But I need to at least cut down or take a break.

Does anyone have some advice on how to handle the very beginning? And not somehow be fooled by your tricky mind in smoking again ?

Anything is appreciated. Thanks in advance,",1

It’s taken away a year of what is supposed to be our happiest time in our lives.

I’m in my second year of university and being forced to live at homed or the time being. My first semester at uni was great but academically challenging and I had been a straight A student my whole life without much efforts. All of a sudden I needed self motivation in school, so my grades and motivation slipped heavily. But then, at the end of my first semester I finally got with my current girlfriend that I had been chasing since I got there. I had three months of pure bliss! Great grades, fantastic relationship, and a really renewed sense of ambition I used to have as a kid.

Then this pandemic hit. At the time I thought “Thank god I’m getting an extra 2 weeks to catch up on school and get a break from these pretentious university students.” But then the months started rolling by and by the time I took a singular deep breath it was July. I had bombed my finals and gotten relegated to a less prestigious program and since my academics played a huge role in determining my self worth it took a huge toll on me. 

I had smoked a couple times in high school and had a couple friends who dealt so weed was a readily available vice for me to turn my brain and problems off. Another thing is that where I live it’s legal so those D.A.R.E Program propaganda where they said we didn’t know what we were getting was also nullified. So after I got kicked out of my program, I smoked twice with my friends and bought a throw away pen. I justified it by saying I was just doing it to be “not sad” but it slowly turned into a solution to sadness (which it most definitely is not lol) and I began using every other day before bed or any other times I was alone with my thoughts. Soon I started to tie activities like sleeping or playing games to pointless without being a little high.

I’m now 3 weeks into quitting and I’m much worse than I was prior to starting toking up. I feel less motivated because I feel as though this drug is an easy vice for me to go back to every time I feel anything negative. Another thing is that ever since quitting I’ve felt more hopeless about my life and feeling like I’m not going to amount to anything. I’m just gonna be lazy and turn to dank every time I encounter difficulty. I need better methods to deal with my sadness and that’s why I’m writing this post. Another thing is that being a man in my culture means lack of vulnerability and getting stuff out on an anonymous platform is helpful. This post is both a vent and a call for a bit of help dealing with sadness and this crazy cycle called quitting this drug. Thanks for reading, also thanks to this subreddit. It’s a great resource for people struggling with this issue which is a very real problem.

TLDR;
Life took downhill spiral after pandemic, turned to weed, I wanna know how to not turn to this in the future and deal with sadness using tangible methods",6

I've never made it this far since I began smoking chronically 5ish years ago. No tolerance breaks because whenever I'd try, I'd turn into an unstable wreck. I promised myself that once I'd earned my undergrad degree (finished last week) I'd quit smoking in order to finally get my shit together before my real life starts. Physically, my biggest struggles have been sleeping and eating. The reason I started smoking in the first place was due to relentless insomnia (since I was 11) which makes this a significant issue for me. That being said, I convinced myself years ago that I'd probably never succeed in quitting, too much mental illness and addiction in my family to be possible. 

I'm only on day 3 but I can honestly say I never believed I'd make it. There's still a long, uphill battle ahead but I definitely feel more powerful with a clear mind. Well, clearer...still just day 3. 

My own experience makes me really appreciate those of you who've posted on this sub with such optimism and support for those trying to get/stay sober. Thankfully I've enlisted the help of a therapist seeing as nobody in my life is willing to support me: If you've got the funds (or benefits if you're lucky) to do the same I would absolutely recommend it. Emotional support is more comforting coming from loved ones but receiving legitimate advice (+ support) from someone trained to know what to say can make a huge difference.

My (now ex-)girlfriend convinced me in March that I should reduce my weed consumption. I did, and until the beginning of October I went from about 5 times a week to twice a month. That was when I moved together with her to her family. I was really stressed out and pretty depressed in that time and then started drinking to escape. The second time, I drank was when I hit rock bottom and ended up in the hospital. My girlfriend broke up with me and I went into a psychiatric hospital for a week to get away from consuming. Since then, I have been sober. Her family let me live with them until I found an own place about 500 km away and moved out about four weeks ago. 
Anyways, the last few weeks I felt really depressed again. Instead of consuming, I now escape reality by sleeping awful lots (sometimes 15 hours a day). I sometimes think about going back into using again. In half an hour I will be watching a movie with my dad, like it's tradition with us and I feel like I can't resist hitting a bong there. I stored my last amount of weed at his and I know, he would even fill water into the bong for me. I know, it could easily lead into a major fallback, but the craving seems irresistable.

We started smoking daily together and just never stopped. Not much, 3/4 joints at night. But everynight and more on weekends. 

The first days have been hard, mostly at night. Anxiety, sweat, bad dreams. And the fear that our relationship is based on smoking weed. But deep down we know it's more than that. I never met my adultself weed free and I guess I want more out of life than relax and smoke weed.

I'm happy we're doing it together. The first parties will be hard though. Every single friend we have smoke weed. My gf wants to be able to smoke occasionally, I personally don't know if this is possible, if it will still preserve all the benefits from stopping smoking weed daily and I fear going back in the loophole. I also fear being bored/boring if I don't smoke as I'm not someone who enjoy talking much especially sobber. I don't want to compensate by drinking / using other substances. I'll have to try and discover my non smoking self at parties I guess!

After 5 days not smoking I can see some progress, yesterday I started reading a book out of being bored, a first since a very long time! Being bored has benefits after all!

So moral of the story : I know weed is deteriorating me. I am a avid smoker - for 4 years straight, everyday, more then 10 times a day. It’s just not giving me the spark I know I need to reach my full potential, if anything it’s holding me back severely. The numb, floating feeling I get after taking a hit or smoking a blunt consumes me and forces this idea that everything is okay, and nothing really matters as much as I may think. It’s been a cushion through everything that has hurt me the most and I guess this is why I’m so attached. It’s like a person you’ve fallen in love with, who makes you feel better when you need it, but you know they’re not good for you. You know they’re holding you back. I want to let go, and it’s hard to even think about coming from the same person who would actively attest to any ‘anti-weeders’ - “it’s just a plant” - “alcohol is way worse” - “it literally does no harm to you, why else would they allow weed for medicinal use” - “it helps me eat” - “it helps me sleep” every reason in the book for why weed isn’t bad, making excuses for it like a toxic boyfriend. Now I’m not saying it is bad, but I am saying that it is holding me captive in this cage I want out of so desperately, but the feeling of being high shadows all of the feelings of wanting better, knowing I can do better, but still getting high to forget about what I know I should be doing differently. It is MY time. I’m young. I have an amazing job - at only 21 years old by the grace of all things good, making more money then some grown adults in my own family. I can’t lose these opportunities, and blessings, and I am fully aware that the path I’m on now will not take me where I know I belong. Just looking back at how much father I could be in my life if I let go sooner stings. It’s stings bad. I’ve been set back for so long by my own doing and I’m ready to leap forward full force. I want to remember what it’s like to feel sober. Human. Me. Not only have I gained 40 pounds in 3 years, but have put my education on pause, lost many amazing friends just because they don’t smoke weed. Passed up ample opportunities to succeed because I preferred to stay home and smoke a blunt, to avoid the tension. I don’t feel healthy. My body deserves more. I deserve more. I’m scared, excited, worried, and hopeful. I not only want to stop, but need to. It’s time to let go, and explore all that this world has to offer me. I’d love to keep you all updated on this journey, And thank you for reading.",9

My main withdrawal symptom from weed is a really nasty upset stomach, I always just get nauseous with stomach discomfort and need to shit all the time - I can handle pain and the mental effects but I HATE nausea and it really makes it difficult to quit.

Feeling a little lost, help!","On the one hand, I love reading posts of people sharing the same struggles. I think there are tons of inspiring posts every day of people going sober for truly significant lengths of time and reporting massive improvements to their mood and anxiety, it definitely gives me hope.

On the other hand, I also see many stories of people relapsing after several years, and not just slightly relapsing but getting full-swing back into heavy half-year binges, and I get it, I really do, “addiction is hard, it’s a journey.” I get it. But I’m just sitting here feeling like, am I always just going to be on the precipice of addiction, one traumatic event or one bad week away from falling back into it? Is that what the rest of my life is going to be? Just constantly fighting my addict-brain when times get tough?

I read some of these stories and I start feeling like there’s no way out, and the addiction is just going to be looming in the shadows the rest of my damn life. Maybe that’s the reality and what it truly means to just take it one day at a time. Maybe that’s the price we pay for getting so far into it and throwing ourselves so off balance in the first place. This isn’t a great feeling for me. 

I’m not thinking about using or anything, I’m on day 22 and going strong. I’m overall feeling very good, massive improvements in mood and anxiety levels. But I guess in the back of my mind I was hoping that I could one day get to a place where I don’t even think about the fact that I’m sober anymore. Just living my life and completely taking the focus off of addiction and sobriety. But reading some of these stories, I feel like that is an unrealistic goal. I feel like maybe I will have to be vigilant and on-guard for the rest of my life. If that’s what it takes, that’s what it takes, it’s just a hard thought to have.

Can anyone relate?",11

Looking for advice.,"I'm on day 30 now since last smoking both weed and tobacco as I used to roll joints, and the first week was understandably rough. Over time things have improved but most days now I'm waking up and my heart just races throughout the day, my head is pretty tense all over and I've still got this buzzing/ringing sensation in my ears.

I went to a doctor and had my ears checked (which they said were pristine, no damage or inflammation whatsoever) and just put the rest down to stress, which it might be, but I feel like he kind shrugged me off and told me to come back in a couple of weeks if the ringing is still there. I'm also pretty anxious in general and I might be letting it get the better of me.

I've heard and read that cessation from weed can increase blood pressure and heart week within the first few weeks of quitting (as well as all of the other emotional increase on top of that due to your brain getting used to being sober again) but honestly, it currently feels like it's never going to go away and it bothers me most when I'm lying in bed trying to sleep, or having a moment to myself in a quiet place. I'm going for my blood pressure checked tomorrow just to be sure and rule that out, but I wanted to ask if anyone else has had any similar experiences with these kind of symptoms when quitting and if you have any advice at all?

2020-12-23 05:48:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kiqyrt/160_days_surprising_mood_change/,"160 days, surprising mood change","Man, over 5 years ago I started smoking which quickly escalated to all day everyday. After 30+ failed attempts, this one's worked.

Honestly, before I quit my life was such a mess, and I was a shell of who I used to be... hell, I didn't even remember what I used to be like... I remember 5+ years back being known as a guy who was always in a good mood and even when things were tough I never really got down. I was fortunate to never deal with depression or anything of the like... 

Fast forward a few years and my moods went from high to low. And I mean LOW. So low it was the pit of depression. Sometimes things would get so dark I'd hide away for a week or more in a sad haze. My previous motivation seemed like a long forgotten memory.

It got so bad that my house which I was renting was months behind and everything I owned was sold. The previously large 5 bedroom house had a tiny fold up desk, an office chair and a mattress on the floor... that was it! When ever I heard the gate open I thought it was the landlord, so I hid... He never knew the extent of my problem and I couldn't face him in that sate... god I would have reeked of it! This happened frequently... knock at the door and I'd hide in one of the dark, empty rooms, occasionally peeking out to see if they left. Then I'd go have another joint.  


Well, almost 6 months ago I quit and really the first month was an emotional wreck. I went from extreme anger, to sadness, to excitement, and then the littlest thing would set of a rage of crazy anger which is completely out of character. It scared me.

Things slowly started improving and tonight I was thinking ""wow, I'm happy, I have motivation and energy and even when things go wrong I don't let it faze me... I just brush it off.""  


I realized I feel EXACTLY like I did back before I started with this insidious habit, just a little more mature which is great. Hey, it took a while but I'm never going back. It's so nice feeling good all the time and not experiencing the debilitating lows I remember from earlier this year.

To all of you quitting, keep going, after 3-4 months things start getting SO MUCH BETTER. Merry Xmas!",35

I want to exercise for my health but I've lost so much weight from the lack of food I can barely walk to the other side of the house without needing a rest. I have tried smoothies and juices and they upset my stomach too. I can only really handle water or tiny sips of soda.

Just curious if anyone else took a little while to be able to stomach food again? I'm getting quite nervous about how I'm going to explain to friends and family why I can barely keep anything down on Christmas day.

Just wanted to note some of the positive changes!

-I’m much less reserved in personality than I thought I was.  I think smoking daily really dulled me down, and made me more socially anxious.  I’m feeling much more like myself, and I feel comfortable taking up more space.  Others have noticed I’m more upbeat and personable.

-I notice myself feeling much more present with my loved ones

-Waaaay less mindless snacking at odd hours of the night

-No weed hangover in the morning makes a huge difference in my energy throughout the day - helping me be much more productive

-I’m feeling my emotions - this is a good and a difficult thing.  My emotions are much more intense, and I actually have to work through them instead of instantly puffing them away.  But I believe this is extremely valuable to deal with, even though it’s been harder to handle than before.

I don’t plan on restarting the counter anytime soon.  Will perhaps update in some time.  If you’re struggling I want you to know the long term positive effects outweigh the short term struggles.",5

I’ve had a lot of different what I assume are/was withdrawal symptoms.

The main one still that I’m currently dealing with is anxiety. I recently went to a cardiologist to check on my heart cause I’ve been feeling it beat extra heavy, wore a heart monitor for two days this month and currently waiting to get an echocardiogram done early January. I’ve personally been wearing a fitbit so I can see my own heart rate just for health anxiety purposes, seems to help a bit.

Some days my anxiety is very manageable and almost not noticeable but other days I really suffer. Hoping now that I’m almost at 4 months I’ll start seeing the light at the end soon and I’ll get back to feeling more myself. 

Tonight I’m going through it with the anxiety being a little more intense but hoping that will pass with some sleep as I’m sure everything is fine with me and it’s just my mind trying to play with me.

Anyways sorry for rant wanted to vent and keep up on my journey here.

I'm new to this community, and I don't actually have a zero policy just yet, but will be when the new year begins, However, I haven't been a daily smoker for awhile anymore. I'm really close to a getting a new job starting January the 4th, so I didn't want to quit from high-all-day to all-time-sober all of sudden just three days before being at a working routine again. Anyway, that's it for the intro.

I was an exchange student in Netherlands five years ago, so I smoked everyday. In the end I had a total breakdown, where I ended up being afraid of diseases like ALS or Parkinson's. Eventually I was diagnosed psychotic depression. I had stopped smoking a little while before, so I had all the treatment there was without being treated as a drug addict. I know weed launched it, eventhough I'd have the depression anyway. I quit studying too. But I recovered from depression and anciett rather quickly, after like 8 months. And that's when I started smoking again. 

Eventhough I had recovered, I wasn't the guy who I was before being an exchange student. So my girlfriend broke up with me. She helped me through my depression, but after that we wasn't the same anymore. Yet I continued smoking, because I was working and always got a new job when decided to quit the previous one. I moved a lot, was restless. Then Covid took my last job 9 months ago. I wanted to take a break from working. Now, after almost a year, I've done shit during all this time. I dreamed about building my car further into a real camping vehichle. I planned to take long fishing trips alone. I planned to learn play drums. My drum kit is unbuild, my car has stayed the same over a year and I haven't fish this little during the year like...never. Why? 'cause I smoked a lot of weed. Well, someone should say not that much, but all the time anyway. I'm not THAT depressed anymore (trust me, I know the difference), yet, I have pretty familiar negative thoughts again. 

I've made a promise to not smoke again for atleast a year. I'm really close to getting a job again. But I'm worried, so I need your help.

I'm afraid I will regret being lazy during my 9 months of free time. 'I did nothing' is exaggerating, but there was endless amount of days of doing nothing. Most of them I was high, a lot of them I didn't do anything eventhough I was sober. If I jumped into working routine, just how badly I'm gonna regret those days? 

Please, cheer me up. I'm already dreaming about my next longer period of spare time. But this time, it will be all about hobbies and such. But that's like 1.5 years away. Please encourage me to maintain strength to enjoy working routine and being free of weed. I know by then, I won't ruin the vacation by smoking weed.

Who knew what's up    

With most in life.    
    
... 


From IT,    
 
And cooking apple pies.     

To carpentry and excersize.     

... 


But unfortunately, 


... 


Lots of times I just got high,      

And stayed up late to fantasize.     

'Bout all the things, I could be doing     

But never did, and felt like losing.     


... 



Losing life, and lots of friends.      

Losing passion, 't was quite intense.     



... 



The time had come, I needed change.     



... 


So I did.     

I quit. 



... 




Fuck the smoking, all the shit.      

All those troubles that came with it.      

It wasn't easy, not gonna lie.      

Lots of sweats and times I cried.       



... 




But in just 3 weeks, the following happened. 

- Got a contract in IT. 


- Registered at the chamber of commerce as a furniture maker/restoration. Website will be launched on Jan 1st. 


- Lost the dark cloud in my head, depressive feelings, the paranoia.


- Saved €500+


- And the very most important thing, I'm looking forward to the future again. 




I know my situation is not those of others, but after years of dreaming about cool stuff to do, I'm actually doing them. For sure, I do miss a full 9 hours sleep at moments, or coming home and being able to just go on stand-by for a bit. But the trade-off of having an overload in energy and motivation is so much better. 


Also kept hanging out with my still-smoking friends, and even inspired one to stop too. But I also reconnected with people who I lost contact with because I was rather high all the time, which is just amazing. 


Anyway, wanted to share my progress. It's still a long road to walk, and I have to watch out for the traps that will definitely still be ahead. But for now, I feel I can continue this.",11

I’ve got no one to actually talk with if it’s not about their problems. Weed’s the only friend I have, at least it’s always there in my down times when no one is. It makes me able to cope with this life which I don’t want to be in but I have to as it would be so selfish of me otherwise.

I've been wanting to quit since the first year I started smoking, back when I was 20, but the addiction enveloped me. My dad is an alcoholic, so I knew that addiction could be something in my future.

Fast forward to me at 26, I've become someone I dont recognize. I'm extremely awkward at times, I cant remember shit, I have horrible anxiety, my motivation is at an all time low, I'm always tired, the list goes on and on. I've stolen from people, cancelled plans, I've revolved everything around weed. I cant blame all of this on weed, but I do know that marijuana exacerbated my issues.

Because of all of this, I've experience a lot of shame and regret. I didnt think I could ever be proud of myself, because of who I've become, but I'm changing my mind on it.

I know I can become who I want to be. Its just going to take A LOT of work. Smoking for 6 years daily will take a toll on anyone, and I'll have to be sober for a few years at least in order to get back to being my authentic self. And I'm going to do it. 

This might only be the start of it, but I'm ready to take this ride and for as long as I need to so I can become happy with myself again.",4

2020-12-22 15:03:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kicuur/a_little_hope/,A Little Hope,"Hey Guys,

Just wanted to sprinkle a little encouragement as Today is my 6 months anniversary since leaving the most attractive friend I’ve had, Jane.  It’s been a wild ride to say the least, but to all those who have started the journey. Please keep going.

Will it be hard? Hell, fucking yes. Will it be worth it? 10/10 times, without hesitation. 

Full disclosure, I fell off the wagon and tried smoking after I had quit for 7 months before this anniversary (it took me 2 months to stop, and yes, it sucked), but forgiveness is the name of the game. Life is binary, and you either are progressing towards what you want or you’re regressing further away from that very thing. And regardless of if you’re on day 5, day 30, 6 months, 1 year, or picking up the broken pieces after thinking you can smoke again. (I’ve done this wayyy to many times).  YOU GOT THIS.  

And is there a part of me that wishes I could go back to smoking an 8th a day, isolating myself, and reacting to life as it comes? More than I’d like to admit. But you have to realize that after smoking for X amount of years (me, about 4, and I’m talking basically every day) that you have to break your programming, and create the muscle memory to do the opposite of what destroyed you. Feed the dragon that you know will pay off in the long term and have accomplishments along the way. And no, celebrating weed should not be part of that Bc I know you will feel remorse after you realize that cold turkey is your only route. Jane is a tricky Bitch (excuse my language ladies).

Fast forward to now, I have a beautiful GF inside and out. Someone who supports my journey, and even encourages my growth to not got back to the Ganja life. It is my longest relationship I’ve had coming up on a  year in a few days. My mental capacity is clear. I can perform under pressure instead of crumbling and looking for the next high to bypass the pain called life. And lastly, after letting weed affect a job that ultimately fired me 1.5 yes ago, I am in my dream industry working in the NBA. (Also my longest job, and no, humbly speaking, I’ve been previously successful at 3 other sales job. But I let addiction corrupt my job long enough that it happened at my job before this). Weed does not discriminate.

Life is tough and mines is nowhere close to all 🌹 but give up the control that you feel from addiction and allow yourself to get realigned to the world and feel every emotion. Thanks for anybody who made it this far through my rambling. I’m always here if somebody wants to talk. Please DM me....✌🏾🤘🏾",15

My dreams are more intense, but I expected that. Am I waking up from going off the weed, do you think? Are my lungs starting to clear out a little and that's why I'm getting the pain.

The reason I quit is because my lungs were starting to hurt, a lot, and I didn't want that. I guess I can't smoke like other people can. It really helped my anxiety from borderline personality disorder but it's not worth it if it destroys my lungs.

The longest was for 3 months about 3 years ago. I should've never went back but like so many... I really thought I could moderate.

Weed makes me shady AF. Unmotivated AF, over analytical, binge eat to the point of pain, isolate, has held me back from taking on opportunities I thought were too big for me (though my life has been quite good for the last 2 years... Even despite that I still smoked). I hate how it makes me feel now.

I'm definitely not sleeping well, crying at random, moody, irritable, random panic/anxiety attacks... So tired. Night sweats, hot and cold flashes. Seeing these withdrawals and finally making the connections to them for the first time ever.. Is enough to keep me straight right now. The last time I went months, I felt great! Clear and level headed, witty, social and having a very positive outlook on life. 

I pray I'll have the strength to not give in when the green comes calling again.

I should mention... I do workout daily at home, I meditate (when I smoke that falls to the wayside), I read, I take baths. I cook, I listen to music, I've done lots of therapy (which I am not interested in phone/ video therapy at all so that hasn't happened since March). All of that has been incredibly beneficial to my mental health but I still can't shake the loneliness. It's tough being single, living alone and essentially working alone too. I think that's what motivated me to keep it going with the addiction. 

Now though, I want to tackle what I've been running from. Hard feels and emotions from past traumas. This does not align with the life I have in store for myself. So much money wasted and my lungs have been burnt. 

Sending nothing but love to everyone and so grateful to have found this outlet! Thanks to anyone who's read this novel. Wishing everyone success in breaking this vicious cycle <3",4

3. I still live with my dad and am 30 next year because I had no motivation to move out.

4. Everytime I previously managed to quit, something good would happen in my life and I chose to ""celebrate"" by smoking weed, started smoking everyday again, and sabotaged it.

5. Its ruined all my friendships and turned me into a loner and a hermit.

6. It numbs me of all the emotions I need to feel to have a normal life.

7. I was embarrassed to be addicted to something I needed everyday to function.

8. It smells awful to anyone who doesn't smoke it.

9. PTSD is not cured by forgetting your problems, but processing and facing them.

10. It causes me extreme anxiety, paranoia, and depression, but in the moment makes me think it cures me of those ailments.

11. Once you overcome an addiction, to any kind of substance or crutch, it makes you a stronger human being.

And almost every night I smoke I try again with no success. I only smoke at night and it was only 2-3 times a week but over the last month or two it’s probably more like 5-7 nights a week.

I’ve tried before and relapse and I don’t know what’s different about this time but I’m determined to make it stick. I quit drinking last year for similar health reasons and that was actually a piece of cake. 

My wife is supportive but also hates smoking alone so she won’t exactly be my pillar through this struggle. 

So, here’s to quitting so I can have a long healthy future and hopefully drop the rest of this weight and look better doing it.",1

I was on a 24 year vacation escaping to far away places of no worries and don’t give a fks. When I became sober I had to learn how to face reality, and face thoughts. Most of the thought were unwelcomed racing horrific intrusions that contributed to anxiety.

When you become sober your brain becomes flooded with these thoughts that will seem to control your every being. I began practice and telling my brain to shut the fk up. When I woke up in the morning the first thing I would is say “NO not today brain! Even though I feel like crap “ You will not torture me today with un welcomed thoughts, no shut the fk up, I will practice thinking on good thoughts today “.

The more you do this the stronger you will become. You will begin to train and take back some control of your thoughts. Although I had days where the thoughts beat me like Tyson. I made sure the next day I rebounded back with exercise and positive thinking. 

Don’t let your thoughts beat you and invade your being. Fight back! Do what ever it takes to remain positive while going through the phase of withdrawals. Do some reading, exercise, puzzles, something challenging that flex and stretch those brain muscles. You can do it!",25

The once strong warrior looked down at the scale with surprise and more than a little disgust. 238.6 pounds. When did he let it get so bad? His belly hung out in front of him, reminding him that the signs were always there and he had just chosen to ignore them.

His breathing was laboured, his throat hoarse. His mind, once sharp and decisive, had been numbed to the point of near-uselessness. Just another hopeless clod, struggling to get through the day, with no end in sight. Where was this all headed?  A vapid, uninspiring life without any hint of fanfare or accomplishment, and certainly without any sign of the latent potential that had been so often identified by others and himself.

The road to this point had been paved with over-consumption. But it occurred to the warrior now that this had only been a symptom of a much deeper set of issues. A lack of discipline, a lack of focus, and a lack of belief in himself.

And yet, all hope was not lost. The warrior was still relatively young, and deep within him still laid remnants of the old hope and potential. A renaissance of sorts could still be possible. However, the road would not be an easy one. The problems must be addressed - starting with the symptom. Over-consumption. The root causes could be solved through an increased adherence to structure and a real commitment to change... but not with smoke and alcohol coursing through his body.

Time was running short. His mind and body had, against all odds, mostly hung on until this point. The foundation was still there, buried deep under the dirt and rubble of a troubled past. And one last run was within him to become the man he always knew he could be.",15

The fact that I managed to drag myself to work this morning, sober at that, is an accomplishment.

I’ve discovered my tendency to want to bite off more than I could ever chew in early recovery. I have all these great ideas of who I want to be and healthy habits I want to implement. 

But all that ends up happening is, I set lofty goals that end up feeling unattainable as my depression pulls me down. 

I end up feeling worse than I did before and wouldn’t you know it I end up with a joint in hand sooner rather than later.

Not this time.

I’m going easy on myself. 

I’ve set three goals each day and if I achieve them then I won the day. 

✅Stay sober
✅Drink plenty of water
✅Brush teeth

It probably sounds lame but if I can do those 3 things any other good thing is just a bonus point.

As I get better at this and these goals change to habits I can add more, but for now this is enough. And IM enough.

My mental health has been pretty awful this year having various life events happening in quick succession making life feel pretty overwhelming and a feeling that I’ve lost control of my life a little. When I’m at uni I smoke with my friends, when I’m at home I smoke with my siblings so I never really get a break.

I moved to the Netherlands for uni three years ago, one of the reasons for actually moving there was so I could buy weed at coffee shops, and smoke weed unbothered ( I came from a country where it is illegal, and the police always want to catch the stoners). I was never able to drop the habit while I was studying in NL, it was always so easy to get, all the friends were smoking at every gathering, I used to always smoke by myself to enjoy my dinner more. 

However, now I got home for two weeks, had to self isolate, and I am surprised how easy it is to not think about smoking weed when it is not in your proximity. My energy and focus levels have increased. I was never able to study for more than an hour without thinking about smoking that rewarding joint and chill with my gf. Now I finally am able to study and prepare properly for exams - my grades have gone up, I feel more clear-headed when having conversations with people, I don't spend 8 hours a day watching useless youtube videos that I forget right after finishing them. 

I am pleased with myself. My main concern is what is my relationship going to be with weed when I return to NL. 

Hang in there, I believe in you. 

Best,

2020-12-22 05:51:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ki33bs/day_100_a_worthwhile_journey/,"Day 100, A Worthwhile Journey","I have held off posting on here until I hit this milestone of 100 days free from smoking weed, which after almost 8 years of regular/every day use I consider to be a great achievement for me. Having lurked on this board for a while I figured I would share my insights to help you fellow dudes and dudettes take a journey you already know you want to take. I am a 28 year old man and I work as a Groundskeeper.

I had been thinking about quitting for a while, I knew my parents and girlfriend wanted me to but they didn't put much energy into trying to convince me, knowing that I was stuck in my ways. The first thought was when I was at the pub with my friends discussing one of their wedding plans. I said to the guy who's wedding it was ""Would you prefer me to go to your stag do or the hotel stay before the actual wedding?"" knowing I could only afford to save for one because I was buying more than an ounce a month. This made me think that there's more to be enjoyed than smoking, mostly on my own, in my room after work. The second thought came when I reunited with some of my friends from uni to go on a camping trip before the lockdown rules were tightened again. We all smoked a lot of weed together at uni, resulting in me not graduating due to smoking. I hold those days as some of my fondest memories I've ever made, we had a great time together but passing around a few spliffs that evening made me realise that I had taken this too far. I smoked half a joint to myself an barely felt a thing before passing it on to which only one or two tokes made a couple of my friends very high. I realised that I wasn't even enjoying it to the fullest because my tolerance was so strong. Therefore I was spending a fair chunk of my wages to smoke something that wasn't really working. The next day I packed up all my stuff, sold the last of my weed and downloaded a sobriety counter app and have been sober since.

I thought weed helped me cope with my depression and was a good way to unwind after a long day but it turns out that you can still relax without it, you just have to face the withdrawal period. Once you get that nasty period of time out of the way you will be surprised that you can enjoy everything you used to think you'd only enjoy high/would be better if you were high. As it turns out I still get depressive symptoms but instead of being numb and high I am able to feel my emotions for better or worse and actually process them. This has brought me closer to my family and my girlfriend who have stood by me through this period in time. My girlfriend says this is the best thing that I've ever done for myself and even though I sometimes have stressful or down days where I think a smoke might be nice I understand that clarity through sobriety is more important and fulfilling than smoking a joint. You may think it's helping, it might actually help with some problems but ultimately it isn't essential to survival. 

It might seem daunting knowing that you want to quit something that seems important to you, but to quote Miley Cyrus ""Your beliefs soon become your identity"" and that is what happened to me. I believed that weed could fix everything and I am now known as a pothead. All my friends are stoked for my achievement and it's great to be able to see them (when I can) and actually be engaged in conversation and know that I can afford to attend their important life events because some plant isn't a priority to me anymore. My priority now is sorting out everything that I neglected to achieve whilst spending almost the last decade stoned out of my mind. I'm in a place where I can improve my career, study on the side, use my free time to see friends and family or play video games, Lord Of The Rings is still fantastic when sober. I can enjoy everything that I used to think that weed made better but also benefit from closer relationships and clarity with both my positive and negative emotions, also I have saved a lot of money by not picking up more weed. I would trade that for being content just lounging around smoking weed on my own every single time. It might be hard at first but once you break through you'll realise life is easy to enjoy whilst sober and that you are able to overcome your obstacles without needing a doob.

I hope you find this helpful as I have found this board helpful in aiding me to quit.

Happy Solstice to me,"Today I took a hammer to my 2 foot glass bong I've had for around 5 years. It felt needed to commemorate the decision to admit I have a problem, and to do something about it. 

Somehow, over the last ten years or so I have learned how to EXPECT to be disappointed with myself. I watched so many endeavors of mine never come to fruition, and became used to the eventual loss of interest, lack of follow through, or lack of trying because it was too technical. It's not the kind of failure that you feel the first time full force, it's the kind that manifests after time and time again, I failed to meet the goals that I set for myself.

The last 3 years have had about 2 breaks, and both of them lasted less than 2 months. I always felt good being sober, and that my brain was operating at it's full potential, but I always felt the pull to come back to the complacency weed offers. I would rationalize it with all manner of thinking, and when I did return to smoking I said I would only on weekends, or only with friends, but no matter what I told myself, I would get back to my regular 5 times a day habit within 72 hours. No self control, none.

Today I just admitted to myself that I am not in control, and that when it comes to weed, I have literally no control. My breaks from smoking before were always tempered by the knowledge that I was going to be back to smoking on a certain day. That I just needed to endure long enough to get back to that point where I could have my figurative safety blanket back. That mindset, frankly, sucks.

I read something on here recently that really spoke to me. While I don't remember the exact text, the message was basically this: Quitting smoking is like being out in the cold and shivering at first, but then, after a few months, you realize that you have a jacket to put on, and that the cold harsh world is really a magical place when you have the right tools.

I'm sweating, I'm scared to REALLY be doing this, and also empowered. I know this is the beginning of a long road, but a worthwhile one that will allow me to  become a better person in the long run. 

I know a lot of people are on their first week in here. I just want you all to know that I feel you, I believe in you, and that I have already found a lot of strength just reading.

One thing I was just thinking, because I’ve seen many examples of it recently, is people who give up and don’t even try because things haven’t worked before. One big example is New Years. I see so many people saying “ah it hasn’t worked out before, so what’s the point of making New Years resolutions/ trying this year”. I think to myself “what a loser mentality”. Like I get it, it makes sense I guess. But thinking like that will not get you anywhere. What will it accomplish at all? I went 3 years accomplishing nothing. I “tried” many times to change my life and failed, always ending up in the same place the whole 3 years, but I still kept making attempts, some may have but very unsuccessful and half assed, but I’m glad I did it. I always hated myself for failing, but now that I’ve made some massive progress, I realize each of those attempts led to this successful one. Also one thing that massively contributed to me actually breaking through and actually making changes was quitting weed. After I quit smoking weed, it became so much easier to form good habits and stop bad ones. Long paragraph lol, but yeah it kinda makes me sad to see that, people giving up/ thinking it’s pointless to continue making any effort to change their life, which they constantly complain about. Maybe because I’ve been in their position and am here now. It feels good and I want them to feel it. A good amount of those people are my friends/ family so that sucks to see it Like. But not a thing I can do but let them know/ give my perspective.”",4

So I was a heavy daily smoker for 12 years or so. I ended up giving it up over a year ago with much success and I NEVER thought I would be able too. It got to the point where I was so desperate to get weed I was trying to find a way to ""steal"" money from my account that my husband and I share. 
It was very tough journey at first then things became better when my head was clear from the fog. 
I was actually happy with myself and happy with my life.   2020 was a good year for me, quitting the weed and getting pregnant and having my beautiful baby girl. 

Forward to 2 months after marking my 1 year completely sober, I relapsed. Maybe because the change in my life was so big, having a child. And I knew it's not about me anymore, i had a hard time accepting this. It was my choice to have a child and always wanted to but i knew i couldn't do it while being high every single day. 

Anyways I started again thinking I'd smoke a joint on the weekends for ""me time"". Well it didnt stay like that like must of us know. I started to lie about my usage to my husband, who always reminded me how great of a person iam without the weed. But by that time the weed had already taken over again and I was desperate to get more and didnt care what he said. I kept this up for about a month, I had a conversation with my husband and I had two choices, 1.give up the weed and continue my sober journey and have a happy family that I've always wanted. Or 2.give it all up and just continue to smoke myself stupid alone.

So I choose the first option without hesitation and I knew it was going to be hard again but I know I can live without it. I have 1 week in again but it still calls to me and it's taking everything I've got not to answer.

Thanks for reading and listening....stay strong my friends.",7
2020-12-21 15:12:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/khp5nz/motivation_to_stay_sober_during_a_pandemic/,Motivation to stay sober during a pandemic?,"27F - I discovered weed about 3 years ago and have been using it daily for about 2 years. I also have issues with alcohol, but have managed to lower my use to just weekends and in much smaller amounts. I don't think I could have done it without weed though.

I've been wanting to stop being dependent on weed for over a year now. In November I had my longest intentionally sober streak of 10 days, but I ended up caving because my depression got so bad. I have issues with self-harm when I'm feeling really down. Without weed, it's the only thing that makes me feel better. My substance-abuse therapist said she would rather I use weed than hurt myself, but I feel like weed is just a different way to hurt myself.

I'm unemployed because of covid and my city has been in lockdown on and off the whole time, so I haven't seen many friends or family the last 9 months. I live with my fiance, who is amazing, but he works a lot and I'm alone for the majority of the day and evening. I'm a really social person so it's been really difficult for me. 

I just can't find the motivation to stay sober when I have almost nothing going on in my life. Weed gets me through the day and keeps the really dark thoughts away. I know it's also contributing to my depression and anxiety, but I don't know how to break free of the cycle. I've been doing all types of different therapy for a couple years now, but nothing has helped significantly, and it's so expensive. I feel so guilty spending money on therapy when I don't even have a job. Weed can obviously be expensive too, but $50 of weed will get me through a month, while $150 gives me a 1 hour therapy session. 

I really, really want to start 2021 with no weed and no alcohol, but I don't know how else to cope with my depression and anxiety. I feel so ashamed of myself all the time, I feel like a useless waste of space. It's just so hard to stay sober when I'm unemployed and feel so hopeless about the future. I see other heavy weed users post here about going months or years without weed and I don't understand how it's possible.",3
2020-12-21 14:49:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/khopeh/day_1_and_counting/,Day 1 and Counting,"Hello fellow leaves,

For some context, i am 21 years old and have been regularly smoking since the age of 14 (with days/week long breaks here and there).

For the past couple of years, weed has been a detriment to my physical, emotional, and mental well-being. I simply haven’t enjoyed smoking in so long yet I could never find the motivation or desire to cut it out for good. 

With Covid and a lot more time on my hands, I’ve reflected on the year 2020 and realized how much potential I pissed down the drain just smoking and lounging all day. I had plans to pursue my music craft, lift regularly, read more, etc. etc. but the majority of days consisted of waking up at noon, smoking all day, watching Netflix and playing rocket league in hopes that it would distract me from the inevitable guilt and self-pity I was consumed with from being so fucking weak and helpless.

I’m selling all of my bongs and pieces and deleting all of my dealers off my phone. It’s been a long time coming but I am confident things will improve with time and perseverance.

I’m certainly not here to paint weed in a negative light. I know it serves many people well but it is currently an unhealthy toxic relationship like that ex girlfriend you keep running back to even though you know how things end up every time. 

Best of luck to everyone else on this journey and feel free to connect with me. Happy holidays!!",5

I’ve been oscillating between quitting and trying to foolishly build a healthy relationship with this drug for at least the past 5 years. My longest sober streak was 6 weeks. I’m certainly not letting my guard down to future cravings and depressive days, but this time I truly believe I’m getting out of this cycle, for several reasons.

1) I’ve COMPLETELY abandoned the idea of moderation. I’ve tried it SO MANY TIMES. It never ends well. Tried every strategy you can think of. It never works and I end up chasing the dragon back into daily heavy smoking. Einstein’s definition of insanity was repeating the same procedure but expecting a different result each time. I’ve abandoned my insanity.

2) This is two sides of the same coin, but I’ve given up on the idea of being able to enjoy the drug for special occasions. It’s just another stupid trick my brain is trying to play. There will NEVER be “just one time.” I’ve been down this road so many goddamn times, it’s time to face facts.

3) I’ve embraced alternative coping mechanisms and creative hobbies to fill the time and mental vacant space. It’s easy to give out this advice, it’s much harder to follow it yourself consistently. I meditate through cravings, and I used to think meditation was a bunch of hokey spiritualistic bullshit. It’s saving my life. I take hot baths and treat myself to good food when I’m feeling down. I’ve picked up music again and am working on committing to a stable practice/recording schedule. I’m consistently exercising again. No one can expect to quit successfully without finding alternatives to fill the time weed was taking from you. Boredom will drag you under eventually.

4) I’m learning to forgive myself for missed opportunities and trying to live in the past a little less each day. It’s truly an exercise in futility to dwell on your regrets. We are all simultaneously living three lives, one in the past, one in the present, and one in the future. Ideally the past should only be used to learn from your mistakes, not to punish yourself for them. I’m letting go of the person I’ve been, I’m ending the self-punishment. Similarly, you can’t spend all your time living in the future either; the future is for making plans, but if you’re always making plans and never spending time in the present executing those plans, it’s equally futile.

There will be hard days in the future, life is not a walk in the park, surprise surprise. But weed is no longer the answer for me. It has never contributed anything worthwhile to my life. Never. So why would I ever go back?",27

After my girlfriend of 5 years and I broke up six months ago, i knew it was time to change eventually but i fell deeper into the stoner lifestyle out of depression. 

There were other issues that caused the breakup (truthfully, it was the right thing for both of us, and we hold no ill will for each other) but my weed use was definitely a large contributing factor. 

I’m in a better place now: I’ve been seeing a therapist, exercising and taken up a couple new hobbies (drawing, comedy writing), but i have still been using daily. 

I’m with my parents at their house in Michigan right now for the holidays and I knew this would be the perfect time to jump off, but i’m worried about my identity. I’ve spent so much time high that i can’t remember how I was when I was sober! 

Right now i feel okay apart from an occasional craving, but I think that’s just because I still have weed in my system.

I’m just trying to take however I will feel in stride, but I do admit it is nerve-wracking to think about. Has anyone else who’s used weed heavily had the same type of fears?

2020-12-21 11:20:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/khkipa/1_month_clean_a_cloud_has_lifted/,1 Month Clean - A Cloud Has Lifted,"Hey everyone, I’ve (22M) been smoking for the best part of 7 years, for the last 2 or 3 I’ve been in denial about the negative effects the weed was having on me. 

I got to a point where I realised that I wasn’t getting a single redeeming factor from being stoned and that it was doing nothing but hindering me. Accepting that was really hard. I am a massive extrovert yet have become more introverted over time which I can definitely attribute, at least partially, to weed. 

Now a month after stopping, my anxiety has all but washed away. It was a lot of physical symptoms - being pretty much a given that after smoking even a little I would get a horrible tightness in my jaw and constricting feeling around my throat as if an elastic band was constantly being squeezed around it. My girlfriend would wake to me grinding my teeth in my sleep and it even got to a point where I’d wake myself up from it. 

The worst part though was the social effects smoking was having on me. I doubted even my closest friendships and would get so in my head about social interactions that it became really difficult to tell what was ‘real’ anymore, reading so much into situations and choosing instead to withdraw from interactions. 

My memory of the past 7 years is also a muddy haze, it really sucked when a friend and I met up recently and we talked about when we saw King Krule a couple of years back and we apparently had a nice moment in the crowd where we hugged. It sucks so bad that I have no memory of it. 

The first two weeks of quitting were pretty rough, mainly restless nights and vivid dreams though if you just stick it out it will get better.

I just want to say that if you are experiencing some of these same issues or even others tangential to them - quit! If you’re not getting any positive benefits and you’re just smoking out of habit, which I did for so long, you will be sooooo much better off without it. My mind is a lot clearer - I feel like myself again and as if a fog has lifted from my mind. 

If you’re surrounded by people that smoke (I live with some of the biggest stoners around), it may seem almost impossible to quit, but I’ve found a good amount of relief in realising that I’m better off sober around them. I can actually interact with them without living in the past and questioning everything I say and reading deep into what they say despite being complete fabrications in my mind. 

I realise now how ‘in my head’ I was living and it hasn’t actually been that hard to stop this time - mainly because of these realisations I’ve had, it’s taken a few breaks to get here but those breaks were so important for perspective at seeing how much of a shadow of my true self I was living as. 

Thanks for reading and I’d honestly love to talk with some of you about your own experiences as these are things I’ve kept bottled up for so long.

I’ve tried to quit weed before with varying levels of success, nothing long term. I’ve been a daily smoker for about 4 or 5 years and casual smoker for almost 10 years. 

I smoked my last bowl two nights ago, ate an edible yesterday, and I’ve been using sleep aids to help me at night, they can also addictive so I’m trying to avoid daily use. 

So today is day 1. Hoping for at least one month off. Wish me luck!",2

Today is day 6 and I feel like I'm on a good way to stay sober.
Always when I am craving for weed, I recall the feelings, that I experienced during my psychosis and especially when I came off the last high. It works good for me and I can stay strong.

At the moment, I am dealing with an everyday morning low. I want to do things, but it's incredibly hard to overcome that low. I'm workless and spend most of the time at my place. 

Yesterday I made a plan for today, but I just can't motivate myself to do the stuff I wrote down.

Does anyone have an advice for me, how to overcome that low? How do you get yourself motivated for the day?

Thanks in advance.",3

I’ve been clean from weed for a week now, and it has been liberating. There were a few rough days where I cried due to constant mood swings and I wanted nothing more than to smoke my troubles away, but I pushed through. I’ve been reflecting on the past week, and here is what I’ve learned so far:

Don’t beat yourself up. Reflect on how you were when you smoked but don’t let it consume you with self pity. Imo that was probably a reason why I ended up relapsing so many times before.

STAY BUSY. This one I cannot stress enough. The quote “Idle hands are the devils workshop” has never been more true, especially when trying to quit smoking. For me playing guitar, discovering new music and going on long walks have been my saving grace.

Pay attention to how your body feels. I learned very quickly that smoking caused me to have violent allergy attacks, coughing and sneezing for hours afterwards. Unfortunately I was too high to care. My appetite and food preferences have completely shifted as well. Last week I was face first in a bowl of poke, followed by a pint of Ben & Jerry’s 5 min later🤮

I loved weed more than myself. This was a big one. I did whatever I could to get my hands on weed no matter how inconvenient it was for me. I needed that next hit and the comfort it brought, and i was willing to 
cancel plans with friends and waste my life away because of it.

Joining this subreddit has been the best decision I’ve made this year, hands down. Reading everyone’s stories has reminded me that I am not alone on this journey to stay clean, we’re all in this together.",5

This is prob the 5th time since July that I’ve disposed of 2-3 grams.

I always find a way back to the late night binge eating and telling myself I’m gonna quit. Well maybe this time will be different, if I can just do push ups and lift dumb bells whenever I wanna smoke 

I’m a pretty consistent smoker. At least 1/2 joints per day with bong rips mixed in - it’s way worse now with working remotely, prior to this i was able to maybe smoke a bowl a day..

I have tried to quit a thousand times. My wife just laughs at me now she don’t even wanna be involved but I know she’s concerned. I have a one year old and feel so guilty about smoking so much. 

Idk why I do it but I make excuses to get high.

Painting a bedroom, Go smoke a bowl or two.
Thanksgiving, gotta be high for the turkey.
Sunday at 11AM, it’s Sunday go relax.
Thursday after work, sure why not.
Video games... gotta be high to get lost in a good video game.. I HAVE WASTED THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF MY LIFE STONED PLAYING VIDEO GAMES!!!!!
Cooking, I’m more creative with a dish when I’m stoned..
Cleaning, if I’m doing tasks I don’t wanna do might as well be high for it..
Mowing the lawn? Nothing beats mowing the grass stoned, brings me back to being 20 living at home with my parents, single with a vanilla Dutch and a dime bag.
Seeing my cousins, they all smoke it’s the thing to do.
Eminem drops new music man I gotta smoke a blunt to that album

Hell I’ll smoke just to smoke there doesn’t even need to be a god damn reason.

I am a professional tho I don’t smoke when I have to work and it’s never gotten in the way of my job, I have a great respectable career and do well, but I’m certainly counting down the hours til I can get high or thinking about when I’ll be able to hit the bong 

I have wanted to quit and tried to quit for years. I said I would quit when my son was born and that lasted two weeks. He’s 13 months and I’ve been high for most of it if not all of it. Time is just going by and I’m in the hole.

Today, I feel free!

My cravings have pretty much dissipated completely. Every few days I entertain the idea of smoking, but after a few minutes of thought, I have no desire to. I love this version of myself so much more and so do the people around me.

It's not all sunshine and rainbows, but it is SO much better than where I was!

I'm starting to see the real, sober me. 

He's a little depressed, pretty anxious, and extremely hypercritical of himself. However, these facts are not crippling. Without weed in my life, I am dealing with them in a healthy way. Instead of sparking to numb the pain, I've taken up piano, started exercising regularly, and resumed studies for my career. I am also processing my emotions with my loved ones, but I hope to start seeing a therapist soon. 

These are just a few things, but they fulfill me more than my love affair with Mary Jane. 

I am a more open individual. Not just in conversation, not just while processing emotion, but to everything that life is throwing my way. 

Each day becomes easier but there are still downs as well. But. The odd thing is, I am beginning to love the pain. The more I accept it, the more things feel okay. Plus, I'm tired of running.

Most of all, I realize one simple fact. In order to recognize the good and joy in one's life, one must also experience the sadness and pain that come as well. Constantly chasing the up and never facing the down eventually led me to the darkest corner of my life.

This is my starting point. Square one. Today, I feel I can say I am beginning my journey. My journey to becoming the person I was meant to be.

I do not regret smoking as long as I did, it has been a very valuable teacher to me. I do know one thing for sure, today and for the foreseeable future. Weed is not for me!

 We all have our own path. But. For those of you still in your first month, KEEP PUSHING! You're on the verge of a breakthrough! The emotional rollercoaster with come to a halt! Then you will see you.

As much as we want them to, things do not change overnight. Even while saying all this, I know I still have a ways to go myself.

Although I do not know any of you personally, I love each and every one of you! You make this community such an amazing place! Without Leaves, I would not be this far along. This community has given me more than any outpatient group I've been to. It means so much to me!

1. I’m starting to head-on face a lot of traumas that I just hid from before with marijuana usage. Honestly I feel like I’m growing a lot as a person but at the same time to be honest being a grown-up is fucking hard. Just difficult. I don’t understand how individuals can balance everything and still be happy. More power to you if you’re able to because this shit seems so hard for me. Not impossible, just difficult to balance work, life, mental health, and physical health while at the same time dealing with my second item on my list

2. I’m so fatigued and lethargic all the time now. I don’t understand why; I mean I kind of have a reason. During all my health discoveries I found out I also have giardia (like out of all the things to get, 2020 is a hell of a year). I’ve been sleeping way more than usual and just having random naps throughout the day that also make me feel bad because then I feel like a lazy piece of shit....

3. I’m still positive on a drug test and at this point it’s just pissing me off. I’ve been sober now for 64 days and my pee test doesn’t even need the whole 5 minutes to show that I’m positive, it just pops up so quickly. Of course I check again in 5 minutes to confirm but it’s just so frustrating at this point....

4. I have bad anxiety and being sober is making me have to face it head on. I’m working with a therapist but it’s hard dealing with the guilt from choices I’ve made. I know I’m growing as a person but I regret the past even though I know I can’t change it. All we can do is grow from it. But it’s hard with constant reminders like #3 and also the fact that now I’m trying to fight off copious amounts of debt from said habit....

5. I get random cravings and it’s disgusting to me. The best way I’ve found to not go back for me personally (may not work for everyone) is to read about others bad experiences from smoking to remind myself of why i wouldn’t go back. When I used to smoke and first started I had to ‘train’ myself to not get anxiety attacks (which I think is even more indication that it’s not for me) 

That’s it for now really, if you got this far thank you for reading; and just know you’re not alone; addiction doesn’t rule us; we are more powerful than our addiction; the human spirit is insanely resilient and you got this, your future self will thank you in abundance :)",4

Anyway, ever since I quit smoking I’ve gone from masturbating 1-3 times a day to about 1-3 times a week. When I masturbate I have to force myself to, it’s just not enjoyable at all anymore. When I orgasm I just cry and get really sad afterwards. Every time. It’s not because I feel ashamed either. I really don’t understand this at all. I am also female and 22 years old.

I’ve had sadness after masturbation when I was a teenager but never had problems involving masturbation since then. 

It’s really annoying and depressing and weird because masturbation used to be such an important part of my day, now I hate it. I used to experience extreme pleasure while masturbating now I feel barely anything. 

My boyfriend has not been in the mood for sex much lately either and I only get to see him a few times a week anyway. This just really fucking sucks and I don’t know what to do about it. Sexual experiences in general (by myself or with others) has always been very important to me and I don’t know what to do now. It is definitely caused by quitting smoking.

Ive been smoking daily for 18 months. I barely smoked anything before that in my entire life. I initially started smoking to avoid my problems that had built up in my life. The first 12 months were extremely abusive since i noticed i could avoid all my problems whenever i smoked. I smoked mulitple times a day. My mental health was relatively fine due to the easy escape, and i had always been a person that could control my emotions even though i had a lot of problems. 

The problem is that after the first 12 months i barely remember my sober self anymore. I literally FORGOT how to control my emotions. This has led to constant stress, anxiety and so on. Before i started smoking i did not even know what panic or panic attacks felt like. I had never experienced it. I pretty much thought panic attacks were made up by weak people. After the 12 months of smoking and me not remembering my sober self anymore, whenever i get anxious or stressed i don’t know how to snap my mind out of it. This has led to the last 6 months being filled with CONSTANT stress, anxiety, high heart rate, high blood pressure, heart stabs daily, paranoia about my health being all fucked, and so on. The last 6 months of the entire 18 months period i couldnt even enjoy the weed. Everytime i smoked i was feeling good for like 1 hour and then i was stressed and anxious the rest of the high. But for some reason i did not stop.

I am currently 5 days sober and i am honest when i say that i have zero cravings to smoke. That is because, as i said, i know i will enjoy it for 1 hour and then be anxious as fuck. The problem i am facing now is that that anxiety and stress still persists when im sober. I know i have to give it more time, but how much more time? 

I have literally no pleasure out of anything i do. I don’t enjoy eating, gaming, talking to people, or anything i enjoyed before. My sex drive has plummeted to the fucking ground. I was horny all the time before but now i don’t even know if i would get hard during sex. I also do weightlifting a lot, and i get so fucking stressed and anxious during my workouts i feel like im gonna have a heart attack or pass out. When i do squats, my heart rate and breathing is making me stop the set before my legs are tired. That is FUCKED. I am certain i developed a proper depression out of the weed. I was semi-despressed before i started smoking, but i really enjoyed life before i smoked. I had some moments when i was feeling down, but they passed fast.

How much time does it take to start to enjoy life again? That is my main worry. I know that when i start to enjoy life again my stress and anxiety will go away. I know my sex drive will be back. But how much time does it take to get there?",3

Ive been a smoker for about 6 years total, daily toker for about 5 years. I realized that weed was holding me back from all the things I want to achieve in my life. It was causing me more anxiety than joy on average. I decided to finally stop. 

The first week was bad in terms of appetite/anxiety attacks and feeling irritable. 
The second week was fairly tolerable, most of the symptoms went away.

Going into this 3rd week, I havent been able to shake off this feeling of general background anxiety day to day. Everything feels extremely dull and boring, which makes me anxious. Even if im with friends and chilling, I cant help but think “how fucking boring is this shit” 
“Am i gonna be bored for the rest of my life”
“Nothing seems to be fun anymore even though Ive been sober for 3 weeks” all of these thoughts lead to anxiety and it sucks. 

Has anyone else experienced this? How long did it take for it to change? Will it ever truly go away? Ive been trying to keep myself busy, go on walks, find new interests, etc., but nothing seems to “stick”. I end up getting really bored very quickly. I don’t feel like Ive regained any sort of motivation towards life. 

I just want to hear about other’s experiences in terms of how long it took for motivation/general interest to come back. Im still determined to continue simply because Ive been told it will take at least 6 weeks for brain to start healing and recreating dopamine/cannabinoids on its own.",3

I’m posting this on here because I really need to solidify it to myself that this is really happening. For the past year or so I’ve been debating and battling in my head constantly about quitting but never doing it. I would buy weed then during my time of smoking think of how much I wanna quit. Then when I run out I’d wanna go buy it again. I’d make constant excuses to myself like ‘after so and so happens I’ll take a break’ but then there’s always an excuse I make up to go pick up again. ‘I still have tobacco left so lemme go pick up to finish the tobacco’ ‘I still got papers left..lemme pick up’. What’s the point? I’m not getting high anymore cus my tolerance is fucked, my money is going, my mental health is deteriorating, I’m not enjoying life without smoking, it sucks. P.S. I took an edible like a month ago and it didn’t effect me that’s how far my tolerance has gone!!!!

So a week ago I picked up and I was like ok so I’m gonna pick up again on my birthday but that’s gonna be the final time. But before I could do that I got a tooth infection a few days ago, so as a result couldn’t smoke anymore. Now that it’s my birthday I still have the infection so I still can’t pick up and smoke! So it’s a great time to reevaluate my choices. Smoking weed is fun, but hell when it’s a habit. I have a false perception in my head about how fun the drug is because it gave me the laughs and giggles with my friends years back. But it’s not the same. And it won’t ever be the same if I continue to do this. I don’t wanna be in my 30s n still having the same battle in my head about quitting. I need to do it now.

2020-12-20 22:27:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kh9288/new_here_is_this_normal/,"New here, is this normal?","Hi Leaves,

First I'd like to give a little bit of context to my situation. This year has been really hard for me, like it has been for a lot of people. My fiancee and I broke up and it came out of no where. Things between us seemed good with the exception that we had to cancel our July wedding because of COVID which was a major bummer for both of us. But we decided we'd elope in May. Then one day in April she woke up and decided that ""She wasn't ready to be married"" and the relationship rapidly devolved from there until we called it quits in July. I was devastated by this series of events but by the end, I could tell she wanted out, so we ""mutually"" decided to end it. She left me in a brand new city, with very little community, in an apartment I couldn't afford by myself, in the middle of lockdown.

My experience with weed in the past was that I typically smoked a small handful of times a year with friends. But after my fiancee and I split, something broke inside of me. I just couldn't cope. Nothing could distract me from the constant and intense pain, so I got high, and then I got high again and again and again. At first I was just smoking a joint or two in the evenings but by the time I decided to quit (1 week ago) I was smoking my hash pen as soon as I woke up and even in the middle of the night when I would wake up.

Like most of you here, I decided that this was no way to go through life and so I quit. The past week has been what I can only describe as hell. I've experienced the worst sadness and anxiety I've ever felt. I have to go to my room every day at least once to literally weep uncontrollably which as a 6'1""  200lb body builder, is very disconcerting. I went to a Christmas party last night and I had such intense social anxiety I had to down three glasses of wine just to get my hands to stop shaking and sweating. It's awful. I feel hopeless, alone, unmotivated, scared, and above all else, profoundly sad.

Is this normal? How long will it last? I'm struggling with suicidal thoughts and I just want some reassurance that this will pass. That it's because of the weed addiction I developed and not because something has permanently broken inside of me due to the hardships of this year.

Thank you.",8

Problem is: I've been smoking for almost 5 years now, first started as a weekend thing with some friends to two joints in the morning, atleast three during the day and as many as I can to get to sleep at night. (I've spent so much money omg.) I've also been trying to quit cold turkey for months now. I originally set my end date for August and pushed it back to September and then November and here we are.

I have stopped though, this is day 2 of completely clean for me (including alcohol, which I don't have a problem with but have paired with smoking often) and I was feeling great up until 15 minutes ago. 

My roommate came home and called me from my room to show me the sick oz he just picked up and damn, I'm struggling. I have thought about it in the 2 days of my cold turkey but haven't gotten it because I don't know anyone in this area and I don't have money to spare atm. Now its here and free 😔

I read online that sometimes an easier method of quiting is to just smoke less and less over time to help with cravings and remain committed. But I also think my mind is using this as justification for me to give into smoking? At the same time, I'm the kind of person that just kind of goes all in on things in the beginning and kind loses interest/fortitude over time, so I don't think the cold turkey method is going to work out, especially given the drug positive environment I'm stuck in. 

I don't know why I am writing here anymore. I want to smoke because I like the feeling but I just don't want it to lead me back into smoking every hour on the hour like I was before. I also feel like if I have been so strong these two days its pointless to throw that away now, just for a feeling. 

I'm thinking I gotta lock myself in the room for the night and blast the Office to keep me occupied until the intensity of my cravings subside. Maybe in the morning, I'll think of a better action plan for when this comes up again. I am leaving for a week to visit my boyfriend, and although he smokes he understands what I'm trying to do and does not offer or smoke around me, so it might provide somewhat of a break.  Mega sigh. 

Would love some feedback on how any of yall have handled quitting in a drug positive setting",2

I've been getting a decent amount of sleep and dreams are starting to come back which is promising, but last night I went to bed with a gut feeling I was going to have a bad dream, and I did. I had a dream that I walked in on my SO cheating on me with my roommate (I don't even have a SO). Also had the worst night sweats so far. I pretty much immediately started crying when I woke up because I have been so depressed the last 2 days. The first few days were mostly anxiety but now I am feeling a second wave and it is just the worst depression I have ever felt. I honestly have zero temptation or desire to smoke, but I just wish I could know when it'll end. I'm too lethargic to even enjoy playing a video game.",3
2020-12-20 20:57:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kh7jgy/is_it_normal_to_feel_this_awful/,Is it normal to feel this awful?,"Hi all, 

I just came across this community and I’m so thankful that I have. Sorry this is such a long post but it’s been a literal week from hell and I have never been this sick (physically and mentally) in my life and I could really use some insight and tips to beat this. Here’s a little backstory to understand my circumstances-

 I’ve been experiencing what I thought was a bad reaction to starting trauma therapy last week to then confusing the symptoms to having Covid and absolutely worked myself up SO badly thinking I was sick and my smoking multiple times a day habit could put me in danger while fighting the virus so I stopped smoking completely last Saturday and have been feeling the absolute worst anxiety I have ever felt in my life. My test came back negative but I still feel so horrible and I didn’t realize that these symptoms could be my brain withdrawing from all the THC it was used to consuming. I have not been able to eat, I am so incredibly nauseous all day long and spend the first hour or so after waking up, gagging and throwing up (sorry if TMI) experiencing chills and I was having multiple panic attacks the first few days too as well and it basically lead me to having a mental health crisis and I had to get some fast acting anxiety medicine to calm my system down because it’s just so tired and worked up right now....

My main method of consumption has been high percentage THC vaping daily for the last 3 years and smoked flower 4–7 times a week for 4 years before that and I guess my question is- is it normal to have such a negative reaction? I also tried to smoke a tiny bit to see if it would ease my discomfort and it made it so much worse and caused panic attacks which is not normal for me at all. Could my body have changed that fast to its reaction to THC? I also realize the anxiety has been exasperated by opening up the door to my past traumas last week and then being freaked out by thinking I got Covid and then going cold-turkey has just sent my body absolutely spiraling. 

I’m coming to terms that these are most-likely withdrawal symptoms and all the negative emotions that I’m feeling now are ones I’ve ignored feeling for so long in my constant daze of being stoned. Can someone confirm if this is normal and if so, what helped them get through it? Any relief right now is appreciated more than you could ever know. I’m so sorry for anyone else struggling through this.....I had no idea it would be this hard.",4

I don't crave weed anymore cause I know it doesn't help me going where I want to be in life.

2020-12-20 20:08:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kh6pe1/trying_to_get_clean_again/,Trying to get clean again," I know this will be a post 1 in a 1000 but considering the situation the world is in right now, what choice do we have.

I'm a 32y old man, working a nice full time job which I've held for the past 6years, socially I'm living with a very limited group of friends. Basically couple of mates I've met through internet since I don't really (want to) connect with people from work because nobody really knows about this, so having to constantly hide something is too much of a hassle, so I just distance myself. And just to add to the stereotype because it's not bad enough, I live at home with my 70y old single mother.

My journey with weed started when I was 16 through a classmate who used and let me try it once. Not only that but I have learned about myself that I simply have an addictive personality combined with being quite introverted which is of course a great combination...Just thinking back on it all these years later, it already went wrong with those first joints and how I started using them after I bought him from that classmate. We did smoke 1 together but the rest I took home and over the next days/weeks smoked them by myself. And that pretty much got the ball rolling.

So here I am, 16years later, still using it. I'm from Belgium myself where it's technically illegal but upto a certain amount there won't really be any legal consequences you have to face. Also live very close to the Dutch border so once I had my drivers license at 18 it was pretty much open season. No hassling with dealers, just short hop across the border and within the hour I was back at home. This evolved over the years with their weedpass starting in Bergen op Zoom, Breda, Roosendaal and then all the way to Nijmegen or Etten-Leur, and even now when it's impossible anywhere else I'm still driving to Rotterdam (200km round trip!!!) usually twice a week which is absolutely insane. In all those trips I've been stopped at the border 1 time when I was 18, they took the weed and that was the last I heard of it so why not do it when it's that easy?

Over these years the addictive personality coupled with not being the most social person turned out to be quite a volatile combination and just snowballed getting worse and worse to the point where my life was basically about smoking weed. Coming home from work (or usually Rotterdam since have to get the shit first off course) it's the first thing I do, and the last thing I do before going to bed. Weekends are not much better, I'm not going as far as waking and baking but usually there's no more than 2hours or so between waking up and lighting up the first one. I'm talking about on average about 10-12gr per week here so a pretty big amount.

And here we are now, and for the n-th time we're thinking about quitting. I've been thinking about it for a while but I had to wait until I had a holiday at work. I didn't want to try this while having to go to work the next days. It hasn't been the first time, I tried this 2 times before and obviously both times didnt turn out great because here I am again.   
What made it click this time? Pprobably the same thing it was before, in the glimpses of clear vision when the smoke clears a bit, I feel like a total fucking waste of oxygen on this earth, am an embarrassment for my father (and mother obviously) and am absolutely worthless as an adult. No \_real\_ friends, no social life, no hobbies, no creativity, ... I feel like I completely destroyed myself and have no idea what to do with my time or my life, I don't have any urges and the only interest Ive kept pursueing is my ""hobby"" which is simracing (where I also met the only people I still communicate with on a regular bases).Not to mention the 100's of € I waste every month, luckily I have a fuel card from work lol

So not only have I relapsed every time, I usually relapse almost on  purpose to cannabis because of the reasons above. Weed quickly gets replaced by something else but the 2 times it went basically like this. I usually start by drinking a beer at night just to relax a bit, a glass of wine, half a bottle of wine, a bottle of wine, ... You can guess the pattern here. And then the mental arithmatic of an addict comes to the surface and says ""Might as well go back to smoking weed in limted doses, it's alot healthier and I can actually function with it""' But I know I can't.   
I tell myself that this time I'll just stick to 1 joint a day, or I'll stick to smoking outside so I have to make an effort to smoke, but that obviously doesn't last long.

Well, this was my short story, I'm sorry if this is more a confession than anything else but I had to say something and get it off my chest.

I have 2 weeks now until the 4th of January to get my shit together, it won't be easy because of the Covid rules so I can't really go anywhere or do anything to keep my mind off it, but I can't keep going on like this either. When you start thinking that you might as well not be on this earth and you won't really be missed if you would suddenly disappear, it's getting serious. And I don't want to be that person that starts thinking like that.   
This morning I finished the last weed I had, nice and desperate scraping everything out of the grinder that I could (definitely not a bad sign either) so day1 is almost done, but now comes the hard part which is the first night of feeling 0 tiredness and just not being able to sleep.

I don't know why but I'm tearing up just writing this down, but thank you for reading all this if you're still here.",3

I think most of the physical detox symptoms are behind me (occasional craving or my Addict Brain telling me that smoking-out is somehow a good idea, depression, overall low mood, poor sleep quality, profuse sweating, some very wild dreams, skin is getting clearer, appetite seems pretty normal). 

Have also had some stressors, but I've got some good support and some good mantras I practice.  For instance, ""One Day At A Time.""  ""My decisions align with my values.""  ""No one ever regretted staying clean.""  ""Smoking-out will not solve anything; but staying clean will lead to more positive outcomes.""  ""I am clean today.""  They are simple; but they work!

On my last thread people said my after effects were some of the worst they'd heard of, so i thought i'd throw it back up just to show even the darkest nights have dawns.

\-started smoking with some bros in uni, not a lot at first

\-steadily increased until 3 months I was a 1-2g/day guy

\-After 4 months one of the guys dissocaited from reality(something that has plagued hime since, but he has achieved a PHD in AI at UCL, so he's high functioning)

\-At 6 months I faced the hard truth, let a lone a day, I couldn't make it to the afternoon without blazing

\-Took 12 months from then until I packed it in

\-what followed was an experience I wouldn't wish on anyone. intial month of panic attacks, but I was sure they'd pass, they didn't.

\-The next 14 months of my life were day in, day out suicidal idealtion and extreme anxiety storms, a brief 5 minutes after waking up was my only reprieve, luckily sleep was always a refuge, not hard to achieve.

\-my friends were distrought, they thought I was gone, i'd randomly burst into tears, in uncontrollable panic attacks

\-I had a good high paying job and dated a few chicks, but nothing could occupy my mind

\-I realised my brain was overclocking, seriously and i needed extreme pressure and work. 

\-Quit my job, moved 300 miles to london for a shitty hard job and what i found saved my life, purpose

\-I didnt want to go, and i only stayed for 5 months, but those 5 months let me restart my brain, with new parameters on security, took away my first to get lost in my thoughts, I'll always be thankful for that misery. 

\-Its been 4 years since that fateful day in december, I knew it would be bad, but i had know idea just how bad things would get.

\-I'm a pilot now(never sought pro help, so no one knows my plight) with a lovely home and all my friends are doing well.

I’ve been smoking weed on and off since the age of 16.  I’ve been a daily heavy smoker for the past 3-4 years with no break lasting more than 24-48 hours. 

I’ve noticed over the last year or longer my consumption and tolerance have increased significantly.  I used to smoke blunts and would easily put 6-8 blunts in the air a day. I got hip to wax last year and will easily going through 1g/day. 

I’ve recently recognized a correlation between an increase in emotional distress and an increase in my weed consumption.  I’ve got some shit going on in my head/life and it looks like I’ve been using weed to deal with (or rather not deal with) the associated feelings and pain. It’s become apparent that weed allows me to “dissociate” from my feelings and therefore I just push them down, one on top of the other. Now I’ve run out of room and my brain is like a pipe ready to burst with all these unchecked and unprocessed emotional issues; here I am applying weed and hoping it’ll help. Again and again and again.  

I need to quit. For a lot of reasons, but the primary being my mental health. I need to face some pain and weed is letting me avoid it.  But I don’t want to quit. I love getting high. Im scared. Doubting myself. Second guessing myself. And I just feel like a weak ass bitch. 

Any advice or words of wisdom on how to quit are welcomed. The idea of not smoking at all gives me a pit of anxiety in my stomach. I would like to gradually wean off but I’m not sure if that’s realistic or just me trying to drag it out because I don’t want to let go.

I'm 40 and was a regular smoker almost consistently from 15.  Yesterday I had all the energy, all day I got stuff done around the house that had been bugging me for *months*.  I'd slept a solid 8 hours, I didn't look at reddit first thing in the morning, I avoided distractions like reddit, I played games with my son, I was on top of the world, and everything was coming up roses.

This morning I woke up with the weight of the last 25 years crushing my soul.  I pulled up reddit to try to distract myself, and the *first fucking post* is ""If you could talk to your 15-year-old self for 60 seconds, what would you say?""

I lost it.  The floodgates opened and covered me with regret and anger and pain and good lord it was so. fucking. HEAVY.  All the things I did, the situations I put myself in, the important shit I avoided, the opportunities I missed, all of it just crashed into me again and again and again.  For the first time since Day 3, I wanted to run away and escape the pain again.

But then something that /u/modernshamank said to me the other day came back to me: ""Embrace the discomfort.""  So I did.  I just lay there and waited, thinking and feeling and observing where my mind went, trying to follow which memories were leading to which other memories.  I started seeing patterns of behavior, patterns of avoidance, patterns of deception (both to other people and myself), patterns of negative actions leading to negative consequences.  I started making connections to childhood and the thread of those defense mechanisms winding their way through my life, grabbing whatever escape they could along the way.

Slowly the regret faded and I started seeing life lessons.  The anger faded and I started seeing ways to be different in the future.  The sharp unyielding pain faded to a dull throbbing heartache.

The fear isn't fading, though.  Since I finally got out of bed 3 hours ago, I've been hit with emotional tidal waves again and again, and I've had to go lie down to let them pass.  What if it hits me when I can't just step aside?  What if I can't let it go again?  What if the regrets overwhelm me and I just check out again?  I don't want to check out again, I *can't* check out again.  I can't remember the last time I was hit with emotions so heavy they leave me temporarily disabled, and it's been so long since I've dealt with emotions at all that I don't even know what my tools are to work with them anymore.  I don't know what to do other than keep going, but I don't know where I'm going or even *why* when that wave hits me in the face and crushes my soul under two and a half decades of avoidance.

I'm not going to partake again, that's why I got rid of absolutely *everything* earlier this week, just for this situation.  But I *want* to more than I have this entire week, and I'm absolutely terrified.",25

It's been over 2 years since I've smoked weed near daily, I don't smoke anymore. For the last 4 years I've been seeing a psychiatrist for depression.

I haven't considered how my long-term weed smoking may have still been affecting my depression and identity issues.

To give you some context, I've been a daily smoker for 8 years. When I started smoking I thought it was cool and fun, but over the years it became a habit and a coping mechanism every time I had to deal with strong emotions (it's funny how, regardless if the emotions were positive or negative, I had to smoke). You know the story, somewhere along the way I lost my motivation in life and just felt numb to most things, frustration and anxiety followed. 

I've had a few breaks here and there, the longest being three months, at that point I hadn't realized yet what weed was doing to me, and as soon as I could, I got high again. 
The last break I had was 20 days in march. A lot of bad things came together, I smoked way more than usual and had a complete mental breakdown (in front of 20 school kids that I was giving a presentation...). Lost my sense of reality, heard noises, saw things that didn't exist in my peripheral vision. That shit really scared me and I felt that if I didn't take a break, I'd break my brain forever. After 20 days I couldn't take it anymore, and tricked myself into the whole ""I'll only smoke responsibly on special occasions"". Turns out that my brain thinks every day has about 7 special occasions in it... 

At the time in march I was quite depressed, a bad relationship had ended in an even worse way, I was overworked and i lived alone in a depressed and isolated way. I tried to change the things I could, left my job, started studying again and left my apartment for a shared flat. Both were great decisions, and I feel way better without the job and living with some great people. I never found the strength to quit weed though, and kept smoking. 

I decided to go see my family over the holidays, this is a smoke free zone, I can't get any and don't want to get any. I have 13 days here and they will be sober. 

Right now is day 3. And I'm ok. Like I can sleep alright ish, I can control my moods ish and my brain feels a bit better than it normally does, ish. Like I'm nowhere near my best self, but I'm ok. Last time I quit I slept about 5 hours in 3 days and I'd start to cry if I couldn't find my wallet or if I was out of cereal in the morning.
And that leads to the title of this post. I'm scared that shit is still to come! The extreme insomnia, the strong sweats, the anxiety, no appetite etc... 

So my question to you leavers, what's your experience? Can attempts at quitting vary in their harshness? Is the fact that I'm in a better place in life overall than last time helping? Or am I just deeper in the shit and so full of stored thc that it'll take a while for the withdrawals to hit? 
I'd be grateful for any input :)

One of the reasons for this is because it's SO easily accessible here in Canada. There's literally like 50 weed stores in the city I live in, they're everywhere. Any time I'm stressed, frustrated, or bored it's so easy for me to just walk into a store and get weed. I honestly don't know what to do about this. Before legalization it was much less convenient to get weed, and during that time I had gone for up to 10 months. I'm just so tired of this cycle, literally relapsing hundreds of times. Especially during a lockdown, there's not much to do, but the weed stores are open til' 10 every night.",3

Here's where I'm at:,"I'm properly shocked at how quick these last 28 or so days have gone by despite it feeling like much, much longer, especially during the first week. I've learned so much about myself and about weed withdrawal itself just from being in this community so I wanna thank everyone that's commented on my previous post(s) in here for your advice and support.

It's been a hell of a ride and it's not over yet, but things have gotten much easier to manage. Within days of quitting, (note: I had been smoking joints on and off for a few years, but then smoked daily from morning to night for a good 9 months this year) my whole brain went in to overdrive with negativity, sadness and hopelessness. Almost felt like the world was closing in on me and that I would be miserable forever. I've lost almost a stone in weight to date due to the appetite loss, had to cut out caffeine from my diet as my heart was pounding out of my chest, and the wacky dreams are really coming on strong now. I feel quite ashamed of myself to think that I've wasted a big chunk of this year (even though 2020 has been a diabolical year for most) and that I could have achieved a lot more, and also had a lot more money in my bank too. 

However, at this stage now I am waking up much more refreshed, I can eat proper meals again, can communicate better with friends/family, and have taken a shining towards decaf tea (UK dude here by the way, can't live without a brew!). As cliche as it might sound, I feel kinda reborn and in control of my brain again, instead of feeling foggy, numb and zoned out of everything. It made me realise that I was clearly abusing the weed as I'd begun to rely on it to drown out how I was actually feeling, and I've begun to address a lot of those issues by simply looking after my body a little better.

TL; DR, After 4 weeks of quitting weed I am a completely different person. I'm still me, but much more in control of myself and having a brighter outlook on things. Feel like I actually wanna go and do something with myself, and it's a great feeling. This journey isn't over yet, but if you've gotten this far, or are only just starting, I can honestly say that the rough days will truly make it worth your while in the long run.

Keep on goin', and thanks for reading!",11

And now, YOU.

YOU, made a commitment to yourself that you were not going to given into the pressures of suppressing your emotions.

YOU, choose not to leave and walk the dog while smoking a fatty in frustration to compose yourself as to what was yet to come.

YOU, gave up burning to gain an appetite, so that your family doesn’t think your full of sh*t for not eating the food they “slaved over for days, for you to say your “not hungry” (even though your suffering with an ED).

YOU, made peace with not getting stoned and watching mindless TV or listening to your dreadful cousins sharing in their misery  because your know misery loves company.

YOU, set yourself up for success.

Don’t worry about what family thinks. 

Focus on your own needs and share your feelings by writing it down, listening to some uplifting music or doing something meaningful.

USING IS LOSING.

Don’t let anyone punish, ridicule or guilt you into ANYTHING.

Holidays are meant for EVERYONE to enjoy, not the select few.

We are all SURVIVORS! 

It’s hard to let go of comfort and convince but I believe that CHANGE is possible.

Me and my girl have been together sense we were 16. I really started smoking Heavy about 6 months or so of us getting together back in 2013. So id say probably around 2014 I started smoking everyday. All day. I've noticed I'm always smoking. An I mean always doesn't matter what I do. I mean shit I smoke even before I go to work at 6 in the morning. But shit is heavy right now. Im having some financial problems. Well, to be frank alot of financial problems and the Covid doesn't help. I was off of work from 11/24 to 12/7 and then my mom got the virus and boom. Now I've been off sense last Wednesday. But it seems and I've done math. I've spent alot of money on week this last month for not being at work and I mean easily $450+
I mean shit I done literally pawned both of my PlayStations, my laptop all that. An while no it wasn't just for weed....I feel like that was the main thing that pushed me to sell my stuff. Because we'll ""I can't go without smoking"" my girl smokes just as much as me. I mean money was to the point where I was really worried about Christmas. I figured a little somthing out tho. I pulled some money out of my 401K so that's gonna help me get my boys Christmas and catch up on a little bit of these bills.
I think now is the time to quit. 
I have too. For my boys, for my girl. For our family. But when I try it just gets so hard and I always hit up my dealer. Or come up with excuses. But I figure we can do it. Hopefully and if I'm gonna do it I miles well start soon because we'll I know I'm gonna be off of work another week. So at least I won't have to worry about working through the withdrawal. But my other thing is IDK wtf Im gonna do. I'm not much of a tv watcher I love playing my system but getting it back is not even a option right now. Not with everything going on. But I guess I'm just gonna have to push through it. The weed is taking and has been taking all of my money. An I got a good paying job. An I was just barely making ends meet. Because whenever I had some extra money it all goes towards weed. 
Man it's just alot
I have to do it.....
For my family.

This is my first post, it’s so relieving reading all of your stories and knowing that i’m not the only person who’s going through this. I have many reasons for wanting to quit, and I truly feel as if now those reasons outweigh the excuses i made for myself to keep smoking. i’m currently 19, started smoking at 15, turned to a daily smoker at 17. these days i don’t get any satisfaction from smoking. At first it was great, getting high with friends, laughing and conversing, relaxing and letting loose. but i can’t do it anymore. i don’t enjoy the sticky icky like i used to. it has become a source of anxiety for me, and i found myself in the vicious cycle of wanting to be high when i’m sober and wanting to be sober when i’m high. doesn’t make sense does it? some can live life as a functional stoner, but i am far from functional when i’m high. i’ve been finding myself in a place of stagnation, i’m not growing, changing, meeting new people and having new experiences. i was content living life how i have lived it the last 4 years: blazed, anti-social, depressed. i’m sick of that person. sick of chasing a high that doesn’t feel right. i’m looking forward to rediscovering myself, rediscovering my true inner light that i have numbed over the years. it’s going to be difficult, considering most of the friends i made freshmen year are functional stoners, but i can do it. this isn’t my first attempt to quit, but this WILL be my last one. here’s why

     -escaping the vicious cycle
     -rediscovering who i am without weed
     -making connections with people who don’t smoke
     -not needing to chase a high that doesn’t exist 
     -better short term memory
     -(hopefully) reduced brain fog, better concentration and higher energy
     -reduced social anxiety
     -letting my meds operate on their own
     -quicker on my feet

My message to him, and to you is - if you are a daily smoker for more than a year, you do not know who you are as a sober person anymore.  The grouchy short tempered person you imagine is the “withdrawal” you not the sober you and that’s an important distinction.  

Most of us emerge from that and find a normal without mood swings and nausea and irritability.  Meet that person.  I didn’t become that person until about day 20.  

Make an investment in yourself.  Say that shit out loud, today’s investment will include remaining smoke free, a 1 hour walk and drinking 40oz of water, build on that shit.

I'm spending the day with friends because I can't get home to family in London. Both these people will prob be smoking on Christmas day. 

It's usually absolutely fine for me, if a bit boring to hang out with people getting stoned. However I hung out last night with one of the friends who is coming over on the 25th and found myself saying ""I might smoke on Xmas day for a treat..."" He really didn't encourage me one way or the other and said he didn't want to be the devil on my shoulder.

I know the answer to this but I probably shouldn't right? I have 4 months under my belt now and it would be a bit silly to wreck that. I'm sure this is just a blip in my head and hopefully I've caught it before I do anything.

Have to remember the reasons I quit and really question my motives. I really don't know whether it'll stop at just Christmas day or whether it'll lead me back down the same old path.

I had the same struggle with alcohol last Christmas. I managed to push through and once the holidays were done I was so glad. I think this is my head playing the same old tricks on me.

I was smoking a joint a few days ago at like 11pm walking home for 20 minutes to hide the smell from my neighbours and suddenly i just thought to myself, what the fuck am i doing? I just feel dumb and awkward after smoking now, and now i have to walk my ass home feeling like this and get paranoid about every person passing by, not to mention looking over my shoulder while smoking up and feeling guilty as shit. Genuinenly felt like some kind of junkie roaming the streets in the dark. Tired of wasting time smoking, tired of walking for ages away from people not to be a bother just to feel ok for a couple of hours when i get home, tired of all the time i spend rolling joints, tired of waiting god knows how long for dealers, tired of planning everything i do around when i smoke, getting anxious if someone calls me while high, wasting money, wasting time, wasting my potential. If you cant tell, im tired.

I got 5 grams of fine ass hash left tucked away and im not craving it at all. Not even gonna finish the bag. Ive been smoking on the regular for over 10 years now and im in my late 20s. It was fun in the start with friends with crazy laughing fits and munchies but im just not gonna get that feeling again and thats ok.

When you smoke pretty much daily by yourself for this long its something else. Its a bad habit. It works for some people i guess but not for me. Had long breaks of many months before but somehow always come back to it, which is easy when most of your friends are stoners. Ive been reading this sub a lot the past couple of days and what resonates with me the most is that weed makes you feel ok with being mediocre and stagnant. Ive had shitty jobs, shitty relationships, shitty people around me, a shitty life that i tolerated because i was high all the time. If not high, sort of hungover from the day before and not completely sober. I did nothing to change it or myself because i was content from the devils lettuce. I make music and kept telling myself it makes me creative, yet i can never fully finish a project and i havent even touched production in 6+ months despite being high as shit and having everything available. If i do anything its lazy and uninspired most of the time.

Ive had severe depression for over a year now and i kept telling myself weed helps me, i only smoke small doses so its alright, it calms me etcetc, well clearly fucking not. Either i feel the same sorta relaxing high or i get more anxious when i smoke now. Its a coping mechanism for me and a very short term solution which completely fucks you in the long term. The past few years have just flown by and im in the same dumbass loop doing the same damn things, doing nothing productive, being content with being bored. Not cleaning, cooking, going out and doing things, not taking care of myself. Nothing has changed but the years on the calendar. I used to love this shit but now its time to move on.

Currently typing this at 6am, cant sleep because of the withdrawals and i knew this was coming but god damn i already feel better even like this, after just a couple of days and knowing this shit is over and putting in effort to change starts.


If the ganja makes you feel anything like this, please take care of yourself. Its not the most addictive drug but a habit can be hard to get rid of. Clear your mind and you will find that you are stronger than you think. Much love <3

This is a day and some change late but I wanted to mark the occasion with a post. 

6 MF MONTHS!!! 🎉 🚭🚫🍃

I remember when I just started this summer, I felt like it was an uphill battle minute by minute. Then it became hour by hour. Soon the cravings wouldn't show up for a few days. Now, I can go like under a week before thinking about wanting to spark a joint. I still remember vividly (I catalogued them in older posts) what a nightmare the first few days were. 

I don't think I would have gotten to this milestone if it wasn't for the amazing r/leaves community and all the encouragement and dopamine hits I got from all your comments and good vibes. 

THANK YOU! 

If you're reading this and are just thinking of leaving or on your first few hours or days, keep going! It gets a lot easier and you learn a LOT about yourself as an individual and human being. Addiction (whether habitual, emotional, mental, or physical) isn't anything to scoff at. Mastering one of your vices can bleed in and positively affect so many areas of your life. 

Anyways, thanks again!! I love that this community exists for me to rant and take up a little space with positive news. 🥲",100

I’m a bit uncertain about my future because I’ve been taking LSATs (law school tests) and typing up applications, despite not even knowing if I can afford law school or even be able to secure a loan for it. I was driving alone in my car to my parents house for a visit when “American Pie” started playing on the radio. I got choked up and the tears started flowing. There really wasn’t anything to be sad about, but it was the uncertainty about my future, plus the music, and the fact that this is the longest I’ve gone without a chemical buffer to shield me from negative emotions (2.5 weeks). I know it’ll probably all go away if I went back to my stash, and I’d really rather not, but I just want to know how long I’m going to emotionally vulnerable like this. 

At the moment, I’m hiding in the empty corner of a Walmart parking lot cause I really don’t want my parents to see me like this, or god forbid they’d be able to tell I’ve been sobbing. My family typically sees me as the rational &amp;amp; level-headed one of the bunch, &amp;amp; I don’t want them to know I’ve been hurting. 

Any advice for maintaining your composure? I’m trying controlled breathing right now.

I lost $200 and found out we couldn't go see Christmas lights like we planned and I just found out I have to pay my car registration. Every little thing is ticking me off and I hate it. I'm not a naturally angry person at all...but everything has me irritated...my boyfriend's brother is back in town from California (military) as a surprise and I wish I could be happier. Everyone is happy and I'm just angry. Angry no one told us sooner and angry that when I came home, my boyfriend and him were in the house so I had no chance to decompress and relax before seeing him. I didn't want him to see me like that. 

And now my boyfriend is gone with him to do something and swears he'll come back before dinner...and I believe him, but part of me just wants to be alone. It's hard for anyone to understand.

2020-12-19 16:57:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kgh7my/when_im_sober_crippling_anhedonia_and_inability/,"When I'm sober - crippling anhedonia and inability to feel, When I'm high - crippling bipolar and psychosis","So I have dealt with substance abuse and addictions for most of my life. Prior to this I was doing cocaine every weekend for 6 years, as well as 11 years of smoking cigarettes, and I was also an alcoholic from 18 to 20. I used to be a workaholic for 3 years, and I still suffer with a computer addiction for 15 years.

I also suffered a severe head injury when I was 5 years old that left me unconscious for x amount of time before my parents found me. I don't know if I was ever tested for concussion or had an mri done to confirm if there was any damage. I do remember having explosive uncontrollable anger for 9 years as well as anti social tendencies and lack of empathy. I got into trouble mostly because I couldn't understand peoples facial expressions and whether they were joking or being harmful towards me. I also suffered CPTSD symptoms of sexual abuse, emotional abuse, neglect, etc. 

I believe the head injury caused me to develop diabetes insipidus, which is where your body makes you pee excessively more than normal. I was a bet wetter until about 14.

I also believe that by the time I turned 15 is when my brain rewired itself and began repressing emotions. I stopped having explosive anger moments, but I also couldn't feel much of anything else either. By the time I went to college I developed severe depression and anhedonia that made me attempt suicide.

That was all before I recently picked up weed about 4 years ago. I was smoking it maybe once every month or so, and the effects were really hit or miss - I would either be relaxed and content, or panicky and losing my mind. 

Normally in my day to day I have no emotions or any self awareness about myself. I can't tell whether a situation has made me angry, sad, excited, or happy. This year I learned that me smoking weed actually is opening up those channels in my brain that I had closed when I was 15, because I can only feel emotions when I am high. I'm not making this up. Smoking weed is the only way I can feel anything about myself.

It was really great the past 6 months as a therapeutic tool, because getting high would usually trigger traumatic memories from my childhood in a way that I could process them. It made me feel as if I was back as a child in those moments and I could remember exactly how painful those moments made me feel. I had completely forgotten after 20 years what some of these memories felt like. 

Also, sex and masturbation on weed is 1000 times more pleasurable than anything I ever experienced sober. It just does not compare, and masturbation and sex sober is a pathetic joke.

Unfortunately now it seems I develop bipolar from weed. It seems to cycle every 3 or 4 days. I'll have 2 days of calm and peace and even enlightened state, where simple things like eating feel like the most pleasurable moments in life. Then I develop crippling sadness, crying, and debilitating depression. Last night I had gone for a walk to try and ease the symptoms, but I think the walk made it worse. I had thoughts telling me to throw myself into an icy river, and they kept egging me on to do it. I was crying for the 3rd time. I just kept hearing the same words 'I cant keep doing this, I can't keep doing this...'

I think I also experienced some mild seizures from the weed. But these only ever happened when I orgasmed.

Maybe this is just my 4th major depressive episode I'm going through, but I feel trapped between a rock and a hard place. I can't live life without emotions and this crippling repression - the anhedonia is so severe that I've lost all meaning to everything. But I also can't live life spiraling out of control with bipolar emotions and suicidal ideation. I'm fucked and condemned to a world of pain regardless of what choices I make.",9

The first few days were one day at a time, and the thing that finally helped me through was realizing that my habit was actually physically keeping my body from healing trauma. I hadn’t realized that the high levels of THC triggered cortisol and kept me in fight or flight & on edge. What I thought was helping me cope was just keeping me more isolated. As I’m sitting here, I’m realizing how calm and grounded I actually feel on my own, without any substances. It’s bizarre to realize how much I was actually hurting myself when I thought I was helping.

Hopefully that can help someone else. I’m no scientist, but I’m starting to believe that the race for higher and higher THC plants, separating that compound from the whole original plant, has bastardized the original plant medicine.

2020-12-19 12:42:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kgc9cm/11_days_sober/,11 days sober,"Hi guys, I have been smoking daily for the last year.

A few things I noticed from sobriety: 

PROS: 

- I can finally fall asleep without the aid of weed. This wouldve been IMPOSSIBLE a year ago. It’s so nice to just lay in bed, close my eyes and fall asleep..

- easier to wake up in the morning

- brainfog is practically gone. I’m far more clearheaded

- Without weed, my mind is able to establish boundaries more clearly. because im more clearheaded, i suddenly lost the urge to see people before that i suspected were using me. This has lifted a HUGE depression off my shoulders and a huge boost in my self esteem. I have no spite towards them, but I honestly do not want to see them. Withoht the brainfog, it’s much more clear to see where and how they are using me, and that they do not respect me. With weed it was easy to be complacement with poor relationships. It was easy to have a lack of boundaries 

- I’m actually able to complete simple tasks, like doing the laundry, cleaning, work assignments. When I was smoking, i would think about wanting to do something and i could only get myself to do it days or weeks later, even though i would make a plan in my head to do it every single day.

- I suddenly have the urge to change things that I’m not happy with. I actually have the desire to work towards my career, study new skills, network and learn from others. When I was smoking daily, I had developed a feeling of complacency with EVERYTHING, especially with myself. It made my self-esteem much more low. 
Because of this desire, I have started studying programming on my commute and when I get home. 

- I’m more mindful of my friendships. I keep more in contact with friends because I have a desire to socialize rather than use weed to fill the void. 

- more in tune with my positive emotions like happiness and gratitude. Less disconnected with myself 

CONS:

- less of sexual drive and sexual desire

- more anxiety in work and professional settings. I’m more hyper aware of my surroundings and therefore have become more attuned to small details and high stress situations

- harder to get more relaxed and  less tense in social settings. When I was smoked i was far more relaxed and at ease and could laugh and joke more. Now I feel much more uptight and a bit more anxious. 

- able to feel and be more in tune to my negative emotions. For example, my dad is very sick and it’s far more stressful when I’m sober than high. 

I honestly was not expecting these effects guys. I forgot what it’s like to be sober and i really thought that the weed wasn’t affecting me. But I wanted to quit because I was looking at pictures of me 4 years ago when I was sober and I realized that so much had changed about me. I felt really disappointed in myself and I couldn’t understand why I had stopped having the habit or drive to strive for goals and achievement.

As you can see, the pros outweigh the cons overall. However I’m going to have to find ways to deal with the cons, which are arguably some of the reasons that I started to smoke in the first place.

Any suggestions welcome! Cheers ❤️",6

But the happiness I felt was happiness I hadn’t felt and all 43 days and ever since I had started smoking weed so it served as a sign of hope. But that only lasted for about a day then the past 2-3 days have not been very good. The main waves of anxiety have passed but now I still feel detached from my emotions, like I question my own feelings about things and don’t know exactly when to be very sad or happy. That seriously bugs me out, also I’ve lost touch with my sense of humor which also falls under the detachment from emotions. I’ve seen the light at the tunnel and I know it’s waiting for me, but I guess I have two questions. 1. Is what I’m feeling now normal? And 2. Will I ever fully recover from being this shell of a person (get my sense of humor back, my energy, and my feelings back)?",2

Once I graduated highschool, I began to smoke every single day. For the better part of 6 years, I smoked every single day, multiple times a day. I honestly didn’t even know who I was without weed anymore. I’d say it was a major part of my life. There was one point that I quit. When I was 20, I quit for 3 months in order to get a job. The normal craves were there and a month into it, crippling anxiety kicked it. Well once I got the job I started smoking again and continued on my normal every day pattern for the next 3 years. 

Well eventually smoking quit being what it was. May 2020, anxiety began to set in every time I smoked. It just wasn’t fun anymore. So instead of craving weed, I started to despise it. So I straight up quit. Now I didn’t have the normal cravings I had before when I would wing off of it since I no longer associated the feeling of being high in a positive manner. I had the typical crazy vivid dreams, no appetite, inability to sleep. But, about 2 months into not smoking, extremely crippling health anxiety set in. It was so bad to the point where I thought I was dying. Kind of like what happened the first time I quit, but much worse. I couldn’t even eat normally without having food anxiety. It was hell. But, I stuck it out and eventually that anxiety just went away and I feel much much better. My mind is as clear as it was before I began smoking. My energy is back and I don’t mind going out and socializing instead of staying in my own stoner bubble that I used to always want to do. 

Long story short, quitting weed can be difficult. It can take months to get back to your normal self. But, in all honesty, it was the best decision I’ve ever made. I also want to add that weed affects different people in different ways. Some people can function fine with it. But, in my case it made me lazy, unmotivated, unsociable, and occasionally paranoid towards the end. To anyone considering quitting, I highly recommend it and the best way to do it is quit associating weed with positive feelings and learn to despise it instead of love it.",38

Last weekend I thought I ran through an 1/8, but it was actually 1/4 because I was alternating strains all weekend and ran through both of them. Shows how high I really was. I was sitting on the couch high, skipped the gym (again), didn’t get groceries, had a sink full of dishes, laundry basket full of dirty clothes, and my place reeked of the stuff. 

I started a pretty lucrative sales job where they didn’t drug test and openly talk about smoking pot, so I was able to buy as much as I wanted even with my base pay. So with that, I celebrated by smoking. I relaxed by smoking. I would wake and bake on the weekend and forget all priorities. 

I flushed it all last Sunday evening and swore I’d never touch it again. This week I had my most productive week at work despite it being so close to Christmas. Closed 4 deals, sent out a few more proposals, and my cold calls were insanely more productive. I hit the gym every day (aside from Thursday - a planned rest day). Got some Christmas shopping done. Last but not least, I’m much more clear headed.

The only real problem has been sleep. First few nights I got about 3-4 hours but I’ve always been fine on little sleep. Later on in the week it was closer to 4-6 so that seems to be getting better as well. 

1 week down, a lifetime to go. Super excited to be sober from here on out.",8
2020-12-19 10:33:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kg9rbi/how_long_does_withdrawal_last_anyway/,How long does withdrawal last anyway?,"Whenever I search for a timeline of effects from quitting smoking I get info about cigarettes, and when I specifically look for weed most of the results say that withdrawal effects are minimal. Well they definitely aren't minimal especially considering the amount I was smoking! 

I started smoking in 2018 and it quickly became a daily habit. Initially it helped me out a lot since I had had some traumatic experiences that the THC high really helped me work through, but after a year or so I realized that I no longer needed it for that purpose. Yet I continued to smoke 24/7 anyway. After another year of that I decided that 2020 would be the year I attempted to smoke in moderation. But instead that turned into a pattern of quitting and binging. I'd never quit long enough to get over the withdrawal effects, and then binges would end up being me smoking as much as possible until my lungs were in pain and my head felt like it was going to pop out of my skull. And I'd get the munchies so bad that I'd spend more money on junk food than on the weed itself. So it's been proven to me pretty conclusively that I cannot use in moderation. If I have any weed at all I will keep smoking it until it's gone. So last month I finally said ""fuck this"" and didn't buy any more when I ran out.

So it's been about 3-4 weeks since the last time I smoked and I'm going into 2021 committed to staying off of it for good. Mentally I feel fine, happy, and optimistic about this decision because I know it's the right one for me, but damn I'm still really feeling these withdrawal effects even nearly a month in! I feel really low energy, my body is all creaky, my dreams are extra weird, I rarely sleep through the night, I wake up frequently unable to fall back asleep, I get strange mood swings, my lungs have this raw ""empty"" feeling, and more that isn't coming to mind right now. I seem to have just about every withdrawal symptom I've seen described by others in full force. Except perhaps for cravings, that hasn't been too much of an issue thankfully. But anyway how long does this stuff last for? Several more weeks? A few months? A year? I'd assume that any damage I've done to my lungs will take a while to physically heal but is it similar to the timeline of cigarette smoker recovery? or is it different?",1

Last night as soon as I smoked I felt weird and different than usual. I was saying my thoughts out loud uncontrollably, my heart was beating faster than it's ever beat before, I felt like I wasn't breathing and was about to die, I tried drinking water and it made me shiver and shake uncontrollably. I kept thinking it would get better and the only time it did was momentarily when I was standing outside my parents door, about to tell them I was dying and needed to go to the hospital. That momentary relief was what made me think it was panic/anxiety related rather than me actually dying, so I didn't knock on their door. 

Does this sound like a panic attack? I should add I also have pretty bad anxiety that's been getting worse recently, so I guess it would make sense that I had a panic attack, but I've never felt anything like I felt last night so I am unsure. I genuinely thought I wouldn't make it through the night. A few similiar things have happened to me before like a weed-induced psychosis a few months back and the feeling of needing to vomit but not actually needing to vomit every time I smoked for a period of a few months last year. 

Pretty terrified to smoke again after that and I'm pretty sure I should quit as I really really don't want to experience anything like that again. Only problem is that I crave the feeling of being high and the stimulation and the disconnect from my problems and the relaxation and everything that goes with it and I have so much weed in my house that I don't know if I'll be able to quit even though I really want to.

I've smoked daily for 21 years. Today I thought about going to the dispensary, as a treat for being so good... and I nearly convinced myself to.

I always relied on weed because it kept me from finding other ways to escape, other ways to get high, without most of the downsides. I stopped for my children, I stopped for my wife, I stopped for my financial well being, but most of all I stopped for me. I don't want to live this way anymore, I shouldn't need a substance to feel ""okay"" in this world. As another wise member said on here before, weed makes us okay with a mediocre life- and I am NOT okay with that anymore. I want to remember what I did yesterday, I want to be able to process my feelings, I want to find joy in something other than fake happiness. It hasn't gotten any easier, perhaps it's even gotten more difficult. I refuse to give up. I will be free from this cycle.

I have gotten caught by my mother a bunch of times and the only reason i want to quit is because every-time my mother catches me, our relationship gets ruined even more.

Part of me wants to quit but another part of me doesn't want to quit. I have relapsed several times and its very hard for me because every-time my mom smells my room or looks me in the eyes to see if i'm high I want to start smoking again. Before I started smoking I was soo insecure about myself (probably am still insecure). I always have these terrible thoughts every time i go back to being sober and then once those thoughts kick in i start to feel the impulse to smoke again, my mind starts to think that if i smoke everything will go away.

My mom has done everything in her power to help me, but in the end I know its me that has to decide. There is a piece of me that wants to quit, but there is another piece of me wanting to know how it feels to not overthink or how it feels to not feel insecure, how it feels to be alive again. I know that this stupid drug that is holding me hostage and making my relationship with my mom sour, but there is a part of me that doesn't want to let go. There is something in me that is eating away at my soul and when i smoke it makes me forget all about my past and all about my problems. 

Weed makes me have a safe space in my mind where all these bad thoughts and feelings go away. It makes me feel like me although a little bit stupider. it makes me funny, and it makes me very social with the right people. It also makes me more enjoyable as a person when i'm not using a-lot of it. There is something emotional in me that has clung to this drug, but I don't know what that thing is. I don't know what is wrong with me. I don't know if this nightmare will ever end.",2

Messages of hope only lol"," My story is maybe complex maybe not. Just venting the first part of the story cost me a good job, a great apartment, and a wonderful girlfriend.

I'm on day 8 now. 

I smoked mostly on and off since I was 14 or 15 and pretty much a daily user from 22-27.  In march 2018 I had a panic attack and I stopped smoking weed after that for a little while.  I went to the doctor and they put me on a  steroid for bronchitis(I never had that shit) anyway 2 days later I woke up in a puddle of sweat my heart was feeling funny, everything felt weird so I went to the hospital.  They didn't do anything. Fast forward I have insane depersonalization I feel like I'm not even in control of myself, I stopped driving and haven't worked for since that day.

  At first I thought I was having a weird reaction to the prednisone, than I finally got into see a doctor and the only thing they found wrong with me was I tested positive for Lyme Disease.  So I went thru this whole thing trying to treat Lyme disease for a few months, I'm still not sleeping right, at some point in there I got a medical card and started smoking and vaping again thinking it would help, this is after things had somewhat started to improve.  And then I was having panic attacks from the weed again after maybe a few weeks to a month so I stopped again and was right back to the sweating the not sleeping the anxiety the not eating anything.
  I ended up having to move back in with my dad because my gf at the time wanted her own place (I don't blame her I was a lot during this time I had no idea what was happening to me I genuinely thought that I was going to die or kill myself whichever happened first.  Went to see a Lyme specialist in d.c and they prescribed me all kinds of stuff to treat the Lyme which I never took.   I was scared and also feeling a bit better so I didn't take em, anyway by the end of August 2018, I was flown to Texas to play in a pro pool tournament, did extremely well and was super stoked and proud of myself and never had any real issues after that. 
 I might have had some ptsd about the whole thing but never anymore anxiety.  Some really vivid bad nightmares for a few weeks to a month (all about my ex) but I was sleeping normal. Anyway zero issues after that point.  

A month ago I started smoking again, id kind of played with the idea but was afraid id have a panic attack.  So i started slow a little bit of bud in the end of a cigarette and I was fine.  Within a few days of that I went and got some bud and a bowl and took it nice and slow.  Maybe 2 days later I'm wake and baking stoned all damn day long, I feel great.  Maybe about a month or less of this and I have another panic attack and I puke and my friend comes over and I go to sleep.  Well then the next day all those fucking symptoms come back, so I'm like omfg my Lyme is back.  Than I started reading on r/leaves and now I'm pretty sure that I never had issues with Lyme and this was weed withdrawal the whole time.  Which I didn't even know was a thing but man it fits to a T a lot of the stories that I'm reading on here, and it kind of makes sense to me because while this sucks and the sleeping thing is total fucking bullshit (it feels like someone is bouncing me like a ball or something in my head as soon as I want to fall asleep.  Or my heart will race so impossibly fast I'm not sure if its happening or if its a nightmare.  These things only happen in the moments before sleep that seem to never come.

  But I must be sleeping because its been 7 days now and I think I would be feeling seriously unwell without sleep, plus like during the day while I pace a lot and have a lot of anxiety and stuff I also have parts of the day where I'm like okay I'm out of its gone I feel fine.  My dad says I'm nothing like what I was, my appetite sucks but I am able to actually eat and I've been drinking like a half gallon to a gallon of water a day.  So things are objectively better than they were last time, which would make sense because I haven't used and concentrates this time around, and that was always my go to on top of the buds.
  So I pretty much got over the whole holy fuck is my Lyme disease back (which if it is I can get an appointment and do the program as scary and as much as it will suck like chemo I can go through with it) (I'm one of those people who is weird about taking like an Advil or Sudafed, i rather just tough it out than risk side effects or something idk).  Never really thought about weed as a drug I always just advocated for it, never thought it could be addictive. 
 Now I'm reading all of this on r/leaves and I'm like omg what if this was it all along.  Which brings me right full circle to is this going to be another 6 months of sleepless hell.  My blood pressure was thru the roof, I went to the ER maybe 5 times through the last time like something is seriously wrong with me, I can't sleep I can't eat. I tried to talk to my friends about it and they were like oh wow just try a different strain.  I'm like its been 7 days and I have a good portion of my day where I just feel totally disconnected from reality and emotionless... I knew weed wasn't for me I'm not really sure why I smoked again.  Didn't think of it as a relapse and I'm pretty great in the willpower department.  I haven't had coffee or alcohol since the first time because i didn't know what was wrong with me, I've quit cigarettes' for months cold turkey and never had an issue once I set my mind to it.  That's my story, I'm on day 7 now just praying this isn't another 6 months of hell on earth, or longer.  I read about PAWS or whatever its called and I'm like omg these poor people, I don't know if I have that kind of strength lol.  I also read about the psychosis element and people saying they never recovered and I freak myself the fuck out, but then remind myself like well you did recover and you were fine and all the doctors visits and hospital visits never did anything and they didn't even give you meds and you were fine.  

tldr; I think I had weed withdrawal for like a month or two, tested positive and thought it was Lyme disease so I started smoking weed again a month of two later right when I started feeling a little better, and then abruptly stopped again, and went through another month or 3 of withdrawal. I'm done.  Not sure if I expect ya to have any input besides damn that sucks.  I'm looking forward to feeling like I'm just back and more connected to the moment so I can at least play some video games and enjoy myself.  It's really hard to parse is this psychosis or is this sleep deprivation lol",1

I have smoked my way out of money and so I’m here, trying to quit way before I’m comfortable quitting.
These past few days I’ve been smoking the bare minimum of what I can to try and survive but this is kicking my ass. I have a bunch of old leaves and stems that I’ve been breaking down and smoking just to take the pain that’s coming back away.
Not to mention the nausea! Oh my! I was not prepared to feel like I’ve been stuck in the back of a moving van all day, I am seriously struggling to eat anything or stop the horrible knotting of my stomach. I won’t even get into my poor poor bowels!

I’ve seen so many people who talk about their problems with smoking so I was hoping someone could try to help.
I’m just a college kid concerned for his health and I would appreciate it so much if anyone had any input or similar experiences. Thanks guys 

I think it’s best if I explain my smoking situation first and a little about me. I am 18, and have always played sports/worked out so I’m in pretty good physical shape, not sure if that has any importance. 
Whenever I’m home and throughout the pandemic, I have used carts with one of those diy wires where you don’t need a battery to rip the cart. I 100% prefer real weed but I can’t smoke at home with my parents so I smoke real shit about 2 times a week or whenever I can. The other 5 days I’ll rip the cart, almost always once in the morning and then I’ll keep ripping it from 8pm until around 2 when I go to bed. (If anyone uses carts you probably know that at a certain point the dab carts don’t get you anymore high, you get into a stagnant state of feeling like shit). That is the extent of my smoking, I would say it’s a lot but I know there are others who do a ton more than that. The only times I don’t smoke are if I’m getting super drunk, and then there have been about 5 times where I tried to quit but that only lasted 2-3 days each time. The weed I smoke is high quality mostly, and the carts are as real as you can get where I am from. 
So I am in my first year of college and the first semester has completely crushed my mental health. The biggest thing that is new is my anxiety. It is CRIPPLING. I have never experienced anxiety before this semester, but I really think that the weed is the source. My grades dropped, I almost failed like 3 classes but i can’t tell if it’s because of the weed or the fact that this virtual semester was so challenging!!! The issue is I am not sure if the weed is the cause or the cure of my anxiety, but I think it just depends on the day? 😕 I DONT KNOW, im just confused!! I don’t know what to attribute my worries to. I’m really not too educated on anxiety, but all I know is It affects me all day, I am very irritable, and constantly just feel like shit to put it simply. When I wake up in the morning, my head IMMEDIATELY starts pounding with stress and worries, it has turned into an instinct for me when I wake up I guess and it fucking sucks. 
The only time that anxiety/worrying goes away is when I smoke. I think that’s the dilemma most stoners find themselves in. 

The other thing that scares me is my lungs/internal organs (I really don’t know what specific part but my insides in general feel TERRIBLE) 
If I take a deep breath,  I shake a little bit when I try to exhale (the breath is not smooth if that makes sense, it’s kind of like after you get done crying and try to take deep breaths but you’re breath is broken up a little bit)  
The other thing is I have this constant, very wierd pain right in the center of my chest. 
I think this comes from about 2 months ago when I was shotgunning a beer. when I started to chug it my chest felt like it collapsed or something and I couldn’t move for like 10 minutes. Maybe it tightened up or something? I don’t know. But now whenever I drink, or sometimes when I’m sober, my chest and abdomen area have this unique discomfort that scares me because I’ve never felt that in the past. This part in particular really scared me.

With all of that said, I am a smart kid who feels like smoking is limiting me, but I don’t know if that’s true or if I am just convincing myself that it is bad. I fear these unknowns and just want any advice or input. I would really like to be able to keep smoking like a normal person instead of every single day because I am sure that some of my health complications come from simply using weed in excess. So my big question is for any high school or college kids who have been/are currently stoners, will we ever be able to smoke normally or will it inevitably lead to smoking everyday again? I also really want to know if anyone has similar physical discomfort from smoking. On top of that I would really just love anyone’s input on anything I said up top, thanks to anyone who read this",8

But I know that's now how life works.

I've been really struggling.

I've made it through arguments, an (now ex) cheating on my birthday. Being targeted at work by a malicious person. All without caving and getting high.

But I need support right now. As I've been feeling a shadow following me for weeks now. It says

""Just smoke a bit""

""Grab a small edible, it basically isn't even cheating, you arnt gonna smoke so you won't feel tempted after""

""You can handle cheating once, I mean you made it this far"" 

""Who's gonna complain if you don't tell anyone , just say you've been straight. I mean it's just one session."" 

""You've dealt with this much, you're sure to be able to handle one session""

My anxiety is still pretty high but I am working with my psychiatrist on that and hoping to find the right medications that work well for me. If you’re struggling, don’t give up, it’s worth all the hard work you’re putting into it. If you’ve thought about quitting...just do it. Dont let it take up any more space in your mind.

Back in March 2020 I decided to stop smoking and I made it 6 months but in September I relapsed and started smoking again. At first it was a few times a week but I quickly went back to smoking 6+ joints/blunts a day. I got food poisoning a week ago and during my recovery I barely smoked. I started to remember how free I felt during my 6 months of being sober and I decided I’m going to go sober for good. It’s been about 48 hours since I’ve last smoked any weed and I’ve been having some anxiety every now and then. I just wanted to know if anyone else experienced slight symptoms of withdrawal when they  first stopped and how long it took for them to go away. I know everyone is different but I’m just curious.,2

I broke up with my long-term girlfriend and I've been pretty depressed, but I still haven't smoked, so that's good I guess. 

Anyways, I downloaded this meditation app and it's been incredible. I really struggle with ruminating and anxious thoughts, as I'm sure some of you might as well, and learning how to control your mind through breathing is life-changing to say the least. 

Each session is about 7ish minutes, really easy to squeeze in, but I recommend it to anyone who's looking to clear their mind up a bit, especially if you're in the beginning stages of quitting!

One quote that really resonated with me was, *""Imagine you're driving on a highway; all of the trees that you're passing are your thoughts. Usually, we focus on the trees, trying to get a glimpse as they race by. This time, try to focus on the gaps between the trees, where you can see a glimpse of the sky or grass instead.""*

We spend a lot of time ruminating and thinking about every individual thought, but we never take the time to appreciate the space between thoughts, and just live in the moment. Anyways, I hope this helps someone!",12

I get so tired of my pain that I just smoke it away, so I can deal with less inner QQ about my shitty life. That just procrastinates the issues, so I have to find another way","I get so tired of my inner dissatisfaction with my life. Like I have smoked and been traumatized for decades. Now I have the power to wake up and face reality, but the mess I find myself in is a fucking nightmare.

&#x200B;

the last 2 times I have tried to really face life. Quit weed, quit habitual video gaming or social media scrolling, face traumas and past pains, face character flaws and spiritual issues, etc. 

&#x200B;

the more I really awaken, the more I'm like ""what a nightmare"" and I turn the covers over and hide under the blankets. I awaken to my life only to hit the snooze button with weed. Weed kills the pain. Kills the inner dissatisfaction with life that drives us to change, improve, renew, regrow. Pain tells us whats wrong, what to improve, where to go. Pain gives us meaning in more ways than one. Weed kills the pain. So while weed is a mercy kill (a way to put a suffering soul out of its misery), its not a part of you that you should be letting die. 

&#x200B;

So yeah. That keeps happening. And I'm getting wise to it. 

&#x200B;

I'm going to succeed soon. At first I was too eager to shed all my old skins, I was not afraid of what i might find hidden. And I was not afraid of consequences. But now I see thats just foolish. 

if there is enough pain, smoking weed seems like the least of the worries. If there is intense pain within, smoking weed is like a mercy kill to yourself. The other choice is intense transformation, which is difficult for anybody, even someone like me who has transformed their life before. 

&#x200B;

So yeah. I plan to quit smoking, but I need to do it in a better way. A wiser way. Because I know there is something there that I have been using weed for. A pain I have been numbing away. A power I have kept hidden and locked.",9

A recent post by u/Butt-Pirate-Yarrr explains this better than I ever could. Take 5 minutes each day to practice the art of not thinking and see how far you it takes you.

**Exercise**

Cardio, Weights, Yoga: Whatever gets you moving. Personally, yoga has been tremendously effective in reducing my urges to smoke. Studies have shown that just 12 minutes of yoga a day, for 4-5 days each week will have significant improvements on your mental health after 6 weeks.

**Healthy diet**

This doesn’t mean dramatically altering the way you eat but to be more aware of the things you put in your body. If you’re not vegan or vegetarian, try incorporating red meat, chicken, and eggs into your diet and see how much more energy you have throughout the day.

Kind of disappointed in myself this morning as I drank an entire bottle of Jack Daniels last night...the small one not the huge one, Its good for a personal. Had a great time just myself and listening to music. I woke up just feeling so ashamed it felt like as if i relapsed in everything in life like if i just got pushed back to step 1 when really that isn't the case its just all in the head.

Started incorporating meditation more consistently which helps me move in life with heart and not with my reoccurring negative thoughts. Id love to find some balance with alcohol but I think I've now come to a point where i DO NOT want to DRINK by MYSELF its just stupid and not worth it id rather wait for get togethers with friends like 1 or 2 a month and socially drink. I don't drink all the time and especially by myself, but those ONCE IN A WHILE times I drink by myself I INSTANTLY regret it, its like this insane feeling of being humiliated, i wake up regretting everything i texted or posted on my social media even if it wasn't so bad i can literally have a decent convo talking or texting feel tipsy not saying anything negative just having a nice convo laugh and etc, but i wake up and just feel like i did something bad like humiliating like if  looked or sound disgusting to someone else when that really isnt the case. I have this bad case of caring what other think of me when really i don't ..but. I DO at the same time.

I cant be so hard on myself when I am moving in the right direction with putting down the weed and masturbation. Usually you should take things one at a time and now i am proud to announce that I'm kicking alcohol for sure starting Sunday because my girlfriend is visiting this weekend so just gonna drink some wine or something, I am looking forward to being 100% sober in everything and just go FULL ZEN mode. I hate feeling ashamed , i hate feeling like i keep repeating the same mistakes, and i only feel like that the day after so its just not worth it anymore. I'm trying to chase the beauty of feeling like you DONT need to be intoxicated with something ...even if you find a balance for it. I deeply believe becoming sober will be the next cool thing because we will realize how much we are hurting ourselves.

Just another one of my un-organized posts just jotting down what's on my mind right now and releasing this off my chest never know if it helps someone out there.

2020-12-18 11:26:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kfo9st/a_little_late_on_the_post_but_i_recently_passed/,"A little late on the post, but I recently passed the 30-day mark! Thank you, r/leaves!","Friday, November 13th was the last day I smoked pot.

What started as a weekly thing to do during college, turned into six years of daily smoking. I had some interesting experiences, a lot of fun, consumed food like I was a trash compactor, and wasted a shit load of money. Back in October, I'd come down with a cold that forced me to really cut down on getting high. I went from smoking 6-7 times a day, to going cold turkey because of the virus and it threw my body for a loop; Uncontrollable vomiting, perpetual body and stomach aches, sweating through my clothing and bed sheets almost every night...It was a true nightmare.

When I got over the virus, I began to smoke again and immediately got sick but experienced a more intense form of the symptoms I described above. It got the point that I physically couldn't get out of bed and I was losing weight at a pretty rapid rate due to consuming \*literally\* nothing but liquids and some crackers. On November 13th, I spent most of my day throwing up nothing but bile and made the decision that I needed serious medical attention. What I initially thought was just symptoms of marijuana withdrawal, was confirmed by my hospital visit. I was experiencing CHS (Cannabinoid Hyperemesia Syndrome) aka severe marijuana withdrawal.

I'm 31 years old and I will never \*ever\* forget the image of seeing my 19-year-old brother sitting next to my hospital bed, while I was hooked up to an I.V. unit and struggling to speak or move without discomfort. He wasn't sad or upset, but in all of my inability to make myself useful in the moment, I could hear my thoughts speaking louder than I'd ever heard them...I needed to quit. I felt like such a failure of a brother and son.

When I made it back home, hopelessness really set in. I spent the first week feeling tired and weak and I was barely eating or sleeping. I knew about r/leaves for a long time and discovered so many stories similar to mine and some that were heartbreaking, so I found this sub to be a great place of comfort. When I was feeling alone, this sub would be a saving grace and it pushed me to work hard and clean myself up.

I'm now past the 30-day mark and I can honestly say I haven't felt so \*alive\* in years. Not since I started smoking, have I had such clarity on my thoughts and feelings. I'm still dealing with the anxiety (that I was not prepared for), I can't get through a night's sleep without having a lucid dream, but my diet has slowly gotten back to where I need it to be and I've been able to return to work without much of an issue. I don't feel like I'm quite where I need to be, physically/mentally/emotionally but I'd be lying if I didn't say how much better it is to not feel high all the time.

To the people of r/leaves, this seriously could not have been done without you. Your stories have been infectious and pushed me to drastically improve my life. I want to give a \*huge\* shout out to everyone on this sub who's given advice, told their story, or reached out to me. Thank you for your courage and honesty. Most of all, thank you for getting sober! You are better without drugs I'm proud of you. 

To the people in the early stages of sobriety, I know this is hard and seems like it will never improve. I'm here to tell you that it gets better with serious focus and patience. Remember, a day is a day and an hour is an hour; Each one that passes while you're sober is one more spent away from who you \*were\* and one more towards who you're \*trying\* to be.

I want to be a positive light for people who are struggling, the same way so many people were for me. If you're going through this and need someone in your corner, please do not hesitate to DM me. This sub seriously did some great things for me and I wish I had enough $$$ to buy you all a ""thank you"" gift, but I spent it all on weed over a month ago.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, r/leaves!",5

Urge logs help me because I can either walk 20 minutes, or wait the 20 minutes. So I have a bunch of columns of date, time, rate 1-10, length of urge, what triggered my urge, where was I/who was I with, How I coped and my feelings about coping, Alternative activities, substitute behaviors.

But I'm an introvert, I have a limit.

I've been a full time smoker for over 10 years (I'm 33) but first 10 grams in my teens. Smoking minimum a gram a day. 

It's now day 6 and food still repulses me. The smell, the texture, the taste, everything. I'm so hungry, I've tried so much (smoothies and juices made it worse) I've almost lost 5 kilos and am down to my weight when I was 15. 

I suffer severe PTSD and depression and my mental health is absolutely shot. I have therapy, medication, support, an amazing doctor and incredible supporting partners.  I feel like everything is pulling me back to using so I can function again. I want to lie to them all just so I can eat SOMETHING other than half a piece of bread or a spoon full of rice. 

I'm so worried I will develop an eating disorders (since I first started using weed because of an extremely unhealthy relationship with food as a teen) and now I'm trying to weigh up what's worse.

By the end I was burnt out and 60 pounds over my ideal weight. My mother fell sick with cancer and passed away  and during that time I managed to give up booze and smokes. 

It’s been over three years and I think weed was very helpful in those first 2 years as somthing to take the edge off when I wanted to drink or smoke. Now however I find myself helpless addicted to pot. I work at home as a music and podcast producer, it’s my dream job but I’m free to smoke all day and I do. I’m up to around 4 grams a day and I’m sick of it, I used to me a master lucid dreamer and now it’s all gone! Since I’ve found this page I realized two things
1)I’m addicted to weed and there is no moderation for me.
2) I’m not alone.

I think I’m afraid of being totally sober, I can’t have the off drink to help take the edge of if I wanna smoke, it’s just sobriety from here on in but I’m ready.

2020-12-18 10:06:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kfmrdv/life_on_loop/,Life on loop.,"Every day I wake up and it’s the same thing. I feel like it’s one of those Tom Cruise movies where he relives the same day over and over, and it didn’t make sense until I heard someone discussing a similar situation describing it as: “tired of waking up existing in a space that you’ve outgrown.” That’s my relationship with weed, time and time again I’m fooled into thinking “maybe it’s still enjoyable”, or “ I’m-just in college after all I’m only 21 and if not now then when” just to end up inevitably regretting waking up the next morning all groggy with a stout attitude In the morning “NEVER AGAIN” just to repeat the cycle at night. On top of that the symptoms of Anxiety, panic, and paranoia are hugely kicking in. over the course of 6 months I've gone from smoking a joint walking at night, to getting spooked smoking a joint in my backyard to getting even more paranoid and only smoking in my garage at night. I can barely drive without feeling extremely anxious, and in always super paranoid. have aspirations, I’m pursuing an undergrad in accounting and hope to be the first in my family to get my masters in the future and I believe I 1000% can as long as I stay focused. Especially growing up low income household with a single parent to be put in a position to capitalize on it when I’ve heard so many stories of relatives pissing away their opportunities, I think my family deserves to start achieving more and I want to spearhead the way. I don’t have a girlfriend or many friends not because I’m not social but I’m just too LAZY to reply to messages, to follow through on plans, to pursue girls, etc. When I was little I got suspended multiple times from elementary school before grade 3 until they tested me and placed me in gifted programs after discovering I was just a kid who finished quickly, got bored and always found my way into trouble. I had a feeling I was under the same illusion as an adult but I can address it such as: life is too linear and boring, working 100 years to die but hey if I can make it more interesting with weed or alcohol it makes it so much more enjoyable. I don’t think that’s the case, I think truthfully the difference in this situation is that I HAVE to be the administrator that moves me to another program and realize my lifestyle is not satisfying my drive, and drugs are NOT the answer they are only hindering at this point. I’ve quit before for military programs, jobs, school, etc so this time shouldn’t be the worst in the world. Quitting shatter and concentrated was the WORST, vomiting shaking, the whole 9. I was about 70 days clean 2 months ago coming off of concentrates and have only used flower these past 2 months so this time shouldn't be too hard, anyways thank you for listening to my long rant and please wish me luck on this step forward, this time feels different because this time IS different, I'm done.",4

It's hard because weed hasn't done anything bad for me. It just makes me feel good. I don't smoke (weak lungs already) so I don't have the lung problems from smoking/cough/smell in the apartment. I go to school, make good grades, I am planning on going for my masters. My boyfriend and my mother don't mind that I get high. I almost wish they'd tell me it was a problem so it would be easier to stop.

I got into doing edibles so much because of my major when I first started this semester. I was beyond stressed and got to the point I just felt nothing; I felt totally numb and it was scary. I already have anxiety and depression that I'm medicated for, but school was really weighing on me (I have since switched majors and feel a lot better). Then I was moving in with my boyfriend which was stressful and I lost a lot of money helping him with that and because of school, I'm unemployed. I do postmates sometimes, but I haven't been doing it often. Plus because school is online and there's a pandemic, I've been bored and lonely. My bf still has work and I'm alone a lot. I visit my mom a lot but can't all the time because she works as well. Long story short, I got into the habit of doing edibles every day/night. 

When I first started feeling lousy about it, I began thinking it was a stigma issue and I was afraid of being a ""bum"" but I wasn't because I still did dishes and cleaned and such. I thought since I felt better from switching majors and now I'm settled into the apartment, I should be able to just stop. But I just...I couldn't. I threw out the last of my weed and the next day went out to get more. 

I don't want to blow $40 a week on weed. I can't afford it. And I don't want to be in a daze all the time and now I'm wanting to try and lose weight and can't because I get the munchies. But that's not why I'm quitting. I'm quitting because I know addiction runs in my family from both sides and I feel myself becoming addicted. Every time I say I won't, I do later. If I get rid of it, I go and buy more and then regret it. My dad was addicted to alcohol and gambling and I never thought it would manifest for me into weed...but I feel like it has. Psychologically or otherwise...I just feel it and it's scary feeling like I don't have control over it. 

I just turned 23 a couple days ago so I'm going to try to turn my life around now. As soon as I post this, I'm going to flush my weed down the toilet.",16

I have a problem with my love for food that I've struggled with my entire life. But I tackled that when covid hit and lost 53lbs.  Wish me luck!,17

The last of the benefits of quitting seemed to come around the 6 month mark. Now I feel like my old self, and I never have cravings or think it would be nice to use it again.

The weirdest thing is that there seems to be a wedge placed in my memory, where I remember my life up to the point where I started using, and the time after I quit using, but the 3 years where I used it everyday are like a blur. I have a vague sense of how life was but remember few details aside from a few notable events. 

Thankfully it was only 3 years. I am looking forward, not backward, clear headed and determined to stay that way. I'm glad Iived that life so I know what it's like, but I am also glad it's behind me.",42

So 5 days ago I went on a long walk to a river in my city centre and emptied the last of my weed out of the bag (I got a film of it but this sub doesn’t allow it). I cannot describe how good it felt, it was such a huge relief to know that I’m not gonna continue wasting all my time and money on a plant that I once loved. Now I can divert so much more attention to things that give me meaning in life, such as running and playing guitar. The past 5 days have been a little tough (as I am ill right now too) but each day feels better than the last and I’m excited for a brighter future. Cheers for reading.",387

I wanted to share a bit of my story in case it could help someone; as so many posts on here have helped me over the last two weeks.

To begin I smoked an ounce of concentrates every month. I smoked for around 3 years and then I got completely sober from alcohol and THC in June 2020. In September 2020, I decided to start smoking again and I was using small amounts, but it quickly snowballed into a several times a day habit.

I started to taper off in November and it was very painful. My stomach did not react well and I have ended up losing 15lbs over the last month or so. Beyond the stomach pain and nausea, I was having difficulty sleeping to the point where I would just wake up hourly and then not sleep longer than 3-5 hours a night.

Dec 3rd, I smoked and was immediately greeted with a violent panic attack that sent my heart rate up to 155/90, my vision blurred, I lost feeling in my arms and legs. I was convinced I was going to die, but I got through it. That was the beginning of a very difficult withdrawal. I have been plagued with constant anxiety, tightness in my chest, shortness of breath, loss of feeling in my hands and face, insomnia, you name it and I was suffering from what I would consider very difficult withdrawal symptoms. The first week was what I expected to be the most difficult, but I was incorrect. 

Week Two has been by far one of the most difficult times of my life. I spent days in bed meditating, deep breathing and doing everything in my power to calm my heart and nerves. At these times, I would just nap to escape from the intense panic that consumed me. I even tried to go to the zoo with my girlfriend in an attempt to get some air and have a good day. I was so stricken with anxiety that all I could do is cry, deep breathe and meditate for the duration of the car ride. 

After that, I decided to speak to my Primary Care Physician and it was easily the best decision of my life. My doctor was very understanding of my experience and offered me solutions that would otherwise have been unavailable to me. 

Yesterday was a new day and last night I slept for 7 hours while only waking up twice! I am able to exist! I still have small issues, but now they are manageable rather than completely overwhelming. My experience was working closely with my Primary Care Physician and Therapist have really eased the burden of sobriety. I feel like I can make it across the finish line. I hope this helps someone.

That made me feel kinda depressed because my day free of weed didn't feel earned. Then I thought of something. Why not use the momentum of a lockdown during the holidays and fight my addiction like jujitsu? I have been smoking for 11 years since I was 15 and it has been impossible for me to go more that 5 months without smoking on sheer willpower alone. Somehow, someway I always found a way back to getting high. Maybe quitting weed is like in AA when one of the first steps is admitting that you don't have control and you ask a higher power for help.

I've stopped for a few years here and there, never because I thought I *needed* to but because someone else wanted me to.  Monday I didn't smoke.  I don't know why exactly, I just didn't.  I picked it up and put it down a couple times.  Wednesday I packed up all the edibles and cartridges I had left and give it to a friend.  Even a dugout my brother gave me when I was 15, gone.  My wife asked if I was sure I didn't want to keep it, I said it was important that I not hold onto it anymore.  I'm absolutely done.

It's midnight on day four without weed.  It's been at least 5 or 6 years since I've gone this long without it.  3 years ago, I admitted to myself that I don't actually like being high, just the other effects.  I kept on going.  ""Pain management"" I called it, and it was.  I tried to convince everyone it was physical pain only, but no.  I lied to everyone.  It was almost always about the emotional and mental pain.  It was so much easier to just feel nothing at all than to engage with issues, have unpleasant conversations, and that was within reach with a few seconds of hitting the vape.  I rarely took a lot (I have kids that I have to be coherent for) but it doesn't take more than bit to quiet down the scattered brain noise, the worries, the fears, the problems.

Four days in, I realize it was causing the noise in the first place.  The anxious energy, the ADD-feeling brain, the oversensitivity to emotional responses, the fear of tackling problems that seemed to big, the way of making problems bigger than they are, I can feel slowly but surely getting smaller and more manageable.  I feel like I have a shot at sleeping through the night tonight without breaking into a cold sweat and waking up every hour or two.

I start therapy on Monday with someone I feel I'm going to mesh well with.  I have a lot of baggage to sift through.  By then, the last of the strong withdrawal symptoms should be gone and I can really truly focus on fixing myself.",6

I've probably gone through this full cycle five times in the last four years.

When I start again, it's always okay at first. I'll get high at night or on weekends when I don't have anything else to do, and I honestly do love the feeling. I have anxiety issues and nothing else helps me relax and enjoy down time without constant worrying like smoking.

But every time, I end up using more and more. I lose my motivation and creativity at work and I can't manage my emotions without getting high. One of the times I quit, I got high in the middle of the day after an annoying conversation at work and felt like I needed it. I knew that was a bad sign, so I quit the next day. But I still went back to it a few months later.

The last time I quit was in March when the pandemic started. I had been getting high every day for a while and knew I had to stop anyway, and then fear about getting coronavirus with bad lungs felt like a good excuse. It was hell for about a month. I had all the usual withdrawal symptoms, and really bad insomnia. But after that, I was so glad to be clearheaded again.

It hasn't been an easy nine months, but I didn't have any cravings until recently. I'm not sure why exactly, maybe the holiday season which usually makes me depressed, but I've been absolutely dying to get high again. I've even been looking at dispensary menus to pick out what I want to buy. I catch myself wondering if ""this time could be different"" even though I know that's not true.

2020-12-17 23:04:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kfdp3y/meditation_is_saving_my_life_anyone_having/,"Meditation is saving my life. Anyone having anxiety issues, you NEED to try this.","I believe most people probably have a misconception about what meditation is, how it’s done, and what the point of it is. At least I did. I think the media portrays meditation as synonymous with introspective thinking. Sitting calmly and “reflecting” on your life. But in reality, meditation is NOT about thinking or reflecting at all, it’s actually about how to *stop* yourself from thinking, and how to just simply exist in a peaceful moment in time.

I once watched a video of some monk describing what proper meditation is. The metaphor he used is that your brain is like a monkey constantly chattering. Constant thoughts, worries, fears, hopes, constant chatter that becomes annoying and overbearing sometimes. So how do you stop the monkey from chattering, so that you can have a little peace and quiet? You give it something to focus on. For meditation, the focus is your breathing. 

Simply focus on what breathing feels like, how long your inhales and exhales are, how to breathe from your belly vs. your chest, how the air feels moving through your nose and out of your mouth. Get lost in the physical sensations. Imagine your negative vibes leaving you little by little with each exhale. Your inhales bring calming waves of relaxation throughout your body. 

Remember, the point is to NOT think at all, but to just exist in each passing moment. I find meditation 10x more relaxing if I do it with music playing in the background, but nothing with lyrics. Remember you are trying to stop yourself from using your monkey-brain, you don’t want words to distract you.

My current choice is “Miracle Frequency Music” on Spotify. The 428hz is my favorite. With or without music, give meditation a shot. If you do it right, it will blow your mind, guaranteed.


Edit: There are many styles and techniques of meditation. I am NOT an expert and I am just sharing what has worked really well for me personally.",487

Here's my experience so far.,"I smoked multiple times a day, daily, almost exclusively from a bong for the last 5 years. I recently moved to Arizona and knew I might encounter a drug test at my new job. (Aid in a Level D facility for special education and students with behavior patterns that keep them out of other schools) It demands a lot and is stressful. I don't know if that has helped or not. 

I'm a 133 lb, 6'2 male. 26 years old. Always had a fast metabolism and I walk about 5 miles a week. I work from 6:30 AM - 3:00 PM

The last time I smoked was December 2nd.

The first 3 days were the hardest. My anxiety and depression were at an all time high.

By day 5 I noticed a dramatic drop in both of those things. I haven't been this free of either of them since I was a teenager.

I haven't noticed any change in how ""present"" or ""there"" I am yet.

I've been able to relax by both friends and my brother who were smoking bongs in front of me, and have had no temptation to join. I thought it would be much more difficult. I DON'T RECOMMEND IT THOUGH. It wasn't a good idea for me to do this, I'm just sharing my experience.

The biggest downside I've experienced is I've had nightmares pretty much every night and wake up at least once a night in a cold sweat. It's hard to say whether that's from the detox or if I'm just not used to having such vivid dreams because the weed kept them from happening. They seem very realistic. There's a lot that has gone on in my life too that would cause anxiety and stress out any other sober individual.

If you asked me a month ago if I thought this was possible I would have very stubbornly argued that there'd be no way. Yet here I am. I probably could not have done this if my livelihood didn't depend on it. Special Education is my bread and butter at this point and is something I'm passionate about.

Earlier this year I sought therapy and tried to change my ways, but when the lockdown hit, I fell even deeper into a hole, smoking away instead of eating, meditating, reading and using my time productively.

Summer came along, and I pursued a change again, meeting a gorgeous girl who became the brightest spot in a dark, dark year. It was something I haven't experienced in years. Then I lost my job, a job which I despised. But it wasn't the god send I thought it would be. I escaped with weed, pretending again like things were fine when they weren't. I neglected to communicate with the woman I fell hard for, convincing myself she wasn't even into me....It all turned out to be the biggest mistake.

It has been 8 days. I've been trembling with anxiety, depression, self-hatred, and rage.

Things I know that I want to do, yet they’re things that I always do when I’m high.

I’ve been lonely for many years, starting when I was 18 and struggled to fit in school (25 now) Smoking weed made me feel okay to be alone for a while, because I didn’t have to have bad thoughts about being an outcast, I could simply smoke weed and just switch off.

But not this time, I know now I don’t and can’t have a healthy relationship with bud. I don’t smoke with friends (I barely have any anyway) I don’t smoke to enhance my life, I smoke because I do it to escape. That’s the problem, and maybe someone on here can relate too.

Time to quit for good, time to take off the bandage and accept the pain I feel right now, I feel hurt, I’ve cried , but I guess that’s a starting point, at least I’m not lying to myself by flooding my head with artificial dopamine. Time to bite the bullet, and use my loneliness and pain as motivation to change my situation. I don’t think it’s gonna happen all at once, it’ll take time for sure especially due to lockdown.

I stumbled across this community from its bi-annual post on r/trees and have been working myself up to quitting. Problem is I always found excuses and would put it off for the next day. Well it turns out my procrastination could be a force for evil AND good.

I used to smoke casually for years, but quarantine and working from home turned me into a daily user. I would smoke more out of boredom, and slowly started toking earlier each day since I didn't have to drive to and from university. Before I really realized it had happened I was burning through more than I could afford to keep up with, and became extremely dependent on it for anxiety, sleep, and just a crutch to use for completing mundane chores and tasks around the house. I knew I needed to cut back, but this sub helped me realise that I was strong enough to aim higher (pardon the pun) and quit for good.

I have pretty bad anxiety and ADHD, which all ended up being the perfect storm to turn my dependence into something harder to kick than cigarettes were. I started falling behind in university, and left a lot of my papers to the very last possible minute (and this was with multiple extensions and extremely accommodating professors). 

I ended up having to pull an all-nighter to complete a term paper, and didn't fall asleep until 11am (~28 hours awake). I can't do schoolwork stoned, and this is a line I was decent at not crossing (thanks anxiety, I guess?) I ended up passing out and was so tired I forgot my pre-sleeping toke. When I woke a few hours later I realised I had finished my first 24 hours clean in months! 

As of now I am on day 3 of being sober!! I have all this extra time I used to spend toking and half-assed multi-tasking that I don't even know what to do with now. I'm trying to keep busy and have reached out to several friends for a support network. It feels like I got a jump-start on New Years resolutions, but instead I'm excited to finish this year strong instead of labeling it a lost cause!",3

I'm finally social again, albeit awkwardly, but it feels really good to connect with other humans again and make new friends and reconnect with old ones. Also just having more energy and being less cranky in general. I did end up drinking a lot more to cope for the first week or two, but have started to limit my alcohol intake again and have replaced both substances with a lot more exercise. I'm in the best shape of my life, my mental health is better than it probably ever has been.   
I know trying to ever smoke again socially would just be a slippery slope for me, so I am done with weed forever (that's the plan anyways). No shame to anyone who is able to enjoy it in moderation; I wish I was someone who could do that. Props to anyone who is on their journey to quitting weed or thinking about it.

It's been a tough week, as I'm sure you all know. The withdrawal is tough to cope with, but with the right strategies I don't really have genuine difficulty abstaining. I went through a breakup shortly before quitting, and that has affected me in ways I didn't anticipate. Coping with the emotional pain is the hardest part, although it doesn't make me want to smoke again - I know that smoking won't solve my problems. In fact, it's likely the reason why these emotions are so difficult to deal with.

That being said, I'm happy with the direction I've chosen to go in. It's time to stop being a child - to stop relying on a substance to medicate the pain and dissatisfaction I feel. Recovery isn't a linear journey - there are days that I feel everything getting brighter, and days that I'm plunged back into darkness. Last night I layed awake, and was suddenly overwhelmed with anger - anger towards my own mind, which insists on going over every little detail of my breakup, and keeps telling me to cling to hope. But if there's one thing I'm learning, it's that I am not my mind. I see clearly now that the obsessive thoughts I get plagued with are just shallow attempts of my brain to get me to use again, and there's no way that I will.

TL;Dr been trying to quit, taper, moderate etc since April this year. Had varying levels of success and genuinely enjoyed being sober.

Over the months, my marriage took an absolute nose dive - not solely because of weed/my addiction might I add - and this led to a pattern for a few weeks where I'd abstain for 2-3 days and smoke, which just went on repeat. 

Most recently I managed to go about 18 days, then I relapsed last night. I am utterly miserable about the state of my marriage and I do not yet know what I can use to cope that isn't weed, so I fell back to it.

It was terrible. I had a really unenjoyable smoke and my heart started beating so fast I genuinely started to worry I'd have to go to hospital. It was a waste of money, a waste of time, and I felt worse than I did before I smoked. 

I've decided to try again from today and I will seriously reassess my life after Christmas (due to presents already being bought, family plans being made and how stressful the are because of Covid, etc I feel it would not be a good move to air all my woes to my husband and potentially cause a giant falling out which will forever mark Xmas (him and his family hold grudges). 

I know no one wants to hear my life story. But I just wanted a post even just for myself documenting WHY I relapsed, why it wasn't worth it, and laying my situation out so I can look back on this post and remind myself that I CAN sort this sadness. I need to not be high to do that. And that's possible.

I feel like I've been an absolute slob and when I look at old pics of myself I realize that I just looked a mess the entire time... I exercised but never consistently enough to help me reach my goals. And on top of that, I've neglected skills that I've always wanted to learn and I haven't improved my self confidence. 

I don't know if that's the truth or just my brain playing self hatred tricks on me. I mean, I'm better than I was 2 months ago, and I guess that's what's important.",5

2020-12-17 02:44:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ket2yu/day_1_looking_for_community/,Day 1 ~ looking for community,"Today I agonized over whether or not to pick up. Wishing somebody could decide for me. Wishing I knew what I wanted to do. Wishing weed made me feel like it used to make me feel. Wishing moderation was the way to go (and who knows maybe it is. But maybe it isn't). Wishing I could find out about terpenes and all the nitty gritty so that I could keep smoking every night. Wishing i could find the secret formula to enjoy the one thing that I used to never need to analyze or think about enjoying

But in all of that agonizing, the answer felt (sort of) clear 

I've been smoking daily for a little under 10 years. I remember it used to be so thrilling to tweak my reality because my actual reality felt unlivable. Hiding from my parents, feeling a rush, getting adrenaline whenever a song changed and the volume was a little too high. I remember everything being elevated. I remember all of the lovely conversations I had and all the relationships that have blossomed through smoking. I also remember all it destroyed. 

More than anything I remember the blissful moments. And I think I've convinced myself that I cannot feel that bliss without smoking. Walks, being outdoors, talking to the moon, creating, going on drives... and I also realize that this usage, being when I was actually doing things that felt good, isn't really the issue for me. 

The issue is stagnancy and procrastination. Sitting on the couch after work smoking and watching shit without even processing anything. Feeling my gaze get lost and not really doing anything about it. Procrastinating going to bed, for a reason I still do not understand. Weed has become my wind down method and pairing that with media consumption just is not doing it for me anymore. In fact it's undoing me. But I'm scared that if I pick up and promise myself to not use it in that mindless way, I will fall back. Sure I can meet myself with self compassion but what about doing whats good for me? What is good for me? And how can I figure out what that is know? 

I know I am strong and at the same time I know the urge is SO strong. It feels nearly impossible to smoke in those cute blissful situations,, on a summer day in the woods, on my porch in the sun, etc, without also smoking to 'wind down' i.e. zone out completely. Which may I add i do not want to zone out!!! Unlike when I was younger I actually enjoy my life and getting to know myself. But it's like there's this part of me that wants to avoid growth-- reading, learning and following my curiosity, making my podcast,  painting, and actually not doing anything but in a way that feels good. 

There's doing nothing and there's doing nothing stoned. For some there is no distinction (which makes it even harder bc I'm like ""WHYY CANT THAT BE ME!!"") but for me, doing nothing stoned makes my brain feel like i have 100 tabs open and can't stop switching between them and I don't remember what I'm thinking. It's scary sometimes 

Doing nothing sober tho, for me, is liberating. I have always been a stoner who gets shit done and I am a perfectionist with a compulsive drive to produce. If I'm not working, I better be self improving and reflecting. All the time. No breaks. Except when I smoke weed and zone out. 

But doing nothing sober, just being, is so different. Because I actually get to hang out with myself. Not do activities with myself or actively learn about myself, but just fuckin chill. Which tends to bring self knowledge anyway 

And it's hard because sometimes I can achieve this high. But sometimes I can't. It's all about my usage yet I cannot seem to grab the reigns on that. And like I said im scared to try to grab those reigns because every time I have, I fall. 

Today was my first day not smoking. But as you may have picked up thru this post, I am also having a hard time figuring out how to work w moderation, i.e. not use weed to zone out at night and procrastinate going to bed. 

All thoughts, advice, guidance, encouragement, etc is appreciated. Thanks yall",7

I'm so sick of having these hard-fought few-day stretches just to start over again. 

I think part of the problem is its just hard for me to see myself quitting weed ""forever"". I am at heart an alcoholic, and after a multi-year hard fought battle and 15 months alcohol free, I honestly have firmly cemented in my brain that I do not ever need nor want to drink again in my life. 

However, my attitude towards weed is much more lackadaisical. I see my alcoholic self as a crazy skid row depressive with nothing in life, whereas I see my stoner self as more Seth Rogen. 

Kind of a therapeutic rant on my end, but I guess my question is:

\-how can I really light the passion and fire for freedom from weed when honestly the consequences for me, while negative, aren't really THAT BAD, and I do have fun moments with weed? Its hard quitting weed bc I will never end up in jail, institutions, or death with weed",1

I’m starting to remember who I was 6 years ago, before I started smoking weed all day everyday, before it became my personality. I feel really excited for the future. 

Aside from crying, I also listened to a lot of music today & really really enjoyed it, sober. I got lost in the moment and sang along, sober. The song was “More Than A Woman” by the Bee Gees. 

Also— Jack Harlow came out with a pretty amazing album. Random, but that’s something that made me happy today. So I started to watch some interviews with him & came across one where he was talking about how he doesn’t smoke weed because it doesn’t do him any good. I felt that to somehow be a sign. 

Tomorrow is day 4. I just drank my sleepy time tea & I’m hoping to pass out at any second now. But for the first time in 6 years, I’m genuinely excited to wake up tomorrow to see what else I can discover about my sober self. It’s so much better then being in a smokey haze all day ❤️",11

I've noticed the downs I experience are followed by extreme natural highs, almost like level ups. Recently, I've been asking myself two questions: 1) ""What am I chasing?"" 2) ""What am I running from?"" Although these things seem opposite of one another they are very related. 

Love, success, and happiness are all things I am chasing and by smoking I am running from all these things. The depressive nature of addiction makes me chase and desire these things to such a degree that I feel the need to run and suppress, as conquering these are scary. For the brief time I am high (really just the few moments right after a toke) I dont crave or mentally chase. However, right after the short lived relief I am forced into an even worse state of desire and distress. By starving myself of my main habitual vice (smoking), I am forced to face what I have been running from. Instead of chasing and being lost in my desires, I am beginning to think and gradually work towards the things I was chasing in my stoned day dreams.

I posted my whole journey so far of the last almost 2 months of my sobriety. Initially my mental switch happened when the love of my life, partner of 3 years had broken up with me.. because of me hiding and continously lying about smoking weed.

This definitely drained her and felt betrayed-- now being clear minded I can totally relate to how hurt she must have been.

Today was the day when I decided to reach out to her (about 2 months of no contact).. and as much as I hoped for getting back with her.. she told me she was happy at where she's at and plans to remain single. It was like a needle went straight through my heart.. I realize now of being an addict and was making an active step to come completely clean of it.. and of course in my mind if 2 months were enough time I would show her through my actions.. but the damage has already been done.

We talked briefly about future and how in a couple years(2-3 years, random numbers she gave) she can definitely see to giving me a chance and working out a relationship-- as we both agreed we saw husband/wife material in each other. But as of now-- we both have to move on, both having to grow and be happy on separate terms.. and as much as I'd like to get back with her soon.. it was ultimately her choice and decision to be single as of now, and I completely understand and respect it.

So I guess the lesson learned here-- it was a blessing in disguise, I would've been in constant denial of my addiction because things were going great in my life as well as the relationship(or so I thought), but the true culprit that was inhibiting me from being present in these relationships as much as I should have.. was weed. It still hurts me right now deeply, and no I do not plan to relapse. This gives me more of a reason to better myself and to continue to grow as a person cus this will be an important stepping stone in my life. Although I need to move on with respect to her decision, I will not give up hope that we will eventually meet in (2-3 years). Should I completely cut contact or do I chime in within a year from now? This girl is my soulmate and I love her very much.. just the fact that this could be resolved by knowing my addiction and taking course sooner kills me.. Thanks for listening everyone I appreciate it deeply.🙏",5

I’ve kept away from oil vapes and other potent stuff during this time, and been on and off for periods of 2 - 3 months at a time. 2 months ago I bought a vape cartridge since they last longer and I was a bit short on money at the time. 

Over the course of these 2 years I’ve developed some tolerance and needed more puffs to get there to that comfort spot. But with this vape stuff which is much more potent, I quickly developed a big tolerance. I didn’t take a break this time, and went on to buy a second cartridge with the first one being done with in just 2 weeks of heavy use. On Nov 15 (last month), I got a call that a close friend had died from an aneurysm. I tried to null that pain by smoking non stop that day and the next. 

On Nov 18 I lost track of how much I had vaped, and had a huge bad trip that resulted in high blood pressure, racing pulse, I was pale with the whole room spinning and was sure that I was gonna die. My wife called an ambulance, and by the time they got here, I was already feeling better. Everything checked well so I skipped going to the ER because of Covid. Vaped again the next day, and had pretty much the same reaction, so I concluded that the weed was the problem and threw away all my vape stuff. 

Quitting had never been a problem for me before with only some mild symptoms. Days passed and I developed the common “cold turkey quit” stuff, but nothing serious. Until week #3 hit (this last Saturday)... I felt really bad again similar to the bad trip day. This time I went to the ER, but all checked out OK, was given a Vistaril to relax and sent home with a “panic attack” diagnose. I went on for 2 days without being able to eat anything, feeling very sick and miserable. I’m anxious all the time, paranoid, huge headaches, sinus pressure, gastric disturbances, can’t eat well, muscle twitches, my right eye twitches, and so on. Currently being checked by my doctor, and all tests so far have been good.

I just discovered that weed PAWS is a thing. I was always told that weed addiction and recovery is just a psychological thing and there are no physical symptoms. Oh boy, is that wrong... I’m just 4 days shy of getting to week #4, but if feels like its been a year. I’m faithful that this nightmare will end someday. Can anyone else relate? I’m not giving up hope of recovering, I know this will pass, and better days will come again.",2

I sleep easy-peasy now, I have a consistent energy throughout the day.

2 weeks ago. I was an addict.
I desperately wanted to take my own life, but for the fear of it, I just stood still; 
Fighting the urges and feeding them with a drug habit.

But now that time has passed, and I fought through myself, and the world around me
It's like someone took out my very soul, defragmented it, wiped away the dust and muck and filth, and put it back in.

Your stories have always guided me throughout it.

The longest I've ever gone is a month.  It's been tough because I literally live across the street from a dispensary, it's corona times, and it's so easy to feel sorry for myself and then go smoke.  I tend to turn to it whenever things feel a little blank and I want to dip out of the world for a moment.  I'm very tempted right now because it's a quiet night, I have nothing in particular to do tomorrow (the first time in a while it's been like that), and I've been thinking glumly about how time goes by and things change so quickly.  

But I think the reason I keep trying to quit is that I want to be someone more dependable, get more work done, and be more aware of things as they pass me by.  And the reason I keep relapsing is because the thought comes into my mind that I couldn't be that person anyways and it's sort of pitiful or pretentious to try, so why not just have fun and smoke? 

I'm hoping this time around it sticks, and I'm optimistic that it can -- I'm trying to keep myself accountable, keep working out and being creative, and try as well as I can because, as Drake said, you only live once.",3

So, long story short on why I'm here: used to smoke daily about 4-5 bowls, depended on it completely in order to eat and sleep, and didn't even enjoy it that much: I was in the same situation/cycle as most of us here, if I had something boring to do, weed made it enjoyable; if I did something I already enjoy, well, weed made it more enjoyable. I knew I was abusing it and, worst of all, nobody, even my girlfriend, knew I smoked so much (at most she thought I did it once a week... sure lol). Cut to around November 20th, I smoke a bowl, and 2 hours later (my high was long gone by then) I go to sleep. As soon as I close my eyes, boom, panic attack. Full fight or flight mode, an adrenaline rush. The next few days I'm so scared and having anxiety episodes I stopped smoking right away, fearing it might be related. I stop for about 3 days, then smoke again. Nope, anxiety episode again. What the hell? I decide to just stop cold turkey till I'm more stable. I don't know what the hell is happening to me, consider going to the psychiatrist and psychologist (huge procrastination issues on top of my addiction) for the first time ever. I quit for a week, feel a lot better, then decide to smoke a bowl to see if I can handle it. As expected, quitting for a week made my high ridiculously strong. No anxiety thank God, BUT, I just didn't like it. Sure, by the end I was relaxed, but I was more in the same state as before smoking. I just didn't really enjoy it. It somehow felt... invasive. Like, smoking a tequila shot. Too strong, made me dizzy. Can't believe I was putting this into my body 4-5 times daily. For some reason, something broke between me and weed. I just didn't like it. Decide that will be my last bowl for the foreseeable future. A week ago I started my therapy and after the worst of withdrawal has passed, I feel much better. It's been 2 weeks and 3 days since that last bowl, and haven't missed weed at all. Sure, I miss my old life, my comfort zone, but I haven't felt the urge to smoke at all. I know if I did I'd just feel weird and would want the high to end. I enjoy my life a lot more now, despite starting therapy, or maybe because of it.

Ive been using for more than 8 years, and the last 4 years felt more like a warfront within me; Knowing how high usage would ruin my focus, energy and logical thinking and yet having  the urge to use and let my mind loose above myself.

I tried taking feeble steps too many times, although some of them felt like huge steps for me (ik 2weeks might not seem a lot to many), I always found my way back to using with a promise to take it undercontrol, and of course failing.

Idea of managing and enjoying life soberly, felt like a lost paradise to me for a long time, but everytime I aimed I would miss somehow. However im happy I took all those shots and tried, and had this long process of thinking and weighing my decision and never letting it go completely, because just now I know how all those trials tought me something about myself, my value systems and my inner yearnings and motivations.

Tonight after deliberating about my current situation, I made a promise to myself, and the love of my life to do what I have to do, and let a new chapter in my life begin; Maybe I had a long prelude, but I hope I learned my lessons well enough to write the next chapters consciously, with responsibility and respect for what I can bring about.

These amazing community has tought me a lot of valuable lessons, from all walks of life, so I just felt to give back in someway, wishing to glint even the tiniest glimmer of light in someone's mind.

At least - I told you to get lost

And you took the best of their lives

Away from them

I'm 24 years old and I smoked my first joint at the age of 14.
I didn't like being high back then. But when I noticed, that it helped against my anxiety, I got deep into smoking.
That was in 2015 and since then, my consume level increased.
I was sober for half a year, but relapsed when corona started.   

The worst about the relapse was, that I suffered a psychosis in august and I really thought I lost my mind.
I was still smoking after the psychosis because I thought, it would be the only way to cure my anxiety. 

Few days ago I came to realize, that smoking actually makes my anxiety a lot worse and that I am completely driven by my weed addiction. I want and need to change something and maybe this sub is a good start for sobriety. 

First achievement: 
I threw away my crusher and longpapes today

I feel like I have no footing and momentum, so I guess my question is where do I begin? How can I build something that will make me not want to sacrifice it by smoking again?

At 22 I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression and I thought smoking was going to help with it as it has for a lot of people I know. However, since then I’ve had this battle with it where I know it makes me feel worse but I can’t stop. It’s there when I’ve had a bad day or when I just want to relax but either way it never makes me feel “better”. In the last couple years the derealization/ depersonalization has set in more and more and smoking now has really just become a routine. Without it I feel bored and with it I feel numb and sometimes nauseous. 
This is day 2 of not smoking and I honestly just feel relieved. I’m doing this to gain clarity, memory, and to bring myself back from the fog. So far I have told everyone in my circle I’m quitting and got a cheap ecig to help with the desire to smoke. Wish me luck!",8

I'm not a heavy smoker, but even a few puffs of smoking and getting high will do the trick, so I'd smoke a joint or two a day.

It's day 3 fo being sober and I feel like I got hit by a truck. I'm having physical and mental symptoms that are seriously interfering with my day, such as: brain fog, migraines, stomach aches, nausea, feeling cold, heart palpatations, and intense anxiety.

I've taken a break before and it resulted with me having the same symptoms, except I had anxiety and panic attacks for a few weeks. I really want to drain my body from these symptoms (probably because of the THC), so that I can get back to feeling normal, and possibly somking a joint every now and then without feeling like it's gonna stop me from being productive the next day.

I understand that it takes a couple weeks until these symptoms will go away naturally, since the THC is still in my system. I would really appreciate any advice, including home remedies that can help. Anyone else experience this?",1

Quitting’s tough, that’s not denied,

Feeling hopelessness inside,

Wondering if your brain is fried,

Pain you think you can’t abide,

Like a part of you has died.

Mental anguish, tears are cried -

Talk about a bumpy ride.

All you want to do is hide,

Your inner voice begins to chide,

But soon enough, you’ll hit your stride,

And find that life you crave to guide,

Achieved by many far and wide.

So tough it out with strength and pride,

I’ll see you on the other side.",22

I rarely actually wanna smoke weed, but everyday for the past week or so, i have been feeling like something is missing, until i smoke some weed. Bare in mind that i have a veeery low usage, not even 0,1 in the evenings as whenevery i cave in, i only do it in the evenings to fall asleep (not sure if it's insomnia from nicotine withdrawal or because of the weed).

Here are some things I have been doing to help my body  and mind recover that may help some other people.

1. I am spending a lot of time on this Sub. Reading posts and trying to help motivate others is a much better thing to preoccupy my mind with than the fact that I have given up weed.

2. I have been trying to keep my body moving. Nothing too intense, but house cleaning and walking my dog often to keep my metabolism up and help break through the trash in my system. I also throw some pushups in.

3. I am listening to lots of music. It can be cathartic and as many of you know the mood swings, irritability, depression, anxiety and general fogginess of the mind are intense when you stop. I am trying not to pay too much mind to these feelings and just let them pass. Music let's me experience them without too many thoughts joining in trying to attach to these emotions.

4. My appetitive is still completely gone but I am trying to nourish my body to help it heal ""'Let thy food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food"". I have been eating mostly foods that fit within Mediterranean Diet parameters. This is simply because this diet has the most scientific evidence backing its health benefits.

I was always clearing my throat. At night when I slept I would feel like it would cost me to breathe like I couldn't catch enough air.  None of that me want to quit until 11/27/2020 I got a headache so bad that it wouldn't go away. I still have it but it's not as bad. The first week I quit was awful! Night sweats, nausea. My emotions are all over the place. I feel very fragile and things that stress me out like arguing with my family or partner makes me want to smoke. The only thing that makes me not crave it right now is the headache I still have that in 1 day will be 3 weeks. 

I really love pot. I wish I could I could be that person who can do it once and a while but I abuse it. I hope I'm strong enough to leave it for good.

Posting here just in case anyone has an experience like mine and needs reassurance to keep going. I had a horrible panic attack 48 days ago after smoking, worst I have ever had. I decided on that day that I was done with weed and done with the juul. Quit both of them and for the first 40 days or so I had pretty bad anxiety every few days. Not panic attacks per se, but definitely feeling very uncomfortable from general anxiety. I also noticed that my hands were tingly and numb sometimes, which really freaked me out. Now, on day 48, I've had about 8 days straight of feeling mostly normal (limited anxiety) and not really having cravings to smoke now that I've broken the habit. Some things that helped me when it got rough:
- Taking a long walk (seriously, I didn't think this would make a difference for me but it really did. Try to get yourself talking about whatever is on your mind, super therapeutic)
- Melatonin (helped me sleep, beware you will have CRAZY vivid dreams for a while!) 
- Fixing my typing posture (the hand numbness wasn't actually related to the weed, it was Repetitive Stress Injury from typing on an elevated keyboard)

I have to say even though I had some seriously stressful days after quitting, it's really nice to be in control and be able to enjoy things sober again. I used to use weed to 'enhance' basically every activity. Gaming, working, reading, watching tv, eating... All were prime times to convince myself how it would be that much better after a toke. I've had to find new ways to occupy my time, but I found myself doing things I gave up previously. Picked up my guitar again, started learning to code, and am trying to be more present in my relationship. 

This is a big rambling post but the bottom line is that if you're on leaves wondering if it's worth it to quit, it is. Food will still taste good and games will still be fun, you just have to put in some work along the way to train your brain to enjoy those things on its own. I still have my cart and battery in my closet but I've started feeling really proud that I can turn down that temptation, every time I see it is a chance to practice my self control and it makes me happy to make healthy choices. You can do it too!",9

Evening thoughts: Dec 15,2020","I am coming up on 3 and half weeks off the greens and have been experiencing a steady blend of ups and downs. I'm currently 21 years old and have been a regular smoker since I was 13. My use has linearly increased since I began, plateauing the past 3 years as I have been constantly high beside the rare t-break. The longest break I have taken since the beginning of my use was 5-6 weeks and I often question why I returned to daily my habit. 

Over the past 7 years my relationship with cannabis has transitioned from healthy loving experience into a battle. As a teenager, I had the same beliefs as the young stoners in the comment section of youtube videos, claiming ""weed is harmless"" ,""weed can't be addictive"" etc. I remember the first time I recognized my dependence with cannabis, I was a sophomore in high school; I am now in my final year of college. For awhile, I demonized the plant, blaming cannabis for the pain and difficulties I was experiencing. Obviously this is false, as a physical thing like a plant is not that powerful. I personally used weed as a vice to deal with the issues and insecurities I have with myself. I blamed a plant for my issues when in reality my internal beliefs and demons were the true cause of my suffering.

Cannabis is a wonderful tool and in my early days of use showed me new perspectives and helped me grow. However, I know many people who like me transitioned their relationship with plant into a vice which suppressed their demons.

My last t-break ended with and unusual high, it was awesome. Unlike the typical effects of cannabis, I felt motivated. I looked at the guitar next to me telling myself ""I can master the guitar"" ""I can learn fluent Spanish"" like these tasks were easy to master. Analyzing this experience, I understand why I constantly used after that even though I swore it would just be one time. I'd normally say it was the sneaky nature of sweet sweet marry however my internals thoughts and previous patterns drove me to constantly numb myself. I had sufficient dopamine in my head as I had starved myself of this neurotransmitter for the past 5+ weeks. I felt healed, fixed, reborn and it was awesome. However temporary, I smoked sun-up till sundown everyday since then, and that was 6 months ago(besides the past 3 weeks:)). I dont regret it, as my last attempt to quit taught me a valuable lesson this time around.

I have felt incredible natural highs without weed that compare to my high explained above. I have also experienced dark times of depression and regret since I stopped smoking. I have been processing emotions, crying and managing anger I am normally able to simply suppress by taking a bong load. It has been difficult, especially during time like these. I need to make new friends who are not always stoned, but this is difficult when the government is requiring us to stay inside and isolate. I made this post because I know others are experiencing similar thoughts. I am so grateful for the words others have shared here as it has helped me immensely. I hope my message is able to help someone else and aid them in coming to these realizations without the years of trial and error I have experienced.

much love <3",3

But my anxiety is stronger than any high and taking bong rips all day, everyday through this global health crisis was starting to get to me.

I always knew I'd do it someday, always had goals/dreams of living sober so I wasn't surprised when I woke up one day a couple weeks ago and felt...different. It was time. I enjoyed one last day blitzed out of my mind, cleaned my bong and gave it away.

Today my family is going through a very painful time. It's rough, but I am so grateful to be sober right now. Since I've had time to go through any withdrawal crankiness/side effects, I can be fully present and supportive to anybody who needs me. I'm not thinking about when I could sneak off to get high so I can handle the situation, I'm just handling it. I'm okay!

The timing was perfect for me and I hope it's perfect for you too. Good job everybody, I'm proud of us!

Maybe memory and emotions coming back made me want to trace my steps on this quitting journey*****
 
Heres a quick story in years;

12 years old: I smoked hash in a pepsi can and giggled hysterically in a forest.

13 years old: I smoked bongs before a school disco and whitied. I got suspended from school and caused a lot of trauma to my parents. I got beaten up for grassing on two people.

14 years old: I was with a bad crowd smoking weed. I stole my dads bike to pay for it. He still doesn’t know. We even went to the police together.

15 years old: I was smoking in a park and my parents walked past. My mum gave me a hug and said I know what you are doing whilst sniffing me and said go home. My dad never knew. Later my mum searched my room and found hash and a pipe. She thought it was crack because there was foil. She sent me to drugs counselling. I resisted.

16 year old: I got arrested and given a caution for possession. It broke my heart to tell my mum and have her come to the police station.

17 years old: skipping classes at college to be a stoner.

18 years old: I was dealing for around 6 months.

18-21: smoking throughout university. Quit boxing, football, guitar, skipped classes. Lived in smoky unproductive houses. Got a 2:1 but just about. I would say this is when I started to not like it and  seriously notice its effects on my motivation. I put on weight. 

who knows? This is life. Stuff happens. I made some mistakes. I feel bad for my parents. I would get super stressed if I couldn’t get it and punch walls. But we are moving on to the next phase…


22 years old: I’m in Korea teaching English with a girlfriend of 3 years. We got hash 3 times in the entire year. It wasn’t in Korea really. But I do remember smoking that hash on hot knives and being angry that we couldn’t get any more.

23 years old: my girlfriend got very upset once when I smoked in the garden without her secretly. 

24 years old: we moved to Turkey. We smoked hash together for a month. Decided we didn’t care for it. No big deal.

25 years old: broke up. I quit smoking. I remember very well having weed in my drawer and not touching it or thinking about it.

Didn’t smoke for a year and a half

26 years old: moved to Spain with best friends. Started accepting spliffs again and then smoking full time again. It led me back to cigarettes.

28 years old: Moved to Vietnam. Smoked every now and then. Didn’t really care for it.

29 years old: smoked a few times a week. Had a lot of motivation.

30 years old: I specifically remember smoking for first time in 3 months with a girl and getting extremely paranoid in the bedroom. Really remember that feeling.

31 years old: spent one holiday in HCMC and smoked all time. Always bush weed.

32 years old: I want to quit. I know this because it is n my journal. Usually it was a mix of quitting and starting again through one drunk toke. Same same tobacco. Start of heavy dissonance thinking. I know I have to quit.

33 years old: had a bit of a panic attack mixing weed and something. The something brought it up but the weed ignited it. The spliff was in my hand. Didn’t touch it again for 6 months….2 puffs. That was in Thailand before a job interview. I remember being very paranoid.

34 years old: in Malaysia. Didn’t think it was in the country for 3 months. Had two puffs on the beach with an Indian girl. She drove me home. I remember clearly thinking we were too close to other cars. I was too paranoid to invite her in. Went home and remembered what munchies are. Smoked for next 2 months and stayed at home a lot feeling lonely. Wasn’t hiking and socialising like before.

Next phase…return to HCMC! Work very hard to get a six pack.

35 years old to now….high grade…you know what I mean? Bush weed wouldnt give me a buzz now. 

This is 2 years of seriously wanting to quit! Now or never mentality

Here I am now! I need to change my relationship with weed. I get addicted to it.

I did quit;

In Bali 2 months ago I had the time of my life! Natural smiles and laughter. Couldn’t find enough hours in the day to write and read. Lots of evidence of this. The thought of smoking never ever crossed my mind.

I get back and think to get some to take to a beach town. I smoked a small joint of bush weed and it knocked me for 6. The next day I was reminded of that tired feeling. Its not bad…but smoked in mui ne…remember allowing myself to mix tobacco. I am a smoker again. Here I am now;
 
I get addicted to weed!

I am not allowed to have it again!

When im not smoking i do so much work on myself

What do we know?

I get addicted to weed with one toke! I have had long breaks in the past. I get super paranoid with that one toke but that doesn’t stop me from continuing…months fly by! Its rewarding to break the cycle but i slip back. 

I cant be breaking my promises again now or in the future. 

Its only one compound in the world that I choose to put in my body. 

Clearly I want to quit. But what’s stopping me from doing it now? 

What’s different about the present moment than some moment in the future when i think i will quit for good. 

It has to be now.",11

It kills me that I spent all that I had left of my mom on fucking weed. I dont think ive ever felt more guilt in my life. But as many of you know.. this shit is a vicious cycle. I start thinking about how much money I've spent and I beat myself up over it until I feel so shitty I cave and buy another eighth, smoke it in less than 48 hours while simultaneously telling myself I absolutely have to quit this time because I can't afford another eighth, and repeat, over and over and over.
I make maybe $250-450 every two weeks at my job.. and I'm spending over $120 a week on weed.. did I mention I have 4 dogs, 6 parrots, a cat, and a few other pets that all require regularly financial support and stability??

2020-12-15 16:48:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kdvbvu/withdrawal/,Withdrawal,"I've been smoking all day every single day for about four years now. I really wish it could be a once in a while thing, but it isnt and never will be. I go to work high. I do my schoolwork high. I drive high. I think what really cements my addiction is that if it were seriously affecting my physical health, I dont think I'd bring myself to stop. If it were killing me, I'd let it kill me.

The thing I'm most scared of is the insane withdrawal. I've quit both cigarettes and blow before (was a heavy user of both), and for some reason my pot withdrawal is way worse. When I'm sober I feel like all the happiness is drained out of the world. Anxiety and depression becomes extreme to the point where I'm still contemplating how it's even possible. My body aches. I cant sleep at all, not a single wink. It feels like time is moving very slow and it just lasts forever. The longest I've made it was 12 days and on day 12 I was curled up into a ball crying. Nobody even believes me and they keep telling me it's entirely psychological but I swear it isnt. It's physical. I dont know why this happens to me. I think it's like how some people can handle alcohol and stop drinking it with no issues, but for other people a single sip is enough to push them over the edge and create or reinvigorate an addiction.

I feel really low. I'm not in control. My friends and family laugh at me and tell me pot isnt addictive and this shouldn't be hard for me. It is the hardest thing I've ever done, and like I said before I've struggled with ""worse"" addictions in the past.

The whole break up is making me extremely tempted to just say fuck it and go back to smoking seeing as she was the main reason I was quitting. I’m worried I’m going to fail and go back to smoking even though I really don’t want to, I’ve fallen off the gym and my bjj/ mauy thai training, and really don’t feel like leaving my bed in the mornings.

Woke up EXTREMELY emotional.,"The first few days are always the easiest because your so motivated to changing something that's been a daily habit and it feels good to COMMENCE and start , the first few days are easy...Until about week which is now.

I have had multiple breaks longest was 1 month, and in all breaks this has ALWAYS happened. You just find yourself very sensitive and emotional as you acknowledge the idea that this for the long haul and not just a few days, I have no problem putting weed down but when your body starts to get that weed out . your emotions take a huge spin man your feelings come alive and you have choice but to face them and not smoke it away.

I woke up not feeling too rested and found myself quickly overthinking which leads me to a bad and dark mental state being if I let it , so I go and put on a movie that I didn't finish the night before about alien invasion and in the end they beat them and it was so again.. emotional for me i find myself so much more connected to characters and the plot like everything has a emotional affect for me again which is beautiful but also so depressing and terrifying since we are used to numbing that pain and forgetting about it in matter of seconds rather than having to deal with it head one for hours or days , this is great for growth in life as it makes you tackle whatever underlying problems there are in your life but omg this feeling i always forget about and reminds how MUCH weed ... just ... masks ... like its a whole different light being weed free.

Typing this I'm on laptop and feel way better after that movie I just had to distract myself and make a reddit post , I'm also doing NO FAP haven't been eating MEAT or really unhealthy snacks so a lot is going on but the feeling of being slave free from yourself and abstaining from pleasures just letting go is a wonderful thing I love the fact that I already saved about $100-150 alone on WEED in just 5 days.

I Feel way more connected to my family in the sense that I use to be so mad at myself for being so high and on another planet while my loved ones and mom is just on the other side having all this time go by without hanging out with them or stopping to tell them how much you love them last thing you want is to be so high that times passes by and YOULL REGRET a lot of things ...

My current girlfriend is flying from Miami this Friday to stay for 3 days and she doesn't smoke weed so I look forward to staying with her for those 3 days which then lead into Christmas and then spend time with family home, watch some movies etc. just hang out. The next 30 days should be very good I'm looking forward to ending 2020 on a positive note with change that I wish to carry on into 2021. I just never thought id feel like I just want to hold someone so bad... I want to be the best human being I possibly can to others there's too much that I regret in the past and quitting weed is helping my behavioral problems and making my Decision Making Better, if my decision making is better I am way less prone to doing or saying or acting a certain way that I will indeed regret.

This was a very difficult morning that took me by storm but looking forward to continuing my streak and hope everyone else out there is going strong we are no different from each other we all came to realization that weed has held us back and made split personalities for way too long that psychoactive change EVERYDAY is no joke.

Anyways , this may seem a bit unorganized I am jus jotting down my mind right now and its helping so much I love being apart of a community and I just want every to be happy and healthy. I am looking forward to seeing my beautiful beautiful girlfriend who I am more grateful for, looking forward to spending more time with my mom, looking forward controlling my anger issues ,looking forward to releasing all my music that I have been sitting on FOR NO REASON but overthinking which is caused by the weed, looking forward to just taking back my life and not being so hard on myself <3. if you took the time to read this i appreciate and love you and I hope this post helped you from not picking up a joint or masturbating!

I was smoking around 9 spliffs per day, and quit entirely.  I feel **sooooo** much better. It's weird but now that I don't smoke, it almost felt like I was smoking out of obligation rather than desire. Like, I would smoke because I was 'supposed to' be smoking, rather than wanting to actually be high or have some kind of stress-relief.

Since quitting, my self confidence has increased a lot because I feel like I am finally able to conquer and complete something that I wanted to for so long.

My hair smells so much better, my eyes look clearer, and my skin looks smoother. I can breathe easier and I can tell my teeth are becoming more white. I can't wait to see how much more improved my physical appearance is even 1 more month from now! Aside from that, I've had friends who do not smoke weed tell me that I sound more alive, that my thoughts seem more organized, and that I seem more confident in holding a conversation than I was before.

It is still hard at times, not to turn back to the habit I had for so long, but I'm doing healthier alternatives to keep myself busy.  I've been able to clean my living space more which is a great distraction, take care of my personal hygiene better (painting nails, doing hair, etc as a distraction), and get in touch with people who I felt ashamed to talk to before quitting because I was stoned. It's so relieving to finish a task and not have to ""run away/hide"" to go get stoned on my own. I can't describe the freedom I feel.

I don't regret quitting smoking weed at all, and I'm so happy with myself for finally being at a point where I was able to accomplish this.  I know the cravings will continue for months, or even years, but I never want to go back to my old way of life again.  I feel like I outgrew my marijuana habit, and I don't want to regress back to that as a coping mechanism.

I still live in a household with active smokers (both weed and tobacco) but I'm hoping by living a sober lifestyle, I'll be able to finally gain employment and be able to move out (and maybe even inspire them to reduce/stop too!)

I'll keep you all updated.  If you're reading this right now and debating if life without marijuana is better, ***it is so much better.***",35

Whenever I try to take a tolerance break or quit, I get terrible nausea and withdrawals. Usually they only last a day or two. 

When my friend was visiting the past month we smoked more than I have have. Like smoked half an ounce in 2 days, taking a dab after each episode of America's Next Top Model, high from waking up to going to sleep kinda smoking. Now that he left, I experienced withdrawals just going back to my normal amount.

I want to stop all together at some point but based on how bad the past week has been (with still smoking), I am taking my time. I haven't been able to eat much and I've lost almost 12 pounds. 

However, I wanted to share some of the best things that have helped me through the nausea, vomiting, cold sweats, etc.

1. Hot baths with Epsom salt 
2. Saltine crackers (a bit lighter than Ritz)
3. WATER
4. I drank Pedialyte when I couldnt eat anything but again talk to a doctor
5. I heard laying on your left side is better than your right but I curl up in the fetal position with a heating pad on my tummy
6. As soon as I got any kind of appetite, I took advantage of ate something nutritious. I bought Ensure shakes, vegetarian chicken noodle soup, oatmeal, etc.
7. For the diarrhea, I use the BRAT diet: unripe bananas, white rice, applesauce, and toast. Especially when there was absolutely nothing in my stomach, these foods were a good foundation to start eating again. 

Please add your own tips for nausea, vomiting, dealing with withdrawals below! 

If the nausea is really bad, talk to a doctor! Be careful of dehydration and lack of nutrients! 

We got this! It'll get better",6

I quit 18 days ago. Decided on cold turkey after smoking one bowl per day before Covid and sometimes not every day. But when Covid came my intake quadrupled and I hadn't taken a day off since April.  I don't like how it makes me feel. I don't like the lack of control I have and it brings my anxiety on both when I do and when I don't smoke. Its just constant.

Anyways, cold turkey has not been great. I commit to 7 days before I allowed myself to give in if needed (light in a tunnel) so I managed 8 days before side effects, headaches zero sleep, and no appetite were too much to handle and smoked a tiny amount. Just a roach I had. I figured a small vessel, no reload option would be good. After all, the purpose was to just allow relief of symptoms, not like, get High high... 

After the 8th day bump in the road I continued on my leafless journey for 4 more days and ended up smoking with a friend on day 12. No excuse this time, I just caved because I made a choice. Simple.

Get. Back. On. The. Horse.
I'm on.

Not encouraging lapses, just trying to mitigate some of the self-hate that can cause people to completely give up when they come. 

From Hermann Hesse’s ‘Siddhartha’-
“We are not going in circles, we are going upwards. The path is a spiral; we have already climbed many steps.” 

If that lapse comes, you don’t fall back to the bottom of the spiral, no matter how much it may feel like it. You have all the work to show how far you’ve come: lapsing after 3 days of abstinence following years of addiction is still 3 days spent not smoking. Just keep climbing those steps.",5

Am I alone in this and maybe I have something else going on or this another weird withdrawal thing? 🤔",3

Ok guys I’ve grown a lot this past year. I was never a smoker. I didn’t start smoking heavy until 19, I just turned 23 in October I’ve quit any addiction , adderall , percs , ecstasy ,and porn and drinking , I’ve been porn free and masturbation free for 6 months , I’ve been off adderall 6 years from being on it heavy in highschool.  By far weed has been the hardest habit for me to kick I’ve smoking heavy for about 3 years now. Weed has ruined my life and it’s put here because it keeps us in a box refusing to let us out of our comfort zone that by far is a dangerous drug. My everyday life centered around this drug I would go home go to work spend all my money on weed. That was my cycle keeping me in a terrible mindset , that is what weed does make a person complacent idc what anybody says. I didn’t take care of any of my responsibilities , I was lazy didn’t wanna do anything with my life , weed changed me mentally , and I was just not myself or the confident  guy I used to be. My dreams an ambitions went out the window. Weed made me a very boring when that’s not who I was , weed ruined my conversation skills , and the guy I once was. It’s ok cause I’m working on me. In January when my relationship went sour and we stopped talking and I started exercising to cope , my mindset has changed a lot I’m growing mentally moving on from old friends , and that old relationship I was miserable in. But I’m growing so much but it’s so hard for me to kick weed . Today is the day , There’s so much more beauty to life than this drug. I tried to quit in January and relapsed during quarantine  , now I’m quitting again, and my grandad just bought me a car , so I can no longer afford the drug , i have bigger things I want in life and I’m moving on, I lost all my friends and relationships , and weed is apart of my past. Wish me luck on everything guys I can do this!!! There’s big things in my future please don’t let this drug trap you were bigger then this!!! 👏🏽",7

Last 5 years I've become a regular smoker.  First I smoked with friends, then became doing it by myself.  When I get some free time, all the thoughts are about how to get high as soon as possible. Smoking and PC gaming are my most popular activities. Even if there was a week or more without weed, even when I decided not to smoke... Everytime, after real quick brainstorming, I'm again smoking it. I just do not controll my will and body well enough...

I've read some posts on this community, and realized that my problems are solvable. That not only me have same situation. The question is - how to keep motivated? Because, even if i brake up this circle chill, next time I get lonely - and I'm smoking again. How to keep the progress stable? 

I keep remaining myself, that its necessary to stop spending my life like this. And it feels right, looking forward for day I'll stop for real.

I’ve been a lurker for the longest time but the community here has helped me realize that I have a shitty relationship with marijuana. I started smoking when I was 17, and it was the best thing in the world! There was no hangover the next day, food tasted amazing, and the enhanced sound of music blew my mind (I am partially deaf so I really valued this aspect) 

At first I thought I had a good handle on things. There was no way I could get addicted to weed! But after 3 or so years of daily smoking I’ve realized that I am dependent on it to function. I am in a constant fog. I used to be an honor student and now it feels like I can barely form a proper thought in my head. I am self conscious of the fact that I am not as sharp as my peers anymore. I also have extremely disordered eating habits and weed compounds that tenfold. I would smoke a few bowls and binge on takeout from 4 or 5 different places and purge. The thought of spending a night doing nothing but smoking and gorging myself was (and honestly still is) exciting to me. I am tired of not being able to wake up on time the next morning, hacking and coughing like a pack a day smoker, and spending my days stoned on the couch avoiding my responsibilities. 

I’m on day three since my stash has run out and so far no intense cravings have hit me. I keep waiting for heavier withdrawal symptoms that everyone here talks about to hit me but nothing so far. If anything, I am enjoying not waking up feeling stuffed from munchies the night before. I started taking melatonin for sleep but it’s not doing much for me... Any advice on that would be totally welcome. This community has been so helpful for giving me the final push I needed to quit! Here’s to hoping it sticks this time.",4

It’s been quite the emotional roller coaster. I last updated at 11 days so it’s not really that big a deal.. but I needed to vent a bit. 

The last week was really tough. The physical withdrawals were super intense and the fatigue was pretty much taking over. I couldn’t find the motivation to do pretty much anything. Bless my boyfriends soul for helping me eat and do basic house hold tasks. 

Sunday came though and I was so disappointed in the fact that I had stopped going to the gym, even though I knew my body needed the rest . I could feel myself starting to desire to be back there, though. I spent the day doing laundry and cleaning up a bit and got a good nights rest. I set myself a goal to start doing some light cardio this week, no pressure though. 

Today was a decent day. I had a slight headache and still pretty irritable , still some fog - but not quite as much . I did notice that I no longer smell that cloud of pot smoke around me , for the first time . It’s such a weird feeling,  I can’t quite put my finger on it. It’s like part of my aura or something has been altered - in a good way. 

Anyway, I got home and ate a nice dinner. Laid down for awhile and finally - FINALLY... decided to get up and get to the gym. I did some stretching and headed for the treadmill...

Wow ... if you thought running felt good as a smoker , it feels even better when sober. Let me start by saying - I am slowwwww . So slow lol. It sucks. But I did some sprint work and definitely was feeling so freaking good. And I feel like I am not going to be taking 2 steps backward by destroying my lungs with smoking directly after my run. I’m excited to hopefully make some real progress and shave some time off my mile .

But then , a tenth of a mile to 2 miles and I reached up to my nose and realized my nose ring was gone. And I know, I know - big freaking whoop, a nose ring. But it was real gold and I paid almost $200 for it 4 years ago. It was so unique... and a huge investment. For someone that only has one other piece of nice jewelry, this crushed me. 

All the good I was feeling completely crumbled. I can’t believe how devastated I feel. And I really don’t have the money any more to buy something of such nice quality. (Thank you pot for taking all my money). Anyway.. I’ll get through it - but it just really bummed me out. I will try my hardest to continue to be motivated and to look on the bright side of things...

2020-12-14 21:05:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kdcc3z/3_days_in/,3 days in!,"Hey everyone, I just want to start by saying I am so grateful to have found this community. The support system is unreal. I am 25 years old I’ve smoked weed since I was 13. I became a daily smoker at 16 and for the past 9.5 years and smoked every chance I could. 

There have been several times I have thought about quitting and have attempted to do so. Every time i decided to quit, it wasn’t because I wanted to improve other aspects of my life, but because I wanted to prove I could live without it. I would stop smoking 3-7 days each time and then pick it back up again. I was able to tell myself “Nick, you did great. You went a whole week without weed. See? You can live without it”, but continued to smoke after that. I wasn’t quitting. I was taking a T Break. 

I discovered there were two reasons holding me back from quitting. 1) I was quitting without purpose and 2) everyone else around me was still smoking even when I quit, making it even harder to abstain.

After discovering this subreddit, I realized that despite living a happy and high life, I was complacent with where I was and had no interest in bettering myself. I would work all day high, giving half-ass effort and then I’d get off work and smoke a little more while playing video games all night. I let my house go to shit, I let laundry pile up, and I was watching my health 
crash and burn. I realize now that there is so much more that I want in life and weed was killing every bit of ambition I had. 

I am currently 80 hours sober. I worked harder at work today than I ever have. I read part of a book on my lunch and even hit the gym when I got off work. When I got home, I cooked my dinner instead of ordering UberEats or going through the Taco Bell drive through. Shoot, I even made my bed this morning! 

I am happier, I feel healthier, and most importantly, I am MOTIVATED. I wanted to thank everyone for inspiring me to better myself and my life. This community is truly amazing.

One last thing. For anyone considering quitting, it will be the best thing you’ve done for yourself. I read somewhere on this page that weed should be a way to treat yourself when you get to where you want to be in life. I’m not there yet, but I know that I’m on my way there and in the driver seat. Here’s to my new life!

Long time addict here. Quarantine has made it so much more difficult to stay sober. I used to use going to the office, the gym, playing sports as a way to stay sober. It used to be so much easier for me to go Mon - Thursday sober and then Friday's and the weekend were kryptonite for me. With quarantine and me having my own apartment, my self discipline is fucked and I'm struggling so bad. 

For reference, I'm a millennial with a job in finance who's ambitious and actually smart, but I let weed prevent me from reaching my full potential. My entire life, even to this day from my parents, I hear about my potential. I am not living up to it because they see there is more from me. 

We put ourselves in a mental prison.

I really appreciate this community. I've tried to quite a few times over the past year, no attempts have lasted longer than about 40 days. I'm currently on another attempt, a little more than a week in, and how do you deal with emotions coming back? Just little things make me so emotional, anything from stress-related events to cute puppies to anything really. Some of the emotions are good, but it's all so much and I feel really awkward when I see a cute puppy while walking or something and want to tear up. Do people know how long it takes to get used to that raw emotion feeling and how long it'll take before I start to be better at regulating my emotions? And what techniques can I do for myself to get better at regulating my emotions? My emotions are overwhelming most of the time, which is hard at work, with social/romantic situations, etc.

So I’ve just joined, desperate to quit the devils lettuce but after 2 or 3 days cold turkey I feel like I literally lose my mind and that is no exaggeration, it’s seriously scary.

It’s so much so that I hate smoking weed now but I still am because of that feeling I get when I haven’t smoked it, which I think is partially down to lack of sleep but honestly it’s terrifyingly bad.

I’ve smoked it since I was 13 daily for 20 years and I smoke very small amounts now. But without that small amount I genuinely feel like I lose my mind and the feeling is so horrific I always end up smoking again after 2-3 days to get rid of the feeling.

I’m unable to work when I feel that way like I’m losing my marbles which is another reason I am worried to stop. I hate smoking it but I feel like my body doesn’t cope without it. I know people say it’s not addictive/doesn’t affect you that bad but I can’t even begin to describe how bad it is.

I’m at a loss and that’s what brought me here. How do I get out of this cycle? I’ve tried cold turkey and tapering but both have the same effect given time.

Has anyone had the same problem of serious mental issues like you’re going insane when giving up?

Any tips, remedies, anything to help is very welcome. I want to be free of it now, I’ve had enough. It’s by no means been detrimental to my life, but I just want to feel more alive now and I feel ready but my body and mind seriously struggles without it, especially my mind. 

Hope you guys can help me and I will soon be saying I am weed free!!

I started using cannabis and alcohol when I was 15 after my mother had a mental breakdown. In British culture, this is really normal. However, the extent to which I did it in comparison to everyone else really wasn't. I imagine it was due to a lack of parental supervision and also a taste for extremity. From the first day of using, I began doing it every day.   


By the time I was 18 I started using drugs like MDMA and cocaine on a weekly basis. I continued to smoke cannabis and drink alcohol daily.   


By 19 I knew I was in trouble and I had my first serious attempt a quitting. I decided to go to University to get away from the group that I was hanging with as they were all heavy into it. But when I got to University, I seemed to have found myself hanging around with the exact sort of people as back home. I continued to use.   


I had countless failed relationships and friendships. I also had some successful ones too. It wasn't all bad. But what was bad for me, was the feeling that my using was out of control. I was getting more into cocaine as time was moving forward and as I grew into my chosen profession (finance).   


By the time I was 25 I was addicted to cocaine and was drinking around a litre of whiskey daily. I decided to get into MMA, as I thought that would solve the issue. 

I saw health professionals during this time to also help me with my mental health and really get a better understanding of my mind and the route cause of my addictive tendencies.   


It is no surprise to hear that I ended up spending around 4 hours a day in the gym, working out, fighting and learning discipline. I did this for around a year and didn't touch any drugs or alcohol. At the end of the year, I decided to go back to using as I felt really isolated from my previous friends and way of life.   


Shortly after using again, I found myself back in the exact same cycle. Drinking heavily every day, smoking cannabis (on occasion) and using cocaine 3/4 times a week. I also was working around 10 - 12 hours per day, 6 days per week to support my addiction. I really had no life.   


During this phase, which lasted around 5 years, my mental health got worse. I was more aware of my behavior when I was drinking and that I really did want to stop. It was like going to battle every day and loosing. Feeling defeated at the end of the day and swearing that it would change tomorrow.   


When I hit 31, my partner went to live in a sober living community to meditate and learn more about secular Buddhism. I told her that I wasn't able to join her as I couldn't live without alcohol.   


At this stage we had been together for 8 years. And it was clear to me that alcohol (and drugs) had a stronger hold over my desires than the person that I loved and cared for. So I decided to go to AA.   


When I went to AA, I went to atheists' and agnostic meetings as I do not believe in God. I met someone who took me through the steps and I also read a ton of books, learned more coping mechanisms - particularly stoicism and REBT. Now I am clean for 2 years.  


I am really proud of myself. It's a huge achievement for me.   


If I could say something to my younger self, it would be - keep trying to get clean. It'll work out for you. You're a good guy and everything is going to be okay.   


If you're trying to do the same, I would also say the same to you. It's going to be okay. It's going to work out.",99

2days ago I told the boys and we took my bong out and smashed it somewhere safe, smoked a joint to say goodbye. 

Its now day 2 and I've stopped smoking before work because the thought of rolling a joint and smelling like weed puts me off. 

I've now made it a lot more difficult for myself to get that quick high and its showing, I'm considering money, my relationships, things I want to do for myself ... I'm more determined than ever to stop being so skinny and actually appreciate what's looking at me on the other side of that mirror.

Smoking made me remember what I didn't like about it. Mostly the sneaking and the smell. It was a nice distraction, but it didn't change any of the reasons why I felt so overwhelmed.


-I'm still homeschooling my autistic kid with no outside support.

-I still hate my job.

-I still have no close family, as I am permanently estranged. 

-My friends are keeping safe from Covid like I am. 


Weed didn't change my feeling of bone-achingly loneliness or isolation from the above. It just gave me a break. A break of mostly paranoia.

The smoking gear is my roommates so I can’t just toss it and hearing the constant coughing / smelling it makes it rough.

2020-12-14 15:07:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kd5c7s/day_1_wastefulness_destruction_goodfellas/,"Day 1: Wastefulness, Destruction & Goodfellas","For the past 2 months I tried quitting, but each time I still had some bud in the grinder, or resin in the pen. Each and every time, my thoughts would make this u-turn, and I'd be back to smoking:

""If I were serious about quitting, I'd throw it away, remove the temptation.""
""But I spent good money on that green, just throwing it away would be a waste!""

I'd then resolve myself to finishing that last batch, and when I ran out, I'd panic and buy another 8th or another cartridge. The cycle was vicious and I was acutely aware of each and every step.

Funnily enough, it took me watching Goodfellas while high (and riding out the beginnings of a second-hand panic attack during the helicopter sequence) to really get it thru my head that the core thing making these characters' lives so messy, making ME so stagnant, is the insistence on short-term gains and short-term waste being the be-all & end-all.

I took a walk on the beach, and did the math. The REAL waste wouldn't be a single unused cartridge, but the money and time spent maintaining my own miserable stupor. Cannaboids were making me sloppy, groggy, lethargic, when I have so much I need to DO, so much more than I CAN be, SHOULD be, than a zoinked-out wastoid licking his wounds in perpetuity.

So I smashed the pen. I took a rock to it and bashed it against the wooden plank walkway with the same dejected malaise I feel when tenderizing chicken thighs before tossing them in the shake and bake. ""This small waste,"" I kept thinking, ""will prevent larger, more costly waste in the future.""

I'm scared of the cravings I know are coming down the pike, and I've already felt the physical pull in my chest towards that source of comfort I just demolished not 16 hours ago. But I've faced worse than this, DONE worse than this, and got thru it just the same. I have no doubt in my mind that I will be better for it, and for that reason it wasn't much of a waste at all.",21
2020-12-14 15:04:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kd59sr/day_19_better_every_day_i_quit_pot_after_smoking/,"(Day 19) Better every day. I quit pot after smoking every day for 3 years straight due to a panic attack. Dealing with anxiety, intrusive thoughts, and mood swings.","I know these symptoms are fairly common, but I think what’s unique about quitting after a panic attack is it wasn’t really up to us to stop smoking, we just don’t want to lose our shit again. So we stop. 

Just some background: I know a lot of people continue smoking after weed “turns on them” and causes them to panic, but as someone who has been fairly mentally strong all his life without any anxiety whatsoever, this sudden terror I felt after smoking scared the shit out of me. That’s why I decided to stop smoking cold turkey after 3 years of ripping concentrates and bud every single day. 

-The Panic Attack- 

This panic attack happened the morning after a night of ripping a bong just a few times. I don’t usually use bongs, and most of my experiences with them are bad since it’s kind of difficult measure how big your hit is gonna be until your inhaling it into your lungs. This particular night, 19 days ago, I had some anxiety after ripping the bong, but kept myself under control even while shaking a bit. What fucked me up was the next morning. I was totally sober (so I thought), until I was sitting at breakfast with my family and began to feel as if something was wrong, but wasn’t nervous about anything in particular. I began feeling kind of hot, so I went upstairs to take a cool shower so I wasn’t causing a scene. This is where I broke down. I turned the shower on and off several times, with the feeling that I was losing my shit growing by the second. I was pacing down the hallway back and forth as my heart raced until I finally got some control. Understandably, I was still freaked out and felt it could happen again at any second since I’ve never experienced a panic attack before, so I spent that whole day in my bed. 

- Physical Withdrawals -

For me, most of these lasted about a week to a week and a half. Symptoms began about 3 days in and included loss of appetite, cold sweats, mood swings, heart palpitations, and insomnia. Heart palpitations have lessened, but still have them today along with occasional sweaty palms when I’m letting intrusive thoughts get to me. 

- Psychological Effects -

These effects were particularly unexpected for me and very hard to deal with at first. I am an incredibly happy person, which is why I was shook as hell when I started questioning my purpose in life, having intrusive thoughts that scared the shit out of me, feeling like I’d never be the same again. What I didn’t know is how incredibly common these symptoms are after quitting marijuana after heavy use. It has to do with a “numbing” of your parasympathetic nervous system when smoking heavily, which causes your sympathetic nervous system to remain active most of the time (which causes intense anxiety). Someone explained it much better than I did [here.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/WeedPAWS/comments/irxdud/the_most_effective_way_to_recover_from_weed/)  

Since I no longer craved weed due to my fear of having another panic attack, I was associating all of these symptoms with my mind losing its shit, rather than my brain not being used to no longer having thc as a constant source of relaxation. I had no idea how damaging heavy and daily marijuana usage could be. But it gets better with time.

- Recovery -
 
For me, the psychological symptoms were significantly harder to deal with (especially the anxiety and intrusive thoughts). You need to be patient with yourself in the first 1-3 weeks. You WILL feel like you’re losing your mind, just let it happen. If you’ve smoked as heavily as me or even heavier, give your brain a minute to figure out what the fuck is going on LOL. 

You will have intrusive thoughts. You may even have a few more panic attacks like I did. This is NORMAL. What helps me a ton is accepting your intrusive thoughts. They are not real. Feel your body reacting to them, pay attention to your heart rate and pace of breathing increasing, and do your best to untie that knot of tension in your chest while you slow down and relax. Focus on physical symptoms. Let your brain do what it wants, because if you try to fight it, you’re going to lose. PERIOD. This is all normal. You’ve had pot to numb any negative thoughts for so long, don’t be surprised that they’re all gonna come flooding in at once, just let it happen. 

At day 19, I’m amazed how I went from thinking my life was screwed a week in, to having incredible confidence in dealing with this screwed up situation now. You’ll hear it in ever other post, and you’re gonna hear it again here too: the key is TIME. Go easy on yourself, your restless brain, and take a deep breath. You got this.

Stay strong everyone, keep a warrior mentality and let’s all kick ass together.",11
2020-12-14 14:50:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kd4zr4/3_weeks_clean_my_battle_with_weed/,3 weeks clean - My battle with weed,"Hello to all the leavers and contemplators. I want to share with you all my story because it was those stories from others that inspired me to finally make the change in my life that my body and mind were waiting for. 

I’m 19 years old, a second year college student, smoked since 15 and since 16 almost every single day. When I first started smoking, I loved it so much. It made hanging out with my friends so much fun, too much fun you could say. At first it was a spontaneous thing, once every couple of weeks, but it quickly spiraled into something that took control of my life. 

I ended up smoking every day, justifying that it made me better at my hobbies, playing piano, drawing, and creativity in general. I loved the weed culture and all of the statistics about how harmless weed is, and I was surrounded by other people just like me. Both of my older brothers were smokers and many of my friends in high school too, so it was very normal. Until I was in my first year of college, life wasn’t so bad. I graduated high school 4th in my class, got an amazing scholarship to my pick college, had my goals in sight and had a beautiful girlfriend. All of these things made me say to myself, “wow my life is so great, marijuana isn’t hurting me at all, if anything it’s helping me!” Well I’m here writing this so I was wrong. 

The thing with weed is, the negatives have a snowball effect, slowly building up so that you can’t see them right away. This plant convinces you that you don’t need it, but it’s so safe and fun that life is just better with it. Then when you don’t have it life seems miserable and dry so you end up smoking before any activity, even the most mundane tasks, and maybe worse - the important ones. 

Halfway through my first year of college, me and said girlfriend broke up. It was extremely painful for me, because I realized it was my fault. We were in a distance relationship, and I cared more about getting high than giving this lovely girl the attention and communication she deserved. However this plant prevented me from dealing with this pain. I masked it by smoking even more amounts of marijuana than I already was, which made my problems worse. The weed was stripping me of the characteristics that made me human, my emotions, my mental clarity, my focus. I began caring less about school, and more about who I was smoking with next. Less about my closest friends that I had for years, and more about which strain of bud I wanted to get next. 

This process lasted for a while, slowly spiraling downhill until I was just a shell of my former self. I lost my drive, forgot about my goals. Spring 2020 into fall 2020 was the culmination of it all. As COVID took me from living at school, I was now living in my bedroom, smoking 24/7, finding excuses to leave the house to go smoke with people when I wasn’t smoking alone in my room and playing video games, not giving a singular fuck about school and my dreams of being an engineer one day. It felt like my life was falling apart in front of me, and all I could do was sit back and watch. In my head I could see that I was letting things go way too far but I couldn’t change my actions. I just needed that high, I was scared of life without weed.

Over the summer I was a pool boy, smoking all day at work, and then more at home. I kept smoking, ignoring my actual friends and just hanging out with people that smoked weed so I wouldn’t feel alone, even though I felt more alone with these people than I did by myself in my room. It was at this point that I began to feel that feeling many people on this sub mention, wanting to get high when you’re sober and wanting to be sober when you’re high. 

This semester was when things got to a point that I new change needed to happen for the sake of my life. I felt emotionless, not happy, not sad, just drifting through life. When I would hang out with people I could barely form sentences, had zero confidence, and was always in my head and not present. I still wanted to smoke though even though I realized what was happening. 

I ended up failing two of my classes this semester, didn’t tell any of my friends. I felt like trash as someone who used to be referred to as an excellent student and very smart. This sparked something inside of me. I couldn’t keep letting my life get away from me, I wanted to be how I was in the past; funny, confident, smart, a person that was fun to be around. It was around this time I discovered this sub, reading people’s stories motivated me. I knew I wasn’t alone in this battle of plant vs zombie. I gave my older brother the eighth I had left. 

The first few days were hard as fuck, but if I have one thing to share with you all that helped me immensely, it’s running. I guess any type of exercise will do, but running is the hardest thing in the world for me to go do. Since I’ve quit, I’ve been running every single day, the high that you get after doing something that difficult and physically intense beats any high from weed, and it instantly lifts your mood for the majority of the day, which helped me forget I was even craving weed. It also helped me by increasing my appetite, I know people struggle with their appetite after quitting weed but I felt nothing of the sort. Some days the motivation to run is so low, but I just force myself to get out there and at least do 2 miles. It has seriously been helping. 

Now that I’m 3 weeks clean, I can’t begin to explain how well my life has been going, and I’m never looking back. I was scared before quitting that I wouldn’t be able to enjoy hanging out with my friends anymore, because I was always high when we chilled. I hung out with them a few times and just declined any weed, didn’t go into detail of what I was going through, but you know what? I enjoyed hanging out with them sober more then I had in the whole past year. My confidence after 2 weeks is almost where it was, my mental clarity is coming back slowly, but more than anything else, I feel like I’m in the drivers seat of my life again.

Since quitting I’ve gotten back into running, began playing more piano and drawing better than I ever have, the “weed makes you more creative” mindset I was in was totally untrue. I applied to a few different jobs, made an appointment with an advisor at my school to get back on track with my classes and make a plan to graduate. My mood is 1000% better, I can actually talk to my family without snapping at them, and I actually enjoy their company. My confidence with people and girls specifically is back, I’ve felt like people are already treating me better, and I think it’s because if you don’t respect yourself, people aren’t going to give it to you. I started learning how to invest in stocks. Oh yea, I can actually wake up in the morning on time now and don’t feel like shit. I stopped wasting money on fast food and actually care about my diet now, and I’m saving money.

What blows my mind the most is I’m only 3 weeks clean, i feel like a new person already, and I can’t wait to see how I’m going to be in a few months. I can’t even imagine smoking again, when the only
negative is it takes me a little longer to fall asleep now (melatonin bois). One thing I don’t do is focus on not smoking, I don’t count the days, I never got any apps to track my progress, I didn’t even throw out my bong. I feel like those actions are very surface level, and to really change you need to evolve your mindset, which comes from deep within. I feel like focusing on not smoking only reminds you of smoking. This worked for me, I’m not saying that that strategy doesn’t work for anyone, it’s just some food for thought. 

So at the end of the day do I miss weed? A little. I guess I wish that I was the kind of person that could not take weed smoking to the extreme, and balance life and your goals along with it, but I know that’s not me. For the sake of my future, I can never go back to where I was. I think my withdrawal symptoms were pretty mild compared to many of you on here, but I think that running / meditation helped a lot with that. The worst part was the first week I was a little moody and I had some anxiety, but that has subsided. 

I can’t thank this community enough for changing my life, I love all of you guys. 

TLDR: I quit weed 3 weeks ago and my life is significantly better now. <3",23

It felt mostly harmless for many years. I was smoking about an 1/8th a month. It built up slowly to about an 1/8 a week and it just kept going up. In addition, I was buying stronger weed as industry standards went up. During those years I was diagnosed as bipolar and put on medication to help with that. Those were rough times. I still consistently smoked weed, but often skipped or down right quit taking my medication for weeks/months. For me, weed was also becoming a financial issue. I tried to quit many times with little symptoms, but only ever made it for a month at most. In 2016, I took a trip to Cleveland and didn't smoke. I did have some stronger symptoms without weed for those few days. I felt tense, tired, had trouble sleeping, loss of appetite, and lost focus both mentally and visually. Got back from the trip, lit up and felt relieved. Months later I tried to quit with similar symptoms and failed. During that time I started dating my now wife. We both smoked, trying to quit many times. I would often fail, then go to buy weed feeling guilty and having to admit my failure to my wife. It did become an issue, but mostly supportive. For me, being bipolar and having issues receiving medication/care and my inconstancies taking it, made it especially difficult mentally. This July (on my bday), I had a less serious type of heart attack called an NSTEMI. I was in the hospital 7 days because they weren't sure what was going on. I also have stomach issues and they were investigating that. They had me on a strick diet while I was there and had me on my medication consistently. I didn't smoke the whole week. I was released from the hospital feeling the best in my life. I lost weight, felt clear minded, heightened senses, inspired to help people, compassionate, and happy. That same day I bought weed. It smelled incredibly floral and I started smoking again. It was great, but after about a week those wonderful feelings faded. I was told to keep a healthy diet, but I started eating junk again. Went down that road and found myself smoking as much as I did before. I also quit my medication. My wife got pregnant and I knew I needed to get better. I tried a few times to quit without success. It was causing stress and created friction and my wife is now 6 months pregnant. A few weeks ago I started weening and getting in touch with a doctor to get my medication in order. I had many symptoms like before getting off weed, but my mind was out of control. It took until last Friday to see a doctor and receive medication for my disorder. It has helped to ease my mind and I am one week clean! 

I still have cravings for the greens, but am confident in my success. I haven't reached those wonderful feelings like after my hospital visit, but I feel great. I realize that my medication is helping and it is not purely from quitting weed, but for me it is still a success! I see it like this: At my worse I was smoking at least a 1/8 a day, up to a freaking 1/4, and my best I was smoking 0. 

For me keeping busy and having the tv or radio on consistently helped. My best to everyone quitting:) Stay positive and not afraid of seeking support.

-Daniel





Note: The verdict is out on wether or not my stomach issues are from Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. I had 2 doctors in support of that diagnosis. I had nausea and vomiting every morning for months, also lots of cramping. Doctors found a nodule in my stomach, but I am not sure the cause of it or when it came to be. So I didn't want to present anything as truth with that issue.",2

Another go starts today","I have been trying to quit since I started. Weed has never been that beneficial to me. I have used it as an adhd ""medication"", but that's just a long winding road of justifications. 

I love certain parts of it. I love the interest and motivation that comes with that initial rush. I love the ways it provides a different perspective on some things. I don't like just about everything else. This year, in 2020, I had a period of 90 days (12 Jan - 12 Apr) where I didn't smoke. A pact with a new roommate. We both wanted to quit. He made it most of his, I made mine. Then we were back to smoking all the time. 

I have been doing better the last month or two, with periods of 5 - 7 days in between smoking. Sunday comes, and I spend so much mental energy avoiding the thoughts of smoking. Then one of them just breaks through, and before I know it, I've decided to smoke and have smoked. The depression hits after the high wears off and the prospect of living my life feels dreadful. The thing that's used to mute that is obviously smoking more. Cue waking up feeling lower than ever. Back into the routine of hating myself. 

Yesterdays smoke was literally the dust collected from the bottom of a jar and what was left in a little pipe caddy thing. It's all gone now. I'm not going to buy more.

Even writing this, I am vocalizing these statements of ""no more"" and I immediately start dreading not being able to smoke while riding bikes, while woodworking, while with a great group of people where smoking helps me to get into the deeper conversations. I'm writing my ""I quit"" manifesto, and I already miss it. Fuck",54

I’m caught in a paradox
Leave the trees and head for a clearing
Or stay in the forest
Not forever, but for now

have long gone away

The time is coming 
It might already be here
but how will I know
when my vision isn’t clear?

I’m led to thinking
what’s the trouble
it’s not like I’m drinking
passed out in the rubble

It feels like medicine
It feels like fun
So why am I so reticent

Maybe I’m curious 
itching to see
who is this mysterious figure
the real, real me?



/// I’m 27 now, and been smoking consistently since 19. I’m an artist/photographer with anxiety and migraines so weed has always been a tool as well as medicine for me. It was how I could feel okay day to day, and be productive, creative, and not paralyzed with an over-analytical mind. I never smoked that much, maybe about a bowl or joint a day, sometimes more, sometimes less... and I’ve taken some breaks before (longest was 2 months), but now I just don’t think I need it like I used to and it almost feels like I’m only smoking out of habit / comfort. But still I’m on this fence of wondering whether I’m just overthinking it all and “no harm no foul” kinda thing, or if I’m right to be questioning it and wanting to feel what it is like to be at that baseline again, to see who I really am and if I still really need this in my life. 

Thanks for reading! Any thoughts are appreciated... I don’t really have stoner friends, my wife doesn’t partake but understands how it’s been helpful for me, and has also heard me tell her “I’m quitting weed” many times before - and it seems like whenever I make a statement like that, I go immediately back in, smoking more than before ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ so I think this time I’d rather keep it quiet, like a silent promise to myself and this community...",7

Thinking back on it though, I'm someone who: lives alone, works from home (due to COVID), and my job as a software tester is pretty isolating work. Basically, I sit alone all day every day, inside, by myself, rarely even talking to others let alone seeing them in person. There's no reprieve at the end of the day to go out to eat, hang with friends, do an activity with others. The best I can do is go run by myself. It makes soooo much sense that I (or someone like me) would resort to weed or any number of 'numbing' agents to disconnect a bit.

I'm really working on pushing forward, but getting back to work today really has me thinking of how fucked up this whole situation is these days. I'm sure there are MILLIONS of folks like me who have been cooped up inside and isolated for months. I have no idea how we are expected to stay sane and productive like this.

Not really looking for much here, just needed to vent this out a bit. I'm going to keep pushing through this today, and hoping the world gets more normal soon for all our sakes.",5

This is harder than I thought.,"Full disclosure, I'm new to Reddit and this is legit my first post, I came across this group during one of my horrible stages of researching the withdrawal symptoms of weed, one of which I've been struggling to cope with recently is the tinnitus/ringing in my ears.

I moved home just before UK went in to lockdown back in March and had smoked it on and off but got in touch with a friend who had a dealer close by my new place, and that's where my habitual smoking started. Until about 3 weeks ago, I was smoking it chronically, from waking to sleeping most days. I had a bit of a mental breakdown a couple days before my birthday (end of November) and ultimately decided I need to kick the green.

Since then it's been a whirlwind; sleepless nights, nausea, hopelessness, lost almost a stone in body weight, the works. I already have a history of depression and anxiety, using weed to suppress it, but it probably wasn't the best thing to do. Today I'm not feeling too bad, but my ears still ring from time to time which is mostly annoying and I'm worried it will never go away. I have to constantly remind myself that all of this is only temporary but it's difficult when you're alone, despite having good friends who are just a message away.

I thought I'd see what this was all about and I already feel a little less alone, I know that everyone's experiences and struggles are different but I'm hoping by sharing this I can maybe get some more insight on what some of the best things are to help me cope. Thanks for reading 🙂",1

Wake up, smoke, and face the day-

Is there any other way?

Mornings suck, oh yes indeed, 

But they’re made easier with weed.

&#x200B;

Made it past the midday cliff,

Now celebrate it with a spliff.

Couple tokes and pretty soon,

You’re high again by half past noon.

&#x200B;

Evening comes and with it, dark,

Time to meet up at the park.

Taking turns while blazing Js.

The old routine to end the day.

&#x200B;

Night falls and you prep for bed,

Thoughts go racing through your head.

Alas, you know the perfect balm:

A nightcap smoke to keep you calm.

&#x200B;

Your day is done, but what’s to show?

That’s right, absolute zero.

You smoked and smoked and smoked some more.

As if it were some magic cure.

&#x200B;

But all it’s done is sapped your time,

Your motivation, and your prime.

Day on day you just get high,

While life around you passes by.

&#x200B;

Life is tough but I am too.

Ready to begin anew.

Looking forward to these days

Of living life outside the haze.",72
2020-12-14 10:58:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kd09ep/6_months_today/,6 Months today!,"Today marks 6 months. I'm not going to detail all of my recovery time but I would like to say a few things. Number one is be good to yourself and don't expect a full recovery right away. Its a journey. Number two is change your attitude, after 25 years of smoking I couldn't stay sober until I became okay with being a sober person. That had been a very scary prospect for me for a long time but I overcame it. Number three is time, time will pass by and as it does recovery will take place, slowly, but surely you'll get better. Things will become easier, you'll think about weed less and less. Your brain will begin to repair itself and your mood will reflect that. You aren't missing out on anything, quite the contrary, while being stoned you are missing out on so much. This will be the first Christmas I've been completely sober since I was a child.   


I'm not 100% recovered yet; not emotionally and probably not physically. While my brain does it's thing to repair I've been focused on what I missed out on in terms of personal growth since being a stoner at such a young age. Life is more rich and wholesome, I care about things that I wouldn't have given a second thought to before. I do regret what I've done in my past but I'm focusing on the future and building a life on my own terms, not influenced by the chemical effects of a plant (or other things).",50

I’ve had so many failed attempts to quit within this whole past year— but this time— I’m holding myself accountable and would also love to make some friends along the way!

I want to know why you quit— how you felt during your first week/few weeks, and how you feel now PLUS the benefits and improvements you’ve seen along the way!

I’ve been told I’m MUCH HAPPIER when I’m cannabis free (-:

I have been doing some reflecting and have realized I began heavily smoking when my grandmother and uncle died in the same week unexpectedly back in 2012- I started heavily smoking again after quitting for almost a year, when my mother died unexpectedly due to a brain aneurysm in March of 2019.

I want better for myself, my present, and my future though.

I accept I'm an addict and I guess this is the first stage.

Only ever gone without smoking for a few weeks all together, tops, since I was a kid.

Always had guilt about it which has gone some way to controlling the habit. However I'm in the situation now where I don't want to spend money on it at all - I want to spend that money on my kids. But I'm still buying it. 

I'm on maybe a half a month, often more. I cant afford this, basically. My income is not great as it is. I try to smoke only in the evening but this gets earlier and earlier, a constant battle. The pandemic hasn't helped. I've always smoked and worked, I do creative computer based stuff, it's never seemingly got in the way, but then again I have nothing to compare it to. Like, its such a part of my life that its hard to see the negatives. Its never stopped me doing stuff. I've always joked that its a culture enhancer. But the money, the money is the thing. And that under-current feeling that whatever you are doing, you'd rather be getting stoned on your own. That can't be healthy. And of course, in some of my work, anyone finding out would be a career killer.

I've lurked in this sub under different names for a while and been thru posts, some great and inspiring stuff here. I have big respect for people that have kicked it. You sound so confident that it was the right thing. Where do you get that positivity from?

I need to take the next step and just stop. Tomorrow? The weekend? Right now? I'm terrified of who I am without it, I worry ill be more depressed than usually, also ratty and so on to my family and colleagues. Who is non-stoned me?

What do I tell myself? To take the next step? I've always sort of hated life a bit. Stuff doesn't work out for me. I'm an odd ball, I don't think its just the weed, although I accept it doesn't help. The paths I choose turn out to be unusual / unreliable. I use weed as a massive crutch for wanting to disappear and just stop having to make decisions which fail. Something like that anyway. Sometimes I just want to give up, na mean? I don't think that feeling will go away tbh. 

What do I tell myself?",6

I ran through a whole 1/8 this weekend.

The scariest part is how being high makes all these things “okay”.

I don’t want to be held back by weed anymore. I’m a 25 year old guy who should be getting more out of life rather than just cruising through life waiting for the next high.

On the bright side I have went from cigarettes to 50nic and now to 6nic within 6 months! I struggle dropping both addictions so I don’t believe I can drop that at the same time unfortunately. I use weed for the most part to vent my stress from fast food so I believe nicotine should be the first to go since I am looking forwards to quitting this stupid drug as soon as possible. I remember days when I use to think nicotine was gross and cigarettes were stupid, but now I have unlimited connections all around me! It frustrates me how easily I could access these two drugs!!

Overall I want to have money saved up for my own car that I can rely on throughout college. Weed and nicotine burn holes in my bank account so I cannot have that. I also just hate the idea of relying on substances before entering college. I’ve had two years since I’ve graduated to drop these nasty habits but I continue to struggle! How should I handle this?

I am 15 months alcohol-free. I have an addictive personality in general (alcohol, drugs, gambling, etc.) but alcohol is the demon that led to lost jobs, arrests, and physical health issues.

I've been going to AA for 3 yrs but have never been a true believer in that. And with COVID I've just not gone to a meeting since the pandemic started (yes I know meetings are online as well)

I feel very strong in my alcohol abstinence, I honestly don't think I'll ever drink again in my life (higher power willing). However, the glaring caveat is that I smoke anywhere from 5-7 nights a week on average. All my addictive obsessions have left alcohol and are now focused on weed.

Wondering if there are any other recovering alcoholics here, and tips from anyone on staying sober from all substances?

In a way, weed is wayyyy harder to quit than alcohol. I never blackout on weed, I only smoke at night and stay in my apartment and play videogames and watch movies. I am maybe 10 lbs overweight from weed and it is unhealthy, but the weight gain is small enough I don't really care.

I have a good-paying job were I am a high-performer and well respected, and weed has not interfered from this at all.

Essentially, alcohol truly did bring me to a rock bottom and forced me to surrender, but the negative effects of weed are manageable/sustainable.

Why do I want to quit then, you ask? I hate the obsession. I hate waking up feeling groggy and low-energy, promising myself from the moment I wake up until around 7pm that I WILL NOT SMOKE!. Then once I turn on the tv or start a videogame I say screw that and blaze away.

I have so many Day 1s from weed, and so many mini 2-3 days of sobriety. It's hard because I can look way in the future and say ""I never will drink ever again, f\*ck alcoholism"" but with weed its like ""yea right you're saying your never going to smoke ever again? cmon man get real""

It's a manageable and sustainable cycle, but still an addiction, and addiction is never good. Its so hard with weed bc I don't see a rock bottom with weed.

Just looking for any tips, anyone in the same boat, any comments at all.

Thanks.",1

Heading towards my full potential..,"I started weed in my undergrad 4 years back because of a bet. Initially,  I had an healthy relationship with weed. I had it under control and would use it only during socializing. 

But slowly, my dependence on it grew and so did my responsibilities. With responsibilities comes pressure and I used weed to escape the situation when things got difficult. It got to a point where every minor setback would make me crave it. 

This deprived me of the inner strength I could develop to face the challenges while I was sober. And the realization hit me that I was not achieving my full potential because of this and other known physical side effects of weed.

Last month I made a decision to quit for good and as the urges came by I would say to myself -

'I'm not an underachieving stoner'.

This one sentence helped me push through the tough times and also helped me change my identity from a stoner who is trying to quit to a guy who is not a stoner anymore.

Thanks to this sub for all the support. Hopefully this post helps others as well.

I started experimenting with smoking later than a lot of people, like age 27 and pretty much smoked since, I’ve had a few breaks including one earlier this year where I got through all of the uncomfortable effects and was really happy, I was eating really cleanly, not what you’d probably expect, raw meat and animal fat actually but it helped massively, a lot of healing was going on and all brain fog had cleared up, no anxiety... even when something that should cause it happened, I’d put that down to the food though because when I’ve quit in the past before that I didn’t get that same amazing feeling but have the 3 times I’ve attempted that diet properly. 

The diet part will be relevant here, it’s something I’ve worked on for a while and it isn’t easy to transition to that in a world that really wants to move towards the opposite but the results are undeniable when you feel them. 

The link between this and weed is that after living like this for a while everything was going great, like I’m super happy and everything is always funny, I can always see the joke or fun first, like I genuinely feel high, I think this is what we’re supposed to feel like.

Then I smoked. 

I’d been hanging around with a girl who was really funny, intelligent and driven, all good hanging at her friends and they’re having a smoke, I didn’t really need to but figured in the past weed has enhanced certain situations such as this, like I know I’ve enjoyed it so I had a go just to see how it would feel this time that I was feeling my best I’d ever felt. 

Horrible. 

Literally felt like it took some of my souls away or something, it was good weed that if I’d have had last week I’d have loved it but compared to raw meat sober it felt like poison. 

I cut out all sugar for 6 months once including fruit and carbs and bought I’d “treat myself” to a chocolate bar for my birthday which was a huge mistake because it tasted awful, like chemicals but despite that I couldn’t stop putting it in my face, I literally wasn’t enjoying it but couldn’t stop the addict in me, within 5 minutes I had the worst migraine of my life, that’s sugar well and truly on the bad list, but the thing is I did the same with the weed that time too.

That should have been the perfect realisation, this stuff doesn’t actually make me feel good. I mean when I’m feeling crap from eating pizzas and Chinese etc it adds something and brings me up but not compared to natural good feeling. Despite that I still had some more then wanted it the next day too... then because of that I figured what harm can one Chinese do, I’ll only get the duck so it’s not like I’m having anything too bad really? Wrong. 

Turns out soy is a massive contributor to depression and even the amount in that dish will start to take effect after a few days, thing is for those few days I kept eating that same thing because I was still hanging with the girl I had a couple of chips from her food and boom I’m off the wagon smoking every day feeling shit and eating crap. I battled with the food again and after starting to feel joint pain come back (something that had left completely at 35 after cutting out the last plant I was consuming at the time, coffee) and stomach bloating, and all the other carb related problems I won. 

So I’ve been back on the ancestral meat diet for a while but I don’t have that same clarity as last time because there was still one plant left, this time weed. 

Yesterday I had a really strong feeling that my dreams are about to be important so I should really get them back on by quitting weed, so here I am. Unable to sleep but prepared for the intense dreams I’m about to have when  manage to sort my sleeping out over the next few days. 

So uncomfortable but I’ve done it before so all I basically have to do is wait it out. 

Just writing this to pass some time and kind of introduce myself here. 

I hope the meat thing isn’t too weird but I look forward to this next sober section of my life once this discomfort is gone. 

I’m not sure if I’ll ever be a person who can just have it once with mates, I’d love to be able to say I’d never have it again but I’m not convinced of that either because sometimes as an artistic the right strain can definitely help... or so it seems. 

I don’t know though. 

When I thing back to when I first started, my life was awesome, I was well respected in my industry (tattooing), loving it, travelling with it and getting a lot of attention because I was working and posting every day but I got into a bad relationship at the same time but unrelated to the weed and although I appreciate the lessons and have grown a huge amount from the struggle in the relationship I always thought it was the single cause of me dropping back and withdrawing a bit from the industry I loved but now that I think back, in hindsight, this side of smoking with the withdrawal effects actively at their worst I think the weed may have been the biggest factor of it all. 

All my relationships before that one were relatively fair and peaceful, and if there was a problem it would be resolved either by working it out or ending it. That bad relationship though was very different, she was physically and verbally abusive, something I wound not normally stand for but this is where the weed played it’s secret bigger part. It made that bearable instead. 

Instead of ending it I smoked. I felt like I genuinely hated her sometimes, I could see the manipulation she was using and feel the pain of the attacks but after a smoke the hate would drift away. 

Weed helped me drag that pain out for two years! I’ve always felt like I’ve been recovering from it since and have came a huge distance from there in the meantime, I am grateful for what I learned and I’m sure weed has also been a part of that recovery too but it’s like it’s own toxic relationship in itself. 

At this point I’m not sure this will even make sense or be cohesive at all and there is guaranteed to be spelling and grammar mistakes everywhere, after all I am a recovering addict lying in bed unable to sleep despite being very tired so I’m not sure I’ll scan it for that stuff before posting, I will probably edit it tomorrow though. 

If anyone made it this far I appreciate you joining me for this. 

That’s enough for today though. Now I’m going to attempt to sweat myself to sleep. 

Goodnight.",1

I just rot away on my phone for hours and hours. I've been up since 10:30 and my screen time says 4 and a half hours: I've been on my phone almost the entire time that I've been up. 

This is so fucking dumb sometimes. I think about the school program I'm going through right now that has a chance to ""test"" so I know I can't smoke, but my final assessments for them didn't go well and I think smoking to risk it even though I know how dangerous that is. I'm gonna be living without my friends for 6 months starting January because they all decided to move out of the apartment, but hopefully, the people they choose to sublease are ok. I'm just really not happy.

What do I do?,"I haven’t smoked weed since November 16th, 2019 after years of regular use. Although I used it quite frequently, I often had really awful highs and ended up freaking out with extreme anxiety/social anxiety. That being said, I mainly smoked due to peer pressure and had a hard time saying “no”. I finally started my sobriety streak after a really bad high and continued after a good friend took his own life. I decided I wanted to start addressing my own mental health and I even ended up getting prescribed medication for my anxiety. A lot of my buddies still offered, but the longer I went without smoking, the easier it was to decline offers. Flash forward to last night, I went over to a friend’s house to celebrate his birthday with 10 other buddies. These are really close friends who normally supported my streak, so I let my guard down. I found myself upstairs with two friends and my girlfriend when one of my friends 1 offered friend 2 a joint. Afterward, friend 1 said there was a low THC content (14%) and offered it to my girlfriend (my biggest support system). She said “sure”, then looked at me to see what I thought. I didn’t want to seem like I had a stick up my ass, so I shrugged it off as she took a couple of hits (her 5th time ever smoking). Afterward, friend 1 offered it to me, and my girlfriend basically said, “go ahead”. I took 2 hits and was told to keep both inhale in for a while. After 5 minutes, I already felt really high and then realized that was my first time smoking with my anxiety medication, so I hoped my high wouldn’t be awful. I was wrong. I found my social anxiety getting worse than I remember experiencing before. After feeling like I made an ass of myself in front of my friends by being way too high, I knew I should go home. I drove there and had to have someone else drive my car back. After getting back, I felt overwhelmed and ashamed of myself. I threw those 392 days away for a night of paranoia and social anxiety. I now feel disappointed about how I failed myself, and how my biggest support system encouraged me to smoke. Sorry for the rant, but where do I go from here?",6

2020-12-13 17:11:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kck0m1/do_the_after_effects_really_go_away/,Do the after effects really go away?,"Since I first smoked my brain hasn’t been the same. When I was 16 I smoked a lot for one month, but that whole year I felt after effects, brain fog and vision changes that triggered anxiety, depression and derealisation. When I was 17 I smoked a bit more often, but never every day, maybe once every couple of months, but the brain fog never went away. It’s really intense visual changes, like how things look when you’re high but not as confusing and without the good stuff. 

From 18 to now (23) ive smoked every day, but I’ve taken some very long breaks. 

In all this time ever since I first tried weed, my brain has felt absolutely fucked, especially in the first few months of quitting, but it never fully goes away. The problem is strongest in artificial light at night and when I stare at the same spot for ages, things get real fucked up. 

I’m fairly certain this will never go away. I’ll get used to it in a few months and it won’t bother me as much but sometimes it still becomes really noticeable and tbh it’s devastating, I believe that smoking from a young age causes permanent changes and if I have to accept the change and get use to it, but I hate it. 

This is a huge trigger that kept me smoking for so long. When you’re a stoner it’s normal to be fried all the time but when I’m sober I feel so fucked up and I hate it. So I smoked to avoid the feeling.

I can’t help but feel like choosing to do weed is like sacrificing your sobriety forever in order to get high and once you’ve made that sacrifice you only feel normal as a stoner and something always feels off when you’re sober. 

What are other people’s thoughts on this? Will it become irrelevant after a few years sober because I’ll be so used to it? Has anyone felt the after effects years after they quit?",3

I wrote a lenghty post about 11 months ago (I reference that threadin this post):

[https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/elwali/quitting\_pot\_at\_a\_low\_point\_in\_my\_life/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/elwali/quitting_pot_at_a_low_point_in_my_life/)

I'm back to give a status update how things are going. First of all, I was completely sober for about 4 months during that time. I then made the mistake of smoking some weed, but way, way less than I used to. Let's put it that way: I only got a 1/3 ounce three months ago and it lasted me until last month. Anyway, while that has been a relapse, I'm back on my grind. It really lost its magic to me and I defintely don't feel addicted or longing anymore. The relapse was a lingering habit which made me do it again. Brush it off, move on. All in all, I have never coonsumed so little cannabis in year for the past 10 years. All in all, just that 1/3 ounce.

Anyway, I have a long term appartement now. Unfortunately, I had to break up with my Ex-GF since she got psychotic again. That was painful, after all the stuff I mention in my old post. I have a new job. I've been seeing a psychiatrist since June. Still depressed and somewhat lonely, which probably made me think of weed and posting here.

Positives since quitting:

\- More energy.

\- I can actually be spontanous since I don't have to hide anything.

\- Life situation has stabilized / more energy to get things done.

\- Smoked way fewer cigarettes and drank A LOT less. Still working on it. It's my birthday in 14 days. I'll give myself the present of quitting alcohol and cigs completely.

\- More self confidence.

\- No more ""guilt"" when talking to people who didn't know about my drug use.

Negatives (or positives, in a way?):

\- Regretting all the time I have lost due to weed. I try to frame that feeling in a positive mindset. Better get to terms with it now than never.

\- Someone mentioned in my old post: ""Don't think quitting weed is going to fix all your problems. You have to face them."" How very true. With clarity comes the understanding that you have grab your problems by the horns. That is hard. Really, really hard. Sometimes depressing. Yet again, trying to see it in a positive light. It's quite the process, adjusting to all the feeling you suppress for years.

\- That's a weird one: Dating. Since things are done with my ex, I'm kinda trying to get in the dating game. It's difficult, partly I still have some residual shame for my drug use. When a girl asks: ""What have you been up to the last couple of years?"" it stings a little bit, because I have to think of my drug use. How did other people here deal with their past when trying to start over?

So, yeah, there is a lot of work to be done, but I think in the end it's all worth it. Hurts like a motherfucker sometimes, but that's life.",8

I have many reasons to stay sober and my partnership is a big one of course. Have been applying to jobs. Applying to go back to school.

I know that getting rid of everything is the best way but I’m just not there yet. I was relying really heavily on carts to help me quit, but found carts just make it too darn easy to get stoned. Yesterday I got rid of all the carts, and I’m down to just some flower and a bowl that were gifted to me. 

For the last few days, I’ve smoked just 1-2 bowls in the evening to wind down. The vivid dreams are already happening, the night sweats, decreased appetite are all starting to happen. Weirdly though, the cravings are much more manageable because I know I’m gonna have my 7pm smoke. 

Where do I go from here? What do I do next? I’m trying to quit vaping nicotine too but so far I don’t have a successful strategy for that. Am I doing this right? What am I even doing?

Don't get tricked by delta 8.,"I quit a few months back after struggling with addiction for around 6 years, going back to high school. I've never been able to just use weed on special occasions, and if I have it, I inevitably will end up using it every day.

I recently started looking after a friend's weed plant while he was away for a month. Figured it would be a fun gardening project. I ended up getting a little too obsessed with it and when harvest time came around, I decided to try a little after all my hard work. It was very disappointing (very low thc percentage) so it left me craving more. I heard about delta 8 thc and how it supposedly was like thc but without the paranoia, anxiety, and social reclusiveness of regular thc, so I decided to go buy a cart of it down the street (it's federally legal so it was super easy to buy it).

I took one puff and felt great -- clear headed, introspective, focused, energized...for about a minute. Then the high started to set in and it felt just like regular thc. I got a call from a friend out of the blue and it sent my heart rate skyrocketing. I *wanted* to talk to him but I knew there was no way I could. The thought filled me with fear. My parents later left me a voicemail wanting to talk but I couldn't because I was high. I felt so much guilt. I felt my heart rate increase and it brought back the paranoia that I might be having a heart attack. Luckily I had something [apparently not allowed to mention what it is on this sub but you can guess] that I use for anxiety which killed that before it could turn into a full blown panic attack (something I only have ever gotten from weed). 

It just teleported me back into that scared, small, reclusive boy that I was trying to escape. It wasn't fun. It wasn't some magical chemical that was going to make weed affect me like it affects most of my friends. I wish I could use weed without feeling so scared and powerless, but I need to accept that I can't. I reset the clock and hopefully this time I can make it all the way to 6 months.",19

I'm so much better when completely sober but I just cant seem to get there. I know it's because I'm bored. Or need to de-stress. I, like everyone else, have got a shit tonne going on at the moment.

Withdrawal symptoms are not bad, except from insomnia and the aforementioned inability to focus on stuff, maybe beacuse my substance intake was realtively small, just one joint before going to bed.

But I want to press on. I hope for my mind to reset, be sharp again, remember stuff better and be motivated to take action.

But after years, those were just excuses, and I knew in the back of my mind it was only holding me back, only making memories blurry, and not really helping with any issues I had. Really, it only prolonged and compounded every single issue. When I couldn’t get weed, I became an incapacitated ball of anxiety, unable to deal with life. 

December 12th 2019 I ran out of weed, and had the thought “you know, this bowl COULD be the last you ever have...” I sat there holding that bowl for half an hour. Put on my favorite song. Smoked that bowl. Then threw that pipe into the desert (I live in AZ). It was so cathartic, and haven’t looked back since that moment. 

Since then everything has gotten better. I was forced to deal with my insecurities and anxiety, and it improved little by little until it was a cascade affect. Now, I never have anxiety like I used to when I was smoking. Of course I still get anxiety, but it’s the confidence of knowing I can deal with it and that it doesn’t control me that keeps it at bay.

Im just another dude trying to stop, with a looong story and an endless list of reasons to stop. I dont want to go in too deep because i could easily write a whole book on it, but i decided to still post here, to be commited and maybe get a few tips ( because im also suffering from insomnia heavily, even if im high as fuck ). I will add a TLDR at the end because it will easily be a long post although i try to keep it as short as possible

&#x200B;

Im smoking since 11 years ( first joint with 15 which was way too early ), just with friends and maybe once a month, but it quickly got to ""get high as often as i can!"". So by the time i was 16, i was smoking at least every weekend and at 17 i was high nearly every day... And i really didnt have much sober days since then, im now 26. I never was the 24/7 kind of guy and most of the time smoked my first joint in the evening, 8 pm or later, but it was still too much as i realized.

&#x200B;

Because the problem is im just not a normal guy, in any aspect of life. And to even top it off, every aspect of my life is in shambles, completely fu\*\*\*d. For real. 

I suffer from depression and social anxiety since i hit puberty, but it was pretty mild back then compared to now and definitely managable without professional help. I was a beloved, funny guy, had enough friends and people to hang out with, also good chances at dating etc., but my low selfworth/esteem and constant negative self talk always pulled me down and i wasted most of my chances and potential. As some of you may have experienced, weed only made it worse, but i couldnt or didnt want to see it, because i used it to cope with my mental problems. 

This way my depression and anxiety got stronger and stronger, i felt more alienated from other people by the day. Everything became super negative, my thoughts became darker and so on.  Nowadays i have full blown depression and anxiety, to the point where i cant walk by people without getting trouble breathing and walking, to the point where i have suicidal thought at least once per hour and where im completely at a loss on how to solve this problem.

&#x200B;

As if that isnt enough to make life hard and break a person, i also had 2 accidents in the course of 2 months, which left me with permanent health issues. How it happened is a long story in itself, but since then im sure i have some sort of brain damage, although several doctors scanned me and all were sure that they cant identify any damage or problem. But im just not the same since these accidents. Of course im not a completely different person, but a lot of important things changed for the worse. I have a lazy eye since then, which made my social life hell and just boosted my anxiety to never before known heights. I also got issues with my motoric abilities sometimes, my feeling for balance is off and weirdly enough my sense of rhythm too, which isnt a problem you want to have as a musician. Its weird as fuck but before i had a pretty good sense of rhythm, but now its sometimes like my brain malfunctions and im thrown out of the rhythm. Moreover i have some sort of hyperhidrosis since then, sometimes cognitive issues ( keeping up concentration which was even possible when i was high before ) and so on... Its just a chunk of the problems i have since then, the point is im just not the same. Its like someone took my old, true me, and replaced it with a worse copy that cant even feel or think the same way. It sucks.

&#x200B;

Like i said i could go on endlessly about my problems and story, but i think yall get the gist and the post is already long enough. Theres not a single aspect in my life thats good: Im fucking 26 and still living with my parents, because i couldnt get a job in the past, except for smalltime jobs that couldnt pay any rent because its not enough hours. I honestly dont know why but i always got rejected, and now got a huge gap in my CV, which makes even more employees reject me. Its  a vicious circle.

Moreover i never had a girlfriend ( at least im not a virgin anymore ) and maybe went on 3 dates in all my life. I wanted to become a good musician ( not necessarily a star or make a job out of it but just for me and everyone who wants to hear it ) but couldnt ever pursue it at home because of my parents, which is a different story ( and it feels like im a 12 year old typing this, but at the end im stuck here with no money ). And to top it all of im trying to get help for my health issues but so far no doctor could really do anything for me, because weirdly enough, a lot of my problems cant be easily fixed like a fucked up knee for example. Its like the universe is just pulling a sick joke on me, or just wants to finish me but torture me for some years before it does.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Long story short: I started picking up journaling again after nearly breaking and losing myself in my suicidal thoughts and then it hit me yesterday night: Im at a crossroad in life and have two ways to go:

The first one is to keep living like now, unemployed, unhappy as fuck, not able to be myself or make music, live the life i want to, stuck with my parents.... And this way will only fuck me up more and everything will get worse and worse. I often thought i hit rock bottom and it always went lower. Im pretty sure if i walk this way i wont live to see the year 2023, because i will either kill myself or die of something else ( im honestly not sure where these health issues are going, but they are definitely getting worse ). 

The second way is to do the exact opposite, switching my whole life and personality/way of thinking and acting around. Problem is i dont know if i can pull it off and how to, because my problems are so fucking big and so far i couldnt solve them or find someone who can help me solve them. It is definitely hard to pull it off and maybe its not possible at all at this point. But on the other hand not doing something means automatically chosing the first way and dying in the near future. 

But there has to be some doctor that can identify my problem and help me right? Theres got to be one employee in my country whos willing to give me a chance. One way i can somehow change my way and live a life that i think is impossible now. On my own, in my own appartment, just being myself and living my own life without having those issues with my parents, maybe even find a girlfriend or have some truly happy days. I dont even know what it feels like to be happy, or at least ok with myself, anymore. Everything became extremely negative and sad.

I dont know if can pull it off, but the point is, it cant go on like that. Theres no way i keep on living like that and be able to cope with it. 

&#x200B;

And that brings me to the reason im posting here: I dont wanna lie, i had really cool times with weed, a lot of fun, it often inspired me when i made music ( when i could ), i had really cool friends which i only found by smoking together and so on. All of yall experienced some things like that.

But now all the positive aspects vanished and only negative effects are left. Smoking weed now shoots my anxiety and depression through the roof instead of relieving it. Also its starting to make me paranoid and im getting weird aches at my heart from time to time ( my weed is definitely clean but im an european and for some dumb reason mix my weed with tobacco, which may be the cause of it ). I also often have the feeling of going crazy and like im about to break any second. It makes me a recluse nowadays and STILL i cant seem to stop. I cant count the times i say to myself ""thats my last joint now!"", which i tell myself every night, and then the other day i already wake up with the urge to smoke one and do so in the evening ( most 2-3 Jays ).

Sadly theres not a positive feeling about weed left, except for when i listen to songs that remind me of the good old times i had with weed and my friends. But thats not worth the whole truckload of extreme negative effects i experience from it nowadays.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sorry for the long ass post but i feel like i have to at least outline my life story to be able to close this chapter of my life and try to quit weed and lead a better life FOR REAL. Not the ""yeah thats my last joint and i will get my life together"" and then do the same shit the next day way.

So to anyone who read all of it big thanks! If you didnt its no problem either. I just have to get it out to stay commited and maybe some fellas can give me some good tips too

&#x200B;

I wish everyone a nice day/night

&#x200B;

TLDR: My life went downhill in every aspect of life and everything is super f\*\*\*\*d up. Im 26, living with my parents ,unemployed, having several health issues that couldnt get resolved so far, my social life is nearly non existent by now. To top it off , all the positive effects of weed vanished and the negative ones got so severe that i just cant keep on smoking. My depression and anxiety are at an all time high and my life only goes further downhill. If i dont do something now i will probably end up killing myself in the next years.

Never made a post before but I have been reading posts daily to keep fueling my fire to quit. So, I figured, maybe my post will help someone make it thru one more day too. 

I am 34 and have been smoking heavily since middle school. I have had a few months of sobriety peppered in thru out the years but for the most part, weed has been a HUGE part of my life.

I recently have been battling serious anxiety and depression so I started to see a therapist. I was diagnosed with clinical depression and ADHD. Without getting too far into it, talking with a professional has made me want to quit weed, truly face my problems, and grow as a person. 

I am starting day 5 today!! The first day was easier than I thought. I think it’s because I was on a kind of high from throwing EVERYTHING related to cannabis away (bongs, vapes, papers, lighters, and even a quarter of some fire). The past 3 days have been HORRIBLE! I have had constant anxiety and absolutely nothing gives me the joy it used to. Life just feels so hard now and it’s hard to see the point. I just want to run away from it all.

I know this will all get better but OMG this has been so difficult. I’m not craving to smoke, I actually find  myself angry at weed. I hate what I have done to myself and what I am putting my spouse thru.  I just keep reminding myself that it will get better and I gotta just keep going. I know I’ll make it but I am just terrified of the day as soon as I wake up. I am drinking tons of water, exercising and communicating with my spouse how I am feeling. This and reading other people’s struggle is all that is keeping me going.

I am looking forward to not hiding from my pain with cannabis. I am looking forward to the financial benefits of not throwing countless dollars down the drain for this habit. I am looking forward to not binge eating and sticking to my fitness goals. I am looking forward to not ever being present and always looking  forward to the next puff, dab, or whatever the method of moment is..I am looking forward to being FREE!!

I never want to go thru this again!

2020-12-13 10:38:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kccls2/relapse_after_100_days_of_sobriety_my_thoughts/,Relapse after 100+ days of sobriety: my thoughts,"Hi fellow Leaves,

This year was the first year since I've started seriously smoking that I spent more days sober than high. I've had one streak of 99 days and one streak of 100-something days. Relapsed both times. Both times went pretty much the same: I would convince myself I would just have one evening of smoke-induced fun, only to find myself craving the smoke later. 

The day(s) after smoking I would have headaches, a bloated stomach because of all the munchies, lack of sleep due to staying up too late, and a uncomfortable/slightly painful feeling in my throat and lungs. I would then be convinced I would not do it again until a few days later, the 'perfect' opportunity shows up. Then I would do it again and it would be slightly less uncomfortable than before, making me crave it more. I would end up smoking days in a row until I realize **I'm still addicted and I still can't moderate.**

During my last streak of 100+ days, I got back into lifting weights. I played a lot of guitar, and started two new musical projects. Made serious progress on my thesis. Bought a new guitar with the money I saved by not smoking weed and  everything around that (Transport, munchies, food ordering, missed work opportunities etc). **It felt amazing to realize what I could materialize when I didn't spend my days smoking weed.** 

Trouble started brewing when I gradually abandoned parts of my new healthier routine. It felt as if I had some blocks regarding the thesis. Didn't know how to break through a roadblock, so I would just not work on the thesis at all. This left me feeling bad and with time to kill (for sitting around ignoring your responsibilities is really hard for me while sober), so I started playing videogames for days on end. Then I would stay up late and grow hungry, so I'd eat something unhealthy. Then I would wake up feeling bad, drink too much coffee to try and feel better, all the while starting the cycle again.

This was my natural state as an active user: Wake up late, drink coffee and play videogames till I could smoke, then smoke and play videogames until I would be tired or bored enough to go to bed. All the while eating a very unhealthy diet, all the while ignoring friends/family, my responsibilities, and perhaps worst of all: my aspirations.

I've noticed that **healthy habits reinforce each other** in the same way that unhealthy habits reinforce each other. If I'm working on my thesis and music, working out, and eating healthy, then why would I want to smoke weed? Conversely, if I'm ignoring my responsibilities, eating unhealthy stuff, playing videogames and watching YouTube, then why would I not smoke weed?

Anyway, this relapse will be the shortest I've ever had. One smoke, one almost two weeks later, then two days straight the weekend after. Every time I smoked I realized that I didn't necessarily like being high: it just made me more OK with not bettering my life. And I don't want to be OK, I want a better life. I'm not sure exactly how to achieve that, but I know a very good play to start: being sober.

Thank you for reading my story and good luck to all of you in your sobriety!",51

The experience of getting high itself was somewhat underwhelming but, what it awakened in me is a little more insidious.  

Namely, a craving of the mind.  What I had forgotten about when I was a user was the constant craving and the planning to be away from family so I could be essentially self-isolating and uncommunicative, getting absorbed in my thoughts and getting deeper into my head while smoking.  

At the core of my issues is a deeper addiction, I have a sex addiction to pornography.  

When I was high the other night I sat in a dark room and asked myself whether this was worth it and what I want to do with my life. I acknowledged my need to address my pornography addiction through working a program for it as I once did. 

I learned I could live without weed after not using for all that time but, disappointingly, I did come back to it.  Last week I bought an 1/8, smoked a tiny bit, got high, and while I was high I threw away the pipe and weed.  Days after I was thinking, why did I throw it away?  Maybe it's still in the trash, I'll go dig it out..and so on. Obsessive thoughts, thinking about how to get it again, have plagued me since.

The path before me and any of you who are at this crossroad is not easy.  Marijuana showed me many things initially then it became a straight jacket.  Not because of what marijuana is but, because of me.  So many things came to me while being high, a realization of what is holding me down, hurting me and what I need to focus on to get better.  What came after is what could make these realizations meaningless which is that igniting obsession of getting more to get high again, to indulge these 'revelations' without actually following up and doing anything and just being high.....

&#x200B;

To be honest, I'm not sure what I'm going to do.  At the very least I'm going to address getting back into recovery for sexual addiction, I'm 7 days sober from acting out.  I need to get down to root causes and work towards living in a way that marijuana doesn't surface again as a 'solution'.",13

I know the symptoms can be very unpleasant but the best advice I can give you is that it is TEMPORARY I promise you !!!! There has been times I thought I was losing my sanity , and then weeks later I would laugh bcuz of how alleviated I felt “feeling normal “ 
But anyways do these to speed up recovery 
- WATER 
- EXERCISE PLZ
-GO OUTSIDE / STAY OCCUPIED (worst thing you can do is think all day )
- listen to uplifting music that brings you at peace 
-Along with exercise , make sure to rest properly As well , BALANCE is key . 
-PLEASE EAT , - I know it sounds disgusting and you probably have no appetite but you NEED your vitamins . You WILL feel worse if you don’t eat . Try smoothies , protein shakes, fruits are amazing .
- LIMES (this might be personal but I heard lemon and limes or lemonade if u want , can balance your terpene levels or sum shit idk) 

Okay but I hope you guys can take something from that . I’ve been in this cycle for too long , but now I’m finally quitting . You got this , we got this . This is just a storm , and it will pass, don’t fight the feelings , and be patient . 

God helps too but ppl don’t wanna hear that nowadays .",7

I’ve been silently reading post on this from for the last few months and today is my first step towards sobriety so I thought I start off with a little background. My name is Joel and I’ve been a chronic smoker since about a junior in high school so you could say the last 7 to 8 years. When I say chronic smoker I basically means smoking at least a gram a day (as you can image consumption has increased over the time span). The reason I got into smoking was it started off just as just recreational fun with the friends after school  and  something to help decompress and reduce a lot of the stress I had going on at the time. I wanted to be a college football player but was having a very hard getting recruited due to my size (I’m a pretty short fellow), so smoking made it easier to cope and just have “fun” with my friends. But I had no idea of the future implications. No idea what type of habit I was creating if not properly check (which o didn’t, hence why I am here now lol). No idea I would keep running back to it as a coping mechanism or using it as a recreational drug to fuel my escapism from reality and as an escape from my thoughts and feelings. No idea that I would be unmotivated to do the things that I love doing or actually want to do. No idea I would take my high earring job for granted and self sabotage myself every step of the way making it even harder to reach my goals or maintain my job. No Idea I would be stressed out all the time because I keep spending my last on weed and junk food. No idea I would stall and procrastinate my life. No idea I’d be prioritizing weed over everything and everybody else even myself. And I had no idea that I’ll be using an app to help me stop. But you know what all of this is fine I have accepted and taken responsibility for my circumstance and my situation.I’m here today to start a new journey a new path, new life where I am in the driver seat and Weed isn’t even in the car, not even a passenger, not even a thought just an image on the windshield as I drive past it.

Now I've quit cold Turkey and I'm fucking determined because I've realized that I can never take weed in moderation because I will always look for more high.

I am 29, I  became a heavy user over the past year with a few periods of sobriety (a week or two but not taking it seriously). Over the past 3 months, I became an extremely heavy user. I am talking 1 gram of concentrate in less than 3 days, two 1 gram carts a week at times as opposed to a cart lasting a month, and buying about a 1/4 a week of herb. This was also split between my wife and I. She quit 28 hours ago as well.

It got really bad when I let my sister and her husband move in with my family (I have a kid, wife, dog, and 2 cats) so she could find a house on this side of the country and put down roots near me, which is awesome! Except, she is super about sobriety (her thing is alcohol) also in the psych field and she is preachy, she is not wrong but man it's a turn-off for sobriety at times, even when she is 100% right. I tried to go sober when she moved her as I felt ready, unfortunately, the stress of the dynamic of living with a sibling again was much more than I could have anticipated. The night terrors were so bad for the first few days. I dreamt a man wandered into my home and shot my wife and I in our bed, I had to smoke to cope with the situation.

They moved into their house last week, things are getting better. I am getting better, I am ready to treat myself the way I deserve to be treated. My daughter deserves her dad sober. I know I operate at a much higher frequency without weed, I deserve that and so do the people around me.

I just wanted to post and say hi and thank you to those who are here. I woke up drenched in sweat two times last night, no dreams yet though as it's only been 28 hours. I feel like a raw exposed nerve that needs to reacclimate to the world. I reached for my vape 20+ times yesterday only to realize I threw it away and it was not in my pocket every time. It had become such a damn reflex, no matter time or place, the convenience of vaporizers really makes it too easy. I normally would have too much shame to show up at my kid's school smelling of weed, unfortunately, the vape removes that issue. I smoked every second of every day for 3 months. I am ready to be myself again. I like myself and I deserve better.

All of you do.

I've had good multi-month streaks in the past, but would love to leave it for as long as possible. Usually, my streaks start after I hit some kind of low point, mentally. Once before, I realized that I was just wasting my life being fucked up, just like how my mom got hard into drugs and spend decades do squat, and I was like omg, I can't be like her. 

Tonight, I realized I was being lazy af and selfish. I'm a really messy person. I would make a mess of the house, and not really be respectful of my roomies in how we share the same space. Tonight, I did like three loads of dishes, took out all the trash, cleaned up a really disgusting mess that was on the counter, cleaned the stove stop -- you know, basically the whole kitchen, because I felt like an asshole and being a stoner was perpetuating and worsening who I was as a friend/roommate.

Sorry to get all personal.

I now know that I gotta quit cold turkey, and this ""weening myself off it"" will never work. Tomorrow, I will not smoke, and I will instead spend time reading, or working on something else, or maybe exercising.

This is working a treat however, sometimes my cravings are so stressful I decide to do some breathing exercises and slight meditation for 3-5 minutes and then I feel ok.

Vivid dreams are Insane! I’m having 3 or 4 vivid dreams every night and waking up sweating in between each one. Some dreams are good and some are not so good but I’m using the positive dreams as motivation to how great and rewarding my life can become when I am not smoking at all!  It’s quite exciting!

I started again on november 6 and havent smoked a puff since then, i recognize there are positive changes, my sleep schedule is better, i do more things and have more motivation to do things but damn, everyday there's a voice in my head that tells me i could smoke like once every 2 weeks or once a month. Ive never went this far but sometimes i just wish there was 1 high night listening to my best playlist, kind of like a trip you know.

There's a part of me that knows if i smoke just one joint my mindset will be damaged, and I will feel cravings again but there's the other part that says nah you're responsible enough after 40 days to decide to just smoke once a month.

With that mentality, it’s as if my dependence were a heavy boulder, that I’d pushed up a hill only for it to fall to the bottom. **A more apt analogy isn’t pushing it up a hill, but rather rolling the boulder along a road.**

I’m no longer living for the next session.

I’m no longer spending all of my money as soon as I get it.

I have smoked ~almost~ everyday for the past 6 years. I fell completely in love with weed for lack of better terms— the feeling of escaping reality on a day to day basis intrigued me & made me feel “alive”. I believe my high state of mind helped me reach a lot of spiritual realizations in my life, has helped to calm me down overall & often showed me how to look at the brighter side of life by simply switching up my perspective. Alas- I feel slightly betrayed by my green friend, for I am 24 years old & the past few years have started to feel like one giant day that I can vaguely remember. It’s like suddenly I find that I have nothing I’m deeply passionate about, I have ideas on “career choices” but don’t know where to begin, so I just allow myself to keep living while doing the bare minimum. Sleep, smoke, eat, smoke, socialize, smoke. I feel the current moment so deeply when I’m high, but I find that my long term memories & overall concept of time has somehow been distorted. For so long weed has been part of my persona. I’m the “stoner” of my friends; they call me to smoke if they need to “wind down”, I roll their blunts/joints, etc. It enhanced the sound of music, the flavor of my food— but it’s as though I’m waking up after a 6 year long nap & I’m asking myself: “wut”. What the hell have I been doing? Why is smoking sometimes the only thing that I think about? Why can’t I sleep without it? Why do I love the feeling of slight ego panic after that first high of the day? When will I stop? Will I truly ever quit? I hate the idea of myself fully relying on something, but damn if I don’t rely on weed— & quite frankly I don’t even remember how I started smoking everyday. Weed has truly become a part of my daily existence & I want to know who I am without it, although the thought of “raw dogging” life makes me cringe, especially with our worlds current events. I guess what I’m asking for is moral support from others who have experienced the same love for weed & then one day asked themselves “what the hell is even happening”. I want to WANT to not smoke. I want my creativity back. I need a new routine in my life. I’ve never tried to whole heartedly quit before, I’ve said that I would try in the past & then still found myself calling my plug to pick up the same day. It’s as if I’m comfortable with this life of just existing & I hate that for myself. I want my sober reality to be enough, I’m tired of escaping every single day. Marijuana can be a beautiful experience, but I have self reflected and came to terms with the fact I am abusing & relying on this plant. So— how long did it take you to quit? What did you do to go to sleep? When did you finally (actually) tell yourself you’re done smoking? Should I quit cold turkey? I type this as I’m staring at my last joint. Today (Sunday) is the day I usually re up. To re up or not re up... that is the question. I look forward to any kind words— I just want to feel completely ~alive~ again ❤️",3

The doc explained to me that I’m going through anxiety and panic still. Can anyone else relate ?,3

I get *so tired*. If I didn't have a kid to take care of, I'm sure afternoon naps would help with this, but I just hit a wall with my energy levels and have tried to line up the kid's screen time with when I'm feeling tired so I can chill on the couch and watch them play video games.

Eating is hit or miss still. I wasn't really able to eat yesterday, and lunch was a little rough today, but I was able to eat a salad with chicken for dinner so that's an improvement.

We're making a gingerbread house today and I've been pleased with my short term memory and time management - something that has been hard without setting reminders everywhere ahead of time.

I still get irritable, especially when I can't eat or when the afternoon exhaustion hits, but I'm not angry at every little thing any longer which has been nice.

I know not *all* of this can be attributed to quitting weed, I'm also almost three weeks into treating anxiety/depression with new medication so it could also be helping me level everything out, but even though the healing is slow I can tell it's in the right trajectory.

It'll be a week tomorrow, which I'm pretty stoked about.

I had graduated college, was getting my masters and my teaching credential. I was doing everything right. But I was completely dependent on weed. I told myself that it was helping my anxiety- when in reality it was making my anxiety worse. I needed to be high, and then when I was high I was hating myself for not being strong enough to be sober. I quit May 23 when I realized I was smoking away my determination and drive. 

I am incredibly lucky that the first time I decided to quit, I could. I am now 6 months sober.

But I am having incredibly strong relapsing thoughts. When I was high I was still succeeding. I was failing upwards. As Jamie Lee Curtis put it in an interview, I had a ""high bottom"". I know that I am an addict and that smoking again will lead to so many more problems than relief, but the denial thoughts are so strong. 

""It would just be one cartridge for making it to Christmas Break"" ""I would be rewarding myself for working so hard as a teacher"" ""Nothing bad really happened when I smoked"" ""You quit so easily last time"" ""It would just be one time"" ""You can be a casual smoker again, look how well you quit"" ""It felt so good"" 

I am afraid to tell anyone about these thoughts because then I know they will talk me out of it or watch my extra careful to make sure I don't relapse.",4

But the field is incredibly competitive. Forget 80-20; its more like only 1-2% actually achieve the standard I want to be at. Do these people laze around all day, blazing and playing the 192762539th game of Rocket League or Warzone? Quite the opposite - they ensure their mental (and by extension physical) health is in tip top shape, not allowing themselves to be distracted from their goal.

So in my mind, the choice is clear. Sobriety, dedication, and success - or addiction, laziness and failure.

I hope that I can keep my social circle somewhat intact, but I am ready to pay that price too, should it come to it.

2020-12-12 20:31:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kc1i8o/unwinding_without_weed/,Unwinding without weed,"I smoked weed because I wanted to be as chilled out as possible. I used weed as a way to totally dim the harsh bright lights of life. I used it to unwind from a long day (and frankly what felt like a long life). However, sometimes that meant unwinding before the day even begun. I wanted to dull the details of my anxiety enough that I was merely existing. I spent my days in a blurry reality. As they say, it was fun, and then it was fun with problems, and then it just became problems. 

Today I have 617 days sober. I’m in the middle of finals and I’m stressed to say the least. I still want to chill out and numb my mind a bit. I still want to unwind and relax from all the shit I have to do. And that’s ok! That makes me human. My desire to chill out is not the issue. But how I react to that desire is what matters. Today I chose to eat some junk food (a greasy cheese and pork quesadilla to be exact) and then I did my favorite 45 minute yoga class. I’m not dipping into my savings account or leaving my friends on read or ignoring my cat when he begs for dinner because I’m too faded on the couch. I get to still unwind and enjoy the aspects of life that come when I live healthily and responsibly. 

Edit: It took me months to get to this place. My first few months of sobriety consisted of binging on candy bars and taking 4 baths a day. I’ve learned to have patience and to trust that things fall into place. Anyway, I hope this helps someone. Thanks for reading.",433

Here are some things I’ve realized:

1. You feel much more clear headed very fast. Took me <2 weeks to notice a significant difference in memory and processing speed.

2. Cravings turn into fond memories - after a while you don’t have a desire to smoke as much as a nostalgic reminder from time to time. I’m a senior is college and most of my friends/housemates smoke so I can smell it and hear about it often and while I used to have temptations at this point I’m pretty indifferent. It was fun while it lasted but overall don’t feel like I need it.

3. Stress and self-reflection double/triple. And it’s hard to deal with setbacks or things that upset you in the beginning. You don’t get to take a hit to relax, you have to face what you don’t like and are basically forced to come up with a plan on how to fix it. I realized I was a lot more anxious than I used to be, but that I was actually doing something positive about it. Over time, the anxiety subsided and found myself being productive not out of stress, but out of my own desire to improve - the best thing I could have done for myself.

One more thing: you can do it. I thought I never could then I tried, it started as just a week t break and I just kept extending. Don’t put too much pressure or expectation on yourself, but you won’t get anywhere if you don’t try and pick yourself back up when you fail. That’s how you win.",15

 I kinda forgot. I think that says a lot about where I am in my recovery and this journey on the whole.

Life is good. Of course there's not so great things and I'm dealing with SAD now and for the first time in a long time doing so without weed as a helper... But, I still feel really good despite that. We all have off days and down periods but in no way do I feel that weed is the solution to a single one of my problems now.

As I've continued on with sobriety I've also added more things to my list of kicked habits. Most recently nicotine. Something I never thought I'd be able to kick yet here I am 14 days clean of that too. 

Things really do add up over time. Day by day. As long as you always do a little bit each day. It all counts. It all helps.

I’m really not enjoying this aspect of recovery. Has anyone else felt this way? It’s getting really hard to make it through the day when I feel so tired constantly. I’ve been dreaming very vivid dreams every night so maybe that is part of the reason too.

One of the biggest obstacles to following through with sobriety for me (and I’m being totally serious) is the fact that it feels 10x better to cum after getting good and baked.

Hello. Long time lurker and first time poster. This community was instrumental in helping me get into the mentality to quit.  I felt like I was the only one going through a shitty relationship with weed, but these post made me realize I’m not alone. I’m a 21F senior in college and I’ve been smoking casually since senior year of high school, with it turning into a nightly habit my freshman year and a daily habit my sophomore year and beyond. I first had thoughts that I need to quit my freshman year, but once the anxiety wore off from the high and I thought about how dramatic I was because “you can’t get addicted to weed”, I was right back to smoking the next day. Weed has prohibited me in so many ways from being successful. I used to be able to juggle a job, sports, and doing well in school, but my focus, memory, determination and social skills have diminished tremendously. I want nothing more than to get back to the old me. 

I miraculously was offered a very good job position for after I graduate college, where I’ll move to a new state. I’ll need to pass an examination, as well as a drug test, to stay on board. I also just want to be at full functioning brain capacity by the time I start, and have an easier time socializing and meeting people. This was the kicker for me giving away my grinder and the rest of my weed, and I made it to two weeks. I felt great. Come Thanksgiving break, I smoked with my friend back home for a couple nights. Thought I had it under control to jump back on the horse, but ever since then I’ve been justifying myself smoking, going about 2-3 days in between without. My roommate smokes, and while I can hang out with her while she does and not indulge, the next night may be a different story. 

Of course I regret smoking every time. I don’t even get high and I feel too stupid to hold a conversation. The worst part is getting the shakes. Sometimes they’re so bad they’re painful. Last night I was watching a movie with my roommate, when I asked if I could partake in smoking. I was shaking so bad and couldn’t pay attention to the movie. I even went to my room to take some anti-anxiety medication my mom gave me at the start of the semester for emergencies. I haven’t had to touch that stash since she gave them to me 4 months ago. I hope that was enough of a wake up call for me to realize I should never touch the stuff again. 

If I hadn’t relapsed since I first quit, I’d be at 30 days free right now. I want to know what it feels like to literally have no weed in my system. I want to focus on working out, eating right and gaining weight. I want to be strong both mentally and physically for this next chapter in my life. I’m sick of starting my sober app over. I’m ready to be myself again. 

Hopefully this post marks the start of day 1 forever. Thank you for reading, and good luck to anyone thinking about quitting, in the early days, or seasoned leavers.",3

First time posting here because I’ve recently quit smoking after having a bad trip. I’ve been a heavy weed smoker for about 12 years (I’m 27 now) I would smoke over a gram a day sometimes wax and dabs. My last time smoking I had a really bad trip where I thought about my childhood and the abuse I had from neighbors. I’ve never thought that before when high but for some reason I was thinking about that. After that I decided to quit smoking but now I can’t stop thinking about the past (obsessive thinking) and bad anxiety. I’m not sure if this is due to going cold turkey or something else. 

I’m on week 2 of not smoking and I have no motivation eating, no motivation playing video games, getting out of bed, insomnia, body aches and on top of all this obsessive thinking not sure if some memories were nightmares or reality.

Deciding with pretty decent initial motivation that somehow seems to dissipate the more real the action gets. I'm sure others here can relate. 

I know somewhere inside me I want to stop smoking weed. I've been great about stopping smoking cigarettes after 15 plus years, drinking after years of sometimes multiple days of binge drinking, and harder drugs (I'll just let your imagination fill in the details of this vice). Stopping the weed always seems to elude me. Possibly because there is no hangover, so my body really doesn't have a physical aversion to it. 

The mind is a different story. Especially during shelter in place, I'm becoming more isolated, literally in my apartment and more figuratively in my mind. Today was a tipping point. I found a girl online that was actually interested in hanging out with me (which is a bit of a rarity but I'll stay focused and won't go into that here). My socially anxious, agoraphobic, weed smoking self was thinking about excuses to call it off all morning. She won't like me. I won't be entertaining enough. It's so much effort. So, I called it off and decided to stay home smoking weed instead. Weed definitely places me inside my head, which is clouded with indecision and self loathing. I know this isn't a therapy session, but maybe some others can get the point and possibly relate. 

I have decided I want to quit. That's step one right? I do have about a quarter left. I hate economic waste, so I don't see myself throwing it away or giving it away. The plan is to finish the bag, then abstain. This is a different strategy from quitting other vices. Usually I go cold turkey. The slow wean. Good idea or bad idea?",3

I just started today my break. More of yesterday where I had my last joint at the morning and already had trouble sleeping but I pushed through.

I consider myself a heavy weed smoker (5-7 joints per day for 4 years). Never tried to quit, although I stopped for a month in the whole 4 years because I had to travel for work for a month (that's the only reason). It really fucked up my financials. I still do good at school. But my performance took a considerable dip especially this year.

Today is what I consider my real first day although it is really hard so far. I'm in a study break for my finals and while I'm pushing myself to study, my brain is feeling really irritated and snappy. I really hope I can get over this initial hump quickly.

Also is there anything you do to relief yourself of that irritation? I tried smoking and coffee but ofc it is not the same or even similar.

Thank you

The thing is, whilst trying to convince myself to reward myself ""just smoke over the Christmas weekend"" I then already start bargening for more time ""if I'm going to smoke for Christmas I may as well get some now"" and so on.

I've managed to quit for a month or two before and everytime I've allowed just one time I relapse for months. Idk if that would happen here, it would probably be a rough few weeks but I'm sure I could get through it and not smoke after NY but idk if that's just junkie thinking.


I feel like CV19 is making everything worse, it's making living here worse, I probably wouldn't be craving so much if I'd have been able to get out a bit more, meet people instead of being stuck in the house. Xmas/NY probably would seem so dull if I could go out NYE.

I managed to quit for a month once in 2018 and a couple months in 2019 but I eventually devolved back fully into my addiction because I was not committed to recovery and I was looking for a way I could still have it in my life and use it “once in a while” but now I’m pretty sure that idea is nothing but a mirage of a nonexistent paradise off in the distance of my mind. 

I was always kidding myself when I pushed the date back further and further. Day 1 is always just going to suck. I realize that to avoid the suffering is to avoid trying to quit at all. To be honest I’m most afraid of the no sleep and how my mind will deal with that at work next week ... buuuut I’m also nervous for all the emotions and having to deal with them all for real not with a quick bandaid fix of getting high constantly.....

I live in Canada and there’s about 7 weed stores within 1 km of my house this makes it soooo much harder for me to quit. The battles in my head are absolutely constant. Fuck, I miss the days when in order to quit weed all I had to do was delete my dealers number. On top of that no one out side of this sub seems to recognize, understand or care how much we suffer due to this (totally misunderstood) addiction to a plant which most people actually believe is impossible to get addicted to.... it’s a pretty invalidating experience 

I know you all understand and that’s why this sub means so much to me and why it’s so helpful for me in this journey. Sometimes you all take thoughts that I cant find words for right out of my head and then I get to read them and understand myself more through you. I could go on but basically - Thanks for making me feel like I am not alone in this.🤍🙏🏼


Edit—— I have been using thc carts alllllll day everyday for the last 5 months. I know the withdrawal is going to be brutal. If you were in a similar situation and you have any suggestions or advice to give me as I step off into the battlefield please reach out. I would love to hear from you.",11

2020-12-12 07:20:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kbo8bj/read/,READ,"For me personally the worse experience due to me being high wasn’t just one experience it was an entire super paranoid/ delusional mindset. I used to think that most people disliked me or thought I was a joke , due to me never being “happy” or sociable in any way. I was pretty much this close 👌🏾 to turning paranoid schizo, I used to smoke weed everyday atleast 2-5 times a day for the past 6 years. So far I’ve been sober for a 11 days and when I say my entire life feels like... well that I’m living again. I’m able to say hi or spark up small menial conversation with people without having waves of anxiety or questioning what they might think of me, my confidence have slowly but surely started coming back and I’m honestly just shocked how heavy being high all the time influenced my behaviors. I knew that when I was high I felt ‘different’ but I really had no clue the damage I was doing to my body and mind. I’m at the point now where I don’t have a single craving nor have I had a single craving since I quit because honestly, I wasn’t living a life worthy of me when I would just numb everything and go through the motions in a pseudo-terrified/ anxious state. My thoughts have started to become a lot nicer to myself and I have gotten a job, started talking to girls again ( my nerves/ lack of confidence fully had me questioning and doubting my sexual orientation) due to me never speaking to females in recent months due to the wave of anxiety/ feelings of inadequacy I put in my own head about myself. There is absolutely and I mean absolutely no desire for me to smoke, and even if for a brief second I get an urge; I immediately remember that I stopped enjoying getting high close to 2 years ago, and the only reason I didn’t quit was because I kept telling myself that I was only trying to use the weed as an excuse to why I wasn’t where I wanted to be in life/ why I didn’t feel good about myself. I thought that I could just “thug” it out, and if I stopped being such a pussy/ so negative about everything then I would finally be happy. Long story short , it’s been 11 days since I stopped smoking, in the past 7 years I’ve went less than 30’days sober total. I still have some insecurities, doubts, and feelings of inadequacy but now my mind reinforces that I got this and I can achieve anything instead of berating myself for feeling the way I do. 
Quitting weed was the best decision I’ve made in the past few years and I just want you to know that you got this, no we got this; r/leaves is a family going through similar situations and as long as you focus on the success stories and not the urge to get lifted - we’ll all be able to make a massive turn around.

But I saw the decline, I was an athlete, but gradually I started backing off from my football practices. Then I got a job after MBA in a secluded location, weed became my friend. Work + Weed was all I did. Became distant from my family, became money godzilla as weed wasn't cheap. Then, I started watching Stoic Philosophy, which pointed me towards a better high, i.e taking up responsibilities, aiding ageing parents, household etc. This gave me deep inner satisfaction which I was avoiding with the help of weed. Weed was giving me instant gratification, but the deep sense of life and gratification only came after I took up responsibilities.
  Weed grows naturally in the Mountains here, its freely available, but I restrain myself from these vices as it doesn't help my progress in life. The one thing I did, I replaced weed with Video Games, weight lifting, gardening. And now I feel more complete and at peace with the universe.
  Will keep updating, this is just a rough sketch of my inner thoughts. All the best guys, I hope eventually you all will find the true salvation, which we try to seek from outside. But at the end it all begins from within. :)",24

I got back last night, stayed with family, gave my nieces presents and played with them in the yard, drove myself home, excitedly shared photos with my housemates, unpacked and cleaned up, now I'm lounging on the floor watching cartoons and eating pizza, feeling amazing and completely clear, sober.

I gave up smoking 10 days ago , I was dealing with depression and anxiety from the past 10 days. I started working out and running. Unfortunately I sprained my ankle and I  was supposed to go meet the doctor . The waiting line in doctor was for 2 hours. I had gotten my friend to come assist me because I was in a wheel chair. After getting to the hospital we realised that we had to wait 2 hours until we can get a single X-ray . Seeing that we could do nothing else . My friend suggested that we should take a quick break and smoke and come back .long story short , I convinced myself to smoke because there was literally nothing else I could think of. 

It was then that I realised that how bad I’ve become socially . I could not convince him to do anything else . It was as if weed was the only thing that was keeping us friends. I feel disgusted that without weed I feel like I got nothing to talk to people about. And lately as I’ve been injured I can’t get to go outside and get some exercise .

Is there anyone else who feels like weed has severely affected your social skills . I am a great person socially , but I soon realised that my social topics slowly changed to weed . And now that I used to be a stoner for 3+ years . It’s become hard to talk to people without involving weed in the conversation. Even my mind can’t seem to get off this . Lately I’ve been looking as pictures from last 3 years and all good memories / fun I had were because of weed. Although they were fun . I didn’t improve on myself , me and my friends just went and smoked and came back . I feel like my last 3 years have been a complete waste. 

It is becoming so hard to let go of that part and get motivated to do my own thing. Does anyone else feel the same",4

I can't stop crying writing this because I am so grateful for everyone. Please people, keep posting your stories for the next person. You have no idea the impact your experiences/support have.

So with that said, the big difference this time is DIET. 
It helps so much with the fog, depression , self hate etc. Of course the first 10 days all you do is cry, but that's ok. Let it out...and love yourself. Keep fighting everyday because YOU deserve a better life. YOU beat out 5 million sperm to be here. So let's make it count together. 

So just to clarify a little. My diet consists only of meat,eggs,fruit,veggies, nuts and seeds. No condiments, no grains, no diary. Yes it may taste gross sometimes eating raw carrots and broccoli but feed your brain and body properly. Spend a couple extra dollars and get the organic. But if you can't buy it frozen instead, it will never go bad.

I would have had 17 months a few days ago, had I not relapsed in September.

Today I hit 40 days everything free, 45 days cannabis free.

I've been struggling with the desire to escape my mind - life is hard right now. But life will always be hard, eventually. And then eventually it will get easier. There's a beautiful symmetry to that, I think.

Right now I have 40 days of total sobriety, pizza cooling on the stove, a cat that adores me, an incredibly soft blanket, a support network that's stood with me through the turmoil and loved me when I refused to love myself. A clarity of mind, about who I am, what I really, truly need, and what I do not.

I am learning to love myself again, absent the love of a partner, absent the heady infatuation of weed.

You'll get there too. It'll be hard, there might be roadblocks and backtracks. There certainly were for me.

And I'm so, so excited for you, to share in this heartful of gratitude I have now. Take your time getting here, or don't. Do what you need to do.

It'll be here when you're ready, like it was for me.

Peace,

I wasn’t sure if I was gonna be able to make it this long, but I’ve probably powered through the worst of it by now. It probably sounds weird but I honestly have no idea how I did it, but something just triggered in my brain that it was time to give it up, at least for quite awhile. The first two weeks were absolute shit lol. I started smoking when I was 16 and fell in love with it, and smoked almost daily for about 7 years, and I’m 23 now. I’m also finally starting to feel much better, not nearly as much fogginess in my brain, and I can dream again which has been pretty awesome to say the least. I’ve also lost about 60 pounds throughout this whole year, and not getting high every day has substantially reduced my craving for fattening foods, especially the munchies late at night before bed. And I’m really looking forward to hopefully being able to soon pass a drug test so I can get myself a better paying job. I took one already on day 27 and I failed, which I was totally expecting as I was a pretty heavy smoker, usually about 1-3 grams a day depending on the mood. Sorry for the long post but I could definitely use some advice and support, I really want to keep this going. I’ve made it this far and I’m finally starting to actually be proud of myself again!

- r/leaves community 
- new hobby (running) 4 times a week 
- new born baby 
- quit alcohol- it was a trigger

What I found to be the best way to quit was when I start exercising (running). That removes all the bad stuff as well and give birth to new positive stuff. Here are bad habits that fell off when I started exercising with commitment.

Bad Habits/things gone
- Weed
- Alcohol
- Anxieties / Paranoia
- Self Doubt
- weird sleeping patterns
- bad hip hop songs that promotes drugs and belittling woman

Good habits acquired
- eating healthy 
- healthy body
- reading books (completed more 12: non-fiction and YA novels)
- affinity for plants
- reading more about Buddhism, a journey to discover myself 
- meditation 

I tried different methods and I have been struggling to quit but the best method for me that worked was by exercising on a daily and that comes with a big bundle of positives while the negative fall off. Also, I do believe there’s a higher power that gives you strength - I started going to church. Whoever who wants to quit, good luck and I do believe eventually you’ll break through and when you do, hold on to that method that helped you quit. Keep trying, Life is hard and by being intoxicated you’re making it even more harder. Stay sober and be yourself all the time. Be proud of your clear mind.

Smoking costed me a marriage, a great job, many good friends... 2020 came, my life was pretty fucked up... And I decided to stop and recover my life. It felt like the right thing to do. 

I was OK with the job I had, it paid the bills, it paid the weed and gave plenty of time to smoke and chill. I could live. But, was that the life I wanted? 
About a month ago I started running low, and I said ""I'm going to try to quit, again"". Luckily, I live in Ecuador, so weed ain't legal. Deleting the dealer's phone number was the first step. Getting rid of anything weed related was the second step. 
Being sober with myself, for the first time in years was the dreaded third step. I always failed here in the past. 
This time I came here. I wrote, I read, I shared. I found the strength and motivation connecting with you. Reddit was my best choice to not fall agaib


The first days were hell. I was sweating, craving all day long, having mood swings and hating myself for thinking I could do it. The first days I just wanted a big fat blunt, or even just a small nug ( I moved furniture, I cleaned the house, I was hoping to find something)
Then, I talked to myself in the mirror. We cried.
For about a week, sleeping was impossible. I just wanted to smoke dammit! I wanted to be better, but I also wanted to not feel like shit. One hit please, only one hit... It was only day 2.
Day 3 I was angry. At the world, at myself, at the pizza guy and the wifi. I hated my life, but I also hated the color on the building in front of my apartment. I hated my addiction, but I also hated that my drink was not as cold as I wanted. This had to be an abstinence response. I knew I could get through it. I hated it, but I knew I could. 
By the end of day 3, I had written about 6 pages of every single thought that came to my head. 

On day 4, I started sending my CV to every job I ever wanted (I have 2 masters, but I was also stoned 24/7). I hated every second of my life while doing this. I just wanted some weed! 
Why am I doing this? I can just go back to the couch. I could call someone else for a hit, right? 
But then, things started to change. At first, I realized smoking was a routine, not a pleasure. My obsession with smoking was stronger than any effect (maybe it was tolerance) that smoking gave me. I felt like I could fight back. 
The fog started to clear. I started to feel like I could, maybe, be better. 
And then, it happenw

I landed two great job interviews this week. I got both of them. I aced both interviews and got both jobs (one is a 6 week project, the other is more of a long run job) I also spent time with my 3 year old son, without the hurry of getting back for a hit, for the first time in more than 2 years.

Do I think about weed?
Yes, the idea is there
Am I craving?
Yes, some times I really want a hit
Am I going to smoke again?
Not now. And ""now"" is the only time I have access to due to how space-time works.

Day 17.
I've been sleeping better, I even had dreams.
I have energy to do things. The day lasts more, time somehow changed. Motivation is there, appetite is back, self love seems to be sprouting for the first time in 15 years.

Day 17. I feel a 1000% better, and I'll keep working to overcome the addiction. This is just the beginning.

Thanks redditors, your stories brought me here. Your support is keeping me on top of this.

I hope this reaches you. I hope you find the strength you need to be the best yourself you can be.
Love. J",26

Towards the end, I was smoking anywhere and kept it on the low but still I got soo comfortable! It is nice joy being a slave to the tree, but instead focusing on me and what I can do!

I was stoned so much that I stopped feeling it because it just felt normal, from waking up in the morning to going to bed at night. I was coughing up mucus with what I’m assuming is resin or some sort of smoke residue. 

This summer I found out I have type 2 bipolar disorder, and the psychiatrist I started seeing referred me to my addiction counselor, who has been a big help. Just being held accountable for my actions and having someone to disappoint has been a good motivator. 

Still, I have yet to go more than a few days without smoking. Over the last few weeks I managed to cut it down to only $20 a week but whenever I visit my parent who smokes, I get blazed with them, and sometimes they give me some. I was also given 3.5 g of bud and 1g of wax by my best friend after her CO vacation, but of course instead of rationing it out fell back into the bad habit of near constant smoking until it ran out (quickly). 

I have so many reasons to quit and I try to remind myself but it’s hard when I’m tired and sore from work and stressed about day to day life and weed just takes that away, albeit momentarily. I think I wouldn’t mind being a casual smoker but I want to at least quit for a while to prove to myself and to everyone that I can. 

Anyway, I’m not sure what I’m hoping to get out of posting this. Advice, maybe. Support? Conversation? All of the above?

If you made it this far, thanks for reading!",14

And then later on I was on a date and having pizza and it hit me like a train. I just wanted to leave and ring for weed. So I sat. And I breathed. And I thought about why today was suddenly going the way things do before a relapse and with these triggers. I noticed my body and brain were basically telling me this situation is no good for you and you need to get out. I realised I crave weed when I don’t want to deal with anything and just want to escape. Especially romantic situations for some reason, it’s like my brain has overruled my instinct when something is off and tells me it’s all ok and to keep going for some reason? Old me would have kept going, let things develop and started smoking secretly and generally felt rough etc. New me left straight after the pizza finished, listened to her gut instincts, and is going to call things off!

The only times I've been sober for any length of time (a week or more) have been when I've been on trips with family. I've tried over and over, have had some small successes of just having a hit before a workout, but it always became a slippery slope of ""okay, just one hit to do this project."" I actually found myself more productive with it, happier, but always becoming paranoid that I was deluding myself.  


I work from home in a creative gig, and weed was always my friend to allow me to dive into some music and hammer out projects, feeling awesome and happy. Now I feel like all of the pain and sadness I've been numbing is right there staring me in the face. This time I'm committed to not running away into getting high or escaping some other way with alcohol, sex, buying anything.. all the addictive behaviors.  


I am finally facing the healing process of rebuilding my self-esteem and self-worth after enduring a narcissistic mother, which led me to a toxic, emotionally abusive affair with a man who was also probably somewhere on the narcissistic spectrum. I fooled myself thinking that weed helped me have major insights about healing, energy, and how the universe works. Maybe it did, but none of it matters when I'm constantly trying to escape my everyday reality.  


I feel like such an asshole. I have an amazing, supportive boyfriend who doesn't care if I smoke, but I've still been hiding it from him (whether successfully or not is a different question). I have an amazing life and have only been taking solid steps over the last year to get out of the credit card debt I put myself in, we're going to move in the next year, I'll be getting away from a family dynamic that isn't currently good for me, I have a great work team and am getting paid well --- and all of it feels like ""is this it?"" without being high. As someone else put it, the utter banality of everyday life feels like a slow march towards death and I don't really know how to cope with that without escaping somehow.  


For now, I'm just trying to sit with it, catch up on work, listen to music, and be present for my relationship. I'm reading a book on healing those core wounds that I believe have led me to have such a predilection towards addictive behaviors and low self-worth.. but it feels so hard to face it all without that numbness that weed brought me.",5

I’ve been a year plus sober and have relapsed because of this thought. “Hey work is going well, I’m in shape, finally have savings. I think we are okay to try this whole smoking thing again”. And when that thought wins, everything rolls downhill. 

I’ve found it helpful to think that I’ll never be out of the woods. Which isn’t a bad thing as long as you know where you’re going. I’m on my way to lifelong sobriety, might get lost here and there, but as long as I keep my bearings, I’ll be okay

For me, keeping that mentality that if I smoke today I’m going to want to smoke everyday. And that’s dangerous. What helps me get ride of some tempting thoughts is asking myself “look how good it’s gotten and remember how bad it got. Am I willing to trade all this goodness for a chance at getting high?” 

NA says “One is too many and a thousand is never enough”. This saying couldn’t not be more spot on. 

I’m creeping up on two months sober from weed after a few sober streaks this year. My intention is not to fall into temptation from here and through 2021. Going a full calendar year sober is proof that I can do it.

I was an addict. And I've been addicted to opiates in the past (codeine, tramadol and oxycodone) when prescribed from my GP. But those were easy for me to give up comparatively to cannabis. Sure the physical withdrawals weren't great. But cannabis had such a strong psychological hold on me, it was unbearable to be without - yet it was unbearable to be high at the same time. 

It was the hardest and most challenging, yet most rewarding decision I ever made. Especially as it was lockdown, so I was working from home a lot more. 

Weed ate up all of my savings. I had £0 savings for 10 years since I started working (and incidentally started smoking). Now I'm en route to a deposit on buying my own house.

Got to 6 months clean and bought myself a Toyota Celica, a car I've been yearning after since I was a kid.

Probably done more for myself in 232 days than I have done throughout my whole life.

The only downside is that I have to face my challenges and mental problems head on, rather than using cannabis to mask them and bury my head in the sand. Which can also be interpreted as a good thing too I guess.

It's been ruining my life at college by making me unmotivated and by taking away my concentration and memory. 

It's been worsening my bipolar symptoms, increasing the frequency and intensity of mood swings and throwing off my medication balance (by interacting with and by making me forget to take it).

I lost touch with friends, isolate myself so i can smoke without being bothered to the point where i spend most of my time alone (this pandemic and lock downs didnt help a bit).

I lost a considerable amount of weight, only being 63kg for 185cm, I barely eat and barely go to the gym or to the swimming pool like i used to. I remember myself 4 years ago, hitting the pool 5/6  times a week, eating good and being 10 to 15 kg fatter.

I don't sleep well anymore, rarely wake up before 11AM, i became lazy, easily stressed and lost a good part of my optimistic personna. Used to have all A+ with great ease and to be one of the best at school, now i consider myself extremely lucky if i can get a C+ or a B-. 

I first used to relax a bit during the weekend, or after big exams, but it has become a coping mecanism for almost any problem i am encountering (stressful familial environment (i still live at my parents home which plays a lot, loneliness, anger, sadness,...).

I've come to realise that this coping mecanism is nurturing the problems in a vicious circle. I go outside and smoke my head out so i dont stay at home with my parents, but spending tons of money instead of saving keep me away from independence, isolating myself to smoke my problems out keeps me more lonely where a friend could've been great to help me deal with reality and emotions.

I've tried to stop multiple times, but always ending up at my dealer's to buy some.The most time being sober was 2 weeks off during a summer abroad where it was not available. 

It's exhausting, making me studpid, physically sick and complexed, lonely, poor, emotionally numb and more than mentally unstable.

I really don't want that in my life anymore, but i cannot stop, it's like i'm afraid to go back to reality, its ""banality"" and all the emotions that comes living.

I've talked to my best friends about it, my psychiatrist, my priest too, they all have good advices, but none of it helped.

So if anyone has a solution, advices, or words that may help it would help me a lot.

I wanna go back to being this really smart, educated, sporty, ambitious and social kid i was 4 years ago before all this weed. I don't want to walk on this earth like a zombie anymore.

Thanks for reading all of this, and thanks in advance for the answers. Hope you are all doing good, or at least better than me",23

(Harder actually that the first two weeks of quitting) I like that I’m not using weed to mask my issues and I’m having to face them but it’s hitting me just how many thing I was masking with weed. My depression is so much worse, my anxiety is so much harder to handle. Once I get anxious I have an extremely hard time stopping the thoughts, even with meditation that used to work in the past. My ED that I had thought I pretty much overcame is back in full swing to the point where I get panic attacks when looking at my body. I’ve noticed that every day I have an intense urge to get things done or to be doing something productive but I can’t get myself to actually do those things or I do things and I never feel satisfied, always feel like I should be doing more but at the same time have no motivation to do whatever it is my brain is saying is so important or I just can’t figure out what I should be doing. Things that previously made me angry when I smoked weed now just make me immensely unbearably sad to the point of panic. I’m crying so much more, sad so much more and the sadness is way more intense and debilitating. Also I go through periods of time where I feel like I want to do something but feel like I would not be able to enjoy anything, even things I like doing. Get this extreme feeling of neither happiness nor sadness just discomfort and I can not figure out why. It’s like an inability to be relaxed mixed with a feeling of absolutely no emotion and also fear of what my life will be like. It’s hard to do anything except be on my phone all day I’m feeling like I need stimulation but can’t find anything that will stimulate me in the way I need. And also no motivation to actually seek stimulation just anxiety about the feeling I’m experiencing to the point where I start fidgeting and rubbing my legs together and rubbing my thumbs with my index finger until I’m in this state of hyperactive dysphoric anxiety and my muscles hurt. I’m honestly just confused and don’t know what to do. I thought I knew and understood my emotions pretty well but this is all so overwhelming and confusing and I don’t understand it at all.

It is also in a city where weed is recreational so the plugs are walking distance away. I am already starting to rationalize in my mind how it will be fine for me to break my longest streak in 4 years because I will be away from home. How since it will feel like vacation I can take a break from my break and go right back to it when I am done apartment sitting and how now I can have a functional relationship with weed since I already proved to myself I could quit for this long and how this situation doesn’t come around often so it’s justified to relapse.,2

It has helped me try to kick my habit once and for all. Secondly, this is a long one but I implore you to read it all.

&#x200B;

The first time I got high was Halloween my 9th grade year, and I LOVED it. Like, I really really loved it. I was 14 years old. By the time Christmas break came around only a couple of months later I was an everyday smoker. The first day I got back to school from Xmas break I woke and boke and went to school high. My very few friends I had at the time thought I was crazy, but low and behold it was already written in my mind that this would be the way for me going forward. I got high every morning - and smoked all day - from then to now. I am about to turn 32 next month.

&#x200B;

Smoking weed Literally became my personality. I started to sell it by 10th grade and started to make a lot more friends through weed. For whatever stupid teenage ego reason, I wanted to be the guy who could smoke more than anyone and I sent out to prove it. For the next few years, I would be smoking about a quarter a day, between myself and those whom I smoked out.. doing stupid things like betting money on who could take the biggest bong rip. I once ghosted a gram of weed through a 4 foot bong in one rip, I admit I am still a little proud of that one. This was all just a silly ego boost though and only reinforced my habit. I liked being that guy though, as before my weed habit I was a heavy loner, and it felt good to seem noticed.

&#x200B;

To make things worse, I began to drink very heavily at about age 17, a habit that would only get worse and worse until I started pulling in the reigns when I was about 28. It got so bad that I left my previous life behind and embarked to figure things out in a new town where I knew nobody. This has helped me take control of my drinking incredibly, and am proud to say I no longer have a major problem with alcohol.

&#x200B;

Thing is, this whole time I thought that the booze was my real issue, when in all actuality it is my addictive behavior in general. You see, we are all told weed isn't that big of a deal, and I fell for and believed this for half my life. This is a behavior that I chose adamantly in 9th grade, and has stuck with me and defined my life all the way to my thirties. I have always been ""that guy"" who associates EVERYTHING with smoking weed, and I have always believed it to be perfectly OK. People have told me many times that I would be better off not smoking so much, but I always ignored their suggestions. I just loved it too much. It was WHO I AM!

&#x200B;

Well then Covid hit and the love of my life left me a month or two later. This was my third heartbreak and it hit harder than ever. The scenario worsened when my brother who was living with us at the time started doing heroin again. Fuck was I depressed, and fuck did I start smoking myself silly. I have been a depressed mess for the better part of six months now, and somehow still managed to not go back to the drink to drown all my sorrows.

&#x200B;

Here is where it gets interesting. I make music, and I have a lot of really cool gear to do that with. I am already a homebody who avoids people at all costs, so I figured the Covid lock-down would be such a fine opportunity to really get into it the way I had always wanted...... but I was still smoking an eighth a day, and no music has been happening, none of my cherished gear is being used. Instead I spend all my time staring at a screen researching things and smoking weed. 14 hours a day, everyday. Why the hell was I not making music?

&#x200B;

Was it the weed? No way. Could it be the weed? Nah I don't think so. Maybe its the weed? Well fuck, maybe it is, but I really don't want it to be. Its the weed dude! Well fuck me what am I going to do about this, weed defines my life.

&#x200B;

That's when it hit me. I have allowed for half of my life to LET WEED DEFINE ME. Honestly, pondering this started to disgust me. Now don't get me wrong, I still love the plant, she is a very wonderful gift to humanity. However I realized that I really no longer could justify my relationship with it.

&#x200B;

I look around and I really have no friends. That's my fault. My lover left me. That's my fault. I am not pursuing my passions. That too is my fault. I have allowed myself a lazy attitude toward life, and that is also my fault. I have just been using the weed to cover the negative guilty emotions related to these realizations. I was numbing myself from both personal and social responsibility, and that is my fault. I have avoided family, and that is my fault.

&#x200B;

I am taking my life back, as I have far too many aspirations that have been on the back-burner for 17 years. That is the biggest problem with the abuse of this wonderful plant, it allows you to put off the important things indefinitely, and allows you to feel good enough about it to not even give it a second thought. Oh how I wish I would not have gambled my adolescent personality on the fact that I so thoroughly enjoyed the plant. There are so many other things to look forward too.

&#x200B;

This is my fourth day without it, and I am certainly feeling it. Sweaty, zero appetite, cant fall asleep, alternating between anxious and depressed, nausea and headaches. Mild enough but still disconcerting. Really, I just want to feel motivated and full of energy again. I WANT MY DREAMS BACK. I want my life back. I want to make new friends again and reach out to family regularly. I want to make art, and most of all I want the inspiration to make my music to come back full force.

&#x200B;

Does anyone else feel that their drive for creativity sorta just went out the window when they quit? How long did it take after you quit smoking to REALLY feel that drive again?? These are serious questions. I cant recall the last time I was truly motivated to get down n dirty and just create. I force myself to do it, but it does not feel good yet. Is this normal? I just want to feel motivated to do what I know I love to do. Why is this so damn hard? I know it is only day 4 for me, but I would love some insight from those of you who know what this feels like and have gotten past it successfully. Please, creative ones who lost their way and found it once again, tell me your stories!

NOT smoked. Have not browsed. Have not let myself think of getting on as an option. 

And it feels good. 

I threw out all my stuff. Even things I'd owned since the 90s. I hate littering and waste but i didn't want to have any of it around anymore. 

I have had a few trigger moments. Going into my office at 8pm a few nights ago I realised I was looking forward to using my vape. Then it all hit ne. I've thrown my vape out. I've quit weed. I'm planning on never smoking again. And for a few seconds I felt a deep, deep sadness and grief. I let it wash over and through me. It passed and I was ok. This is ok. 

I do think it really helps that I quit drinking 4 years ago and saw a psychologist. That helped me understand why these things are so appealing to me. Even though I still ended up totally addicted to weed again, it's been a lot easier quitting with this understanding of myself. I think that's was the biggest hurdle for me the first time, getting clean and then having to deal with the emotional reasons of why I was using so heavily in the first place. 

I've been using this place, attending NA meetings and I've made an appointment to a psych. I think this is too important to not create a network to help me succeed. I've also had some great DM conversations with ppl from here which has been super helpful. 

I'm really glad I've taken this step. No it hasn't fixed my life, but it's removing this huge barrier between me and getting things done. Now if I chill on the couch for 3hrs, it's my choice, not the weed forcing me to do it. 

Things are good. Yes I'll miss weed. No I'm never going back. I've made plans to get out of the house. I'm working on my goals. I've hit a bunch of workouts. This is good. 

I hope you're all doing well. When it comes down to it, all we have to do is not purchase the stuff and refuse all gifts. Can't partake if you don't have any. And then get help for any mental issues. It's the snowball effect in action, one day at a time. 

Hope you all have a good xmas!",8

I’m cooking more, making moves towards my goals, and keeping up with my physical therapy. 

But then I start to feel lonely and I want to block it out. I’m not going to though. I know the issue has more to do with some relationship work that needs to be done with my SO. And feeling overwhelmed with the job searching/feeling not qualified and so far from my goals. The only way to fix these things is to actually deal with them. Rather than “get over it” and continue to ignore the issues I have to sit with it and feel the way I do so I remember it’s important to deal with them and they matter to me. 

Whenever I get high I think “oh that’s not a big deal” “I was over reacting” or something weird rationalization for why I actually want a shitty job rather than working hard towards what I want or figuring out what is really going on. 

It’s really hard in this moment to not pick up my favorite coping mechanism.

The way I want to end this is by saying that it really is about communities and not being selfish that just feels good it feels good to not have everything always be about me cuss that’s when I get extremely disappointed, dissatisfied, un motivated , it’s just so bizzare how one thing in life is a chain reaction to another , every time I go sober I feel so good and so Alive I don’t know why I really try to convince myself that it isn’t the weed that’s it’s just out of world energy doing this to us which I am big believer of I truly believe there’s a higher race that is FEEDING OFF OUR ENERGY, yes literally like artificial anxiety just something that’s here that’s overwhelming all of us and the first step is just to get sober  

This message is scattered and all over the place with my ideas and thoughts I didn’t really plan this out or organize I’m just venting right now and I’m sure there’s someone that has been thinking the same way i have been 

I’m quitting weed again tommorow my longest break was month I’ve done that several times and it’s been worth it every single time you get to feel so good that you literally wanna smoke cuss you think it’ll be alright and that your self again no way you’ll have a breakdown again etc it’s all bs just stay away from weed if you think for a single second that it’s holding you back , I’ll be updating in about 10 days or 7 to explain the shift I feel",5

2020-12-10 19:02:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kar10z/day_2_im_exhausted_already/,"Day 2, I’m exhausted already.","I decided yesterday (9/12/20) that I was no longer wanting to smoke. 

A bit of backstory for me first, since I might be posting here more regularly. This is going to be a long post. Feel free to skip, but I appreciate your time if you don’t. I’ll include a TL;DR at the bottom. 

I was never extremely popular in my school years, I was very much that kid that had his own circle of friends and everyone else knew him kinda, and he got invited to some parties that the people he knew put on but never the big parties that popular kids had that everyone seemed to be invited to, and despite having a healthy social circle of good friends, I always felt like I was the subject of ridicule even if I wasn’t. This really fucked with my head because I always felt as though I had to prove that I was worth people’s time and that I was serious business, not that I’m intimidating or want to intimidate, rather that I wanted to not be seen as a joke, if that makes sense. 

I first started smoking weed when I was about 16, but only ever sparingly. I never had the funds to smoke any real huge amounts and definitely not to myself. As the years progressed, (I’m 19 now, I know 3 years may not seem long but to me the past 3 years have felt the longest in my life) I began to work more, get student loans, make more money and get better connections to dealers, and it basically started from there. My friend started smoking quite heavily and whenever we would see each other we would skin up and get stoned and love life, and I really did love life and didn’t think it could get better. 

Fast forward to September 2020. 

I moved cities and as a young man moving into University Accommodation I wanted nothing more than to be the man on campus, you know? The kind of guy that everyone loved to have around, the big kahuna, guys wanna be him, girls wanna be with him. The usual identity crisis shit that young people go through. My flatmates were from various small villages and towns and I was from the big city so this helped boost my ego a little and help me internalise this tough guy image I painted of myself. 

At first I struggled to find dealers here because the University I attend is in a city ten times smaller than where I came from so dealers are few and far between. 

I wish I never found a dealer. 

When I found him, I thought this is amazing, I get to smoke weed, and I get to further create the persona of the cool guy. 

However, something I never anticipated was the chronic lack of interest in me. I know what you’re thinking, this guy is a narcissistic ass who wants attention, this isn’t the case, it’s a kid’s realisation of the big world. You move out from your old turf and no one knows you and no one gives a shit if you smoke weed or shoot heroin, so long as it doesn’t interfere with them. 

Of course, this is in the midst of a global pandemic, and no one is having fun. There’s no parties to go to, no people to meet, just me and the MJ. The lifestyle I wanted so bad, smoking  24/7, hooking up with girls and being a generally well liked individual is impossible. 

Eventually, anxiety and depression started to kick in, I started to panic when I couldn’t feel the effects of the weed, and when I couldn’t feel the effects of the weed I’d buy more, and when I didn’t have money for weed I used my money for food to buy weed and ended up owing money to family and friends on top of paying rent and travel fees and laundry fees and Christmas etc. 

And this brings us to the terminus of this long (sorry) post. 

2 days ago, 12/8/2020, I decided to stop smoking weed. Yesterday, I felt fine right up until I tried to sleep. After months of smoking basically everyday, sleeping at a reasonable time sober wasn’t an option. I was awake until 4am this morning and woke at 830. After a day of exhaustion, I’m glad I’m got through it, I was so sure I’d cave and get some of the sweet stuff but I got through it and I’m looking forward to how far I can take this. 


TL;DR - After a life of feeling like everyone wanted to make fun of me I moved cities for university and wanted to leave that shit behind and reinvent myself, developed a dependency on weed, decided 2 days ago to stop smoking. Couldn’t sleep the first night, exhausted all of the 2nd day but I’m looking forward to where I’m going. 

Thanks for listening. I appreciate it.",6

2020-12-10 17:52:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kapmol/im_quitting_right_now_my_story_of_2020/,I'm quitting right now. My story of 2020,"I had no idea I was going to write a post this long, but now that it's written, here you go...

24 yo male; started smoking weed January 2nd of this year. It was loads of fun, made everything I did fun, and gave me something to look forward to getting off work. My girlfriend and I would smoke up all day for a few months, playing Roblox and some other games, until COVID hit in early March. Working from home I figured I could smoke weed while I worked since nobody could see me and I didn't have to talk much either. So I'd smoke all day and all night; was fantastic!

Being locked down due to Covid, it was pretty much just me alone in my bedroom, working from home, smoking all day and playing video games- something that just felt perfect at the time. It's only now that I realize just how emotionally damaging that was to do that. I stopped giving a shit about other things. I'd get high, sleep, play video games, jerk off 2-3 times a day, something that took ages since I was too uncoordinated and unfocused to do it, but I still persisted.

Once I went back to work in late April, I hated not being high, and not being in my bedroom doing exactly what I wanted to be doing. Waking up in the mornings I would feel completely dehydrated and fucked having smoked tons the previous day. So what do I do needing to wake the fuck up and not feel like shit on a work morning? Smoke more weed; something that, being in IT, is pretty bad when it comes to you needing to be able to solve problems and coordinate with others.

By June, I was a hollow shell. I would come home and keep doing the same thing I had for months. I treated people like shit, and became a terrible person. I felt no drive to do anything, other than what I had been. I was doing terribly at work and was having constant fear about getting fired or not doing enough work because of my dependence on weed. But I still thought ""well maybe if I just smoke less, time it right, drink more water"" etc., I could maybe make it work, because I still loved weed.

By Late July, I spoke with a doctor for the first time about some of the feelings I had throughout the year so far, including self harm and suicide. In early August, my girlfriend of 2 years and 8 months dumped me. This was probably the worst feeling I've had in my life. She had wanted to break up with me for a while, but she was scared I would do something stupid. She hated the person I had become, and so did I.

I've been working on trying to get my life together since then, but I'm still smoking way too much weed at home, and I have no idea if it's really affecting me at work or not. On all mornings I feel like shit, have to drink like 1.5 Liters of water to hydrate myself. I still tried smoking weed in different ways, times, quantities etc.

At this point, I've realized weed just makes me feel like shit most of the time, with really only like 2-4 hours a day that feels good, or at least decent. The other late hours I'm high I just feel normal, not good. My life is empty right now. I'm struggling with ADHD, depression, anxiety, and OCD all at the same time. Trying to find meaning and direction in life. I have 0 friends (I've always struggled making friends and maintaining relationships). Maybe I am just a terrible person in general. Maybe the weed brings out the worst in me. Maybe weed just warps my own interests and makes me into someone completely different.

I've been telling myself to get checked into therapy/CBT for over a year, but I can't convince myself to make any progress. The most I've done on that front is contacting a ""Christian Counseling"" clinic that does CBT. I'm an atheist but as long as they have normal therapy options I don't care. They responded saying faith is not required, but I haven't contacted the back and I'm probably going to push it off even more.

I haven't gone a single day without smoking weed since probably July, and I'm just exhausted. I have no idea if weed is the source of my problem, but it is definitely at least an amplifier. The only way to find out is to try quitting at least for a while and see what happens. I can't count the number of times I've just screamed at myself telling myself I'm going to quit smoking, at least for a couple days. I've just been incapable. Wish me luck.",8

I start to get thoughts of “ahh, one joint won’t hurt”. I basically think that somehow THIS time I can moderate my use (I know that’s s a lie)

So. I haven’t smoked since Nov. 16. However, I kinda said to myself, you know I can regulate drinking more. I will only drink when out! (Had one cider, awesome). I will only drink with someone- perfect, hubby and I had some wine and I had two glasses, I dumped the wine so wouldn’t be tempted to finish. Perfect. Zoom Baby shower, same, did some dumping

Last night, had a little argument with SO that left me feeling bad. I went to store bought a bottle of wine and ended up drinking the whole thing, with the intention of a glass or two. I feel horrible- with a HUGE headache. Like so gross, and I have so much to do today. And you know what, for one of the first times I am actually mad at myself. I have a lot happening. Today is a huge day with MULTIPLE meetings with key stakeholders for my company and I really want to crawl into a bathtub. 

And I am worthless in my ability to do good work right now, I don’t have the time to be hungover and I feel like crap

My stoner bestie suggested I smoke, haha, which of course does sound better than doing all of the other things I have to do.

But I am not going to smoke and I think the truth is, I really cannot manage to control my drinking 100% of the time. I am successful sometimes, but sometimes it feels too good and I go off the rocker. Even if it is just beer, even if I give up red wine. UGH, I love drinking so much, but seriously. I just don’t think I can moderate it

I am in the middle of completing my masters - and I feel like I can't bring myself to be interested in my own research enough to try when I'm sober. I was sober for so long and did not touch a presentation that I needed to work on - I finished the thing in two days while high. What is wrong with me?  


It has come to the point where I don't even know if I can operate sober. If I am sober, I am too anxious and ""bored"" to bring myself to do anything remotely related to my work. I have talked to my doctor about these problems and we cycled back to how my ADHD could be contributing to these feelings,   - but firstly, there was a time was I can operate sober and was unmedicated, so I'm not sure if I made my ADHD worse by smoking all these years; and secondly, he told me no doctor will even consider medicating me given my ""substance abuse disorder"".   


I am just at a loss on what to do. While there are ""benefits"" to smoking, getting high is objectively having negative affects on me - socially and academically. At the end of the day, my work is not my ""best"" work, but I feel like it's better than nothing? I'm so conflicted, has anyone had similar problems?",3

My throat isn't hurting like it did yesterday morning and it even feels... Silky? I think it's just me noticing that it's not as inflamed from smoking all the time and rediscovering what more ""normal"" is supposed to feel like.

I... did not sleep well last night. I stopped counting how many times I woke up after the fifth time, but at least my bed is comfortable.

I haven't experienced that psychosis I was feeling during my last month of usage and I don't feel crazy anymore. I talked with my psychiatrist yesterday and she agrees that quitting is the right choice and once my new dosage of meds for other psychological issues even out over the next month we'll treat any lingering insomnia in FDA approved ways.

Still having a lot of trouble eating but I've been trying to mitigate some of that by taking dog walk breaks to the local coffee shop and getting hot chocolate or something. I know it's not the healthiest sugar choice, but having the calories from the milk and getting my body moving in the process has been an improvement. Broth out of a mug has been another way to get something into my stomach. I'm allergic to too many things to utilize some of the other staples like saltines, so am trying to find good alternatives but it's a slow process.

I am *very* tired. I know some of that is from the insomnia but I've had insomnia long enough now that I can recognize when fatigue is coming from other places as well - this fatigue is definitely in addition to insomnia fatigue.

It made it bittersweet to realize that laughing was a *change* for me, but as sobriety continues I'm sure laughing will feel normal again soon.

We had issues with our Cyberpunk 2077 downloads yesterday and weren't able to play yet, but instead of getting angry at my PC like I have with every other inanimate object that inconveniences me in the slightest way - we watched a movie together instead. And I didn't smoke beforehand either.

I realized we were watching a movie that I had never seen sober.  It's a very mind bending surreal type movie and I just always enjoyed it high, and I will need to watch it again sober, but it really made me realize that yes watching things like that high definitely adds a layer of enjoyment that sobriety cannot, and I miss that - BUT there is so so much more I'm realizing I miss while high, or details I don't catch, or commentary I can't provide to my viewing partner because I'm too high to be social. Yes I missed being high while watching this particular movie, but I didn't smoke and was able to laugh with my partner instead of melting into the couch.

You’ll find this note in the morning but I’ll be long gone before you can try to sweet-talk and pull me back. I met you when I was young and lost; didn’t know how to fit in, how to socialize, how to be “cool.” Didn’t know who I was supposed to be. Sure as hell didn’t know what I wanted out of life. A high school friend introduced me to you and I still remember when you first took my hand, you said “just relax.” It felt so easy. It was innocent fun, I was young and we both had nothing to lose. 

After our first few times together, I couldn’t stop thinking about you. We warmed up to each other slowly, but we were bound to be inseparable. Some of my friends thought we were spending too much time together, but if they didn’t support our love, were they ever really friends? Together we went to movies, concerts, school dances, theme parks, you name it we did it. When I left town for college, you couldn’t stay away and ended up following me halfway across the Country. I was happy, I didn’t mind, I still loved you then.

I thought you followed me to college out of love, but now I look back and I think obsession is a more proper description of our relationship. I had to focus on my education, my future career! But you wouldn’t let me, it was always about you. What you needed, how neglected you felt, and how much of my time and attention you required to feel loved. I’d been with you for so long, I’d forgotten how to be by myself.

I’m crying as I’m writing this because goodbyes are never easy, especially when it’s for someone who has been with me half my damn life. I don’t know who I’m going to be without you. But I do know who I’m going to be if I stay with you, and I don’t want to be that person anymore. You have no drive, no motivation to do anything positive for your own life. Laying around in bed all day and “relaxing” can be fun once in a while, but what kind of life are we building when that’s all you want? Mary, I’ve seen that there’s much more to life than just relaxing.

I need more and I’ll never get that from you. I’ve tried reasoning with you, tried bribing you, tried breaking up, but you always pulled me back. But now I’ve truly seen that our relationship was never healthy. I need to be able to depend on myself before I can depend on you or anyone else. This time there won’t be a discussion, there won’t be an argument. This time, Mary, I’m just leaving. I’m sure you will do great things in the future, but they won’t be with me.

Goodbye.

I’m not coughing up a lot of phlegm but feel the need to consistently clear my lungs. I’ve smoked very heavily for the past two years and a moderate amount for about a year before that. Last year I had a very serious cough that produced a lot of phlegm and I’m not to sure it ever went away fully due to consistent heavy smoking. Now that I’m sober I think I’m realizing how often I actually feel like I have to cough to clear my lungs and am growing more concerned that I may if caused long term damage (chronic bronchitis or something to that nature). I’m only 21 years old so this is pretty concerning for me. Is this something that is normal even though I only stopped roughly 8 days ago.

I have recently been diagnosed with bipolar 2 and my doctor strongly discourages any mood altering substance, which makes sense. I’m starting with weed, then alcohol, and then—gasp!—caffeine.
This summer, with covid stress, my thc consumption was out of control. I never believed people needed rehab for weed until I couldn’t give it up. For financial reasons, I did it myself rather than do a rehab situation but I do think I’m missing out on the social support part that rehab could have offered. When I went from smoking occasionally to all day every day, people in my life were only mildly alerted that something was amiss. Weed is so acceptable, and I’ve even been someone who has argued its credibility. I still believe some of what I preached, except the “it’s not addictive” part. I’m forever schooled on that. I’m here because I need more voices telling me that weed is not the answer.
I was looking for something to brighten my dark moods, curb my anger, help me play with my kids since we are home all the damn time... and I didn’t realized how much of a crutch I was creating. I just gave away all of my stash today. Even the empty fancy rechargeable vape pen that was relatively new. Having it in the house for a “special occasion” was not gonna work. I went from Nov 1-30 without weed and then had a particularly stressful day with the kids and after a lot of deliberation decided to take a couple puffs. I feel my bipolar disorder is still not under control and I fear that each time I have a little exception like that, I set myself back.
Long story short, I’m here. And I want to be here for good. It’s still fresh and tender and there’s a shred of uncertainty and fear (like the stupid “I won’t be edgy if I’m sober!”) but I AM HERE. You all are amazing and I’m excited to join your ranks.",4

I have quit before for about two years after I met my eventual wife, but January of this year a friend and I decided to travel to a legal state and it was all downhill from there.

I’ve been a daily smoker for the last 5 years, smoking .5 to a gram of wax a day for the last year or so. Recently I’ve been in way more of a funk and my stress and anxiety have been out of control. I did a lot of thinking and reflecting about what had been going on and why I might be that way, and I came to the conclusion that smoking wasn’t doing the things for me that I once told myself it was. Instead of relaxing, I’d always feel anxious and on high alert, even being alone watching tv. What it’s been doing is keeping me down and making me stay there instead of working to bring myself back up.

Ive been here for two months and probably woken up every day with the view to quit that day. 

Today I am....

I had quit for a month before I joined here then had a cookie one night, then bought a gram the next day and I havent stopped until now. Last night I finished a vape and a joint and I felt a little buzz whilst coughing a lot. It wasnt worth it. 

I cant stop until i get to this stage! Where its not even working and I am just mindlessly consuming weed. 

I felt on top of the world for the last week of that month. After 2 weeks of rubbish the worse being lack of sleep, I somehow justified that cookie and thought about the low tolerance. But here I am again. 

Its only the morning and already I have tried to convince myself that I can buy another cart and then quit. I have to quickly shut it down.

I know I am going to quit and give my life a better chance to live but I am a victim of that never ending last day. 

Alright here we go. I know if i go longer than a month without and hit 2, then 3 and then 6 months. I would find amazing results. 

I am way too foggy minded now and im not at peace. 

I reeeeemember laughing and smiling naturally.

2020-12-09 17:20:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ka23of/my_first_10_days_free/,My first 10 days free,"Hello all,

I would like to start by thanking everyone for posting/ sharing their experiences. Without this subreddit I don't think I would be in the place I am now. I've tried cutting back and even stopping my addiction before, but to no avail. So, Thank you!

I am 25 years old, and graduated University 1.5 years ago and am struggling to find my first job. I started smoking weed at 18 years old, and have progressively continued down a path of addiction, self loathing, anxiety, and depression. During University I was on and off with weed, sometimes smoking daily and other times only on weekends. I consumed weed with alcohol often, normally getting black out drunk while very high. Just before graduation I was starting to smoke and drink almost daily as I was very stressed that I would not make it through my last courses (ya like that going to help lol). This continued after graduation and progressively got worse. During the first fall after graduating I took a small 3 week/ month brake from weed, then started right back where I was. And this continued that to where I am now, roughly a year later.  

During my time smoking I was very depressed, my body hurt, and my alcohol consumption went through the roof (I always felt more high after drinking). Many times I thought about my position and knew if I kept up with my addiction I would probably die young, or have extreme health problems later on in life (I guess I still could, but quitting now will hopefully increase my chances of being healthy longer). But for some reason I kept getting more. Kept smoking more. And kept drinking more. 

I would like to share this with you in hopes that my past experiences will help others out there like so many of you who have helped me. I know that for myself, I could not do this alone. Luckily I have a brother who helps support me, and a family who is always there for me. But it is you, with similar experiences, who have showed me that life without this addiction is possible. That even if I fail, I can try again. 

I hope to never smoke marijuana again, but I am taking it one day at a time. Hopefully I find a job in the new year, and start progressing in my life and future career. I have already started exercising more, and I feel much better after 10 days. My head doesn't feel as foggy, my lungs don't hurt like they did, and I am much happier. Thanks for taking the time to read this, as your support means everything to me.  Hopefully I can give you all another update at 1 month.",5
2020-12-09 16:53:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ka1lg8/the_millionth_third_day/,The millionth third day,"I’ve lurked here for awhile, always amazed at how many people finally echoed what no one else seemed to believe... like, even just that weed isn’t amazing, in fact is pretty damn bad for anyone with mental illness, especially bad if mixed with ADHD meds, messes with sleep and therefore literal brain function, that if you have to try to moderate it for yourself it’s probably a problem... someone even talked about how long they’d been journaling that being high is boring or they don’t need it but still are! And anyway, I was always scared to post on reddit ever because I was so scared of the rejection (love a too-late ADHD in women diagnosis but that’s probably for another sub, ha). 
But I’m sharing about being on day 3! Somehow, after “trying to quit” so many times in the last two years, going a couple days to a month or two once, I actually achieved setting a date to be done by and smoking until all I could associate with it was being bored... I have no idea how that worked honestly. After two years of hard work I’d finally began to manage ADHD/anxiety better and then COVID came around, then I moved away from my family to go back to a way too expensive school, couldn’t see my old friends because of COVID, my favorite grandma and great grandma died, I didn’t have any socialization to continually practice he things that help my anxiety- I genuinely felt like this is pretty much the worst place I could let myself get to, and figured the side effects of quitting weed & juuling wouldn’t even phase me considering I was already either constantly panicking or high and just bored. 
And I’m on day three. And i can’t tell if it was worse than I expected or just another couple really bad days I thought I’d never get too again before the pandemic. And I’m not going to lie, I’m even scared of the fact that I don’t want to smoke anymore, as if that would make a relapse worse than actually relapsing because I want to smoke again. And I don’t know guys, but if you happened to read this and have literally any thought come to mind... I’d really love to hear it. :) 

TL/DR: I quit because I was at my lowest point and figured I wouldn’t notice withdrawal symptoms apart from all the shit going on outside of quitting, and now I’m a little freaked out about the fact that I don’t want to smoke and double scared of how I’d feel if I relapsed while having that attitude. And without any in person interaction, it would be nice to hear anyone’s thoughts on this post :)",12

2020-12-09 16:10:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ka0rma/i_cant_stop_cheating_myself_27m/,I can't stop cheating myself [27/M],"I've been lurking in /r/leaves for a while now and feel extremely relieved to get this all out in the open. I never touched anything THC related until I was 19. Being a teenager who identified as a church-goer & morally opposed to drugs can turn around and bite you really bad once you're out in the ""real world"" making your own decisions. 

It all started midway through in my sophomore year of college. I had friends offer to let me try before, but I always preferred to sit back with a few beers and let everybody else get high around me. That all changed when I went home for winter break. I had just broken up with my girlfriend of 3 months... I had a bad tendency of rushing into relationships and quickly breaking up once I found the obvious red flags that could have easily identified earlier had there been more patience.

She was calling & texting me all hours of the night threatening to sit outside in the freezing cold, stick her head in the oven, etc until I agreed to talk to her (she never did any of this and was just trying to get attention). I was super stressed out. Coincidentally enough, an old friend from high school invited me over to his basement to hang out. I needed an escape from my current situation and decided to go reconnect with my buddy. Fast forward a few hours and I'm trying weed for the first time. I didn't get super high, but I remember feeling a very relaxing vibe and the ambiance in the room (Kid Cudi on the stereo, wall tapestries, comfy couches) made forget about all the crazy threats that were bombarding my phone. I didn't totally understand this feeling of calming apathy, but I was all in.

Jump to me at 22. I've graduated from school and I'm starting my first real job. I smoked away every spare moment of my junior & senior year. This translated seamlessly into my new life as a ""young professional."" I spend most of my nights after work drinking cheap table wine, smoking, and playing video games. When I go to the gym, once or twice a week, I'm bringing my bowl with me to take a ""burn ride"" on the way home. The only time I'm not smoking is when my guy (the 17 year old younger brother of an old acquaintance) can't meet up. Otherwise, I'm spending most of my non-working hours holed up in my room smoking, binge snacking and trying to figure out why I feel so unhappy.

Jump to me at 26. I'm definitely not as bad as I used to be, but still need to figure some things out. I have a long-term girlfriend at this point (now wife) who enjoys smoking on occasion, but is no where near what I used to be in terms of dependence. She has definitely helped to guide me in the right direction. I've also picked up running and will typically knock out multiple 3-4 mile runs per week (which I would sometimes get high before just out of habit). My new job is super flexible and allows me to determine my hours working from home vs working in the field. It's difficult to remember a day where ""working"" at home didn't consist of playing Fortnite and ripping a bowl. 

\*Sorry for the long post, but I feel the backstory is important and I appreciate you making it this far\*

Now we go to present day. I'm resisting urges and finding other outlets...99% of the time. I no longer smoke before, during, or after work. I keep up with running, have started reading much more and also write out a list of things I need to get done each week to stay focused. While I occasionally struggle with the urge to waste 5-6 hours playing video games and binge-snacking, but I've identified the dangerous pathways hidden in these activities and have managed to keep them to a minimum. 

Until my wife goes out of town.

It's like the worst nostalgia trip ever. She goes for 1-2 days at a time and I find myself right back where I was at 22. Smoking, popping open a container of ice cream, and playing video games. I'm always so disappointed in myself during and after the night, but can't seem to resist it. Once she leaves, the thought comes into my head that I have the whole house to myself and I can do whatever I want...and all I want is to get high and piss the night away. 

She comes back home and I won't even feel the urge to touch weed until she leaves again. There have been multiple nights where she's home and wants to smoke and I politely decline. I'm very aware of my tendencies and have made huge strides in the last year, but every few weeks these ""cheat nights"" manage to overpower me and I feel like I lose all the progress I've made over and over again. 

I've been playing around with the idea of quitting cold turkey, but always convince myself that 2-3 times a month won't hurt. I am capable of sticking to that schedule now; but when I do smoke, I feel more lazy and ashamed than relaxed and zen. Maybe I feel like I've wasted 7 prime years of my life. Maybe it's because all my intense focusing on productivity and recovery during my sober hours amplifies the feelings of paranoia, laziness and guilt when I occasionally get high.

I'm not sure what the answer is, or if it's even possible to keep a healthy balance while using infrequently. I think I'm going to lock all of my stuff away and impose a month or two long break. Then I will hopefully be clearheaded enough to make the right decision.

first of all - I wanna say thank you (again :D) for this great community and the ones who created and are maintaining it. If it weren't for this reddit, I'd still be smoking.

I made my first post in August when I decided to stop (have smoked every evening for approx. 5 years: age 17 - 23). After that, I caved in two times in social situations in August/early September - but it really just made me more anxious, which is good - since then, my desire to smoke has dropped to zero.

What really gets the best of me though is all this cognitive dysfunction Im experiencing. I used to be a very disciplined, self organized person, had a good ability to learn and a vocabulary I was content with before I started smoking (also ca. the first two years into it). Since then, my memory has gotten worse over the years, my discipline and drive slowly faded, as well as my ability to organize myself, my studies, work etc.. Conversations were getting harder, grades a little worse, was always exhausted. Its the major reason why I stopped smoking. I remember being clearer, more focused and more able to remember things on a 2 month break I went on about 2 years ago.   
This time though things are just getting worse... some days I can't get out a straight sentence. I have close to zero ability to memorize things, Im super slow at work, and what worries me the most: Im all over the place. Cant stick to a task, can't pull things through, always forget something here and there, make a lot of mistakes, no matter how hard I try. Then there's situations like today, where I accidentally knocked over a clock that sits on some sort of mount - one you can put on your desk. Either way, I wasn't able to figure out how to set the mount and the clock back up the correct way. Gave up after 10 min. About an hour later I come back and try again; coincidently pick up the mount the other way around just to see that it fits this way. Long story short - I feel extremely dumb.   
Theres other struggles as well (in every aspect of life) but this one gets to me the most.. ( side note: went to a psychiatrist; he's prescribed an antidepressant, Im on that since 7 weeks now, upped the dosage 2 weeks ago. Feel a tad more energy but that's it.)  


So Im writing this in hopes some of you might want to share what your experiences with stopping to smoke & the effects on the mind are like? Are some of you experiencing similar or very different things? Has someone went through this and feels a lot better now?   


PS: Thank you for reading this. With my doubts about this ever getting better increasing, just getting it off my chest felt relieving. Thanks",6

My parents were divorcing at that time as well, and I specifically
remember that being the start of me **needing** to smoke every time I laid down in bed. 

Fast forward to 27 year old me, a homeowner, a wife, a dog mama, an obsessed aunt, and a lot of people and things to be there for. 

Every night for the past 2 years I have told myself I wasn’t going to smoke anymore. The longest I’ve went in the past year without smoking is I think 2 days? and I felt like I had the flu, and just caved. I cave so, so easily. So I’m trying something I’ve never done before but probably should have, having my husband hide and lock up all the weed stuff. We grow in the summer so we don’t have to buy, and so we also can make a little extra cash. So, it’s not really feasible for me to rid of EVERYTHING weed related, but I imagine it will help if I don’t have access to it, lol. It doesn’t bother me that my husband still smokes, he doesn’t smoke daily and is definitely not dependent on it like I am. 

I’ve been here before, not hopefully not again. There’s something about the end of the year that feels so transformative to me, so hopefully this is the kick I really need.

Super long frustrating day at work, I walk through my apartment door, and I see a single prerolled tube on the ground I somehow missed throwing away. There was a roach and I didn't care I smoked it. Felt great for an hour. No regrets but I'm sticking to my sobriety. It was an hour buzz and I'm not counting it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Xmas and New Year's are coming up though and I'm not going to be travelling to see friends or family. I've been tempted lately with all kinds of thoughts like ""I'll just buy one half gram J"" or ""a pack of edibles isn't smoking so that's fine right"".... or with the job promotion I'm getting ""I've done so good, I'm getting a promotion, I deserve to celebrate"".... I'm having a hard time lately because life is really hard right now, money is really really low, and I've gone through some extra tough shit the past 2 weeks. Hard times make me want to smoke more.

&#x200B;

I know it's just my addiction whispering shit in my head. I'm staying strong. But I'm sleeping like shit, having horrible dreams that weed can make disappear, I can't sleep past 6-7am whether I go to bed at 10PM or 3:30AM. At first I was sleeping really well but the past 6ish weeks I've slept like absolute shit.

This past week has been the first week I've really struggled with staying clean since I quit 2 months ago.

&#x200B;

I don't know how to relax without weed. I'm tense and wound up tight 24/7. I don't drink for health reasons, that's why I always smoked.

Life is a struggle. I hope I can stay clean. Thanks fam.",3

I’m 22/M and I’ve smoked weed almost every day since I was 12. Growing up my dad grew and consumed but eventually quit . He was my supplier and the person who introduced me. Growing up I was a shut in person, and often would smoke weed to get out of an “uncomfortable” situation . Any time I had a problem I would smoke. I never talked about it to anyone, and I never saw a problem with my usage because of my dad. I’m now in couples therapy and it’s caused a huge disturbance in my personal life and my relationship . I got canned from an amazing job because I crashed a car and failed my drug test. I blow through money at the club like it’s no ones business and I’m starting to feel like I’ve been robbing my kid of a childhood. I never thought I could be addicted but I am . I have an incredibly hard time falling asleep and I get irritated if I don’t smoke. It’s been brought to my attention that I’ve never really gone without it either. I’m at the bottom of my weed and I really don’t even want to smoke. I feel disgusted with myself but I crave it. I’m learning that I have used it to make big situations seem small, and those big situations never get resolved because of my cycle .

I stopped lingering around smokers, discussions about smoking or any other way where you have to think about weed for a while. This includes this subreddit, which I now visit only to give some encouragement that it can be done. The reason is because when I visit places like this where weed is discussed then I think about it and then I might fall into the habit of lingering around memories and past experiences, creating a loop of desire. It's like thinking about people yawning. That creates an urge by itself, maybe even just thinking the word yawn.

I  set aside my opinions about weed, I don't think whether it is good or bad, but when I ponder on it and have opinions about it when someone disagrees it creates arguments and agitation for me so I might end up creating the same problem for myself. My relationship and attitude towards weed is impersonal, that it is simply a state of mind I don't need. It's like being in a pool, maybe its good maybe bad but I don't need to be there. It is something that is not a necessity for me.

There was some troublesome times. The urge to smoke was very much an addiction of my mind. With all addictions, the problem is that I can not think it away. Again, it is like yawning but not so strong of an urge for me. I can not think it away and even worse thinking about it makes it worse. So what I do is to not resist the urge with thinking but relaxing into it. I look at that urge as if it is simply a painful feeling, like I have a cold. The addiction is simply like this: A painful urge. If I give into it there is gratification sure but that gratification is impermanent which means I feel good for a while but I will feel bad afterwards. So it is a never ending cycle. Just like yawning, it feels good to draw that deep breath but it is brief and fleeting. After a while the urge comes back stronger. So I don't think it away, I don't gratify the urge, I simply experience the feeling and let it be there. It will not be there forever, it cannot remain there. And I know this, I have been through it before. I have proved it to myself that it is not always there. I notice when it is gone but I don't get carried away. If it comes back then that's the same thing, I don't give into it but I don't resist it by straining. I relax into it and let it be there, it will eventually go away. I don't put any value to that feeling, it is not mine. I didn't tell it to come up, I don't tell it to go away. It doesn't listen to me even if I do. It is like someone is bothering you and pulling at your arm. Like some annoying people who don't listen to you. If I get angry with them it doesn't help anyone. But if I ignore them eventually they will get bored and go away. So I see that feeling as a sickness, relax and ignore it.

I do something else, like drinking a cup of tea, knowing that eventually my cold will go away. If I get upset about it, it is not helping anyone, furthermore I make myself more agitated, making the urge even stronger. But if I relax and let that urge be there it without giving into it, it will go away. It cannot sustain itself, this is how nature is. The fuel and sustenance for that urge is the gratification itself which means the more you gratify it the stronger the urge and more the agitation.

TLDR: I don't hang around discussions about weed and even this subreddit too much because I think about it and then that itself can create the urge to smoke. I don't discuss it with myself much either, I think ""it is just weed, no big deal, I will think about something else"". The urge itself I overcome by: Not trying to think it away and neither resisting it by trying to fight it, rather just seeing it as a sickness like a cold and knowing it eventually goes away. Contemplating the cycle of addiction is helpful to me: There is an urge that can be gratified, but the gratification will give little happiness since it is impermanent. When it goes away I find myself back where I was, a painful urge. So that gratification itself sustains the urge. But if I don't give in eventually I will be cured of it for good which is more rewarding. This is how I thought and I was right :) It is definitely better having a clear mind.

Best of luck to you.",48

Family said I was fun to be around, intelligent and helpful. I feel positive about that. This week, I’ve noticed spasms in my gut. Having to rush to the bathroom. I don’t know why exactly, but I’d rather feel these things than smoke. I’ve had one moment while awake of wanting a smoke and it was after a tough therapy session. I’m cool with that. Finally told mom that if I relapse I’m going to rehab. Rehab is a great deterrent bc I have 3 cats and don’t have anyone to care for them while I’m gone.

Pretty simple. When I got here, I was fully in the throws of addiction and was smoking my reserves basically all the time. I assumed it would be trivial to get a new plug, and... I was wrong. People up here aren't the same kind of fiends so I didn't just run into huge social circles of pot smokers right away. I could just drive to a dispensary in Illinois, but... 60$ eighths is too much even for an addict

For a while, it sucked. I bought some absolute Reggie that didn't do anything off a roommates sister, kept nosing around for a plug, and I didn't find anything. 3 weeks later, I'm sort of just reflecting on how I spent the past few years, smoking as often as possible, trying to escape my (admittedly crappy) life, even continuing to smoke in the middle of a deadly respiratory pandemic, smoking to the point where I didn't even find it enjoyable anymore... It was ridiculous.

The funny thing is I knew it was bad a while ago. I've watched Digibro/Diginii on and off for a while now, I thought he was super cool though the  weed arc, then at the end of it I even agreed when he said basically ""weed is awesome once in a while, but once you're smoking it every day just to eat or feel normal it's really not worth it anymore"". I really can't agree more, I would have said the same thing back then too.

Ironically I'm kind of ok with the 60$ eighths now. It's not something I want to do every day anymore, it's something I want to have around for special occasions and acid trips and stuff, then put down for at least a week or two at a time. I still enjoy it, but using it every day just... Sucks ass, honestly. It's cool being able to breathe effortlessly again. It's cool not having daily panic attacks about my health, or running out of weed, or getting caught and arrested or whatever. It's cool not running out of money right when I get paid because I spend it all on bills and drugs immediately. Existence is still pain and misery but it's a lot harder to ignore the misery that being addicted to weed was until now that I'm out of it",3

After my diagnosis, I quit weed four four months. I recently relapsed for two weeks and now I have three days clean.

When I found out I was bipolar, I knew I had to quit smoking. I read tons of studies about how weed can induce psychosis and mania in bipolar folks and I knew that it was happening to me. I was obsessed with data mining and had tape over my cameras because I felt like someone was watching me. 

My four months of sobriety were good but hard. I craved weed every day. I romanticized it and told myself that my life would be so much better if I could just smoke. Eventually, it got so bad that I managed to undo everything I had learned about myself. I convinced myself that I’m not bipolar and that I just have some form of dissociative identity disorder. I did this simply because I wanted to justify smoking weed. All of this despite my partner reminding me of how poorly the weed interacts with my meds and sent me to the hospital multiple times immediately after my diagnosis.

A few weeks ago, I contacted my dealer and bought the weed. I was fiending for it. Once I smoked, I felt both stupid and like my brain was on fire. I pretended to feel great because I wanted it to work. On day three, I stopped taking my meds. 

PLEASE DO NOT DO WHAT I DID!!! Within a few days of being off my meds and on the weed, I wanted to die. I was having panic attacks in stores. I was dependent again. My mood was going up and down depending on when I smoked. If you have a mood disorder, weed is the devil. Weed will override any meds you’re taking to regulate your moods and will cause additional mood swings that you just don’t need. 

Two weeks into smoking and I was so depressed that I became bedridden. I felt like I was grieving a death. I was in literal agony. Every time I smoked, I had a panic attack. I eventually threw out all the weed and took myself to the hospital. They got me back on my meds and I’m still recovering from the episode a few days later.

Please, if you have a serious mental illness, try to remind yourself that weed is a dangerous substance for you, much like alcohol or uppers or anything else that alters moods. I’ve been sober from all other drugs for five years but I still managed to glamorize and worship weed. Not anymore. Because of my mood disorder, I have to start viewing weed like I view alcohol. It’s off limits. It’s dangerous. My life is so much better without it.

You can skip to the stopping tag if you don't care about how I started smoking.

I started smoking with a first group of friends at 18, I was leaving alone. This was the discovery part when everything seems fun and new. I didn't smoke much, had my first experiences buying and smoking alone.
My best friend was smoking since we were young, and I started joining her and it was really nice.

2 years later, I join a new group of friends. I offer them to smoke, most of them are willing to try, others were already smoking. I set up a whole system of buying together, meeting at my place and get stoned almost everyday. Then the ones who were trying started to want to buy more, to meet at their place etcetc. This is when you start being an excuse to smoke more than a friend. We kept meeting to smoke, I was still seeing my best friend and smoking, it became a big part of my life. I thought it was okay, I was young and smoking a lot since a year.

Later, I learned that the person I loved the most in my family was about to die. I completely shut down. Went to work, came back home and smoked until I had to go to sleep. I tried to ignore this issue, not talking to anyone in my family because I hated myself for smoking and didn't want them to notice anything. I thought having sex would help, ended up with a stoner just as depressed and even suicidal. Then, the person I cared about the most and ignored since this whole time passed away.

[STOPPING]

I decided I wasted too much by smoking and I had to do something. First thing I did, is smoke less and less alone, to the point where I stopped smoking by myself and was only buying as a group with other people. I left the weed at a friend's place, so I had to move to smoke. I tried to stop smoking step by step, but the thing is that all of my relationships were about weed. So anyone I met offered me to smoke. I tried to care less about the weed, smoke just a puff and then pass it. But the really hard part was saying no, I'm not going to smoke tonight. Until one day, I did it. I brang something to drink, and no matter how much I wanted to, didn't smoke. I went back home early despite all of my friends asking me to stay and offering me to smoke. And for the first time, I was proud of myself.

The first lockdown was a big turn for me, since I didn't buy anymore and wasn't meeting my friends who kept smoking. So I decided to start doing sport, learn a new language, play video games with old friends and writing down about the bad sides of smoking, why i wanted to stop, and the good sides of stopping. I wrote down everything to remember why I did this. I can post about these later if you want.

When the lockdown ended, I thought smoking just a little would be okay, but right after, I hated myself even more for ruining my efforts. So, everytime I wanted to smoke, I was thinking about what I would think about myself afterward, and decided it was not worth it.

I'm now 6 months sober, and focusing on my work and studies. I now have a very healthy relationship which helped me a lot to stop smoking. I also lost weight and I'm more fit than I have ever been. I still think about smoking, but I know why I stopped, what I gained from stopping, and there are no reasons for me to decide to smoke again. I'm still careful though, but I can meet my friends and watch them smoke without being bothered. Most of my old friends are now smoking more than ever, but I'm still in touch with them.

Tl;dr

I stopped smoking by myself step by step, and saying no to friends offering me to smoke made me realise I truly had the power to stop smoking.",13

If this cna help someone quit for even a day I'll be happy.

Okay. 

I mostly wasted 8 years and thousands of dollars on weed. It fucked me up so bad, I developed depression, anxiety and made terrible decisions while under the influence.

I tried to seriously quit upwards of ten times. 

I used to cry when I bought weed again because I knew I couldn't try to quit again until I had smoked it all. 

I stopped looking at weed in terms grams/ounces and started looking at it in terms of time I was going to waste. This made me really depressed. Every time I bought a bag. 

I feel like the universe kept trying to teach me my lesson over and over again. Its like I kept failing weed101 and had to retake it every semester and every summer! 
Finally, I became open to the idea of learning my lesson. I started to believe I was stronger than my addiction, like I truly had the power to say no.

I slowly took up regular basketball with friends, which lead to working out, which lead to counting calories which lead to 20kg/~45lbs of weight loss. 
I was complaining to a friend about my limited cardio when he suggested quitting weed to see how fit I could really get. This combined with idea of 'never graduating weed 101' got me to take action. 

1 day turned to 10, 10 turned to 30. Now I'm looking at turning 30 days of sobriety into 365.

My experience in my 8 years of smoking/quitting is that you really need to stay away from other vices when you quit. If you are struggling - try to get addicted to something positive like the gym, sports, learning, a new business, a new career, a new project, a new hobbie. Anything that gives you something positive in return for your time/money and efforts. 

Before basketball I started to buy my self a vinyl for every $50 I saved  (roughly 3 days off of weed). During this time I relapsed on and off but I was starting to teach my self what my money was really worth. 

___ ___

Anyway, don't be so hard on your self, forgive your self and love your self. If you have fucked up countless times, it just means you need to try again. Just try and try again, try and try again. One day you will succeed and you will reach a new normal, a normal you thought that wasn't possible. After a few weeks of your new state you will want to strive to a higher and better normal. This is how life is supposed to be. Continual growth. 

Please never give up on quitting and never give up on yourself.

Now go and have a crack at 3 days off and reward yourself with a gift with what you would have spent on weed.",14
2020-12-09 05:38:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/k9pnho/quitting_and_loa/,Quitting and LOA,"Good morning friends, Day three here and just wanted to say, it really was in my head. I've been studying the Law of Attraction this past year as well as a lot of mindfulness based approaches to mental health. With that I've learned the power of thought, thoughts are magic, they change moods, they tell your body how to feel, control your thoughts, control your life and we all have the power to change our thoughts.  Initially reading this sub pysced me out, all i would see was how terrible everyone felt so I expected to feel terrible myself. I decided to reframe this in my mind so I could be successful. Began listening to my affirmation videos again and meditating for short bursts. Told myself I don't need weed, told myself I am perfect without any substance, told myself everything I want is possible and i am well. I am allowing wellbeing to flow through me and well... I feel well! Yes I am a little agitated, and my brain still fires a few addictive thoughts, but I am allowing my natural state of wellbeing and I feel better than I ever would while smoking. Its not that hard, my body is naturally healthy, I release this addiction. 

Moral of the story, if you go looking for symptoms/ reasons this will be too hard, your brain will find them and make this all very hard for you. You're in control of your brain, tell it you're healthy, tell it you're healing, it will tell your body the same and you will feel better much faster.

Happy healing everyone. Love and light to you all 💛🌻💫",2

Saw this post about stop lurking and start posting. So here I am.

This is my third time quitting. And also the longest time ever I have been not smoking at all in 12 years. Today Im feeling great about my decision to stop. The first 2 weeks are the worst for me. All that insomnia and lack of emotional balance. But now Im proud to tell you that I no longer feel any weed in my system! My mind is clear and I can start to concentrate on my other problems.

Its hard, I know. But if you can fight your way through the first weeks it will only get better. I still have my triggers and occasional toughts about doing it. Last night my friend (who didnt know ive quit) brought me a bottle of green dragon he had made himself. I took the gift, but mentioned that i no longer use cannabis. He told me to take it anyway, for rainy days. 

Well,then  i poured that shit in to the sink in front of him :D now he understands me.

Keep fighting and take it one day at a time. We can do dis!",9

I of course regret the time and money wasted. But the relationships are the ones I regret the Most 

Usually when I start to think about it, I end up feeling guilty and smoking again (just like I did yesterday) 

Woke up today full of shame and hate that I relapsed again. 

And I start to think again about everything that I have lost the past 8 years and now I want to smoke again to ""forget it"". This is my daily routine. Waking up everyday with regret, shame and hate. 

I try to ""ignore"" it and not look back, but that doesn't work. It's hard to do that when you realized that you have no friends to text.

I am feeling fine. Besides my high anxiety and wanting to start a fight every now and then for stupid reasons, i am feeling good. 

One thing bothering me is that i am still waaaaay scatterbrained to properly focus on my work. Its like weed numbed al lot of the screaming ""me""s inside my head, and now they are all roaming free trying to get some attention. 

I have made other changes in my life along with it. Started eating better, and am waking up really early in order to walk. I am now walking about 7km daily. So when night hits, i am usually too tired to have time to think about bullshit and self loathing. 

This pandemic has shown me what i really value. That neverending loops of going out every week to parties.is not what i need. I was going there to find company (wich i did not find anyways, wrong place for me) and fear of missing out. My objective for 2021 is to save enough money to buy a motorcycle for traveling. Weed money will contribute with 20% of it. 


And what can i tell you folks who are struggling to get to this point? Besides the exercise stuff, that really helps, your heart's gotta be on it. My earlier tries i knew i had to stop but did not really want to. This time i do. Other day i saw an acquaintance whom i have smoked with before, and he looked like a zombie, and i felt ashamed that i was like this just a couple of days ago.

Today i am not going to walk. Yesterday i worked till 21 (compensating the crappy focus of the past weeks) and j am reeeeeally tired, even after sleeping, so i decided to use some of that time to share this with you folks.

I really hope you all will find strength in your hearts and mind to go trough this. It's not about the weed itself, but how it eases the pain, anxiety and bad feelings overall. If you just find another vice, instead of facing reality, things wont change that much.

Wish i could hug you folks. And thanks for all the encouragement.

I have consumed weed via vaporizer almost from the beginning of my studies. Before I had no problem stopping my use for holidays, for my girlfriend visiting etc. I even felt that I didn't need to because it seemed like weed had become a big part of my personality and I felt like a shell of myself without it. 

Lately with stress levels getting out of hand in studies due to covid and the topics getting harder I had a really hard time reducing my consumption. I was vaping 1-1.5 grams every day, being high for almost all day. I started skipping assignments and not caring about it (huge red flag for me). I knew I had to quit and am now on my second day after relapsing on monday, before which I didn't smoke for four days. School work seems impossible especially with seminars and finals coming up but luckily my friends have been supportive. I've been crying every day and have extreme nausea in the morning, afternoon and night. The insomnia is pretty bad and I keep waking up in a puddle of my sweat 3-4 times per night. My appetite is almost completely gone too. I have mainly eaten bananas, yoghurt and crackers.

I already got rid of my weed and vaporizers so that I don't relapse again. I think this is an essential part of my own recovery. If we could decide not to smoke, we probably wouldn't be on this subreddit.

Has anyone here experienced severe gastrointestinal problems after quitting weed? It all started for me a month in, what I’m wondering might be Paws (post acute withdrawal syndrome). I was smoking 1oz a every 6-7 days and through a dirty bong too. I started getting really scary chest pains that was located over the left side most generally, but then come in fleeting dull but sharp mini like incision feeling all over the lungs. I tried convincing myself this was the lung hair fibers purging the excess muck. 

I made probably 3 Emergency room visits as these got so bad it felt like my heart. 

Going on the pain has subsided in terms of random fleeting pain but 2 months in had really bad acid reflux (I’m a fit young enough person) but ate terribly at times so somewhat not shocked. This got me on acid reflux tablets for a month now still with an ache on the left side under heart and the most awful symptom and inability to breath fully, always missing that feeling of a needed full breath and when I finally get one night take hours I feel so good for getting it. This has come with burping all the time too, to the point I brought up blood but an endoscopy came back clear. Also blood from the other end too, but I’m guessing hemmeroids. 

I suppose my question is has anybody felt these sort of withdrawals after 110 days still or at any point? I’m worried I’m not going to get better from this, and it’s be terribly hard to the point I’ve questioned ending it all. 

Tldr: had chest pains, gastrointestinal problems Esophagus mainly and a horrible horrible sensation of not being able to get full amounts of air. had many tests but everything seems clear, yet I’m having real physical problems. Is this related to weed? I’ve read into paws and cb1 cb2 functions just not sure if this applies to me or not.

Anyways I didn’t even enjoy being stoned to be honest, and the effects were pretty minimal for some reason because usually I get so stoned even if it’s just first smoke of the day.

I smoked throughout college a few years back and stopped when I moved to a big city and started my adult life. However, when covid hit, I moved back home for a while during quarantine. While home, I got back into weed out of boredom. I started smoking every single night just as something to do, and that turned into day and night. I am a teacher so summers off made it even worse, smoking heavily, but sincerely enjoying it and not feeling like it interfered with life. When school started back up I was glad that I had a reason to be sober from 8-4 every weekday. That being said, the minute I got home it was time to smoke and unwind. 

This weekend after smoking multiple joints and not feeling much of anything, and realizing I had spent over $100 just this week alone on weed... I decided it was time for a “t break”. So Monday morning rolled around and I thought “alright, no weed til New Years, you got this!” Come 4 pm, I was a ball of anxiety. All night I just went through the motions of life trying to get to bed time... I felt like I couldn’t relax. I intangly thought “there is no way I’m making it to January... maybe just til next weejend”.... as the night went on, the time line got shorted “maybe just til this weekend” and soon I was hearing that voice in my head telling me one hit before bed would be fine. But no, I knew I needed to keep this promise to myself. When bedtime rolled around, it got worst. I was up til 2 am unable to sleep without weed. I am sooo proud of myself for not reaching for my pen I keep in my bedside table (I ran out of bud on Sunday aka what sparked the t break). 

Now it’s day 2. Same shit tonight... I feel like with weed I could really enjoy life and my hobbies. I would smoke a bowl and sit and just listen to music and vibe out for hours and now I barely have the patience to discover new music or even to listen to the stuff I already like. Same goes for reading and journaling, some thing I did Daily. Now I can’t even find a drive to pick up my journal and instead sat watching YouTube for hours tonight trying to feel anything. 

I’m so lost. I didn’t realize how heavily I was relying on weed until I cut it out. I’m so terrified that I won’t enjoy life and my hobbies the way I do when I smoke. I’m such a high functioning stoner that it’s hard to even feel like there is a problem. I still got my shit done, led a productive life, participated in hobbies, taught elementary school, even still dreamed very vividly every night.... but now since stoping I’m realizing the problem was just that. I couldn’t do these things without weed at the end of the day to get me through. 

I don’t know what I’m trying to get out of this post, honestly. I just found this Reddit page and made an account to post this and idk get support I guess.

I feel empty without weed, which scares me. I have never been more confident or happy in my entire life than I have been the past few months, which has been my heaviest smoking yet, which makes this even more confusing. But I don’t want to smoke everyday forever. First, I’m terrified of my lung health, and second I don’t want to be 45 years old sneaking away for a nightly smoke because I don’t know a me without weed.

And I just came into a little bit of cash. That doesn’t help either. I have to remember why I’m doing this, and that I still have a really long way to go. I still dream of a life that I know I can’t manifest if my mind and my ambition is fogged over by cannabis. But I dream of cannabis too.",4

I am 32 and have been using nearly daily for about 10 years now (A few months absense due to job drug testing). I have thoughts about wanting to quit like others on this sub, but when the time comes I just give in and come up with excuses and indulge every. single. time. I have practically given up and decided to focus on my other bad habits first (another excuse)... until yesterday.

It's been 24 hours since I've smoked and while I haven't even thought about quitting recently, something has been happening to me mentally that I cannot bear anymore and I don't know if marijuana is the culprit causing this so maybe someone who knows better about this addiction can share their insights.

Basically within the last 2 weeks, every time I get really stoned, I am unable to focus on my usual fun activities (youtube, video games, movies, hell even porn). Usually I smoke before I do anything, that includes lighting up before going to work but for some reason these past couple of weeks, when I get high and try to anything really, I start thinking about how far my friends are in life, how I've made nothing but bad decision after bad decision after high school, all of my exes from my past relationships, what I could've been had I never smoked, and just about the worst depressing thoughts possible and is really pushing my limits. I can't remember the last time I've had these negative regretful thoughts about myself and now they seem to be on my mind nonstop especially when I'm high...

I haven't been sober long enough (24 hours) to see if this is just the marijuana causing these trigger thoughts or if this is just something that's inevitable finally making its appearance regardless, but what I do know is, I cannot continuously live with these thoughts reoccuring constantly because my depression level is through the roof right now.

I have thrown my bong away (about the 5th time now) and have decided to give this a shot for good this time because this is starting to feel like it's a life or a death matter for me. I absolutely fucking love the feeling of being high, but I don't know what's causing me to feel and think depressing thoughts like this but if weed is the reason then I'm willing to let this shit go and never look back because I truly feel dying is better than feeling like this constantly. I am not suicidal by any means, I am just trying to express how serious this has become for me mentally.

2020-12-08 20:09:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/k9hld4/day_2/,Day 2,"Hi all,

This will be my first post on this sub. I'd first like to start of with thanking everyone who contributes to this sub in any way, I'm so glad I found this place.

Im a 29 year old male, been smoking for 15 years. Definitely been struggling to control my addiction for at least 10 years now. I live in a country where mary jane is legalized and pretty much accessible most of the day and deep into the night.

Today marks my second day of abstinence. Before I get into that, I'd like to describe my reasons to quit.

Last year,  my partner broke up with me due  to the addiction. She walked out on me and could not take it any more. It basically tore down a big part of my self-esteem, I felt like a complete loser and hated myself. She repeatedly asked me to quit and I ignored most of her attempts or just shrugged them off and kept smoking daily. At least 3-4 joints per day.
The breakup was painful, the guilt I felt is still immense and it's hard to confront it even today. Realising you lose the love of your life due to your own actions has been by far the most cruel and gutting thing I've ever been through.

After the breakup, I quit smoking for a couple of months and focused extensively on physical exercise. It didn't last and I relapsed, lonelyness led to self-pity and self-pity was all my addiction needed as a gateway back into substance abuse. I slowly started more and more, up to the point where I smoked 6-8 joints each day.
It killed all the feelings and guilt I had and I was happy for a bit. Deep down I felt like shit for using again after what it had cost me, but I gave up and ignored that feeling. I put it away as much as I could.

Fast forward some months. Corona drove me into social isolation and that gave my addiction all the space it needed to really thrive. 
I picked up a video game and started smoking more and more, slowly detaching from my actual life and developing an obsession for playing the game as much as I could. 

I was happy in my own little world. With work being done remotely and corona providing the perfect excuse to neglect my responsibilities, I continued for weeks. Then I stopped feeling happy as I lost interest in the game and my tolerance had build up to such an amount that I was smoking 12-14 blunts a day. 
It didn't help. I did not feel happy again, but I couldn't stop. Each day i would tell myself 'ill quit tomorrow, just gotta go one final time.'

 Everyday I had to walk to the coffee shop to get a new stash of joints, the shame I felt was immense. 
Then I lighted up and continued to play a video game for 12 hours a day, moderated my sleep a bit in an attempt to lower my tolerance and repeated the next day.
This was not how I envisioned my life at 29, but I kept going. I stopped caring about myself, the addiction and just gave in for some weeks.

As harsh as it may sound, I think I found rock bottom in these weeks. I got banned from the game and my world collapsed, I was forced to face reality again: An empty live where drug abuse had led me to broke contact with most of my friends and family, focused on a game I can no longer play, facilitated by the same substance that caused the most important person in my life to walk out on me.
I contemplated suicide but decided against it as I did not want to hurt the people that still care for me, I've hurt them enough already. 

The only way out was to quit and I guess I realized it was now or never. So I did quit. 

I found this subreddit on day one and some of the stories helped me through.
 I'd like to emphasize, I would have failed on the first day without these stories.

I survived today as well. The cravings are pretty bad, my mind and emotions are a complete mess and I can barely sleep 2 hours per night. But shit, I'm clean today 🥰

I can't foresee a future where I'll never be smoking again (although I want to). 
So I've committed to staying clean one day at the time, and repeating that promise tomorrow.
My addiction isn't idle either, I'm trying to avoid the obsessive behaviour in other things but it's hard. 
I caught myself installing Tinder and going on a swipe spree then when I denied myself that my focus shifted on exercise again. (planning to exercising 7 days a week is okay right?)
Anything to just make me feel better.

At this stage, my biggest fear is a relapse. Each relapse makes me hate myself even more and each time it happens I lose hope that I can successfully beat the addiction.
However, while I'm writing this i realize it's a topic for another day.

There's two reasons why I decided to share all of this. 
The main reason being it helps to share these experiences, I haven't ever discussed them with someone in real life and just using this reddit to recap my experiences helps me stay clean, get stuff off my chest and I hope will eventually help me process the events.

The second reason is to show how much this community has helped me in such a short amount of time. It was me who abstained today and yesterday, but I doubt I could've done this without this sub. Thanks so much.

I'll check in later this week again 😁",8

It is often the thing that stops me from stopping and always makes me relapse into daily usage. I often asked myself, why should I stop, I am naturally lethargic, slow and unmotivated, what does it change if I don’t smoke? I feel better when I’m high, I don’t have any negative effects like anxiety or paranoia. It always feels good, I don’t sink into depression. But that’s exactly the reason I need to stop. I don’t feel better while smoking I just feel numb towards all the pain I carry within me. That’s why I always told myself, well I don’t need help I’m feeling alright enough. Sure I could be more agile and do something for my future, but that will work out one day. But deep down I know that i have to feel the pain to finally start working on my problems. I’m always lethargic, even when I’m sober, because I have little will to live, because I never actually dealt with my problems. And in order to deal with my problems I have to feel my problems. I need to break down several times a week to finally understand that there are things with me that are just not right. I need to get it sorted out. And not in a „reflective“ way by having thoughts why this is and where that comes from, which i get when I’m high. They’re not wrong most of the time. But what good does it do, to know what my problems are, if I have no idea how to deal with it. I need to stop to finally get help instead of sedation.",2

My question is... What do you use as natural healthy substitutes? I have heard hobbies, hotshowers and pushups. Also what types of mindset are good to hold as I do feel like I put weed on a pedestal still and miss it like an old friend. But I do know that I do not enjoy it when once I do use.

2020-12-08 17:43:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/k9exl4/day_4_starting_to_feel_better/,Day 4- Starting to feel better.,"Hey everyone! It’s my first time posting. I love this group and all the support! ^-^

So, today is my 4th day without consuming any weed.

Days 1&2 were quite horrendous for me. I was having the most terrible panic attacks of my life. I kept thinking I was dying. I was getting random heart palpitations, I was alternating between sweating and getting chills, I slept all day and couldn’t sleep at all during the night, and I just had this really awful and debilitating feeling of doom and death. My boyfriend had to repeatedly tell me that we were both going to be okay and we weren’t dying. I also wasn’t able to eat and I got random nausea. 

I had a panic attack two weeks ago and went to the hospital because I thought I was having a heart attack, but my EKG came back normal and my blood work/chest x-rays were fine. In fact, it turns out I was healthier than the last time I had blood work done and I didn’t even fast this time. Anyway, having these results on hand have helped ease my anxiety for when I feel like I’m dying.

Day 3 was a bit better. I was able to get out of bed, I watched some episodes of lost (one of my favorite shows) and I ate the soup my boyfriend made. Day 3 was when I kept on staying hydrated as well. Last night I had one of the worst panic attacks yet and I cried a lot, but it went away after a few minutes.

Anyway, today on Day 4, I’m starting to feel much better. I felt a panic attack starting to come on but I was able to subdue it with deep breathing and laying down with my upper body elevated. I also did a 20-minute anxiety guided meditation (basically a hypnosis lol) and it really helped. I’ve been eating regularly today, and I just feel overall better. 

The overall sense of doom is gone. I still feel the occasional anxious thoughts but it’s much more subdued now. I’m getting ready to do some chores since I’ve allowed my place to get pretty messy over the past few days.

Additionally, and this is the most encouraging part for me, ever since I calmed down from that horrible panic attack last night and stopped crying, I’ve felt.. more mentally clear? After it happened I drank a bunch of water and sat on the couch wrapped in the blanket and distracted myself with tiktok and some anime.

But today, I’ve felt much more capable of managing things and I feel a sense of clarity. Normally I’d be ruminating on all the negative things in my life but right now I feel like the brain fog/constant haze of being high all the time is going away and I’ve forgotten what it feels like to truly be awake and present. 

I still feel a bit tense, especially in the shoulders, but I am definitely (and noticeably) feeling much better and much more like myself. And by that I mean I feel more like the person I was when I still had positive feelings about my future before I started heavily smoking a lot of strong cannabis all day everyday. I hope this feeling lasts!

Anyway, I hope this helps someone going through the motions right now. There’s a light at the end of the tunnel, and you’re not alone. Feel free to DM if you wanna talk or need some encouragement. :)",4

This is my first post here!

I’m 27 years old and been smoking almost daily for over four years.
I started adding cocaïne to that about two years ago, because I always want to feel more - the next high + had a demanding job and this was my way to cope.
Fortunately this did not last long and I haven’t touched coke since last year october, therapy helped a lot with that.

The therapy also brought up a lot of anger, insecurity and fear that I was hiding/smoking away. Long story short; a lot of things that happend within my family (and actually still happening to this day) affected me more than I acknowledged all of this time.
I have grown so much by working on this via therapy, but I never managed to quit the weed as my tolerance went up and I started to smoke more -> hate myself more -> smoke more.
That endless loop of negativity...
Until now.

Tomorrow i’m starting EMDR trauma therapy to deal with the things mentioned above and it’s scary. In order to do this therapy correctly I was advised to not smoke the day before and after the session. I want to forget and smoke so bad right now but it’s time to move on.
Just wanted to share. Love this reddit and your honesty, please know it really means a lot.

I saw hope . I realized this was the best path today . Where I live there is an abundance of mountains , so I said fuck it and chucked the pipes grinders etc off of the biggest one , ha .

Every single morning, every single goddamn morning, I wake up and crave being high. Doesn't matter the things I told myself, doesn't matter than I'm spending all of my time feeling like the lowest, most pathetic person on the planet. That high is the most important thing.  

I ran completely out today. Maybe could scrape together a bowl if I cleaned my grinder, but all that effort for a measly bowl of leftover kief isn't even going to get me high. And I know that. But all my stupid brain is thinking is ""WHEN CAN I GET HIGH AGAIN?!?""

But my roommate/friend just texted me. We have not been getting along and the living situation is deteriorating. I usually just smoke after we argue. He's demanding me to look through the trash for his acid, because he's convinced I threw it away. We've been fighting about this for 2 days. I thought it was over, but he brought it up again. He has issues, and we have issues with each other. He gets angry and lashes out, and I retreat into myself and shut down. And the man himself smokes (and does shrooms/lsd) more than anyone I know.

High me doesn't care. But sober me does. Sober me is fed up. Sober me doesn't want to live in this environment anymore. Is it weird to say that I'm glad I'm sober and am having feelings? Feelings are usually what I smoke to get rid of. Still feels shitty, but weirdly also good? Feels like I'm thinking more clearly. 

Posted here before, but its been a few months. Quit for 15 days back in August, but the most I've been able to do since then is 3 days over Thanksgiving week. Today is day 1 again.",6

Just I’m still scared. I started weed 5 years ago exactly this month. When I got diagnosed with ptsd and severe depression/anxiety AND got dumbed at the same time for being mentally sick. I started smoking. It started as something that would help me to pass, stop cutting and As my classes ( which I got a degree in neuroscience)  but as I get more mature, I think I replaced love rejection ( parents & partners) with weed addiction. 
BUT I want to quit because I need to start EMDR soon, gain clarity and not depend on a substance to make me feel happy/euphoric.

It feels good to be 'present' and to be able to deal with things instead of suppressing my feelings and procrastinating.  

Last night my wife got back from a short trip.  She drove a couple hours home and then realized she forgot something very important for school back where she was.  She works full time and is going to grad school, on top of having some pretty terrible family issues and trying to plan for the holidays.  Bottom line, she is overwhelmed, and was breaking down, and instead of me doing my thing and letting her deal with it on her own, I realized that these are the reasons I am getting sober and that I could really help her in her time of need.  So I did, and that simple act of being able to, and making a difference, is reinforcing my decision to quit.

One of the things I always felt really bad about when I smoked was how selfish I was being.  I know that part of my healing will be to try and be a better husband, a better son, a better friend... that means living for and doing things for others.  I think this is a good strategy towards a sober life.

I started in school when I was in year 7 UK or 6th Grade US.

I live in Brighton (UK) which is known for being very laid back (in other words, everyone smokes weed or has done at some point), cosmopolitan and also the gay capital of England.

I part own and run a restaurant full of unbound creativity, wonderful people and memorable experiences.
I own a house with my brother and have a mostly caring and understanding family.

But despite the ideal job and living situation I can’t enjoy my life because I smoke too much weed.
I smoke 3-4 large joints on my own most nights after a 12-14 hour shift and get about 5-7 hours sleep a night.
I can feel where my edges aren’t sharp enough to make better decisions day to day, because I am on the afterburner of getting high the night before.

My friends who haven’t been smoking as long (most 1-3 years) tell me it’s not the weed
My friends who have been smoking around as long as me (11-13years, half our lives) tell me it’s not the weed.

I know it’s weed which is why I have to finally quit. I’ve cut down several times before and taken long breaks, but enough is enough. 
I feel like I am unable to truly act of my own accord as it is much easier to get high, so I have to stop. But it’s hard when all of your friends smoke weed all the time on top of all the other drugs and alcohol...

My question to Reddit is, do I need to remove these people from my life? 

Every time I’ve talked about quitting they all tell me it’s fine and that I’m just a bit anxious and I’m just a bit this and a bit that and they all suffer from depression and anxiety but none are willing to entertain that maybe it’s something to do with the huge amount of drugs we take/ have taken in the past.

But I have decided to quit now, and they all say it’s not going to change anything. 
Are these people actually my friends? I feel like when I tell them how I really feel about my life they brush past it and try and bring the conversation back to “life” and how the government are to blame for every problem that’s ever existed and watching YouTubers that lead with opinions rather than facts and evidence.

I feel like I’m the only one who’s clinging on to the real world and that they just want to bring me down to this level of ""cool"" that is largely based around, well, sitting around and getting high.

Any support or advice appreciated.

I’ve been facing a lot of difficulties trying to remember things in general . Is this part of depression , I’ve heard people who are depressed often can’t seem to remember what they do In a day. 

I’m really scared about this , I used to think this was because of smoking up . Now that I’m 1 week clean I thought my cognitive abilities would return to normal . Most of the times it feels like I’m living in the moment and I’ll usually forget what I did like 1 hour ago.

Here's my story: There was a time when I smoked every night. To play video games, to hang out with friends. You know the deal. I don't regret it, it was a good year or two, but I knew that phase of my life had to end. Weed was beginning to affect my mental health: this first made itself really apparent when I took this one T break. After a few days, being sober for the first time in months, I realized I had ""lost"" myself. I had smoked weed for so long I had forgotten to think about who I was, and that idea had faded to a point where frankly it was terrifying to see how much was missing. So at that point I knew I had to slow down.

Fast forward to now. Every day became every week, every week became every month, until a point where I'm at now where months will go by without getting high. It's not like I don't have the chance, I still have a stash, and my roommate (who's going through his phase) asks me every other day. It's really just because I don't ever want to. I think I've realized at this point the novelty has worn off, when I get high I'm either ""just high"" or I'm stuck feeling like I'm weathering a hurricane. It's just not worth it, and my brain has finally caught up with that fact.

I feel like a ton of people go through something similar in their lives: they have the weed phase, and when it's over, it's over. Any of yall relate?",6

My mind can now think much quicker and deeper, and I feel a bit more energetic now. It's like the weed was making me a little too lazy, by keeping my mind and body numb. Now I'm realizing that  although I got stuff done, I wasted a lot of time in the last 2 years and was capable of doing much more.

Today, I left my emotionally abusive fiancé who also dealt illegally. We had dozens of mason jars of weed and I walked away from all of it.

I’m a 19 student who got into the habit of smoking weed everyday at uni, prior to this I have smoked plenty of times but never more than once a week or two weeks in a row, but for some reason I turned into a massive stoner and would smoke 2-3 grams a night near the end and it wouldn’t really get me that high. Anyway I have come home now for Christmas and can’t smoke because of my family and have been feeling so weird the past two days I have been home.
Firstly I had stomach pains and discomfit 
Loss of appetite which was crazy as it my mums cooking and maybe some mood swings ( feeling a bit low ) 
But even then I didn’t link it to smoking 
Only till now whilst I’m writing this at 4;42 am as can’t not get to sleep at all ! I sometimes have struggles with sleep but never this bad
I didn’t even know I could get withdrawals from weed and I haven’t even been smoking for that long ? What do you guys think 
Thanks !!!💜🖤🧡❤️",2

2020-12-07 23:14:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/k8x70z/struggling_possible_trigger_warning/,Struggling. (Possible Trigger Warning),"I've been a smoker since I was a freshman in high school. As much as I can, whenever I can. As I got into being a senior in high-school, I basically smoked daily, flower, carts, edibles, you name it, i did it. And its been that way basically up until November of 2018 with occasional quitting for employment. In late 2018 I quit smoking because I needed a job. I moved 300 miles. I got clean and got a job as a corrections officer. I spent about 8 months there, unable to smoke, due to random testing. Met a woman, and I ended up moving in with her. She knew I used to smoke. I ended up unemployed, toward the middle of 2019 and wanted to smoke again. So I did. I eventually got a job where I didn't have to be tested, and I was around products, flower, edibles, carts, all day every day. Literally absorbing all information I could on cannabis. So I kept smoking pot. My girl finally got upset, that I was a pot head. She sees her father in me when I'm high, because he is a daily user. She says she doesn't know who I am when I'm high. She doesn't like who I am when I'm high. And she only knows me as the sober man she met, but I don't feel like it's me.. the true me... because I have depression, and anxiety, and refuse to use conventional meds, because I turn into a zombie... at least with pot I could smile, and handle my mood shifts so much easier. So I've quit. I don't smoke anymore. After many fights. After many arguments.  She says I'm ""all or nothing"" I either smoke and its every single night, or its not at all... and I agree.. because I've always either smoked all the time, or I didn't at all, cold turkey quit with no major issues. I've been perfectly clean for over 8 months. I can be around my friends while they smoke and have no problems with it, not a desire in the world. I can be around her father when he comes over and he smokes. I can see, smell, have weed in my home. And I have no problem with it. But TALKING ABOUT IT. Talking about it hurts me... it makes me want to smoke...it makes me miss it... it makes me so sad. Every conversation I have about it with my significant other, ends in a fight... she can't control her father, but she wants to control me... and I love her. And I don't want this to become a relationship ender. She used to smoke meth. Addicted and now sober for over 12 yrs. And one more thing. Wants to use THC for our son, who doesn't sleep. (Approved by neurologists) 

This is my story. This is my problem. I want to quit because I love and respect her.  But I can't deal with the anxiety or depression, the longing for a drag off a joint, the ritual of smoking, the relaxation,, the euphoria of being high.. but my feelings are getting worse. My moods are getting worse. I feel awful... and I'm scared of what I have become...that I can't go a single day without thinking of smoking or wanting to smoke... even though I have the will power not to.... im hurting..on the inside...and I can't even show it without being ridiculed for being an addict...I don't get told she's proud I've been clean for 8 months. She still gets mad even when I talk about missing ""the good ole days"". 

If someone can decompress this rant, and understand where I'm coming from...you're amazing...thank you for reading...",3

**""I'm feeling pretty anxious, I need it to relax""**

**""I'm trying to quit but it's the weekend, I'll just smoke Friday and Saturday""**

One of the things I was most excited about when moving to Vancouver, BC 6 years ago, was the easy access to legal cannabis and dispensaries. I started off smoking it casually, then started smoking it after finishing work late at night (bartending) to relax, unwind and to help me sleep. 6 years later and I am smoking pretty much every day. Not an insane amount, either a half gram or full gram joint a day. But it has got me by its claws. I've tried stopping multiple times and can still remember how great it felt not smoking for more than a week. How fresh I felt when I woke up, how alive I felt and how I pushed myself harder to exercise and to just get shit done.

Like clockwork every day now, around 3 or 4pm just before I finish up work, I get the urge. An internal battle ensues where I feebly try to justify why it is a bad idea to go pick up a pre-roll. I can put on my jacket, grab my wallet and keys, and stand at my front door, walking back and forth anxiously contemplating... then inevitably heading out the door as I rush to the closest dispensary. I've put off stuff I need to get done for weeks, for months. Tasks and projects I plan out for the week eventually get pushed to next week because I end up in a haze, gorging on food and incessantly watching YouTube as I tell myself that I'll quit tomorrow and I'll start focusing tomorrow. I use to exercise 4-5 times a week for 1.5 hours or more. Now I struggle to motivate myself to exercise for over 20 mins.. a week. I'm lonely, but smoking makes me less motivated to reach out to others, even the ones I am closest to. I use to smoke so I could relax and ease my mind.

I'm constantly anxious. I'll use this as another excuse to go buy a joint. But then I get anxious for caving in, then I get anxious once I've smoked. Then I feel good, for 10 minutes or so. When the high dissipates, there it is again, anxious more than ever.

I'm sick of this shit and I am sick of telling myself lies. It saddens me to think what I could have accomplished in the last 6 years if cannabis did not have a firm grip on me. I'm not going to guilt or shame myself about what I could have done or what I should have done. But this time I'm never coming back to it. Life is too short to waste. I saw a quote on here today, something along the lines of ""weed never killed anyone, but it'll kill the person you're suppose to become"".

I think my trigger was going on a date with someone who smoked when we got back to her place. I declined the weed and never saw her again (perhaps related to the bud and perhaps not) but I feel like the seed was planted in my head then. I was really struggling emotionally, as I moved to a new music university in a new city. Moving to a new city is already tough but during a pandemic its really really tough. I don't have any friends here nor the opportunity to make any, there are no non university bands or ensembles to meet or play with at the school. the school bands that are authorized only meet for 45 minutes once a week. How is a musician supposed to seriously network with social distancing? Also also even if I somehow did find or form a band there would be nowhere for us to play. I'm paying thousands for university and watching the opportunity to make something out of it go down the drain.

So I'm living in this emotional and career desert trying to stay sober and its announced that next school semester is going to be the exact same fucking thing: no friends, no music, no opportunity, and it broke me. I messaged every girl I could on Tinder asking for a dealers number until I unfortunately found one. Smoked for 6 weeks straight and here I am, sweating and very tense, no appetite.

I don't know if I can stay sober in such a terrible time where everything is so uncertain. I'm struggling just as much emotionally now if not more.",2

Took me a couple weeks longer to quit than I planned, but reading this now with 48 hours clean, I feel peaceful for a moment.","Marijuana, lovingly known as Weed, age 7, of [omitted for privacy], died Sunday, December 6, 2020 with her lifelong companion by her side. Born in [omitted for privacy] in 2013, Weed came from humble beginnings. She enjoyed playing and listening to music with friends, and always lit up the room with her vibes. Weed was a loyal friend, always there for those who needed her. She had a way of helping to ease pain and burden – – she could cushion you in a plush cloud, she could float you down a creek when your world was falling apart. Weed was a soother, a caretaker, and a lover. 

When Weed became ill she refused to give up. She put forth a tremendous amount of effort, especially towards the end, in trying to convince everyone that she would pull through. Weed refused to follow the rules, she lived her life in search of peace and happiness and never let bad news get her down. So when she got the bad news that she was terminal, she went into overdrive trying to do what she did best—soothe. She gave and gave herself. It took a great toll, and while she carried on, we let her believe that she was still helping. When the sun began setting on Weed, she was confused, foggy, and sick. She was so tired. As we lay her to rest in eternal peace, we thank her for all that she gave, right up until the last moment, even when she had nothing to offer.

She spoiled me rotten. I’ll miss her. It’s going to hurt so bad I don’t know how I’ll survive it. But life moves forward, without our lost love ones. We can only recount our memories—good and bad—and either smile or learn.",31

Am i on some list to the cops? Should i be scared? The cops threatened me saying that i could have trouble if i didn't show them my phone, so i had no choice at all. My dealer really fucked up with the deliver, but, really, i was thinking about quitting for good before that and i think this was a life experience to change my course.

It was possible that i should have many troubles after this. I am so fortunate that nothing happened because it would be total disaster, my family is going through so much shit in this pandemic, lost my grandma just a month ago and my dad is going through so much... In the end its probably not worth it. It sucks, the anxiety, the boredom, but still... i know its not healthy, i've been struggling with my weight for years by now and i know the weed has a very negative influence on my body and my disposition. I know its an addiction.

Even though the cops were actually very nice and not abusive at all, it really scared the shit out of me when they came out of the car. I played honest so i would not have any troubles, but still, my anxiety is kicking HARD tonight because of this. Will my dealer know that i had no choice but to give up some information? How much trouble will i get in because of this? I buy weed for more than 10 years and this never happened to me. It would be helpful to know your experiences.

I still worry that I’ll go back to smoking but for some reason I think I may be finally done and I am so proud of myself.

Everyday I think about weed but I’ve learned to catch those thoughts and sit with the feelings attached to the memories. Lately cravings have come in strong but I’m stronger than those cravings and I’ve never been more satisfied with my life. 

To anyone that is struggling with addiction that comes to /r/leaves but cannot pull the trigger to quit I can assure you the sober mind is better in nearly every way. Yes I’m bored more often and yes my anger rises at times but it is all worth it for a functioning mind.

I know change is a process, not an instant, but being alone and the crapiness of this COVID and personal family issues makes it difficult to find other ways to cope with my anxiety.

I’m financially stable and don’t smoke a ton (maybe $60 monthly for joints) but it is a ritual I’ve come to seek in the afternoons after work. The high isn’t as fun or intense anymore,  but the act of smoking brings a sense of comfort. I want to stop simply because I don’t want anything blocking me mentally and emotionally. But I also feel conflicted with the reality that quitting suddenly might bring up all those feelings of sadness and loneliness and the crappy withdrawal that ensues. 

I know I can do it, but it’s hard. Right now, I keep thinking of getting my bong out for a small bowl as I write this. I don’t know. I guess I’d find it easier to quit if COVID didn’t eliminate all the outlets for socializing/meetups. This all just sucks.",1

Last night I dreamt what felt like the entire night and woke up remembering all of it. I can safely say I haven’t remembered dreams or dreamt at all in probably 10 years, until last night. 

Short backstory - 

In 2014 I had an extremely rough break up with a man who had cheated on me for over a year (he’s married to her now). At the time I had been living with him in a house he inherited and a long drawn out break up became explosive one day... and his mother came over and essentially kicked me out. There was a lot of other drug use that lead to the explosiveness. That day I packed up everything I had there from the year of living with him (including 2 cats).. shoved it all into my car and never went back or spoke to him again. 

The wife who had spent years prior harassing me and stalking me.. continued to do so even until this past year. It’s an overly long exhausting story. But basically, I never did get any real closure. 

Last night I dreamt so vividly that my dad and I went to that house to “retrieve my belongings”. I am quite sure I left stuff there - it wouldn’t have been possible to have gathered everything I owned in one fell swoop. 

It was just me and my dad going through drawers and closets of belongings and notes and photos. My ex and his wife even showed up and were quite amicable considering she continues to stalk me in real life and considering I had completely entered their home at free will with in my dream lol. 

Anyway.. since the break up I battled with some serious bouts of heavy and consistent drinking and smoked just about every day. I quit drinking in July and although my emotions began to process , I knew I needed to ditch the pot to fully find myself again. Finally , a week in - and it certainly feels like my subconscious is actually letting go and making space for a new way of life. 

It really is a prime example of the way drugs and alcohol do nothing but suppress our emotions . I know that dream was just the start of the real healing that is to come. It feels like the weight of the world is off my shoulders.",3

While I didn't smoke a lot, one small biff after 9pm each evening, it was a loss I had to prep for. 

I wanted to stop anyway, I was becoming reliant on the nothingness being stoned brought to get through trauma and to manage symptoms of PTSD after burying a child (years ago, but a very traumatic situation) and in turn, to help me sleep. Which was fine, but I was also so used to the routine I'd made my self, it freaked me out not to do it every night and if I didn't have any, I didn't sleep... Which was worse than before I smoked and didn't sleep, it was at least natural sleep before. 

My sleep became this weird artificial chamber that didn't provide rest, but just a temporary standby. I woke up tired still. 

The problem with self medicating with cannabis for illnesses is that there's different strengths and effects to different strains, over here, where it's illegal, you don't really get a lot of genetically tailored grows. Just stuff that's either shit, middle (perfect), strong and zombie.  I wanted the middle ground, enough to help, but not enough to forget everything for the whole evening, I wanted to be able to live still. 

Anyway, it became too much and too easy to use as an excuse. I started waiting for 9pm so I could go and smoke and that sucks. 

New job and the excuse I needed. 
The trauma and effects of illnesses are still there and cannabis, for the first 18 months really did help. In fact, I wouldn't change the process at all. But after 2 years it started to become a negative and now I'm 11 weeks sober. 

I miss switching off. 
The nightmares from coming away from weed accompanied with the nightmares from sexual assault and child loss are excruciating. But it's better to feel something some of the time, than nothing all of the time. Stuff got tough a few years back and it was a good tool at the time, but looking term is just not effective.

The last time around, I had quit after about 8 years of nightly smoking. Weed always held a distinct place in my day. I never smoked during the day but the dependence, especially in the evenings, became a sad reality. I have since learned a lot about myself, my triggers, cravings, and I can truly say that the distress this time around is not quite so bad. I felt frantic last time, as though I was at a breaking point. The shame was constant, the endless cycle of telling myself not to smoke in the morning and then convincing myself it was fine to smoke in the evening was pretty much just a regular day at that point. I feel much calmer now, able to see my attachment and honestly able to understand how my suffering through this is ultimately benefitting me. I'm not sure what I need here. Part of me just wants to be heard and seen as I know this community knows the pride of putting down weed and the shame that can accumulate from re-introducing it. Any words of confidence or courage would be helpful. I have a big fear that in removing this behavior from my life that I'm ridding myself of moments of relaxation and happiness that I won't get back. Logically I know this is not true and that I need to find relaxation and happiness without weed, but this is just how I feel right now.

So I now have 0ver 4 yrs alcohol free- i quit on my own.  And 72 days ago i qit smoking pot because i had to before shoulder replacement surgery.  And I wanted, for a long time, to quit dope.  I was never able to.  Now that im recovering i want real bad to have a cold beer, and am fighting even more the desire to smoke pot again.  Here's what's working for me I hope.

First, even though my grandkids may smoke pot soon(it's so easy and legal her in CA), I want to be able to tell them when they ask, ""yeah, I used to but I don't anymore"".  I know how badly i looked (on google, e.g.) for ANYONE who didn't use drugs or alcohol, to help me stop, and there's damn few.  Even Willie Nelson still does edibles.  Even Neil Young who I thought had quit smokes again.  I just want them to see someone in their young lives who doesn't get loaded.

Second, I don't want to die of emphysema or lung cancer.  I know I've smoked enough to stuff a queen size mattress in my life time.  Even as distressing as it was watching my mother die of COPD I remember stopping to buy dope on the way home from the hospice when i visited her.  A few days in the hospital put the worry back into me.  I was a chemist, for several years an industrial hygiene chemist in the OSHA lab, and you can't tell me it's safe to smoke.  You can always find some data to rationalize using it but when it comes to your own mortality and the suffering don't fool yourself doing risk assessments.  Most of my life i thought it was cool, i started in vietnam, i went to woodstock, we never made friends with straight people, but i wish i had never smoked or taken that first upper.

I will say this.  instead of dwelling on my wrong decisions and muttering daily to myself ""You fucking idiot"" and ""you dumb Shit"", I don't talk to myself like that anymore since I quit pot.  I just realized that a couple of days ago.  Just sayin.    Bob

I have been struggling with quitting weed for 2 years even when it took me to the brink of insanity because I had nothing else to hold on to while my life was getting destroyed day by day while I watched like a bystander doing nothing. I have cried again and again while destroying myself with weed but couldn't help it like I was in some kind of prison. A prison where the guard which is weed allows you to have a sneak peak through the prison's window into the life but won't let you out, after a while you will crave just for that sneak peak out that window because the prison is the new normal for you and the sneak peak through the window is a luxury. You will forget about the life while you are satisfied with only watching others. There are many claims about weed that it is not addictive or not as dangerous as other drugs but the fact is that it depends on the person and their usage amount. A person who is smoking twice a week won't be addicted to it but someone like me who smoked everyday multiple times will definitely see the ugly side of things because once you get inside this hole, it's very hard to get out of it. It comes in your life like a friend but it gets too late to realise that the same friend has stabbed you in the back.

It's been a week since I quit weed and I have quit it before too for weeks but this time it's different, I have 0 cravings for it this time, whenever I quit it before I struggled everyday with cravings and what not but this time I have 0 cravings. What's different this time? My mindset.


Weed addiction is closely related to how much you are struggling with things in your life. I used to make excuses for my mistakes and cover them all up by smoking weed. I never tried to deal with the underlying issue which was me running away from my problems. It's hard to face your problems specially when you have put a full stop on your progress in life while smoking weed but you gotta do it somehow, you have the will power to do it, you just gotta believe in it. Every time you quit all your past problems will come at your front staring you down and making you look for an escape but you gotta realise that past can't be changed and by destroying your present you are only adding salt to injury. You can't do ANYTHING ABOUT PAST EXCEPT LEARNING FROM IT but you can do everything about now. Don't think about the mistakes you made in past. Past is  like a movie playing on a screen where you can only watch and learn but can't do anything in it and you gotta realise this fact from the core of your heart.",26

I told everyone I know that I was quitting when I turned 20 years old a little while back and that lasted only a few days (pretty embarrassing). In hindsight I think my homies roasted me because they're unable to quit themselves. This time, I've been more determined, I flushed my herbs down the toilet down the toilet 10 days ago but it's been 3 days since I last smoked (I don't recommend seeing your buddies for a little bit just an excuse to take a hit). 

My life hasn't been that hard or traumatic but for some reason I feel like I'm unable to cope with reality. All the feelings that I was suppressing first thing in the morning with a fat bowl are washing over me. Things like guilt for not working harder in the past, or just random regrets that I never gave much thought. I guess that's a good thing in a way.

Whenever I start feeling too sorry for myself I remind myself that I did this to me. I'm not a victim and I don't have any reason to think that what I'm going through is so bad. I wasn't thinking about withdrawals while I was casually getting high and domed anytime I had the urge.

Reading people's stories on here has been a huge help knowing I'm not alone and some people may have it way worse.

 Despite how hard it is, it's clear that its very doable which is probably the scariest part :). 

Not wasting money, lying to my parents, or damaging my health has been a pretty good feeling too.

Why don't we all try to make a first tiny step and write out our experience with Mary  Jane so far, and why we want to break up.

I'll start: For me, it started at  16, I  only smoked a few times at parties but I remember always enjoying it. I  ended up promising myself things, that it would only be the summer,  only when I'm at these parties. School started and I  decided that I would only smoke for a few days out of the month, after random drug testing.  (anyone  in  extracurricular had to be in the mix), so that I didn't get kicked out of sports. From there I said I would only smoke for two weeks after the drug test because it would be out of my system for the next one. Then that got thrown away I just kept smoking throughout the school year, having to get around drug tests by sneaking fake pee or diluting my urine.

It's crazy to think that stopping smoking would have been clearly the easiest option in this situation, but I continued to justify my actions. It went from smoking only with friends or at parties to buying THC carts, and **always** having one at home.  From there I entered into college, for my first two years it wasn't an issue because I was always preoccupied with either school or work,  and I  would never smoke before any of these because I  always got terrible anxiety when in public high. But if there were opportunities to smoke without lots of people around at school and work I would always take them. I promised myself that I wouldn't smoke once I transferred to my new school until all my work was done, and once COVID hit and online school started that went all out the window. From the moment I  wake up I hit my THC cart to the time I go to bed. I started getting back into nicotine, and I  find myself often caving to buy a disposable vape when I  pass by my local shop. I've started to miss assignments, I find myself getting motivation to do work, and losing it right after. I'll read all these posts on this subreddit, think about all the help that quitting could do for me, then I'll take another hit of my THC cart and move on.",32

The first time I tried to quit, it put me in tears, I was throwing up, depressed, couldnt sleep, sweating, angry, felt super morbid with dark thoughts it was truly awful, after a few weeks I decided the odd smoke at the weekend would be fine, it was not, I slipped back i to smoking a gram a day a few weeks after. 

Forward wind a few years, I was having a tight chest, heart palpitations that were slowly getting more frequent, trying to cough to clear my throat and chest but never actually  being able to clear it always feeling like something was there, my body was telling me I'm killing myself. 

So I quit again, only  this time - it is just so much easier, I feel so aware of my emotions and do not succumb to them, got chicken noodle soup which is awesome if you feel ill. Drinking plenty of water, first 48 hours I felt pretty bad, slept for most of it . Restless nights and sweating all the same. But I am on day three now and I really can see that I can do this, I am not gonna touch weed again. 

Ive had a list of things that I've wanted  to do, get good at guitar, start a side business on etsy, stream. Over the 7 years after leaving uni whilst smoking I have achieved a grand total of 0 on my list of aspirations. I just cruised, never pushed myself. Didn't have the motivation.

Well 2020 might have been a disaster, but it's also the year I quit weed a now I see my future  lighting up again with possibilities so for me personally, 2020 has had it's upside : )

For anyone thinking about quiting, or already did and fell back into smoking. What I am saying is, your next experience with quiting might be a WHOLE LOT easier, especially if you can get yourself in the right mindset. Dont think your first experience  of trying to quit is the be all and end all. If you know deep fown it's what you want - make it happen, you CAN and WILL find a way.

Feeling more of myself has had both negative and positive connotations as I experience more of what I had been pushing away. I assumed I would only see remorse and negative opportunities. Now, I see opportunities that I would have told myself I could not have for any reasons that made sense to me at the time.

I feel like I can be present in the moments of my life. When smoking, I experienced a series of disconnected moments that my cognition would process in bursts. It could involve rewatching the same scenes on TV or of dialogue in a show because I did not pay attention the first time or for the repeats. It felt like I was doing that in life.

I would ask people to repeat portions of conversations. I would ask to be heard and re-heard on the same issue thinking I needed to convince the other person with my message. Worse, I would interrupt important conversations with observational statements or interrupt with my train-of-thought. This made the people I care for feel like I was not listening to them in the moment and they began to withdraw.

Things have improved and I expect them to get better. Staying vigilant with ourselves is hard. It is hardest for me in the moments where I have time alone and began to feel anxious or lonely. I am
now journaling (I recommend the Five-Minute Journal) and read Eckhart Tolle for help with presence.

It’s the echoes I see on here that I resonate with such as that when I was sober I wanted to be high, and when I was high I desperately wanted to be sober. Also, my friends who are long-term, frequent marijuana users often experienced increases in difficulty dealing with depression, anger, and anxiety. If I am going to feel those emotions anyways, then I would prefer to not ignore them for months until a moment of sobriety forces me to entertain them.

Life is better for me when I have more agency over the moments I choose to experience and feel. Smoking would never ask me to exercise, sleep, eat well or visit friends. My own unclouded thoughts ask me to take care of myself.

It's still hard every day. I still haven't mustered up the motivation to get back into my fitness routine, but I'm also battling with post concussion syndrome as well, which makes it much harder. But it's a battle I'll win. 

It's strange how much we rely on the sticky green plant for help, most of us without even realizing it. I didn't know I was an addict until I quit. As much as I wish I could go back in time and stop me from getting hooked on pot, I also appreciate the lessons I was able to learn, the healing I was able to do and the person it helped me become. Kicking it was just admitting I don't need the help anymore. That I can do it on my own. 

We are worth it my friends. As painful as it may be, as depressing as it can be without it, or anxiety riddling, it's all worth it. Anxiety and depression are there because there is something or something's that we haven't taken care of yet.

Weed might’ve helped, but my lack of control has left me with no other option but through the pain.

I think somewhere in this struggle, I guess I feel humbled.
My own pain is becoming the armour I don, everytime I feel that craving to smoke a big cone.

Did I smoke weed today? Fuck no
Did I feel awful but held strong? Fuck yes

There's a certain loneliness in abstinence. A feeling that by attempting to rise above, you leave a lot of what you knew below. We grow comfortable in our holes in the ground but yet humanity has always dreamed of what's above and past the horizon.

Surely the grand adventure of sobriety is worth the emotional tidal waves crashing upon our vessel.

Just some reflection I guess. I'm pretty young so don't mind my dramatic language.

Keep it up reader! I believe in you. I know EXACTLY how shit it feels. You GOT this",4

I didnt enjoy the high at all, im just sad because I was going to get 1 month clean soon and now it feels like everything goes back to 0.

About a year in I got the idea I should quit, but here we are!

Beyond some anxiety and self isolation, I never had any major draw backs to smoking until about a year ago. My lungs and sinuses were all messed up from hitting a big bong many times a night after work.

I was always very functional, never smoked before work, and I could be very productive on creative projects with weed, but it was making me very cloudy and I didn’t like relying on it to be creative, but I was a very heavy smoker so I knew I’d be in for the long haul on withdrawals.

I made it ten months off about 2.5 years ago, but I had no real improvement. I’d occasionally post here, thinking I saw some incremental progress, but I think I was saying it to make it so.

I didn’t even feel like I relapsed after ten months. I made a conscious choice to just start again because I wasn’t feeling better and the draw backs of weed were better than feeling numb and depressed all the time.

But like I said, last November my lungs were telling me it was time to quit and I’d have panic attacks after a big bong hit that were very existential and made me cry about wasting my life and keeping my family at a distance.

So I attempted to quit a few times, didn’t last more than a week or so each time, switched to edibles which gave my lungs a break but got more panic attacks. 

I finally resolved to quit around mid August after smoking just a hit at my friends house which hurt my Lungs for several days afterward. That was a major wake up call, and it was actually good because I now had a major negative association with being high.

I got hit with the paws hard for 3 months, it peaked about 2.5 weeks ago, just so irritable and depressed, drinking alcohol gave me terrible hang overs, coffee worked for about 30 minutes than I had anxiety the rest of the day. 

I resolved to cut out coffee and alcohol for a while and switched to tea and started meditating and taking long walks.

I can tell I’m not 100% back yet, but I feel major improvement, and my family has noticed. My creativity is coming back And I feel more engaged in interactions. I thought it was going to take a long tome to heal since my last quit didn’t help after 10 months, but I smoked a lot less this year, so I’m happy to say I see the other side, even if I’m not there yet.

Overall, exercise, therapy, cutting out coffee and alcohol really helped, meditation helped, and just patience, knowing it won’t be for ever even if you’ve got PAWs.

Good luck leavers.",3

Especially the simple quotes about smoking habits helped me.

Currently I’m at day 4, almost day 5 and I can honestly say, fuck I wish i did this earlier.
I feel sharper at work, even my manager is praising me for getting in extra work and picking up tasks that i never would have picked up when I was high.

I laugh harder, i cried when i was seeing a video of someone getting a puppy < I didn’t even cried when my grandparents passed away...> 

I don’t have sleeping problems( which I’m so grateful for) and I had a proper dream that I didn’t have in 10 years of daily smoking.
only my appetite is somewhat lacking and I get a little nauseous when i smell lots of different foods together.

I’ve taken on a part-time food delivery job to keep my mind occupied during the evenings and it’s working so far! However I’m still getting some withdrawal symptoms that can’t be done overcome by keeping my kind busy. I’ve made some points that I have noticed so far.
1. Headaches and pressure build up in my head
2. Twitches in the hands and my eyes and my legs 
3. It’s still taking me a while to get to sleep at night but hopefully behind busy all day with two jobs now will help that.
4. My memory (short and long term) has taken a hit over the years from smoking and now I am going t-total it feels like for now, my short term memory is even worse because it’s hard to concentrate without being high. Hopefully this will improve and be much better than it was when I was always high in the long run.
5. Not got a massive appetite but the food I do eat is tasting better and I appreciate it much more.
6. Taking more care in my personal hygiene and health and getting out in the fresh air more which is great. 
To conclude, still annoyed that I am saying good bye to one of my favourite past times (getting baked!) but I’m determined to get over these first few days/weeks/months and never have to put myself through these withdrawal symptoms again!

I stopped drinking idk a month or so ago and to be honest that was way easier than I ever expected, but I have been paralyzingly daunted by the idea of quitting smoking.

Over the past few years I've developed insomnia and issues with eating where I've been historically using weed medicinally for appetite/insomnia with a fun ""bonus"" of getting high before bed. So far it's the only thing that allows me to eat and sleep and I'm worried that without it I will suffer in other ways.

I've spoken with my doctor and we're trying out a new brain medication right now so we're not able to treat my insomnia and nonexistent appetite until those levels even out and I was kind of assuming weed would be a crutch until then.

I'm realizing after reading posts on this sub that a lot of the ""going crazy"" feelings I've been experiencing lately might be from the amount I need to smoke to actually treat these other issues. It only happened once or twice at first, but now I'm feeling that psychosis almost every time and it makes me so sad afterwards.

I hate that this post is a weird stream of consciousness and doesn't really have much of a point, but I'm not really sure where to turn. My doctors kind of shrug or don't know how to respond when I honestly tell them how much I smoke, and my partner is super supportive in not ""pushing me"" before I'm ready so is letting me lead the pace with my weed usage. The downside is I'm not getting external motivation and have to do it all myself. Yes yes, I know this is the way but I can still complain about it while I'm struggling. It *feels* like I'm the only one supporting me right now, regardless of the truth.

I've already lost a bunch of weight from when I stopped drinking and honestly I'm a little concerned about losing more weight once my appetite disappears from stopping smoking. When it's gone, it's GONE. Like, lose 10lbs in a week type of gone. I am already a very small person who can fit into some children's clothes. Thinking of putting food in my mouth, much less my stomach, is so revolting when I don't smoke. Everything tastes amazing and I keep weight on myself when I do.

I've been recreationally smoking for about 15+ years, but it's gotten really bad over the past 2-3. Especially bad during 2020.

Still struggling mentally but I can do this.,"Here's another update on my journey. Writing these posts seem to really help me. Didn't seem to post correctly so I'm reposting.

I went to urgent care the other day and they didn't find anything immediately wrong with my stomach but we came to the conclusion that having more food in it makes it burn more when I'm trying to lay down. They referred me to a specialist and recommended a mostly liquid diet.

So I flushed myself with milk of magnesia and just ate bone broth and yogurt today with some chamomile tea. I was finally able to sleep more than 4 hours! Almost 10 hours actually. The pain is much less than it was before but I do feel weak and had to eat a banana which I couldn't entirely finish a bit ago. I also woke up in a cold sweat, felt freezing, and had to shower. Tried to sleep again but couldn't for long.

It's now almost 5am. I'm calling my doctor today when they open to talk more about what is going on with my stomach and if it is withdrawal related.

My anxiety isn't as bad, maybe since I finally got some sleep, but it's still pretty constant. I just feel numb and out of it.

I also noticed I've been getting itchy all over randomly for a couple hours each of the past few days around the evening. Thought it was an allergic reaction but there's no common factor that could be causing it at this point. I read that it could be a sign of detox and I'm going to mention it to my doctor. Also need a psychiatrist or something.

Oh and still getting random muscle pain around my chest, ribs, and back.

It'll be nice to get over all this hopefully soon!",3

I was always pretty straight edge otherwise, I hated the feeling alcohol gave me and tried mushrooms once. Started smoking  on weekends in college or when my older brothers visited then escalated post college, to before bed, after work. Then later before work, am, pm didn't matter. It gave me an apatite while I was pregnant -vomiting & nausea for 8 months sucks.  I'd smoke when the kid napped and again when he went to bed. When I started it use to make me feel less anxious and more comfortable in own skin. Like I could just sit and enjoy myself instead of thinking of 17 things. 

I got out of an abusive relationship this summer and realizing that I was being abused made me go cold turkey for a week just to wrap my head around what was happening to me. I couldn't smoke around my ex anymore (even though we use to all the time)  I felt like I needed to be more alert and ready for what was going to be thrown at me -literally.

Recently when I smoke in safe environment with safe friends or even alone. I get paranoid more, cry, take things really to heart, overthink. It even felt my heart pounding thru my chest and couldn't relax. I forced myself to sleep so it would stop. It made me reassess my motivation for smoking.

It may be a coping mechanism I've outgrown. I've been slowly tapering off and now its been 2 weeks totally sober and its been okay. I'm feeling my feelings more and that's been nice.

This was going to be my last ride, but it turns out he's accelerated my plans to stop.  The whole journey backs was half ""WTF am I going to do?"" followed by ""This is exactly what I needed"".If anything, I feel a bit liberated.  It's strange, if he'd called me 2 mins after I left to drive home I may not be sitting here typing this. But the annoyance of changing a car battery and driving for what turned into 2 hours made me really think about it all.  He called me 10 mins after I'd started driving back, and it was a close call.  I hit a roundabout (I'm from the UK) and in that moment, I decided no, this is something I need to do.  Like many people here I'm a very well functioning addict.  Good job, great income, bad addiction.  It's been years since I got high, but I smoked every night.  The diminishing returns are real, and I'm looking forward to a 'clean' life going forward.

I'll still smoke one if offered, but I really REALLY want to break the every day habit.  Thanks for reading if you got this far.  


EDIT:  Thanks for all the support people :)  I'll take the avoid social smoking seriously, as it triggered a memory that the reason I got back into smoking was when I first quit for about 3 months (about 5 years ago)  I started a new job, and that's where I met the guy and decided to have 'one', and then I got his dealers number.

I read few quotes from few poorly on this community , which really changed my perspective 

1 “if you are high now , 2 hours later you’ll want to be high again ” 

As someone who smoked pretty often , this made a big hit to me . It told me that regardless of whether I’m high or sober few hours later I would want to smoke again . This left me in a situation where I contemplated what’s the advantage of getting high . Most people do it for medical reason and I’m not going to argue against them . This post if for those who are trapped in this cycle and want to escape. 

2 “when you are high you want to be sober , when you are sober you want to be high” 

This was another quote which I read in one of the posts . I feel this is absolutely true in my case and could be in your case too. Frequently I would get high and become quiet and in certain social situations I would wish if I was sober I could go talk to other people.

After realising that I fact that getting high is not useful for me anymore , It suddenly it hit me. 
I’ve been a stoner for about 4 years, toking on an daily basis .although most of my life has been on track there are certain aspects where I’ve failed(we all have regrets)

I used to get high to reduce stress and chill out. Soon this became a case of me getting high everyday and chilling . Everyone gets stressed , and they learn to deal with it . For me, I used to smoke weed to escape this . 

After quitting for about a week I’ve realised that it’s not stress that I am worried about , it’s LIFE in general that I’m scared about . Weed is an amazing medicine , but consuming it daily transformed me into another person who was mentally dependent on weed for anything and everything . I started hating events where I didn’t smoke weed and I would get angry on people. 

This week has been difficult , I’ve gone through a rollercoaster of emotions , my body had been  affected , my sleep disturbed, eating problems  and much more . I would like to say that this I COMPLETELY NOTMAL . Becoming sober is a journey and this is a phase which we have to go through.NOTE TO ANYONE GOING THROUGH THIS , THIS IS NORMAL AND SOON YOU’LL BE BACK TO YOUR USUAL SELF. Remember to take good care of yourself. You have to take baby steps . 

Smoking up changes your reward system of brain so you start looking for instant pleasure , remember that this is not who you are . Enjoy the little things in life , try to make someone smile(I promise this will bring more happiness and satisfaction than lighting a blunt).  

I won’t stretch it more and say that now I’m feeling great , got some energy back . I’m still on the roller coaster of emotions.

At least now I know I’m on a rollercoaster and there is an end. ( and I’m not in this alone)
Knowing this has motivated me stick to sober me.staying consistent is the key !

Final quote from Vegeta (whatsup dbz fans) to anyone who’s on this rollercoaster with me

I initially smoked weed with mates during social occasions however the decision to smoke at home caused it to become a daily occurrence. I was going down a dark path with weed, where I started to prefer being isolated from my friends and to just smoke weed and listen to music and podcasts. Two months into sobriety and I can definitely say that my life has improved, in regards to my relationships with people around me and also with my daily habits. Don’t get me wrong, there have been times where the people around me are smoking and offer for me to participate , however I think back to the early struggles of sobriety and this notion keeps my willpower intact.

Currently on day 5 and I'm doing so much better than the first few days. I got my appetite back and can sleep again! 
Anyways I was primarily a night smoker, using cartridges in the evening and before bed. I also usually play video games at night. Lately, especially when playing with friends I always think how much better it would be to be high playing vids. Even though I know I'll be high for 30 mins and then just wanna take more hits.
Anyone know when this starts to go away? It's tempting but definitely manageable. I just don't even want it to cross my mind tbh. How long did it take you guys? Or does the thought never go away?",5

I smoked constantly from the beginning of high school to just last week (I'm 24 now just finished college) and ohhh my this has been tough.

 Is it only me or do you guys get hit with extreme waves of depression that makes you physically uncomfortable? and the only thought you have is ""I wanna smoke and I'll feel better"" cos its been like that every day now. I started exercising more and that helps a little, but the depression still hits very hard. My girlfriend and family have already noticed a difference in me. I'm more animated, alert, and just overall a better person to be around lol, but I myself don't feel this way, I feel the same depression as I would feel when I was always high.

I have a headache every morning and sometimes It lasts all day. The night sweats and vivid dreams are taking a toll on me night after night. It's hard to talk to my friends about the withdrawls because they are still stoners and don't realize how much it sucks to come off of. I also had been diagnosed with anxiety prior to my heavy weed use. And now I am starting to get anxiety attacks every now and again and the doctor has me on benzodiazepines for it which I DO NOT want to be having to take. I feel it's replacing one addiction with another. Even though I only take when I have an anxiety attack. 
I smoked almost every weekend or any time I could with friends since high school.  But my consumption got out of hand over this last year after losing my job to covid. I turned to the weed to cope and would spend all day getting high from morning to night. Since I was not working I had all this time to waste away on weed. I'm now 9 days clean and I actually never have had cravings to go and smoke because I'm so done with it. I want to fix my life and I feel this is step one. 

I'm hoping for suggestions on how to cope with my symptoms. I should also add that I am completely changing my diet to clean eating. No more junk. I'm fully committed but I need help.

2020-12-06 19:31:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/k85r76/day_27/,Day 27,"Just checking-in with my daily progress.  I went through a tough couple of days of just feeling lousy, my Addict Brain telling me to smoke-out, but not wanting to smoke weed at all.  I read a lot online about addiction and recovery, especially recovery tools, and read this subreddit a lot too.  It helped me get through those days.  

Feeling better.  Still not great, but not as bad as I was last week.  I am learning that too much coffee seems to really whack-out my system, so I've been being more conscious about that, and less coffee has translated into less anxiety for me.  I love coffee, so I don't see myself giving that up entirely!  ;)  

I am also smoking far fewer cigarettes (no judgments please!).  I used to smoke about a pack a day; but have cut down to one pack lasting about two and one-half days.  So that's progress.  I'm moving toward quitting those entirely, but want to continue weaning myself off of them versus cold turkey right now.  I feel that I am already dealing with a lot by detoxing from weed and alcohol (I quit alcohol about a week before I quit weed entirely).  Baby steps, baby steps. 

An additional note:  I was really concerned about my recovery because those few days when I was feeling so lousy, I wasn't even getting much from the subreddit or the exchanges on the Discord chat.  I was pretty sure it was me because other people seemed able to engage quite readily.  That realization brought me up short, and ironically enough, made me more mindful to stay clean and utilize recovery tools.  One of the things I learned from that was even when I feel lousy, even when I feel like nothing is working, even when my Addict Brain tells me to smoke-out because I'll feel better (NOT!!), that it is well worth the effort to keep my commitment to stay clean each day AND to continue doing ""the work"" of recovery -- even when I don't feel like it.

2020-12-06 17:51:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/k8407a/a_long_story_about_my_history_with_weed_that_you/,"A long story about my history with weed, that you don't have to read, but I have to write","I'm 40+. I've smoked casually since I was 16. When I was younger, I only smoked at parties w/ friends but never bought my own. For 10+ years from high school, thru college, grad school, I enjoyed smoking. I've always been close w/ stoner friends more than anyone. I was capable of keeping it casual myself. It was too annoying to seek out, and I recall complaining that I ""felt dumb for days"" after smoking. I found it fun and attributed no importance to it. Tho I did note one trend among all of my stoner friends over the years... almost all had anger or depressive streaks that were surprising and uncharacteristic of their lifestyle otherwise.  I even reached out to one at one point, telling him that weed seemed to be affecting his academic and social life. He actually did end up quitting later that year. My brother was addicted to hard drugs, so I knew what that looked like. Weed did not seem like an addiction for me, relative to my brother's experience.

FF a few years, I moved to Seattle right weed became legal in WA state. I fell in LOVE! A weed store opened up right across the street. It was bright and cheery, smelled good, and it was exciting to be part of. I was getting into buddhism, and it seemed to really help w/ meditation. I had an active lifestyle around it, hiking mostly. It was great. I found it peaceful and insightful. But within 2 years, it had taken over without me realizing it. One night stoned as normal, watching David Lettermans' final show, I started to feel... psychic.

I told my girlfriend that I knew for a fact that I had seen this episode that I coulnd't possibly have seen. It honestly felt like I remembered seeing it years ago (I'm a huge Letterman fan). As my girlfriend explained that it was impossible for me to have seen this episode before, I tried to prove it, by predicting things before they happened. I believe I may have succeeded a couple of times, likely because I'm a huge letterman fan. It felt very real. Otherwise tho, I am a very strong skeptic. I'd consider myself an activist-skeptic of anything ""supernatural"" (a word I consider to be a true oxymoron). The illlogic of the letterman event began to overwhelm me and I had a severe panic attack that sent me to the ER for what I thought was a heart attack. Even that, did not stop me from smoking. In fact, another very similar panic attack did not stop me from smoking a year later.

From a casual lifetime smoker to the past 5 years as a daily smoker I watched myself become very angry and depressed in general. Going to therapy resulted in a mental illness diagnosis. I began to self-medicate, became addicted to video games, staying up late, and having a series of embarassing social situations while stoned at inappropriate times. I became totally disconnected from my girlfriend of 10 years. I felt inoperable without weed. I tried to quit several times before finding this sub.

This sub helped me realize that in fact, a lot of my experiences that I thought MAY be associated with my weed use, were DEFINATELY associated with my weed use. So many similar stories and symptoms and social situations. I've been stalking this sub for a few months to a year now, and two days ago I decided to try to quit again.

For the past 2 days, I have been miserable. And I honestly would not have made it had I not kept coming back here to read what others have gone through. Extreme boredom. Depression. I couldn't leave bed. Nothing felt like it was worth doing. Clearly, weed, for me, is a serious problem. Last night, I couldn't sleep and nearly ended my relationship because I lashed out at HER for not telling me she stopped going to therapy (a real mistake that I regret). I ended up explaining to her that I was quitting weed; I hadn't told her because I didn't want to let her down again, as I've tried before. But this time, I was using the support of this sub. I've been coming back here for the past couple days, just reading and searching for similar situations. A post about boredom really helped me realize I was not alone in that regard.

Today is actually day 3 and it's the first day I have a little energy again. I started a book I bought months ago. I turned off my cell phone and watched a movie this morning with my girlfriend, snuggled on the sofa. There's a connection I haven't felt in a long time. Something missing is coming back. I decided to come here, write out my story, and help solidify what this all means to me and hopefully stick with it. Tomorrow, I am giving my bong, pipes, papers, etc... to any friends willing to take them, or they are going in the trash.  I quit tobacco 15 years ago doing something similar, throwing out everything from lighters to ashtrays.",132

\- there are so many more hours in the day to do things i love but have forgotten  
\- i have enough energy to cook, and i am satiated by food  
\- i no longer have extreme paranoia about my safety. i do not have to repeatedly search the apartment, or call my sister in a panic because of a faint noise  
\- my memory of the day before is clear, and usually accurate   
and, my favorite one of all:  
\- dreaming. this is so crazy to me because the reason i started smoking in the first place was to escape  a chronic nightmare i was having. again, i know not everyone has the same experience, but when i fell asleep high, i didn't dream at all. not only do i no longer have that particular nightmare (in part to improved mental health), but over the last few weeks, i have had the most incredibly vivid dreams, both good and bad. even when they're bad, though, they are colorful, creative and eye-opening. each day that i can wake up and remember my dreams makes me feel alive and grounded.

if you are struggling, and feeling like caving, you are not alone, but you are strong enough to find 5 things that you have in this moment that you wouldn't have if you were high. i hope this helps someone, and i am rooting for each of us!! thanks for letting me share :)",13

2020-12-06 16:29:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/k82i82/500_days_of_haze/,500 days of haze,"Hello everyone,

Its been close to 500 days since I've been seriously acting on the idea to quit weed. Its been ""one last"" smoke, 500+ times over this span. Multiple last joints a day. At some point I feel that I've medicated my head with blatant lies just as much as the weed. A trump-ian effect on my brain. I believe myself every time very well knowing that as soon as I'm lighting up this last joint, somewhere in the back of my head there is a plan conjuring to procure the ""actual last"". I go through mental gymnastics justifying why actually this time is the last time because it just so happens to be 4:20 PM on 4/20/20, so its just so iconic and something I will look back upon with joy (I still remember how fast that quit attempt derailed within hours). But I never held myself accountable in any meaningful way. Oh it's X months before my birthday today, its a perfect time to smoke the last and reward myself with X months of sobriety. It's all bullshit. 

The thing is, I have a job that I'll consider a blessing and I can coast along. But I can't for long. I am ashamed of myself and my guilt colors every interaction I have at work. Same goes for my personal life. I'm just so wrapped up in the melancholy of quitting and getting that perfect last high. It will never be like the first time. I still remember it, I don't remember much after that. The brain has been on auto-pilot. I have everything one could desire perhaps a partner. And maybe that is a reason I choose to find solace in an easier whore who keeps wanting me to pay her for her time and do nothing else. Regardless of what it is, ignoring life in a haze is not the way to go about it. There is a lot of things I could say or not. I have never really posted here for accountability before. I have surrendered the fact that my past is the past and all those attempts that could have been the last were essential. The journey I've had where I have neglected everything but my sloth like desire to retain the one thing that gives me the false fallacy of soothing. It was important. I realize I've had experiences that have shaped me and I'm thankful for it. I read somewhere that addiction is one the great equalizers. I am humbled to have witnessed these greats heights and depths.

I have started journaling more and that has really helped me keep track of my constant cries for help. I'll leave you all with a entry from there, something I wrote when I was having one of my ""last"" joints.

I love you all and I have faith in all of you.

November 27 2020:

""All choices have loss. That’s the definition of it. Or else it wouldn’t be a choice. I’ve long since determined that it’s a choice between a sober life and that of weed. Logically both cannot coexist together in my life. Sobriety implies the absence of weed. I’ve conclusively lived out my weed life with no opposition from anyone or anything. I felt this was at the expense of my overall quality of life. It felt like an abusive relationship. Thus I made the choice of sobriety. I will mourn the loss of weed as I did anything fundamental in my life. Same to kick the nicotine habit. Same for a lot of people in my life. This will be no different. I will crave it. But I must show the same restrains I show when dealing with heartbreak. This was a more invasive hooker. Much more pleasurable. And therein is the difficulty, much like Anthony, there is a guy inside me who wants to smoke and watch reruns while staying in bed all day. She is the perfect companion. So remember this FrostedSalt. This is a choice you made after deliberation and the correct one. The only thing that needs to be done is execution. I love you.""",3

2020-12-06 15:22:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/k8191m/i_fucked_up_undoubtedly/,"I fucked up, undoubtedly","Hi all. I don't have many people to talk to about this in real life, so I'm turning to the /r/leaves community. Throwaway account, of course.

Folks, I fucked up. I'm almost 20, and since right after 16, I've been using weed and other drugs as an escape from reality and a form of mental self-harm. Now, I'm approaching 1 year sober, and that bounce back into proper cognition, memory, and mood have only rebounded _so much_ of what I had prior.

Hear me out- when I was a kid, I was identified as exceptionally intellectually gifted. Now, the label itself doesn't mean jack; the gifted child dilemma is one helluva recycled trope. At some point, the things that were previously easy to just us either become difficult, and we have to step up our efforts, or other people catch up. I'm not here to complain about how nowadays, I have to put in the time and effort to do well in my courses, or how I could read at a higher level when I was 5, so now it blows that my peers aren't lagging behind or retarded in comparison.

I'm bringing this up for two reasons. 

First, I've also got severe, severe anxiety (even prior to treating THC like it's water), and secondly, I've got pretty intense ADHD. Unfortunately, by virtue of me scoring 99th percentile everywhere and doing my best to mask these issues, they were overlooked by everyone, save for a few people who vehemently denied it (read: my immigrant parents, both of whom fit the ADHD profile to a tee). Moreover, weed isn't exactly the drug of choice for someone with an executive functioning disorder. 

Second, my intelligence manifested as a little more than a high reading level. While my peers were identified as gifted, I was unfortunately identified as exceptionally gifted. I had an exceptional grasp of language, extremely precise visual and episodic memory, and a very strong grasp of math and logic.

These days, it feels like mental scar tissue has covered that up- much like smelling something when you've got a cold, there is a suspicious absence of certain cues in my mind that gave me my edge. I can't ""picture"" or ""hear"" things in my mind to any comparable degree, forget what I'm doing all the time, and have also lost what felt like my guiding intuition. Math and language are no longer natural to me (the silver lining here is that my people skills and public speaking have shot through the roof), and thinking analytically feels like some distant, hazy dream. Generally, I feel like an overly-observant klutz.

Like I mentioned earlier, I've been abstaining for almost a year now. Obviously, 2020 has given everyone's sanity a hard time, but I'm pretty sure that attributing the deafening mental silence in my mind to that would be a mistake.

I'm at a loss for what to do, honestly. It feels as if I've steadily flipped a few switches in my mind off from 16-19, and they're never coming back (or coming back sufficiently). Obviously, I've got some mental health issues that I'm working through, but I don't know what to do about this. I can't un-smoke those joints and un-hit those dabs. 

I'm doing my best to move forwards, but I feel pretty intense guilt over my decisions back then and regret over what would've been different had I chosen to wait just a little longer (from what I've read, abstinence until 18 is good, abstinence until even later is great, although infrequent use won't have marginal impact on most people). I struggle with realizing that I've changed my cognitive abilities for the worse when I work on things I've been doing for ages (coding, math, reading, music) and notice that the spark I had is just, well, gone.

I'm not entirely sure what to do from here. Any advice & support from you all would be greatly appreciated. Lord knows I won't be getting it elsewhere. Thanks.",3
2020-12-06 14:30:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/k8098v/lessons_from_a_relapse/,Lessons from a relapse,"Hey all. Coming back from a two week relapse today. I am bipolar and my addiction to weed is so severe that I managed to convince myself that I’m not bipolar just so I could start smoking again. Along with that, I quit my meds because they interact poorly with the weed. So for two weeks I was off my meds and on a psychoactive substance and, let me tell you, it was BAD.

I became stupid. I stopped having meaningful conversations with my partner. I restarted the daily process of coming up high with the weed and then sinking into the lowest possible depression you can imagine as soon as it wore off. Like agonizing, someone-just-died depression, almost like grief. Within days, I couldn’t get out of bed. I stopped cleaning the house. Weed was my only reprieve from the agony and every day, it did less and less for me and I needed more to get by.

I smoked this morning, had a panic attack, and then threw the weed away. I went to the hospital but they wouldn’t admit me because I’m not suicidal so now I’m home in bed, reading leaves posts to give myself the strength I need to stay off the shit.

I’m frustrated that I have to go through the cravings all over again after four months of sobriety. Does anyone have advice on how to make the cravings more manageable? I don’t want to pull a raccoon and go digging through the trash because I’m fiending. I want to do this for real because now I’ve played the tape through and saw what happens when I give into what I think I want. And how do you deal with the shame of relapse? Is there a way to see it as part of the path to recovery? In a way, it was a huge wake up call for me after months of glamorizing my relationship with weed to rationalize using it. I saw very quickly how badly it can ruin things.

The reality is that weed isn’t good for my mental health and I’m going to have to swallow that pill if I want any sort of longterm stability. If anyone has advice for getting thorough these first few days of pain and regret and cravings, I am all ears.

Save yourself the drama and suffering and don’t relapse.",1

Just wanted to say thank you to this community for helping me get through the last few months, and give a reminder to everybody just starting their journey that it does get better. 

It’s totally worth sticking out the hard days cause weed won’t solve any of our problems, only delay acting on them.

2020-12-06 14:01:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/k7zpbn/halt_this_week_was_hard/,HALT; this week was hard,"Howdy everyone. Day 20 here, first post in r/leaves. I've tried to quit countless times before and I'm committed to making it stick this time. I started a new job and committed to quitting the day I started, 11/16. I started both the job and quitting weed with such high hopes and ideals and honestly, I've been steadily feeling more and more down since starting both.

I know that quitting is worthwhile, I know that each day without weed is a day of progress and a day towards a great future, I know that at the end of my 9-month service term with this new job I'll receive and education award that I'm hoping to use towards law school. I know that this job will undoubtedly set me up for amazing opportunities. I am deeply, deeply grateful to have a job at all right now.

But I still have cravings and it's just been, so, so hard this week. I have a troubled history with weed, leaning on it *heavily* a few years ago when I was suicidal and misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder. I leaned on it when I was slogging through college and working in kitchens and commuting to classes and not sleeping enough. I leaned on it over the summer when the pandemic gutted the job market and I felt stuck working in my grocery store job. It was an easy way to pass the time when I got home after my closing shifts and couldn't fall asleep, couldn't unwind from work jitters. It was a way to keep the ambition and anxiety quiet, to silence that nagging voice saying ""*Is this really where you want to be in your life? Is this an industry you can tolerate? What's going to happen with that bachelor's you worked so hard for?""*

I've had to repeat this mantra of HALT this week: Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired. If you want to smoke when you're feeling any of these things, it's a bad idea, it's a no-go. I've been feeling really lonely and insufficient in my new job; it feels like every aspect of job and workplace has been SO frustrating. I crave the connection, warmth, and love I received from my old coworkers and it's no coincidence that I've also been craving to smoke up, fire up some netflix, and house a bag of takis. I miss the routine, I miss the feeling of melting into the abyss. I miss not having to reckon with or face the reality that the only person that's gonna get me out of any hole of indifference is me, and that's not gonna happen while stoned.

I've posted on here a few times, you all know the classic todays the day, that's it cold turkey.. Blah blah..

Well it's finally happened! I've been a heavy smoker for 15 years plus now, I felt like I couldn't function with out having weed, put all my money into it, would rather buy weed than food, ran up over £3000 on tick with dealers! Was insane and so consuming of my life and I couldn't even see that!

I actually stopped 13 days ago now.. Not a lot I know but for me it's been a rough 13 days, I did 4 days off my own back, then got admitted to hospital, been here 9 days now, not allowed to go out. It has been a blessing for sure!

First few days was easy I found, but then the dreams came back with a vengeance, so vivid and intense, I initially was happy to be actually dreaming properly again.. Then came the nightmares, and god damn they were rough, admittedly they were brought on by going cold turkey but more the emotions and feelings I've surpressed over the years with weed.. But last night was the easiest so far..

Here are the things I have to report:

1. Nausea, sweating - full blown with these symptoms.


2. Insomnia - not so bad. Trouble falling asleep but some decaf tea, hot shower and reading instead of being on my phone in bed has helped a lot.


3. I feel like My Self today more than I have since I first sobered up from alcohol 7 years ago. Clear headed and motivated. 


4. I feel energetic but not too anxious. Keeping the caffeine intake low and being sure to take my meds every day.


5. I know there will be worse days and more intense symptoms to come but just for today I will enjoy the progress and be my own personal cheerleader. I also know I have support here when those days arrive.

.

The green world is always watching

Tempting me into it

If I resist long enough

Temptations wither

If I give in

It consumes me

.

Bright days are always shining

But in the green world

A darkness hovers above

Gloomy its outlook

And damning its consequences

It is the heaven of the bright stars I'm after

But sometimes I become lost without light

.

Others seem to help guide my way

But it is I who ultimately will have to pay

It wasn't until recently I choose my days

To cast the darkness of the green world away

.

It calls me still

After my work it asks to give me a reward

During my stresses it offers up resolve

Boredom passes and it wants to play its games

But I know now

I know not to heed its whispers

I know to simply let it pass like the wind

Mindful of its constant re-approach

Keeping my mind

Without temptation

Delivered from evil

I pass through the valley of the light

Protected by my third eyes inner sight

.

So now I go about each morning and evening

Not much to say really, the time simply goes as it pleases

I work now, where before I faltered

I keep good health now, where before I let illness fester

Sleep brings its full rejuvenation powers

Everything in good portion and balance

For the green world is no longer to be seen

Or heard

And so on

Only I and the sober mind

It is without, that I become truly one of a kind

.

The words don't need to rhyme

I'm simply thankful for my new found time

Amen",4

2020-12-06 09:45:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/k7uy5l/my_unfortunate_experience_with_weed_induced/,My unfortunate experience with weed induced psychosis,"It’s been hard for me to accept how one incident has effected my life so drastically and the changes I’ve had to make as a result of it. It’s taken years for me to accept that I can’t smoke anymore without facing a great risk of losing my grip on reality and I still struggle with it sometimes.

Back in 2013, I enrolled in college in Seattle and left my boring hometown in Florida. I was ecstatic to be in a more progressive city and wanted to take advantage of everything it had to offer. Weed is legal there so I didn’t think anything of starting a daily habit since most my friends smoked and it made things more interesting initially. In high school I’d smoked socially and was only a casual user. But in Seattle I became a connoisseur. 

Things were fine at first; my friends and I would smoke before going to concerts, hiking trips, and anything else that stimulated the senses. I didn’t think anything of my increasing use because it was socially acceptable and it was just what people did in my circle. But before long, the couple blunts a day became frequent dabs, and it was taking more and more to get the same effects.

As time went on, I began struggling more in school. I hated having to take so many prerequisite classes and didn’t feel like I fit in well on campus. Most of my friends lived in apartments in the city and didn’t go to school, and I started loathing going to class more and more. The campus atmosphere was pretty strict compared to the city, and I spent barely any time there.

The more I ramped up my consumption, the more agitated I became when I wasn’t dabbed out. I started getting this pins and needles feeling when I’d sit still sober, like my head was on fire. My mood was getting more and more unstable to the point that I’d snap at people if they looked at me wrong and I’d yell at myself constantly. I needed more and more wax each day to avoid going postal.

By the end of the year, I was so burnt out that I decided to go home for the summer. This ended up being a big mistake as my dad really gave me a hard time for smoking so much; this compounded the stress and before long things were getting more out of hand.

I began having feels of derealization which was likely a stress response. Weed really exacerbated it and I started having nonsensical thoughts as I became less and less sane. Eventually something just popped and I totally lost my grip on reality, choosing to live in a fantasy land when I could no longer face myself. It requires two weeks in the psych hospital and lots of anti psych drugs to bring me back. The experience was traumatic to say the least.

I didn’t want to blame it on weed, but when the same thing happened a couple years later resulting in another hospital stay, I had to accept what it was doing to me. It took a lot of time in psych wards for me to accept that weed doesn’t work with my brain chemistry and it’s hard to stay abstinent. But I needed to give it up in order to have a life.",104

Yes, I'm seeing multiple doctors at this point but they don't know what's wrong until I see a gastroenterologist. And covid test result is coming tomorrow but it doesn't seem likely to be that at this point.

On top of this I feel like nothing really makes me happy anymore. No drive to do anything. Feeling too weak to exercise since I can't eat much at all.

Still having anxiety, shortness of breath and racing heart coming and going throughout the day to the point where I'm laying in bed trying to sleep and I'm terrified I'm going to have a heart attack or stop breathing or something.

Feel calmer when I'm around other people but still get weird breathing.

I cry pretty easily. My body refuses to let me sleep more than 4 or 5 hours so I'm up alone every night fighting with panic and the urge to go to the ER.

Idk if the 8mg of edible I took on the 28th screwed me up again but this is the most scared I've ever been about my health.

I found this subreddit completely by accident at 4am one year ago today and it honestly changed my life.

I will never forgot what one person wrote: ""wanting to be high when I'm sober, but be sober when I'm high"" that just stuck right in my brain. I was so numb and disconnected from my thoughts I couldn't even articulate that feeling.

Before then I could barely manage a day or so without but being present in this community, sharing my story, supporting and being supported by others is what made all the difference. I couldn't have done it without you. 

Thank you to everyone here and to r/leaves. This community is a beautiful place, the kindness and support is incredible. We all deserve so much more than being numb yet anxious, lathargic and content with being senselessly bored. We deserve better and it starts with reclaiming your mind again.

Last night was tough, tears, dopamine withdrawals, the works. But I made it. I fell asleep involuntarily, exhausted and spent.

But today, I woke up with strength and purpose.

The money I used to use on my daily 3.5grams of pot instead went to my girlfriend's daughter.

Over the last 5 years of knowing her, her daughters been so shy and nervous around me.

But today?

We took her to the pool, we helped her overcome her lifelong fear of submerging underwater,
She, a 6 year old, looked me in the eyes and said how safe she feels.

Little does she know 4 days ago, I wouldn't have been capable of leaving the house for more then 30 minutes.

Then as a reward for conquering, what was for her, an impossibly terrifying task,
I used my usual drug-alotted money on taking her to the cinemas.
We lucked out and got the whole viewing room to ourselves and I got to just vibe with this wonderful little girl who finally, FINALLY opened up to me. Who trusted me.

4 days ago, I wasn't strong enough for even myself.
Today, I was strong enough for the family I intend to build.

I've never felt so accomplished.
I know tonight will have pain, anxiety and will be tough,
But today? I found purpose without drugs.

You will too. In your own way, with your own people in your own life.
You will find that strength.
Don't be afraid. I promise you, its worth it.

Good luck reader ❤",42

But here I am laying in bed at 3:32 AM, because what else do you do in the first 3 weeks, something dawned on me. I've been doing a lot of flip flopping mentally, going from ""this is great and I'm glad I'm doing this"" to ""alright a couple days was enough I should smoke again all I needed was a break"" to ""oh my god that's so sad that I can't make it a week without trying to justify getting high again."" In this series of thoughts I was thinking about people in my life who are going to still smoke, people who never even think about quitting or adverse effects for a second, and how jealous I feel of that. I started wondering if maybe I could live like that (lol I have tried and cannot be a healthy daily smoker) and eventually my thoughts lead to a question: what would I get out of continued use? So I consulted reddit with various phrasing of ""benefits of smoking pot long term"" or ""people who still smoke pot..."" and couldn't really find anything. I did browse trees and (saying this without judgment, more so reflection) saw a lot of justifying and collective bullshitting. Fuck man I read a thread of someone trying to convince their mom to smoke with them and all the comments were mostly variations of ""lucky mine kicked me out for smoking what a bitch"" or ""i smoke everyday with my parents and love it."" I 100% could've avidly participated in that convo a few months ago. What I saw when I read that was this veil of self medicating and denying what daily drug use really is, addiction. I can list benefits that I whole heartedly believe in when it comes to not smoking pot the way I was (or at all in my case), but for the opposite there's just ""i dunno I get bored and it makes things more fun."" On the inverse I can list all the things I stand to lose from the way I was living, and only superficial, surface level things for what I would ""lose"" if I quit. I know this is messy but it all just dawned on me also sorry I'm on mobile.

TL;DR: I have plenty to gain from a substance free life, and not much to gain from getting high everyday; I also will lose a lot from continuing my abuse, and nothing that matters from quitting.",19
2020-12-06 03:02:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/k7pq3f/7_weeks_free/,7 weeks free,"Hey guys, first time posting but a long time follower. Yesterday i made it to 7 weeks without smoking, next week is 2 months. This is the longest i have gone without weed in 9 years. It feels like an awesome accomplishment but I can’t help but feel like I’m not out of the woods yet. I still think about smoking, though the frequency of cravings is less and less as time goes on. I keep thinking “maybe a sesh this weekend, I’ve done so good, it wont hurt” etc etc.

I just wanna encourage anyone who is thinking about it but don’t feel like they’re there yet. For real, you have to keep trying. I used to think about quitting all the time, but couldn’t go 24 hours without smoking. I used to think i had no hope in quitting. If you’re anything like me, the thought of running out and not getting on used to make me so anxious that I’d need to secure some just to feel calm again. It’s a shit feeling, but honestly the decision to quit was harder than quitting itself.

If i can offer any advise at all (and i know everyone’s needs are different), it’s this:

- keep busy. Don’t stop coming up with things to do. See family. Go for walks. Catch up with friends who don’t smoke (i bet it’s been a while). Being bored is the biggest problem i faced when trying to quit.

- say goodbye to friends who smoke. Even if just for a little while. It sucked, and i still feel bad, but if it takes cutting ties to stay sober, it’s worth it. 

As far as productivity goes, i feel maybe only slightly better. But that’s not the reason i want to keep going. I am finally fucking free. No more sitting at work counting down the hours til i could sesh. No more cancelling plans cos i wanna stay home and smoke instead. No more missing out on seeing family cos i wanna stay home and smoke. My weekends are totally free and i can do whatever i like cos im not trapped in a room smoking weed. I didn’t know this would be what i loved most about being sober but it is now. Weed doesn’t own me anymore. Im not a slave and i have control over my own life. 

Goodluck. You got this.",12

On my way there I realized that the old me who was a daily smoker was starting to emerge again and decided to drive home instead. 

I recently had a ~33 day streak that ended early November. Since then I've been smoking about every other day but this week has been almost every day. I'm contemplating throwing away my kit now and quitting for good. This will be the second time that I do that. The previous time I threw out my kit, lasted about a month before I repurchased the entire kit and got into smoking again. I realize now though that I wasn't doing anything different with my life, still had my same time wasting habits and I couldn't really deal with the boredom.

I think if I'm going to throw out my kit and quit I need to start doing things that challenge me and stimulate me in a positive, productive way. Lately the only stimulation I've been having has been being glued to social media and YouTube. No wonder I've been feeling so depressed lately... Time has been melting away and when I look back I don't have anything that I'm proud of. I'm not living up to my potential and weed is one of the things that is holding me back.

I was so proud of myself to have gotten through all of quarantine so far without a hit of weed or a sip of liquor. 

A few weeks ago, I had been fighting another round of intense cravings to get high. It doesn’t come about when i’m sad, more so when i’m bored or tense. I just kind of forgot why I wanted to be sober and justified it to myself saying that there is nothing wrong with letting loose now and then.

I smoked 3 times since then. Only one hit from a bowl since my tolerance is so low and I hate feeling too high (my dad’s weed I smoked not my own), and let me tell you: It totally sucked. The feeling of being calm didn’t feel nearly as nice as I remembered it, and I really didn’t like how hard it was to think straight. Instead of focusing on movies and getting lost in their worlds, I just got caught in obsessive thought loop after thought loop.

I told myself never again after the first lapse. Two days later, I craved it again and smoked another hit. Same shit. Ten days later, another hit, and a night without rest, and here I am. I felt so horribly groggy this morning. Almost like I had the flu. And was mentally awake the entire night. The high wasnt even good. And honestly that’s what I had confused me the most: Why was I still wanting to get high even after the highs had sucked? 

I’ve come to realize today, still coming out of my fog, that addiction isn’t something that leaves you. My old habits and coping skills are trying to leach back into my present day life. But I am not that same person I was. The high doesnt relieve me the way it did. And I am longing for that same feeling. Now I have to mourn the fact that this is not only an addiction I need to ensure I stop, but that it’s not one that will likely ever serve me like it did again. The silver lining is that I had been sober so long that I know for a fact the sober parts of my life when pleasant, however infrequent those pleasant moments may be, are still better than the best of best highs that I could ever have with pot or any other substance.

I have smoked pretty much everyday for the last 6 years. I smoke because it took away my anxiety. I smoke because I liked the way it felt. I smoke because it made me comfortable in social situations. I smoke because it helps me collect my thoughts. All these excuses I have been telling myself over the years I now realise are bullsh*t. 

It gives me anxiety, I feel like shit, I avoid social situations or come home early to smoke and there are no thoughts to collect in the first place. Now is the time to stop.

But I know it doesn't work like that and then that depresses me. The mood swings are unlike anything I've ever experienced, which is saying something since I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The whole reason I decided to quit was because my depression was getting out of hand and smoking no longer helped me escape it. My tolerance was too high and when I'd smoke, I'd just think about how I'm running out and I'm wasting my money and I'm broke as it is. I also felt as if something was off. Maybe I smoked myself into psychosis, maybe it was the meds I was taking for various mental health concerns, but I knew the weed wasn't helping.

Anyway, my lack of motivation has been insane. I hardly can go to work, I've already called in a couple of times, and I'm only working 30 hours a week. My apartment is a fucking mess, it's never been this bad and it's depressing to look at it, yet the thought of cleaning it fills me with this anxiety and before, I'd just smoke before I did anything that gave me anxiety and just power through it, but now I have nothing to help me power through it. I want to smoke sooo bad but I'm not even afraid of breaking because I don't even have the motivation to reach out to a dealer, it fills me with this massive anxiety.

I guess I'm just hoping that this anxiety and depression and negative outlook on life will pass. I keep telling myself it will but it doesn't help my psyche. I made a suicide video today, then by the end of it realized that I wouldn't kill myself, no way in hell, but that made me more depressed. But the kicker is that earlier today at work, I felt so happy and I was thinking about how I was gonna get all this stuff done when I got home, then I got home, watched Netflix, surfed the web, didn't get anything done but everything just made me more sad. Am I going crazy? Is this my new life without weed? I've only been smoking for 2 years, I ""quit"" in December of last year for and stayed sober for 2.5 months, life was good, then life got bad and I started smoking my problems away.

I’ve decided to quit today....it’s been a long time coming and I’m finally ready to take the plunge. I started about a year and a half ago to deal with my sleeping issues and anxiety & I’ve been using everyday since. 

I never saw it as a problem before as I was only using it at night and was able to still function through the day. As you know, the side effects started creeping in.....started spending my nights and weekends bingeing on movies/tv shows, spending hours on video games, munching excessively, lost motivation for social interactions which isolated me from friends and family, horrible mood swings (came depending on what strain I would be using at the time). Pretty much became completely content with “boredom”.

I guess you could say I “woke” up to my reality a couple weeks ago & Ive been hating it ever since. I want to change, I want to improve. I don’t want to feel alone in this anymore, I’ve been hiding it from my family because I’m ashamed I’ve let myself get to this point.

Insomnia, low appetite, and some cravings were present, but overall it was easier than it's ever been for me as a perpetual quitter. My days were busy and relaxing and by the end of day 6 I was feeling confident. Then the pernicious thoughts began scurrying along the inside of my skull, telling me I was already ""healed"" and could handle a joint upon my return. Well, 5 consecutive smoking days later and I'm back to square one. I could have ridden the wave generated from cruising past the worst parts of withdrawal, but instead I let it smack me in the balls and now I'm vomiting into the ocean. 

If you have the opportunity to jumpstart any part of this process, fucking do it! Don't take any easy steps for granted and don't take the foot off the pedal. It's incredibly annoying to have to shut up the voice that says ""Actually, going to buy pre-rolls is GOOD."" every day AGAIN, but that's what I get. Got another cold turkey vacation in 2 weeks so I know that's at least something I can use to make this easier on ol' ADHD brain here.

Weed has always been my best friend since I was 16-17 (now almost 24), It’s made me anxious but i refused to quit smoking weed and my anxiety would usually disappear 10-20 minutes after smoking and I could enjoy the tail end of my high. Fast forward 3 years, pandemic hits basically unemployed for most of 2020 until I started doing manual labour (roofing), back breaking work but my boss was chill as f*ck and also the biggest chronic I’d ever met. So obviously I smoked with him all day at work, I would wake up at 6am go straight to my pipe rip a bowl, shower, make a smoothie and drink it on the way to work and continue to blaze 4-5 joints to myself until the moment I went to bed. I was the happiest I’d ever been, smoking the most I ever had and my anxiety was practically non-existent. This is where things take a turn, I woke up 3 weeks ago, regular morning smoked my bowl, had a shower made a smoothie but it was raining so work was put off for a few hours. My boss called me unexpectedly and said he needed me to be there ASAP so I rushed over but it caused me to immediately go into a state of panic. Got to work, didn’t feel better so I smoked another joint (bad call it amplified the effect x10) it was so bad that I was getting blurred vision and felt like I couldn’t breathe. Initially thought I had Covid 19, got tested, I don’t - great.. but my breathing occasionally feels short and my mind races to the worst thoughts, so I stopped smoking so much as I thought it was the cause of my breathing shortening up. The other day I was having a panic attack or breathing episode and ended up on Reddit reading about people suffering from withdrawal symptoms from marijuana something i thought was impossible... but many people said they had a drastic improvement in their anxiety and depression after 2-3 weeks no weed. So I’ve stopped completely, this is day three 100% sober and I have my moments, I definitely don’t feel as anxious but it’s so hard for me to enjoy some of the things that were made me absolutely love, like eating, playing video games, being social, I just don’t feel like me without it. Is this normal? Does anyone have any pointers? Have you experienced similar things?! Any advice or relations to my experience would help me a lot, and I would so appreciate it.",2

I was sooo tired yesterday by 8:30 pm I fell asleep but was back awake by 10 pm tossing and turning all night. Have had this migraine for 2 days now. I’m starting to feel so nauseous. 

I had several things to do today that required me to be human so I put some make up on and a smile and have just been pushing through it but man I hope it subsides tomorrow... I never have headaches so I know it’s the withdraw. I have also unfortunately been bound up and just feel overall crumby. From reading here smoking messes with the biome of our gut so I’m not surprised. Trying to up my probiotics but it’s hard to drink kefir when you have no appetite! 

I am sooo looking forward to this passing. Just posting is keeping me busy and preoccupied. Thankfully my boyfriend’s daughter is over so it gives me something to focus on and there would be no chance for me to spark up with her here. 

It’s not even 6 pm and I just want to crawl into bed but I know I need to wait or I’ll never sleep tonight. 

Hope you all are having a much better Saturday than myself lol",2

Nice to see a group of people so supportive and helpful of each other, rather than just saying 'weed isn't addictive'.

As the title says, I smoked daily (mostly carts) for about two and a half years, and for the last year I was also vaping nicotine from a juul competitor. Had a big panic attack late at night on Oct 28th and decided to quit both of them cold turkey. Since then, I've had intermittent anxiety that just makes me very uncomfortable. It doesn't get in the way of my life, but it is very distracting and frustrating to feel like I can't get comfortable, even on my days off or when I don't have anything I need to do/worry about. I went to my Dr to tell her about it, and she gave me a prescription for if I have another severe attack, but really I'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience. How long did it take for the anxiety to subside for you? Particularly interested in how you felt in between 30-90 days sober",1

I’m done, threw everything in the trash and don’t intend on looking back (unless I’m back in an Amsterdam coffee shop again) it hasn’t consumed my professional or financial life.. but rather it’s transformed into this spineless; you can march all over me I have no self respect, kind of person.. Im an optimistic, float down river kind of guy, but cannabis makes me just not give a shit about my health, my daily routine, my relationships. Mentally I am working with a therapist, life has thrown me curveballs and I used cannabis to suppress a lot of those The older I became, but my questions for you guys are related to withdrawal symptoms. Im sweating Bullets, getting waves of body chills, no appetite, can only seem to drink coffee & water my gut can’t handle any juice/milk. I’ve found a nice warm shower helps, but only for a short while. Any suggestions?  It’s been about a week now. All are appreciated, thank you.

The first night was utter depressing. Barely could sleep and getting angry over the littlest things made me aggravated and just about fed up. I wanted to just give up like I usually do and go take a puff. I don’t what it is but now for some reason I feel like some sort of weight that’s being lifted is finally happening but after so long it doesn’t even seem worth it. The demons came back stronger than ever after 4 years of constantly smoking. Not having a job or going to school is making me pissed off because my mind is still in get high mode. I abused it and now I have to deal with the after effects. I don’t even know what to do/ I don’t even know who I am anymore. My friends told me this might last about 10-15 days but I know that if that’s the case I’d rather die right now than face that obstacle head on. I’m so stupid I can’t believe I let myself get out of hand and now there’s not one therapist that’s not booked due to covid. My family constantly keep on saying that I’m a loser for smoking and that I have no future or goals. F*** it really sucks knowing your on your own and the pain, regret and anguish is utter defining. I’m so jealous that all my friends and other people can smoke and not let it ruin their lives but use it to even enhance it. Making poor choices I guess is what I’m best at. Worst part is I secretly hate myself for giving it up at this stage in life while all my friends are graduating from college and on their ways to getting jobs. My 24th birthday is coming up and I feel so defeated/exhausted at this point of life. I guess I continued smoking for that long because of all the people that called me a loser and I guess I let them get in my head. What’s the use? 


Edit: it’s been almost 2 weeks and I can’t begin to say how it’s been awesome being able to remember things, read books and not fall into a daze/fantasy, and even just make conscious decisions without even trying to get high first so I could enjoy it.",5

Lying. It took me a while to realize this, but to me, weed feels like lying. When I was interacting with sober people while I was high, I felt like I was lying to them. I had to pretend to be normal, so I naturally felt like I was lying to them. But later, even when I was smoking with my friends, I felt like I was portraying someone who wasn't myself. The common effects of self-consciousness and light dissociation added to this as well. Later, I discovered a tweet by Naval Ravikant which read ""The more secrets you have, the less happy you're going to be."" Such simple advice, but it is so true. No matter the positive aspects of weed, including the secrecy, it was causing me to be unhappy overall. Because more weed meant more lying. Lying to other people, lying to my parents, and lying to myself that I wasn't addicted.

Peter Pan. The boy who never grew up. The important part of the story is that it is fictional. We all have to grow up at some point, leave Neverland, and face our problems head on, because that is the only way to achieve real growth. Growing up can be hard to accept. Sometimes I tried to get high enough that I felt like a little kid again, like I was diving into a pool of nostalgia, trying to touch the bottom. Weed had the ability to act as a portal for me to reach into the blissful feelings of my childhood, so quitting weed meant accepting the fact that that chapter of my life had concluded. Which brings me to my last point.

Last night i went to a friend's house to see some friends for the first time since quitting and honestly i was scared and apprehensive about seeing them. I knew they'd be smoking all night and i knew I'd be tempted to smoke. I was kinda worried about how they'd react to me quitting and wasnt sure if they'd be supportive or not.

Turns out i had nothing to worry about, i kept my resolve, said no when they offered and they were a little surprised but understanding. Some told me they'd tried to quit in the past and we had a really good conversation about it all. We had a few beers and even then i didnt feel the need to smoke. I guess i thought that not smoking would somehow make the evening less fun or I'd feel like the odd one out but it honestly made no difference whatsoever. I was still hanging out with my friends, doing what we always do and that's all that matters.

I've smoked for so long now that it just became a daily habit. Doesn't help that every boyfriend I've had either grew/sold weed too. I love weed and it's healing properties, but needed to quit smoking due to my lung/heart health and my dependency on it. Especially this year. I lost my job in March because of covid (worked in the event industry) and this pandemic has made my anxiety sky rocket. Lost my health insurance so no doctor or therapy anymore. I would smoke, vape and dab everyday all day this year. The last few months, every time I smoked I'd have heart palpitations and my anxiety would make them even worse. Freaked me out, especially since I have asthma and definitely shouldn't be smoking during this respiratory illness floating around. So, 3 days in, and I feel pretty good. Yesterday I felt extremely emotional and couldn't sleep. Today was good though. I just need to stick with this. Hope you all are feeling well too.",20

And when I finally was calm, I was usually too stoned to be productive. Forced to stay alone in my apartment watching TV and forgetting everything I just watched. Turning down 90% of the offers I had to go out and do something enjoyable. And whenever I did go out, I desperately tried to act like I was sober. 

What a stupid way to live. 

I quit many times, only to say to myself ""I can have a smoke tonight, I've been good!"" And that one was always too much, I always felt worse afterwards. I never enjoyed it like I thought I would. And then came the chaser effect, I needed an endless amount of weed after that first hit in order to feel better, craving the next joint before the current one was even finished. 

These days I'm enjoying my sobriety more than ever, and for one main reason. I've reinterpreted my cravings as nervous agitation, instead of saying ""I need a joint"" Now I say ""I need some rest/meditation/better sleep/food, exercise etc whatever it happens to be in that moment that my body is asking for. The point is, I listen to my body now and have developed many ways to keep it happy, instead of just shutting it up with another blaze.

However I decided in the lead up to my 30th birthday, I wanted to see just how many good habits I could instill and how many bad habits I could cut out. I went cold turkey on quitting smoking, and I had quit for a long period before after smoking regularly, so I knew some of the side effects (sweaty hands, coughing up phlegm with brown flecks, vivid dreams), and I certainly experienced them, but I never had the extreme mood swings like I experienced last night and early today.

The timeline is like this: I quit a little over two weeks ago, but leading into thanksgiving, I figured I'd use my remaining ABV to make cannabutter as a last hurrah to go with my thanksgiving meal alone (family is several states away in Florida, don't want to risk infection and transfer).  Well, last night, exactly a week later... I was just so fucking moody. I was overwhelmed with emotion. I was irritated, angry, thinking of all kinds of things that made me mad or sad, I could feel tears at the edge of my eyes... and the feeling continued into today, just such heavy emotions that I could recognize, in the moment, that this was more than just me having a bad day. But my question is: Is this the kind of mood swings you experienced? And will I likely be experiencing more in the coming weeks? I feel fine and relaxed now, but god... That was an intense few hours. I am generally an even-keel person so it was just way outside the ordinary for me.",7

As I go about my day

I feel so over-stressed, 

I sense my unjust anger, and 

it makes me more depressed. 

During conversation 

when I try to keep my cool,

I see I got defensive, and 

know I am the fool.


Im the fool for thinking that

I knew what i was doing. 

""Its just a stress reliever, and

theres nothing that im losing.""

I didnt know my ego

had gotten in my way.

This was my first lesson

on this rainy, fateful day. 


Frustration of these feelings,

short and long regret; 

Things we should learn from,

lest that we forget. 

If we choose to just stay numb,

the world will keep on going;

The day that you have died, though,

is the day that you stopped growing. 


In the pursuit of pleasure,

you feel that you are free; 

But freedom has a price

when youre a slave to your own deeds.

I have been thinking on and off about quitting for a while, but never took it seriously with myself. When it comes down to it, I always thought I knew that I would simply just rather get high. But yesterday, I officially decided to quit for good after realizing I've been experiencing mental blocks. I then had this epiphany.

The best high anybody could ever possibly have has to be when you know that you don't need any substance that alters your already current state. Knowing that there is nothing you could rely on that would make the moment and your mindset better. Being sober, yet so naturally high off life, you do not wish for any other change in the world.

I know this is easier said than done, and man do I have a difficult yet exciting journey ahead of me. I must replace all that time I spend smoking weed with being productive. Deep down I know this is one of the most important decisions I will have ever made.

It's been about 3.5 days now.  This is my second time making a significant effort to quit.  It feels a little easier this time and at the moment I'm really just thinking 'why didn't I stick to it the first time'?

In any case, like last time, my withdrawal symptoms are pretty tame.  I do notice a lack of appetite (it's 1:30pm and I haven't eaten yet.. but about to), and I seem to have dropped a few pounds over the last few days due to not eating a ton of munchies right before bed everyday.  I have been having some trouble sleeping, but no more than an hour or 2 in bed before I can doze off.  

I haven't gotten any real cravings yet.  I realize that can change at any time, and if history provides some insight, tonight and the weekend might be the first time I encounter the struggle.

I'll be holding tight!  I have no plans tonight so I'll continue to keep myself busy with hobbies and maybe a video game.  I have made plans with friends tomorrow, they must think something is wrong with me cause I usually do everything I can to stay home all weekend, stoned the whole time, by myself.  I will go visit my dad as well on Sunday, he recently got a cancer diagnosis (another reason I am quitting) and I don't want to live with regrets that I was too busy getting high to spend time with my dad (even if he has his own problems with alcohol).

Background timeline, very simplified:
Age 16 - start smoking daily. 

Age 18 - start selling weed which enables me to smoke more since it's free. 

Age 19 - start doing party drugs every weekend. Smoke all the time. 


Age 21 - ease up on party drugs, start smoking even more. Still selling loads. 

Age 22 - start growing, smoking probably 10 grams per day at this point. 

Age 24 - party drugs are no more, only coke maybe one every two Months. Still heaps of weed. 

Age 25 - I get a daughter with someone I don't even know, she turned out to be a crazy person. She knocked on my door one day, 6 months pregnant and revealed I was going to be a father. 


I do my duty, I take responsibility. I buy a house in the woods with her (my parents bought the house for me) I take care of my child. I love her. 


Age 26 - several surgeries due to athletic injuries, get hooked on oxy, also smoking 10-15 grams per day. 


Age 27 - I'm a ghost. I lost all friends. I don't think anymore. My brain is mush. I'm dead. 


Age 28 - I can't take it anymore. My daughter is my everything and I need to change. Quit oxy, it's hell, it left me with permanent brain damage (central apnea) my brain doesn't send signals for my lungs to breathe unless im actively telling them to) haven't slept more than a couple of hours in a row, in almost 2 years at the moment I'm writing this. 

I leave the toxic mother of my child. I have custody. 

I apply for firefighter (a life long dream of mine) school three times and despite the extremely hard demands I make it. 

Age 29, right now:
I smoke Maybe 2 gram per day, only at night unless I'm off work and My daughter goes to see her mother or grandparents. 

Im 1 year from finishing school and I just received notice that I'm 1 out of 12 people of 2000+ applicants that will get a job in my city this year. 

To get this job I have to do a physical, which is tomorrow. I also have to leave a urine sample, which I've never done before and I didn't know until 4 days ago. Now I'm about to sneak a friend's urine in to a authorial(?) building to try to cheat. 

If I don't get this job, the next chance might never come. Only about 10% of those who finish from my school get a job within 5 years. 

I feel like a fraud. I'm barley making it through school, I have to lie every day why I look tierd. I can't remember ANYTHING. I'm ashamed. 

My mind needs to be ready to accept or possibly suppress some things that happened in my life and weed for the most part has been my tool for it. 

My daughter, my parents, my old friends,  my teachers and coworkers, they all think I'm just tierd from exercising all the time, a habit I'm glad I've never lost, and from the apnea. 

I haven't been sober for 15 years. Now that I have to stop, I'm fearing everything I worked for will collapse. 

I fear losing the amazing friendship I have with my daughter. I fear losing myself due to a psychological break or suicide (had those thoughts before but never acted on). I fear losing my job. I fear who I am when I am sober. 


Tldr: 
I'm scared. I have noone to talk to. Been high for almost half my lifetime and now I have to stop. Fuck. I want to scream. Help.







Update:


The physical..
What happened today was something like out of really bad movie and it doesn't feel like it happened to me, but to someone else. I'll try to get the gritty details which made this so surreal. 

Ive packed 2, 75ml shampoo travel tubes with friends urine between my thighs. 

I arrive. Nervous as never before. 
The first thing they ask is if I brought the protocol of the endurance test we did a couple of weeks back. 

Shit . Was I supposed to bring this? Did I even get it from them? Did I smoke the memory away? My heart is beating so hard, I think I'm done already. I call everyone I know at the station, no one picks up. Shit shit shit. 

""we'll see how we handle this"" the nurses says. 
""first we start with a drug test"" 

We go to the toilet. 
""we must stand here and watch you, it's protocol"" 
Fuck. I know if they see me it's all over. School, work, my reputation, police report since it is a felony to use someone else's sample. 

I'm literally shaking, pulse is way over 150.
Somehow I manage to open one of the containers between my thighs and pour it in the collector jar without they noticing. 

I ask if it is enough, I say I'm nervous and never peed in front of someone before. 
They says ""probably not, but I'll try to fill the tubes "" 

With a 0.0001% margin, it's enough. 
How am I this lucky? 

Next is eyesight and hearing. 
I smell the pee from the open bottle between my legs, it makes me nauseous and nervous. How did they not notice? 

Next is a full body exam. 
FULL BODY? Double shit. 

When the doctor is pressing my stomach I say I need to use the bathroom real quick. 
I go and i hide the tubes on a removable plate on the roof. 

I get back and he pulls down the top of my pants to press my groin and lower stomach to look for pain. How was I this lucky? 

Then ekg. 
The amount of effort they asked for (building up to maximum heart rate slowly) on that bike was more than I thought and the tubes would certainly have fell out of my shorts if they were still there.
Lucky again. 

A person knocks on the door. 
I think that the nurses actually saw me and called the cops. 
He enters and says: here are all the protocols for the applicants, we left them downstairs. 

Is this really luck at this point? 

After this they made additional tests with balance and such but nothing that would have blown my cover. 

I finish. Retrieve the tubes from bathroom and I get out of there. 

I can't believe what I just did. I'm so ashamed of my behavior. I don't even feel like it was me doing it while it happened but more like I was watching some moron execute the most stupid plan ever. But somehow he barley made it. 

I never. Ever. EVER. Want to feel this stupid again. The lying, the fear, the adrenaline, the anxiety. 

Even though it doesn't feel like it was me doing it, I feel sick thinking about my behavior today.  The memory of what happened is fading fast and all I feel is guilt. 

Im not a religious person but if there is any higher power, it had a plan for me today and I will try to remember that through my journey to sobriety.",38

About a year after quitting daily vodka chugging and cocaine snorting i decided i could handle weed. This basically immediately turned into a daily habit. At first I didn't think it was an issue - I wasn't lying, stealing, missing work and destroying relationships like I had with booze....it didn't seem to be doing any harm.

Fast forward 6 years and I have been struggling for a long time knowing I need to quit. Every day I think today will be the day but end up buying more weed. It is EXACTLY the same brain/thinking pattern that i experienced for years before finally going to treatment for alcohol.

I am in an extremely difficult medical program and have a son now - but even that isn't enough motivation. Turns out I have to do it for myself - just like all the other substances. I have put this off for far too long. I am ready for the nausea, the moodiness, the nightsweats and insomnia.

I am an addict. I cant do this anymore or keep lying to myself....the rationalizations are so sick.

Bring it on. I want sobriety. Real true sobriety. No more ""well this isn't as bad as before"" - I want to feel real life again.

Thanks for reading...any words of support are appreciated. One thing I know for sure from getting sober from other substances is I can NOT do this alone.",26

I’m feeling stronger each day. My head is clearing and I’m starting to get therapy from a lot of past trauma while serving. I want this and I need this.

I’m 25 years old and still working on my degree, weed was a set back but I don’t regret my use what’s so ever. It was a stage in my life and I’m healing from it, learning from it. I’m going to keep fighting everyday to maintain sobriety.

This subreddit has helped me realize that being the best version of yourself means investing the time and love into yourself. Weed was supplementing the love I wasn’t giving myself. Well now it’s time to finally love and accept who I am as a man.

You can and *will* do this!","I'm on day twenty-three of quitting, after six years of daily and excessive smoking.  I can remember vividly what the first day of quitting was like; Constant nausea, aches all over my body, anxiety like I've never experienced, generally feeling like I was always one step away from failing sobriety or a couple more from dropping dead. For the last three weeks of this process, I've had a couple of hospital trips, I'm getting \*terrible\* sleep because of the nightly trips to ""Crazy Dreams Land"", my diet has hit a wall, I'm terrified to drive my car without feeling like I'll vomit, and my heart rate rarely beats at a normal pace. Quitting has truly been a perpetual nightmare, of sorts.

I'm heading into my first full month of sobriety and while all of this shit feels like a never ending cycle, I've begun to reflect on the past and how much improvement I've made from the first day: The stomach pain has subsided. My thoughts are clearer and I'm mentally/emotionally alert. I'm now beginning to regain my appetite and eat bigger meals. I'm getting better at managing anxiety when it creeps into my mind. It feels like I'm meeting myself all over again. These things did not come easily and I'm not in the clear yet. I still can't drive my car or get a full night's sleep, and I've yet to have a full ""good day"". I can't tell you how many times I've had to fight with myself over the intrusive thoughts while trying to shower in the morning!

Despite the aforementioned improvements being tiny, they're improvements and I cannot emphasize to you enough, how important it is to do your absolute \*best\* to remember that the small victories matter. Three weeks ago, I was nowhere near this mind set because of how easy it was to get caught up in the feeling of hopelessness of being sober and healthy one day. It's still difficult for me and I'm not feeling great, but relatively speaking, I'm way better today than I was on any previous day of quitting.

Did you eat more today than you did yesterday? That's a W. 

Have you been able to get up today and walk a few more steps without anxiety? That's a W.

Were you able to open up a little more today and reflect more clearly on addiction? That's a W.

You have to keep telling yourself that each passing hour is one more hour away from where you were and one more towards where you're going. You've got to hammer home that the small victories count towards the big one. You \*will\* get there but you've got to want it. I'm really finding that motivating myself to keep moving forward is getting easier, even if it always feels minuscule.

Thank you to all the Redditors who've had the courage to post their stories and for commenting their own words of honesty and encouragement. This is truly a community that I feel a part of and I love you all.

The small victories count towards the big one! Keep going. You can and \*will\* do this.",7

I’m having trouble getting started and hoping to see things from a new perspective. It’s time I quit. I don’t smoke a lot (2-3 bowls a day) but it’s constant. I maintain a high throughout my whole day. Plus the stuff I get is straight farm to table and the quality is great. So it doesn’t take much. 

But I feel this need for it. This irrational need. So I change my thoughts and try to focus on other things. That’s when I start getting irritated then quickly angry. I’m not a physical person, but not smoking is the only time I want to hit things. 

Ok so change habits right? I get stuck in a loop of no motivation to do anything about it. I get all depressy and don’t do anything. 

Just wait it out? I have a six year old son that I raise as a single father. My family has all moved out of state. He literally has no one but me to rely on. Me and my salary that is just barely more than my bills. 

I want to manage it. I don’t drink or do anything else. I smoke and I like to smoke. But I know I need to drop it because of the addiction to it. Because it takes away from who I am and who I want to be as a father. 

I just don’t know how to get over the first intense hurdles. Is it really just willpower? If so, how do I make that stronger? If not, what’s the next best step?

Thank you for reading. :)",7
2020-12-04 08:43:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/k6l3vc/day_1_thoughts_concerns/,Day 1 - Thoughts + Concerns,"Hi everyone. I have been a marijuana smoker since I was 15 or 16 years old. I am now 27. Sometime throughout my 10+ years of partaking in marijuana I went from being a social stoner to someone who needs to be high morning, noon, and night and will do whatever it takes to get high. 

My husband and I bonded over the fact that we both smoked when we first got together, and he introduced me to spliffs (tobacco mixed with weed) which had become my main form of smoking for 3 years.

I decided I wanted to quit smoking weed a long time ago, years ago really, but it was always the case of ""I'll finish what I have now *and then* quit"" and then once I finished what I had I would buy more and the cycle would continue.  

This time around, I told myself I would ABSOLUTELY quit on December 1st without any excuses. Needless to say, it's 12/4 and today is my first day without weed or tobacco and it's only 7:45AM.  I have a few nicotine patches, so I have one of those on... but damn is the craving bad. 

Part of me just wants to rip into the supplies/stash left and roll one up right now. But, the clean taste in my mouth and not-red eyes are what are keeping me from giving in.  My husband is going to smoke until we run out of weed, and he seems pseudo-supportive. He would rather I give into smoking than be in an insanely crabby mood - but I wish he would see that overall, with time, I'll be less crabby/mood-swingy being off the tobacco and weed. I'm very nervous that when he gets home today he will roll up a spliff and I wont be able to resist it. But I need to. I just applied for two jobs I genuinely want so badly, and I don't want weed screwing up another thing in my life!!!! I wish I never tried it at all, sometimes. Although it did help me get through some pretty traumatic experiences in my life, I'm sure not relying on the weed will cause some undealt with emotions/memories to come bubbling to the surface again. It won't be easy for me, as I'm sure it's not easy for anyone. 

It's difficult, too, because we are stuck living with my mom and little brother (mom smokes cigs and brother smokes cigs+weed). We are mostly stuck here because of health issues I faced and had to leave my job, but I'm sure getting stoned and spending so much time and money on useless stuff isn't helping. I beg my husband to help me do whatever we can to move, but he doesn't seem to find it so horrible living here (house is big, with few people). But, I grew up being abused (verbally and physically) in this house and it holds horrible memories for me. One small thing can set me off in this environment and my husband doesn't understand why I can't control my emotions better. 

Anyways, I just wanted to make this post to get some of my thoughts out. I don't want to fail and give into the temptation. I want to be clean for myself, for my future kids, for the people I love. I don't want to be going into my 30's as a stoner who still couldn't stop myself from a temporary pleasure. I want to grow up and be mature and start taking responsibility for myself. 

I'm not sure if it would be better to make a post every day, like (Day 2 - blah blah) or if it would be better to just keep updating this thread? If someone could let me know what the typical way of having an accountability thread is on here I'd be very grateful. 

Also, I'm distracting myself from giving into the temptation by drinking coffee, taking care of some phone calls, and browsing the internet. I'm going to have to get off the internet soon so I don't become a zombie, so I think I'll read some books or make some collages with magazine and newspaper clippings. If you have any suggestions for ways to not give into the temptation when the temptation is in the same house as you I'd really appreciate it.  

Thank you! -J",1

Most times, I’d go exactly 1 day without weed, wake up after horrible night sweats and anxiety and simply smoke again in the morning, telling myself I wasn’t ready or willing to quit yet. And on the cycle went. For years. It’s time to put a stop to that now.

Yesterday sucked and I’m sure the next few days will too but I am fully committed this time to seeing this thing through and making weed a part of my past, instead of letting it dominate my present and future.",22

Tonight we went for a walk, and talked about very deep relationship based topics, and for the first time, I wasn't anxious or stressed or upset.
I was FINE.

I realised how much pot has affected my emotional landscape and how not myself it was making me.

I will get through this. I know I will. Failure just isn't an option for me.

YOU will get through your trials, however different from mine they are.

I’m in the middle of a serious end of a friendship level argument with a close friend of mine I’ve known since I was 7 (I’m 31 now) and I keep playing the argument we had in my head and imagining future hypothetical arguments. 

It’s literally the last thing I think of before sleep and the instantly the first thing I think of when waking up and I can’t get it out my mind. I woke up 7.30am and was instantly in an imaginary future argument.

I’ve also been told I laugh louder and longer now, but that’s a nice feeling. Any feelings of happiness or joy makes me feel drunk and giddy.

I’m not used to feeling pride. I accomplish the smallest task at work and immediately feel like....  anyone here seen the TV Show Spaced? The happy walk Simon Pegg/Bill Bailey do? John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever might be a more universal reference lol.

Basically it takes very little to get me on cloud 9 and very little for me to crash down to earth... I don’t want to smoke again, it just made me numb but Jesus at least it was consistent and simple you know? Or maybe you don’t? Oh god, is this just a me thing?",4

I dont have very many close reltionships since I cut out most of my old crew and its starting to weigh on me. I was hoping that quitting weed would magically fix any and all social problems. 

My main question is will I feel more social as time goes on or is this a mindset/ inner issue that I have to sort out independent of weed? I guess COVID isnt helping but I feel like that is an easy excuse. What are you guys' experience with quitting and being more social. Do you get more confidence as time goes on or is this something that I have to take into my own hands. Im guessing a little bit of both, but any feedback is appreciated!! 

As a side note, I was a very outgoing person back before I started smoking and even during the beggining of my weed use to a certain extent (6 years ago). The past 3 years have consisted of self  isolation mixed in with a small social circle of 2-4 people.

On day 13 I noticed my quit weed app saying that I am in the psycho(logical) phase and the best things I can be doing are exercising, meditating, journaling, and more exercising. This week started with completing multiple projects, teaching classes, and making time to do the above things each day. It was a high water mark for sure and I have been celebrating this. Each little bit of work felt like a small success adding up to something greater.

 Then queue the waking up at 2am and 5am with anxiety that has made the last couple of days drag so hard. Lots of headaches and cravings. Lack of sleep always makes things feel harder than they really are.

Have recently been applying for dream jobs that have kept me motivated, yet now that I have been invited to the trainings I am realizing that this may not be the best fit right now. It would essentially entail me helping young people in a therapeutic environment dealing with their own trauma...meanwhile I have spent only a total of maybe 3 months of this year sober myself. (This is a win in itself, I won't deny that)  I have spent a great deal of time living a double life and just recently admitted to my counselor that I am a complete pothead. They very kindly helped me come to the realization that at this point there is an ethical issue here. 

How can I help others right now when only recently I chose to admit that I have an addiction I need help with? 

This has been so humbling and I'm trying to be gentle with myself.",2

Without delving too deep into my sob story, I lost my Dad to cancer in 2015 when I was 24, and I lost my Mom to the same cancer two years later in 2017. Needless to say, depression, anxiety, and the loss of the will to live have been a part of my life for a long time.

Weed helped calm me down when I couldn't bare to see my parents struggling through chemo. It helped me sleep when the thoughts in my head raced a mile a minute each night. It helped dull and numb the pain I got from watching both of my parents suffer and waste away, leaving me orphaned at 26 with the two most important people in my life gone forever.

I've had spells of normal, successful life, working jobs I enjoyed and feeling like I contributed to society. But still after work, without fail, there would be 2-3 joints enjoyed each night. This year, everything, and I mean everything, finally went to shit. I was laid off from a job I loved in May, and have been unemployed since then. I moved in with my girlfriend of 4 years in June, and we promptly broke up in September, whereupon I moved out and am now in a lonely, shitty apartment alone with just my dog Harley. Most days lately, my routine consists of walking Harley, getting high, and killing time, all in one vicious circle, day after day after day. I am so done with this lifestyle and I am ready to begin my life again as the person I know I can strive to be, rather than the one that weed has made me.

Lastly, after crunching the numbers, between weed, papers, cigarettes for spliffs, I've spent in the ballpark of around $50,000 on my habit in the last decade. To think what else that money could've been used for makes me upset and angry.

Today is only day 1 and I know I have a long, long road ahead of me, but I'm grateful to have found this community and I'm really hoping to remain active here for a long time.",6

For the past 4-5 years, throughout college, I was smoking all day, every day. If I wasn't high, I was looking for the next opportunity to do so. I spent a lot of money and found that I wasted a lot of time. Now, I'm in graduate  school, have straight A's, and have found that I *can* live without it. 

I started smoking heavily around the same time that I got diagnosed with OCD. OCD is a bitch. Being that my OCD and weed use intersected, my OCD really impacted my weed use and vise-versa. Now that I have almost half a year under my belt, I feel more confident about how I've been doing. OCD still nags me, though. Some of the worries I have include the fact that my weed use was a lot of my personality. Can I still be ""cool"" if I don't smoke? Can I hang out with the same people I used to without being tempted?

The pandemic has been helpful in this way, as I was able to look inwards to help myself quit. I'm afraid, though, that after the pandemic, and I see my friends, it will be hard to stay away. These are friends who smoke that I have been friends with for many years. I know they will support me in my decision, but I just don't know what to say when they ask when I'm not smoking any more. I don't want to say 'I'm addicted"", even though that is probably true. 

Has anyone else had an ocd/weed experience? 

What did you tell your long time friends when you said you weren't smoking anymore?

How do you stay confident in your decision?",2

Even if by some miracle I come out of it fine, I NEVER want to feel this fear again. The worst part is I have nobody to talk to, I’m just completely alone in my head right now telling my self it’s gonna be ok.

I’m just disgusted at myself that I risked my own health to THIS extent over a stupid short high, what did it get me? NOTHING.

First thanks for all the support. I just got back, they did a bunch of breathing tests, chest X-ray, and some other stuff. They said something was going on but they aren’t sure what yet. The tests should come back soon here. Some people have suggested anxiety and I hope that’s all it is but It hurts to cough and there’s a constant pain in my chest even when relaxed and that’s a big coincidence for it to start right after clearing a couple Maine lives over a couple weeks.. so we’ll see what they say tomorrow.

2020-12-03 10:21:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/k5z4v3/the_journey_of_selfbetrayal/,The journey of self-betrayal,"First of all, thank you for all the eye-opening and inspiring articles that I have found on this sub-reddit. Your stories and articles made me reflect on my own behavior.

I want to share my journey of pleasure, addiction and self-betrayal.

I my teenager years, I did smoke occasionally and enjoyed it a lot. Until I was 24 years old, I used to look down on daily stoners, as most who did so seemed disinterested, uninteresting, dull and unmotivated. I witnessed personality changes in lifelong friends, friends that suddenly turned down their life goals, passions and hobbies.

At that time, I was in college and had met new friends that all seemed to get high everyday. As I was already smoking occasionally, I didn't mind puffing with them 2-3 times a week, telling myself that I won't get addicted anyways. Months passed, and 2-3 times a week turned into 4-5 times a week. Eventually I started smoking daily, only in the evening. This habit remained for the last 3 to 4 years. Over the years, I realised how my personality was changing, how my relationships were changing , how I lost my emotions, how I lied continuously to myself in order to justify toking. However, I didn't really cared because of the weed. At first the high felt really good, obviously that decreased over the yeara. Nowadays, being high doesn't even feel that good.


The most negative aspect about my journey is the self-betrayal. It mostly went unnoticed as the dullness seems to block my ability to self-reflect. Before smoking daily, I would do what I had promised myself to do, which always gave me confidence and held up my self-esteem.  Over the years, I continuously lied to myself, broke promises that I made to myself. For instance, 4pm :""today I won't smoke for one night to prove that I can do it, then I will get up at 7 and go for a run"" result: I justify smoking in the evening, end up smoking till I'm so high that I crash on the couch, ignoring the alarm clock, sleeping until 10 am.  After I get up, I feel slouched due to weed hangover and end up chilling for a couple of hours in bed to re-energize. 

This behavior intensified over the years, doing it more frequently, in all different aspects of my life. The self-betrayal resulted in a loss of respect for myself. But weed didn't take my dignity, I did it myself. I notice that breaking my own promises is now the rule, not the exception. Weed let's me feel comfortable with doing nothing, striving for nothing, stagnating personal development , living without a purpose. I realise that I became the person that I looked down on a couple ofyears ago. Through reading your articles, I now know that this cycle of self-delusion cannot continue. My ability for self-reflection is guided by the addicted part of the brain, which tries to justify every negative consequence of toking.

Over the years, I tried to stop 3-4 times, relapsing after a couple of weeks at best. Now that I realise the underlying long-term consequences that I endure from toking, I know that for now, there is only one way. Quitting for good. 
I want to retake control of my life, being honest and true to myself, finding a purpose, have healthy relationships and advance in life. I feel like If I don't break this cycle, I will look back in a couple of years disappointed and sad about the chances I didn't take, the development that I chose not to do, knowing that I cannot  get that time of my life back.

After my stash is gone, I will not buy new weed. I want life, passion, happiness, sadness, progress back in my life. The dullness has consumed me for too long. I want to be back in the driver seat. I want to have control over the things that I can control.

I hope that some of you can relate to this story.
Thank you r/leaves community for enlightening me and motivating people around the world.

I've been smoking heavily for a few years now, about 6. It's something I first got into at high school and I loved it, I started to do it before and after most activities I did, and without really noticing, overtime, I couldn't enjoy many of those activities without weed. Even started going to training high but it didn't affect my performance (so I thought)so I kept doing it. 

Once I noticed it starting to affect my sports I started to notice it affect every other part of my life too.

This 'moment' of light happened earlier this year and I've been telling myself in going to quit ever since then but 8 months later, come now, I'm still smoking daily when I can. 
I tried to switch up my daily routine with new 'positive vibe hobbies' and started meditating, reading and got into boxing (the old school pros) but I still find myself smoking at night to 'reward' myself or simply just because I'm craving. 
The last week has felt different though and I think it's due to the meditation routine, I find myself constantly enjoying thinking to myself when I'm sober during the day and when I get high on the same nights I end up counseling myself (in a positive way) on why I don't need to smoke. 

I'm about to go to sleep and I wanted to post this here because it warms my heart seeing the support people get on this page and I hope I can wake up to some comments that will make tomorrow truly different",9

But I didnt have much cravings until like 3 days ago. I feel worse than in my first week. Only upside is that my only way to obtain some weed would be through my so called ""friend"" with whom I dont want to keep seeing anymore. Too pride for this. 

This will probably be only reason for me to keep myself sober. I don't feel any benefits, just low motivation and boredom. It is so hard to actually do something outside of Netflix and YouTube. 

Even though I know that I have to start actively doing things in order to feel those benefits, I feel lazy af and like not doing anything, outside of long walks which I have been doing since I quit.",11

After this realization... Instead of taking action to fix the mistakes, I end up lying in bed thinking about all my mistakes and I end up smoking again, because I'm scared of the amount of work & time it's gonna change to change my life. 

I'm scared of the amount of debt that I have, the fact that my career is going nowhere, the fact that I haven't accomplished much. 

The solution is simple... Face your fears one day at a time. Do the work one day at the time. ""Best way to eat an elephant is bite for bite"". I know all the motivational and productive stuff. But yet I end up high on the couch again. Not applying anything. Not doing anything to improve my life. Asking for advice but never doing any of it. 

Am I just a person that can't quit smoking weed? It's driving me crazy. Wanting to quit, quitting, staying clean for a few days, relapsing for weeks/month and restarting the cycle again.

The fact that I hate the most is that I'm delusional: Everyday I continue to wish that I had just quit sooner but yet everyday I continue to smoke. ""I wish I had quit on Nov 1st"", (said this everyday in November yet I continue to smoke) 

Now I wish that I had quit last week Monday, I would've been clean for 10 days. Yet I continue smoking. ""I wish I had quit on December 1st"", but yet here I am on December 3rd still smoking as I write this. Am I just crazy? Will I continu to smoke until it kills me? 

Even though I continue to fail with quiting smoking, I somehow continue to try in the hope that things will change. 
I've made an appointment at a rehab center next Monday. I've taken leave from work this coming two weeks. I really hope that things will change, I hope that I have the strength to not give up, because I'm afraid I will. I probably will.

I have to face my mistakes and clean them up, that's the only way forward. But will I have the strength & motivation to do it? There's so much to clean up, such a long road to go.

Need to pay off huge amount of debt, find a parttime job, find a good career, take my part-time degree seriously, eat healthy, start working out, start reading up on finances and saving money. I know what to do. But yet I don't do it. Why?",4

2020-12-03 00:46:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/k5rgem/im_done/,I'm done.,"So, long story coming up. I started off smoking small amounts when I was in my early 20s. A single skin a night, a tenners worth would last me a week. I was working so I didn't have the time, nor did I smoke before work. Fast forward 7 years, I was treating it like it was  the life and soul of my life. Always high, first thing I'd do is smoke, same for the last and inbetween.  When I was smoking Js I could easily smoke a Q a day. I quit Js start of 2019 , thought it might help if I did and moved over to vaping. It did and didn't. The amount reduced! Yet I found a slightly new but still the same classic high. Same for edibles. I collected my avb and kept myself in a constant cycle of edibles each night. I accidentally ate 600mg in one night (misread the bag) after vaping all day up to it, whilst back to back eating my home made ones the days leading up. 

After I passed out I woke up the next morning with an awful headache and I was really worried I'd caused myself some damage. It went, but since then I have been afraid of edibles *or* more likely, the way I get with them. 

On a regular day I'd wake up, vape 4-5 times (probably more, lost count for sure) wishing away my day & bored as anything, waiting for 4pm. I had convinced myself that it was acceptable somehow if I did that. 

I ran out of cannabis on Sunday night. I haven't brought more. I really want out of the addiction. I don't smoke, take other drugs or drink alcohol anymore (all abused heavily in the past though) I want my motivation and drive back...but the thing is, I'm mentally ill. 

I have borderline personality disorder, and I have caused myself some real turmoil over the years. Alcohol makes it so much worse. However cannabis made me chill. Made me zen. Made me able to cope and be me, who I am deep down aside from the emotional instability. I'm scared I'm going to back down the route of being a lairy pub person again who is totally unaware that everyone thinks I'm crazy, and the big worry is I'll be even more unable to control my emotions since I've blocked them out for so long via unhealthy coping methods. 

Also, will I ever sleep again?? I'm typing this all out at 5.45am so I apologise if I seem frantic. I miss sleep, I'm used to sleeping reasonably early. I've had flu symptoms to top it off, although its so hard to tell what's a low grade fever and what's nightsweats from quitting. 

It probably reads like I'm struggling with my decision, I'm not. I'm still determined to say enough is enough and mean it (this time) I've had one week break in this whole 7 years last year so I knew it was going to be tough. I just know if I want to be a sensible adult going forward I have to get a grip on my mental health and controlling my emotions in stressful situations.

After the long break I was really hoping to get a relaxed giggly high, and to have that as an “option” with friends etc. I guess I ruined it for myself and that stopped being an option when I made it a daily habit.

I think judging yourself negatively for feeling unpleasant emotions is the devil itself, best not to swap the monkey on your back from weed to your own hypercritical judgement, better just to breathe deeply and accept the present moment. Life is long, good things take time. I'll be in a mental position to return to work and general productivity one day, so i wont beat myself up for that day not being today.

2020-12-02 21:30:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/k5off4/its_time/,It's time.,"I've been a daily user for over 15 years. During that time, the longest break I've had was 12 days, while trying to clean up for a job, but then I discovered synthetic urine and never looked back... Until now.

Well, I guess I can admit, I've pondered this many times before. I've thought that weed was holding me back. I've thought that I was becoming dependent on it. I've thought that I was chained by the cuffs of lovely lady cannabis, who lulled me into her comfortable grip and rocked me to sleep, after I was done eating every edible thing I could find.

Over the years, practically all my friends smoked. In fact, most of my hangouts revolved around getting high together, or making a transaction happen so then we could smoke up. I became a creature of habit, smoking daily just to tag along, just to watch tv, just to get ready to eat, or just to feel something better.

I've made friendships and bonds over weed, but they are pretty hollow after realizing that the only thing we really ever had much in common was getting stoned together. 

I'm not knocking the medicinal benefits of a quick toke when I felt very nauseous, or the relief from a terrible headache, or the life preserver Mary threw me when I was battling some of the lows of my depression and didn't really feel good about living. I was unable to see straight on my own, and while cannabis wasn't the final solution, I don't regret seeking out a more natural way (compared to most other available substances) to climb out of my darkness. But I see now why my choices were flawed.

Weed isn't the same for everybody. Too many times I based my choices for my life off of others who seemed to have their lives together, and had even been seemingly enhanced by smoking. But that wasn't right for me. I've been in denial.

I want my dreams back. I want motivation again. I'm tired of being lazy. I want excitement and wonder that arises from interesting things in life and not my ability to fade out and pay half my attention to something sub par. I want to be solely responsible for the feelings I'm feeling and the things I'm thinking. I want more control and less ""fuck-it"".

If there was ever a time to focus on true personal growth, it is now. That's why I didn't smoke after work today. I have nothing to run from. Nothing to try to fade out anymore. I want to face myself without being bloodshot. I want to be fully present in this life and accept nothing less.

This is fall. I am ready for the leaves.",21

I’ve been smoking since March of last year and I remember when I first hit the pen and how good it felt. I felt liberated. Since then, I’d smoke out of bongs, pipes, or whatever had weed in it almost everyday. I rarely took T breaks (only if you consider being dry for a couple days a T break). Then the weirdest shit happened this past September. 

Ever since I caught whatever viral bug I did in September - I stopped smoking for more than a week (fearing I had COVID) and then the onset of crazy symptoms came. At first it was widespread muscle weakness (most prominent in my hands), coughing up brown speckled phlegm, a very slight muscle pain whenever/ whatever I moved, and shortness of breath. It got so bad to the point where I convinced myself I had ALS and developed a sort of snowballing health anxiety. 

I would take intermittent breaks - smoking occasionally to ease the pain of these symptoms I’ve been feeling. While the muscle weakness had subsided, I kept smoking occasionally and found slightly orange/pink tinged phlegm when I would cough up. And while my muscle pain wasn’t increased it was still present. Any and every movement I made with my muscles was followed by a slight burning and painful That was right around the time I found a bump at the base of my neck on the left side near my shoulder. 

This locked me into a further state of hopelessness. With no insurance and a low wage job - I can’t invest in preventative care that I need. So now I got this thing on my neck the size of two peas. I have no muscle weakness but my muscles hurt anytime I move, I still have shortness of breath and of course my first thought is that I’m dying. And to some degree I still feel those sentiments today. I don’t feel okay right now or like I’m at my best physically. I’ve gained weight. I feel shitty. My muscles feel shitty. I get weird spasms and my back hurts now. I feel like I’m getting closer and closer to a young death and I’ve only smoked for almost 2 years! 

I’ve heard that depression can give people these symptoms so no matter my condition - I’ve resolved to put smoking aside and focus on my wellbeing. Im not ready to die yet and there’s so much I’d like to do with my life. While I’m just writing this to vent about my condition I’m hoping there’s someone out there who’s experiencing the same precarious situation as me.

This is my first posting on this page but I enjoy a lot of the posts I see! I’ve considered quitting for a long time honestly but for some reason I never do. My main reasons for quitting are the munchies & what seems to be lack of motivation when I am high. More often than not after smoking,I end up eating my nights away & to the point of physical pain. I’ve lost over 70 pounds and have gotten to a point where I can’t lose weight anymore & I’m positive it’s because of the bingeing I do after smoking. I try so hard to remain present & talk myself through but it never seems to work. I also feel like I’m not as motivated to do things the way I used to be. Smoking used to entice my creativity but now I can’t say the same anymore. My main reason for continuing to smoke is insomnia and how it helps me sleep. Like I tell myself I’m only going to smoke before bed yet I end up smoking earlier and not listening to myself. Ultimately, I’m just not sure if it’s worth it anymore. I’m having a really really hard time holding myself accountable & it’s to the point where I feel guilty when I do smoke. I can’t deny my dependence on it anymore & I hate that but it’s true....Any suggestions? They are greatly appreciated!",3

Until I realized that my mental health declining coincided with when I picked weed up again, and now it all makes a lot of sense. 

I quit a few months ago, trying to stay away for good, but I smoked a few times here and there with friends after a couple months, thinking what's the harm, and then that led to me getting my own stash again, and then smoking daily again, and now my mental health is bunk. No wonder.

My past strategy was to escape outdoors alone for a secret meeting with my bowl, but not this time. Bye, bitch.

Dealing with my weed love has also required me to really look my emotional eating habit in the eye and tell it ""Nope, no thank you"". Hopefully I can remember to offer this simple answer in the moment when I'm offered the second round of dinner, dessert, second dessert, dessert cause you're still awake, and all the booze in between.

Just another reason to quit I suppose.

2020-12-02 12:18:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/k5djqx/90_day_benchmark/,90 Day Benchmark,"On September 1st, my dog (the closest connection in my life) passed away from cancer. It was very unexpected and I made a post on here about how the death inspired me to quit weed. The night before when he was sick in my room and I knew in the back of my head he didn’t have much longer, I promised him that I would stop smoking because for a long time I had regretted doing it so much so consistently and such a young age. I told him that I would never smoke again, and then he was gone the next day. I know this is a dog but man I loved him more than anything and would tell him my problems while he stared at me. 

I am 18 and I started smoking at 16. The day my dog was in the hospital (day after I promised him  to not smoke and only one week after we found out his white blood cell count was 80,000)  I went home because the doctors said it would take them a few hours to run tests and during COVID we weren’t allowed to stay in the building unless he was on the verge of death. My mom and I got home and I immediately went to smoke. I couldn’t handle the stress and it felt comforting because smoking was all I knew. I hated myself for this and I still do. Smoking while my dog is dying!? Pathetic. About an hour later, my dad got the call that he wasn’t going to make it. I never felt that feeling before hearing my dad say it. All the optimism I tried to have crumbled down right there and then and I knew death was real and it was coming for my best friend.

After getting to the hospital, the doctor highly recommended that we put our dog down. He had a full body seizure as his whole body shut down and he was no longer responsive. Still alive, but he couldn’t hear me say his name. I could barely handle it. Why so sudden? The tests revealed he had lymphoma and one of the most aggressive forms of it they had seen that reached his brain. Of course I regretted finding out so late. I can list all the regrets which were many. And again, this is a quitting weed forum not “woe is me my dog died” forum. But his death was crucial to me stopping.

I had promised to stop and he was gone now. I was never religious but I believe i’m more spiritual now. Maybe it’s just my coping mechanism because I can’t accept never seeing my dog again. So, I believe he’s watching my moves and seeing if I stay true to my word. He’s seeing if I do what I know is right for me. Well it’s been 90 days since I stopped and I have absolutely no urge to do it ever again. My friends will smoke around me and I just say no. I do not understand what happened but I guess it takes an event that is so tragic and tied to weed to push an addict out of it. 

My main point of posting on here is to say that every terrible thing I knew weed was doing to me has mostly disappeared. I get natural sleep filled with dreams (not as many dreams as in the first month though), my appetite is somewhat back to normal, I can play basketball for much longer without chest pain, I think more clearly, I get more excited, I just have more emotion. Of course I get really stressed now because I went from smoking everyday and a lot to absolutely nothing while my dog just passed away. I was always a very anxious person before weed and still am after I stopped. It was a very dark time but I think it tested my strength. I am glad I quit and so glad I kept my promise. The only thing I would say is that in the mornings when I wake up I usually feel like complete shit. I don’t know if that is tied to weed. My nose is always stuffed as well and I am breaking out all over when I usually didn’t have any acne. Sometimes I have a taste of blood in my throat as well. Maybe I have some other condition and it has nothing to do with weed. I have felt like this for a while even before I stopped. I also am worried that the damage it has done to my brain in these developing years is not reversible and I have lessened my life potential. I cannot handle the thought of that.",9
2020-12-02 12:17:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/k5djeu/today_marks_3_years_sober_after_mostly_daily/,Today marks 3 years sober after (mostly) daily smoking from 14-24.,"I don't really feel like giving a ton of backstory. I started young and was immediately in the world of weed. Partying, quitting academic team and gifted programs in school to smoke instead, partying in college instead of going to class.

I sometimes wonder what life would have been like if I never met the person who introduced me to weed. Maybe I wouldn't have taken 7 years to get my bachelor's degree. Maybe. Who knows. There is not any point to dwelling on the past, only TODAY and YOUR FUTURE.

I was ""THE WEED GUY"". It was my whole personality. I didn't have an identity outside of smoking weed. Everyone knew me as the #1 pot head. I embraced it, I didn't try to hide it. I thought it was cool, unaware of the sheer amount of people looking down on me. Granted, this was ~10 years ago and attitudes have shifted, but the point remains.

You will lose ""friends"". People won't believe that you are quitting. It's hard for them to understand. But, maybe they weren't your friend after all. If all they care about is getting high with you that isn't a friendship. You will learn who your true friends are. They will support you unconditionally no matter what kind of choice you make and the types of relationships you will have after you come through the other side will be stronger than any ""friendship"" based around drugs and people wanting drugs from you.

My anxiety and paranoia subsided mostly, it took a year or two. I still get bouts every now and then when certain triggers happen but it's much easier to manage. I am a better person now that I don't care about chasing a bag. So many hours and days wasted worrying about getting money for weed, where am I gonna get weed, we need to hide the weed, don't get pulled over with weed, oh no I'm out of weed. 

I have real hobbies and interests now. It's strange, honestly. Everything I cared about for pretty much as long as I could remember was based around weed. It's much easier now looking back to see that the pot made me okay with being mediocre and bored. For the first time in my life I have been deeply interested in a hobby for more than 6 months (and getting pretty good at it, if I say so myself). I never would have been able to do this back when I was on the weed.

You can do this. If ""THE WEED GUY"" can quit, so can you. Do what I did. Take a concrete step. Flush your stash and smash your bong. Cut off your ""friends"" who only care about getting high, partying, and doing drugs. You will realize in time that they were never your friends at all. It's extreme but it will help.  (I will say, I still have very dear friends who smoke daily that understand what I went through and support me every step of the way. It's rare, but it is possible to have friends in that world that also support you. If their first reaction is not immediate support and understanding, they probably aren't a good friend to have around anyway.) 

Stay strong. I believe in you.",136

And have tried to moderate since then but started abusing again on October. I'm pretty sure I need to stop forever.

One week ago I decided it was time to stop. So I called my best friend, smoked way too much and have him all my stuff.

This time has been the easiest of all but (there's always a but) I feel I can't focus on anything. Yesterday I underperformed at work, and today I haven't been able todo ANYTHING AT ALL. I'm worried about this because, well, I really need to do stuff.

A little shocked that I’ve already tested negative but I think it has a lot to do with the fact that I was only smoking like .5g in the evening for quite a while while practicing intermittent fasting for around 6 months. I think my body was burning through more fat during those periods of fasting and therefore releasing more metabolites. Looking forward to a drug free life going forward. Been running most days.

I’ve been smoking weed on and off for about 4 years now however lately I’ve found myself smoking every single day.
The relationship I have with the drug is very strange as I don’t like it every time I smoke, if I’m in a positive mindset then it’s great however if I’m feeling low (which is most of the time) I think deeply about everything, I can’t sit still and I almost lose the ability to talk. 

I’m kicking myself that I’ve taken it this far as I should have stopped years ago. 
When will I feel normal again? Will your brain adapt to the concept of not having an artificial high so it regains its power of producing it naturally? 

I’ve come to the conclusion this drug is not healthy for me at all so I’m quitting. 
Has anyone else felt completely isolated after years of smoking and then regained your mind?

Because of my financial status and responsibilities I don’t always buy weed daily but when I do buy (every 3-5 days) I buy in large quantities and varieties of the most potent expensive stuff the dispensary has. It has caused problems in my life such as not being able to keep up with any of my schooling effectively because when I smoke I am okay with waiting until the very deadline or even past and then binging my assignments it’s ruined my natural seep patterns because now without it at night I won’t be asleep until 2am it’s ruined my appetite because if I don’t smoke I won’t eat at first it was doing good but now after a year of daily to weekly use it’s stating to do much more harm then good but I struggle with depression and even though I am on meds for it I feel as if without weed I am not sure I will be able to maintain the happiness I have now the sense of being okay in my mind and at peace with my life even if I recognize these problems I fear without weed my happiness is gone and that is a serious problem.",8

I've always been someone prone to depression and panic attacks, and in the past I had made enormous progress in managing it and preventing it from affecting my work as a software dev... up until the start of this year, when COVID hit and I began using with increasing frequency. I hit what I decided would be my ""rock bottom"" and have been keeping it clean since Nov 16th.

Now, however, a new issue has presented itself: My ability to handle anxiety is *completely* shot. I'm not even sure how to describe it besides anecdotes:

- Lying in bed, heart racing, unable to leave or stop imagining stuff like ""what if my girlfriend breaks up with me"", ""what would happen if I killed myself"", that sort of stuff.  
- There are some complex and time-consuming code issues I need to resolve at work, and I'm somehow so scared of it that I can't even bring myself to look at my work or think on it. Before my use really spiraled out of control, this was never an issue I encountered.  
- I barely, if at all, enjoy anything that *isn't* work, because no matter what it is, I'm constantly thinking about the workload that I'm not immediately working on and how long it will take to make up for time lost.

Those are just a few, but I hope they give you an idea of where I am all day, every day. My boss is aware of my struggle with substance abuse and that I'm clean - or at least that I say I'm clean, surely he has doubt because of the deceptive behavior that comes with addiction - but I can feel all of these expectant eyes on me and I don't know how to focus or calm myself enough to complete even basic tasks. Personal care, sleep schedule, eating, etc. have all taken a hit but not to the same degree.

Today I woke up late, having missed some meetings, and for hours the only thought on my mind was how killing myself would end all of the anxiety. I've been in this mental hole before, so that's not new, but being high has become my only coping mechanism for anything over the past year and without it feels like I'm stuck in free-fall.

Not really sure what I want out of this post, maybe just to vent. I've been deeply considering just quitting my job outright, but job hunting is soul-crushing in itself, and my boss has been a hugely supportive part of my life and I'm scared to burn that bridge. I genuinely don't know if I'd even survive long enough to get another job, given how poorly things are going now for me and in the world. That's kind of morbid now that I've typed it out, but that's what goes through my head over and over.

Anxiety is uncontrollable.,"I just need to vent and (hopefully) know that this is just bad withdrawal and I'll be okay...

Was taking 30-40mg of THC gummies for a few months. Maybe 4. Stopped cold turkey around the 15th.

Randomly did ab workouts to try to burn it out of my body one of the first nights and (most likely) caused muscle damage since I almost never exercise.

Completely lost appetite and hard to eat. Nausea, chills, and insomnia every day/night along with restless leg syndrome. Sometimes not so bad.

My mom thinks I'm crazy when I tell her my worries and thoughts throughout the day. Waaay too much on my mind. 

I was almost 2 weeks in and stupidly took about 8 or 10mg of an edible like 3 or 4 days ago and now I'm worried the withdrawal has reset. Super paranoid about my breathing, heart rate, checking my temperature, constantly paranoid about covid and I can't get tested for basically a week... Even though I'm not coughing and my temp is staying around 97F. Wanting to take my inhaler daily when my breathing feels weird but the albuterol makes my anxiety worse... Waking up with muscle pain after 4 hours of sleep, getting hit again with the anxiety and then staying up all night (like right now). Talked to my doctor and he prescribed antacid and nausea medicine.

Yesterday I had what felt like a mild allergic reaction from something random and felt groggy and off. Was not a good day. Only ate a banana, some bread, and fries. Slept 4 hours and woke up feeling dehydrated, shaky, and anxious.

 Been taking 2 different antidepressants daily for years and now they just don't work. Can't exercise because I tried and the muscle pain has been awful. for days, up until yesterday, I had AWFUL burning upper abdominal pain right in the middle that I couldn't tell if it was muscle related or in my stomach. Like an ulcer or gastritis. Now it's feeling much better but still hanging around my ribs and I'm noticing my muscles are tense.

It's about 4am and I'm honestly just scared. Never experienced anything like this. Still no real appetite like before, but I can stomach some food easier. Just not feeling hungry.

2020-12-02 03:22:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/k55fjy/why_im_done_smoking_weed/,Why i'm done smoking weed (Depersonalization/Derealization),"Hey all. I am a 22 year old recovering heroin addict ( almost 2 months clean from heroin) Some background - I used to smoke weed daily when I was 13-15, stopped, have smoked here and there - but for now I am done. Here is my story involving depersonalization, derealization, dissociating, and more.

I remember first smoking weed. I was at one of my best friends house for his birthday, and him and his brother (a year older than me) rolled a joint. It was a terrible, skinny joint - wet as hell from licking, twisted on both sides. I took two little hits. I'm pretty sure I got no real effects - just placebo - so I never really counted it as my first time - but, the time after that (which was about a month later) my friend and I bought some weed & I was staying at my friends house - his older brother was ""Looking after us"" cause it was our first real time getting high. We smoked bowls on his roof, got stoned, smoked hookah, ate about 8 jack-in-the-box tacos each, and fell asleep crying-laughing to scream. It was amazing. Safe to say, I liked it!

My next time was probably a week after that. Then 4 days after that. Then 2 days after than. Then the next day. I loved it! I was doing it daily from the end of 2013 to July 2014, having fun! We would ride bikes, skateboard, watch movie, ditch class, eat junk food, listen to music and more off weed. It made everything great. No one has overdosed on it, I don't have to put a needle in my arm, so it's not so bad, right?

Me and my cousins went with my older cousin to the skatepark, who stopped at the clinic on the way and got some fire weed. We smoked a blunt and skated, then got Subway (My cousin ordered a cold cut combo, forgot, then tried to put ice in a watter-bottle, realized he forgot his sandwich until we got home, then ate 4 beefy5layers in 1 sitting. Amazing) My cousin dropped us off - and he gave me the left over weed. I emptied my nalgene water bottle  and put the weed in there, hid it in my closet, and went about the night. Fast forward to the next morning - where everything with weed went WRONG.

I woke up towards the end of the morning on a bright summer sunday. I was supposed to go to my grandparents in a couple hours, my parents are at work, so fuck yeah i'm gonna light a couple bowls! I pull down my nalgene bottle & take my weed out - I notice it's a little damp. Shit - must've been a drip of water. It's all good. I go out back by the pool and spark up listening to ""WOLF"" by Tyler, The Creator. Felt amazing. After a couple bowls, I tell myself imma make some food and play some Garry's Mod & watch YouTube videos until my grandpa picks me up. So, I walk into the kitchen.

 I grab a hot pocket out of the freezer, turn to the microwave - and - out of nowhere - I didn't even grab the hot pocket? No wait, I did, I just realized i'm putting it in the microwave - wait - how did I get to the microwave from out back so fast? What the fuck? Is this real????? What's going on??? Where am I??? Is this real??? My mind and heart are racing - nothings real - this microwave isn't real - this hot pocket isn't real - IM NOT REAL, TIME ISN'T REAL. I try calming myself down by breathing and figure I need to eat & drink some water, so I put it in the microwave and go upstairs to get my water. Wait - what the fuck??? How am I upstairs already??? Only a second has passed. What the fuck. In  what feels like literally 2 seconds, I go upstairs, drink water and breathe for a while, go down, bring my hot pocket to my room, try putting on garrys mod to focus on something and calm down, but it's not going away. I figure I need to try and sleep so I lay down. Instantly fall asleep.

I wake up - I can't move. At all. No clue why. I see my room. My chest hurts - I can't feel much. I can't breathe. This is it - i'm the first fucking idiot in the world who overdosed on WEED. I think about how I should've just not smoked & visited my grandparents one last time - about how I should've told my stepbrother I loved him, how I should've called my mom when I woke up and told her that i'm sorry we get in so much arguments and that I love her & that I know she wants what's best for m- then I see a figure come in my room. All black - with a very vague demonic face. He is slowly creeping in my room for what feels like ten minutes - then JUMPS at me - I wake up in a sweat. I found out a couple years after that this was sleep paralysis.

I wake up, and I feel fine & grateful. I decide to maybe at least chill out on the weed for a bit. I go to my grandmas and enjoy every second with them. Shit feels good - for maybe 2 days. 2 days of no-smoking later I am playing Skate 3 on a late night - just messing around. Until I focus on something that's on the screen for too long - I literally feel something on my mind ""close in"" and then boom - something similar happens (except the time thing) - nothing feels real. I am in a movie - a simulation - a video-game, i'm in Tranquility Lane. I go to bed. Wake up - it's still there. I can't even lie - this feeling lasted for 2-3 months. TWO or THREE months. I absolutely hated it and didn't tell ANYONE. Days with my family at the county fair, days skateboarding with my friends - none of it felt real. I didn't smoke weed anymore.

Eventually, I felt better. Fast-forward to November 2015. A lot is different.  I'm now 16, I have a job at a grocery store, I haven't smoked in a year, etc. I'm at a music festival with my friends when they start passing a blunt around - decide it has to have been long enough. I hit it a couple times. Then a week later im working and - same thing - start focusing on an aisle in the store - and BOOM. It hits again. I have a panic-like attack and run out of the store - somehow I finished my shift, and thankfully it only lasted a couple days. But damn, it SUCKED again.

Okay, now fastforward to late 2018. I have just quit heroin, figure i've outgrown whatever the hell it was - and start smoking. I take little hits with 4-day breaks in between in case it happens again. But then one time I smoke too much with my friends and BOOM - I go into the same thing again while smoking. Only this time it's WORST (This has been the worst it's ever been.) If yall have seen the 2017 movie ""Get Out "" - you know where he is in ""The Sunken Place"" watching his life in a black void on a little screen? I shit you not, that is WHAT HAPPENED TO ME. I WAS LITERALLY IN A BLACK VOID WATCHING LIFE THROUGH MY EYES, UNABLE TO CONTROL IT. Every ten minutes i'd zone back into myself - and tell my friends what was happening - that I was seeing my life play out on auto-pilot and i''d randomly zone back in. It SUCKS. I tried to help myself with music, water, benzos, etc. Nothing worked. I even went into my grandmas room and hugged her cause I thought this time I fucked up bad and i was STUCK like this. However, once I woke up, it was gone. and I didn't have any effects afterwards. 

Now, we're here. I quit heroin a month or so ago, and decided to puff a couple times. Then again. And again. I actually thought I was cured this time, cause I would get that ""Fun"" stoned, like the first high. But, good things don't last. A couple days ago, I smoked a joint at my friends - and it hits again. Not the ""get out"" effect, but just a huge feeling of ""Nothings real, can't focus on anything, can't remember if what I did a second ago was real"" I woke up cured. 

I'd like to say that when this happened to me in 2014, I did try googling it, but didn't find many similar experiences. I decided to google it a couple days ago, and found out it's a mix of Depersonalization, Derealization, and Dissociation. I found out that it happens to some people after smoking weed consecutively, and that it's possible I might have a disorder already and weed makes it more ""real"" i guess. I originally thought it was cause the weed was wet. People told me my weed was laced - but - I witnessed my cousin go into the clinic, lol. But yeah. I am done with weed - for good. People told me ""everyone gets it, you have to smoke through it!"" but I didn't even realize this was a disorder. That shit sucks!!!!

But yeah - I am officially done. If you read through my long-ass-post - thank you! If you're on this sub because you quit/are trying to quit - I send my love to you! You can do it! Life is better without substances anyway. Drugs mask your true feelings, whether you realize it or not. If you're here because you're stoned and just want to read stories from people - I still send my love! Do whatever you want.

**If you have stories similar to mine, feel free to drop it.** In 2018 when I got the ""sunken place"" effect - I did some keyword searches on twitter and found a lot of people who  had similar effects.

***TL:DR - Smoked weed daily at 14-15, one time I tripped out & had a little derealization attack, had sleep paralysis, woke up fine, randomly had sleep paralysis for a weed. Smoked again in 2015 and was fine, week later have the same thing for a week. in 2018 I smoked and had a BAD ""trip"" PLUS a derealization attack. Quit heroin a month ago and tried it again, same thing happened - found out what it really is. Deciding to ACTUALLY quit.***

No social interaction and this quarantine phase had made everything worse as I work from home and can’t stop myself from lighting the bong.

A little background: I tried cannabis when I was 14, hated it. At 16 my family convinced me to smoke to alleviate my pretty horrible symptoms of polycystic ovaries. It worked like a charm so i'd smoke a tiny bit when my period hit. A year or so later I developed a friend group that smoked pretty heavily but I would only partake occasionally. Then came the moment where I became a slave to the ganja, a large emotionally distressing event occurred and I decided to smoke away my awareness. From then on it became my emotional crutch. Years went by, I coasted on natural talent and work environments that were better with weed.   
Fast forward to 23 when I decide to go to college as a STEM major. I learned the only academic things I can do high are creative writing and life drawing. Understanding math, science or programming? Not a chance. Recalling anything I read 2 sentences ago? Forget about it.   
Naturally I decide to quit smoking. Turns out my body and my brain are painfully out of sync. My body buys more while my brain is held hostage, then i'm stoned and I'm inspired by all kinds of hopes and dreams while neglecting the real work to get me there. I love what I am learning the problem is I can't get myself to sit down and do it because I crave being stoned and can't focus on anything else. So I get stoned with the rationalization that if I just give my body what it wants it'll settle down and let me study. The falsest of falsehoods. 

  
I am 27 now and the longest I have quit in the last 4 years was 2 months when I tried to join the military. Lit up right after MEPS. Felt so shameful. When I try to quit I can go less than a week. If I spend extended periods of time outside of my house, i'm around people or my boyfriend is staying with me I don't think about smoking but as long as I am alone in my room, its like there is nothing else in the world that matters.   


I can't live like this. I feel like it's sucking my life. I can't be social, I become impulsive, I neglect the responsibilities that I want to have. It's like 3 different people run my life given the vast differences in the decisions i would make high, sober or coming down.   
Tomorrow will be day 2 and I am hoping for a day 3 and beyond. I have tried a ton of methods, my typical is cold turkey throw it all away. If anyone has advice I would greatly appreciate it. I am feeling pretty stuck.   
I know this was long so thank you for reading. Maybe doing a progress blog on here will help as a source of accountability.

Before that, I overall broke my stoner habits even though I occasionally smoked weed here and there.

I'm currently 19 years old and have been a stoner since I was about 17; I started smoking albeit in moderation when I was 16. I feel like it has truly changed my brainpower. I feel as if my memory underperforms sometimes. Also, I take more time to critically think about a topic. It's so weird to explain: it's as if my thoughts are trying to produce an assessment, say about a political topic, but my brain just isn't processing it fast enough. It's very frustrating and makes me feel like I have a low IQ. Perhaps this feeling is a result of a lot of things (my sleep schedule is awful right now and I know that can also affect brainpower).

I haven't done anything all day, some errands I had to do, and found out I'm gonna need root canal treatment for one molar. All I've wanted to do is cry all day, I stay still, sometimes in my bed, sometimes sitting with a cigarette, and every now and then I sneak into the backyard or the bathroom to cry a bit, because I'm ashamed of crying in front of my family, who the fucks knows why.

The one silver lining is that I think I'm finding my emotions again, I wasn't crying because of the weed,it was because the dread I feel for putting aside my needs (like my teeth), and the complete uselessness of me, and my family's grief for having to stand me.

But I tell you one thing, though it sounds bad, and it is, it's SOOOOO much better than the complete void I was living, and the plain felt regret I had everyday for spending it high, instead of alive.

Even though I want to smoke like crazy, I won't buy today, and I don't think I will tomorrow. That's as far as I can project anything right now. On the weed end I'm motivated as fuck, and this uncontrollable need to cry just reminds me that I'm in fact alive, and I want to keep feeling awful until I start feeling better, but not let just life pass me by.",13

Thanks for participating in this awesome sub and helping people to quit. I’m convinced it really makes a big difference to read through the posts and the encouragement in this community. 

I started smoking on weekends 7 years ago and have been a daily user for around three years, then on and off throughout this year and now finally made it to 40 days sober!

The fact that my mood and motivation stabilize, I’m slowly but surely starting to get more sleep and I’ve come to terms with some psychological stuff that has been going through my head for quite a while really make me want to continue and stay sober as long as possible. 

I‘m pretty sure that I’m over the hardest part by now, but the upcoming holidays back home concern me. All the friends I used to hang out with and will hang out with while I’m visiting my parents are regular smokers and our planned New Year’s Eve (just a few people, COVID bla) will include a lot of J‘s flying around - pretty tempting, especially when drunk. 

What can I do to not rebound that night and not bother any of my friends simultaneously?

If I slip, how bad will the consequences be?

Felt for a while as if my whole life is just going through the motions until I can next have a smoke. Spending time with my children, friends and family isn't enjoyable. Spending time with my girlfriend isn't enjoyable. Only time I'm happy is that huge Dopamine hit right before I know I've done what I need to do and I can sit and smoke! Sat in a freezing cold car for hours on end day after day watching different shows or videos on my tiny phone and this is apparently how I'm desperate to spend as much of my life as possible! It just isn't right but at this point, it's all I know. I'm on day 5 of quitting both marijuana and tobacco and physically I'm not too bad, managing to eat and sleeping more than ever as I just don't want to be awake! Mentally, I'm a mess. It's like I'll never find joy in anything ever again, got home from dropping my daughter back at her mum's tonight, parked up on my drive and literally sat there crying reminiscing about rolling up a sweet joint and getting Netflix rolling!

Around March when lockdown started I started smoking way more frequently. By July I was smoking daily and by September I was smoking a few times a day. I know this might not be as long as a lot of other people in this sub, but I have definitely felt the effects of not being able to quit the few days I tried. Also, I am very susceptible by substances like that (I had some problems with alcohol at 15 and had to cut it almost completely to be able to maintain a good relation with it - moderations does not really work with me)

At first, weed started as a social activity and I had such a great time with friends, then I started smoking when I was bored and wanted to watch a movie/go on walks. Now, I got to a point where I need to smoke anytime I need motivation to do anything and anytime I need to sleep. It has not really impacted a lot of my life in the sense that I am still pretty functional while high, but I hate the idea of being dependent on weed to be able to live my life.

I have always been a very positive person and have always enjoyed boredom because it allows me to do stuff I normally don't have the time to do. However, with weed, I end up getting high, getting the bare minimum done (cleaning, cooking, showering, etc) and then finding myself watching a show or scrolling through social media for hours. I miss having that sense of happiness and motivation to try and do something new that I used to have. Don't get me wrong, smoking and being alone by myself has taught me an insane amount about who I am, what I like, what I want, etc, but it needs to come to an end.

This Saturday I am going to be travelling back to my home country where weed is not legal and I want to use this situation to quit weed all together for the 2 months I will be there. I've tried quitting before and I've had insomnia, headaches, foggy thoughts and irritability pretty intensively being just one day off it. Does anyone have any tips on handling these type of withdrawal symptoms when quitting cold turkey? Is there something else I need to worry about when quitting it like this? (i.e. I've seen some stories of people having panic/anxiety attacks for a while after quitting, and while I do not think this is going to be my situation, I want to be prepared for it).

Also, I should add that my family back home does not I smoke at all (they have a pretty bad view of weed) and I cannot depend on them to help me with it if I need someone to go through with me.

**TL;DR:** I am going to quit weed cold turkey this Saturday. I get pretty bad withdrawals (insomnia, headaches, foggy thoughts, and irritability mainly) when I try to quit, so do you have any tips on how to handle it? Is there anything else I should worry about when quitting cold turkey?",3

There are quite a few threads on dreaming already, and I was wondering if anyone who had longer term dreaming symptoms could chime in. I am about 4 months clean now after smoking non stop for a year and most of my symptoms have subsided. However, I still feel as though I'm getting a ton of REM sleep and little deep sleep. I remember my vivid dreams every morning (mostly pleasant dreams). This is strange to me, because prior to withdrawls, I would very rarely remember a dream (unless woken up during REM sleep) I was wondering if this is something that is generally permanent or is this something that will eventually subside given more time.

I was here about a year ago and had pretty good success (so I thought).  I wanna say it was like 42 days.  I went through a lot during that time.  Got a lot of work caught up, started studying again, worked on a bunch of home projects.  But it didn't last.  I eventually started using again at some point and didn't look back.  Never checked back here, didn't want to hold myself accountable.  Just kinda took all those truths I knew and learned and suppressed them with more mj.

A full year later, and.. here we are.. again.  Nothing has changed.  I feel the same desperation.  I'm using everyday, multiple times a day.  I'm not even enjoying it, most of the time.  It's just routine.

I have a good job, I workout 5-6 times a week, I have a good marriage.  I should be setup to grow and achieve things in other areas of my life, but I just smoke and fail to follow through with anything but the bare minimum effort to keep everything in my life afloat.

I think I may need to see a professional to deal with some of my issues.  Not sure how to start that ball rolling.  I feel like I've been depressed off and on for years.  I don't believe the mj caused this, but it surely hasn't helped me deal with those issues.

There is more, of course, but that's where I'm at right now.  I'm going to start writing in a journal again to try and analyze/sort through these thoughts.

The first couple of weeks were awful. My 3rd day of quitting I ended up staying in a psych hospital for a week. Which did help me learn some good coping skills. The first two weeks I got literally no sleep, couldn’t eat at all, was perpetually angry/hypervigilant, getting into constant fights with my boyfriend, had an extreme headache, extreme stomach ache, my whole body hurt. Actually thought I had covid but my test came back negative. Now for the past few days I’ve been sleeping nonstop. I’m asleep more than I am awake. I feel this constant urge to be on my phone and in bed when before I would smoke weed and hang out with friends or play guitar, draw, watch videos, etc. I’m having multiple panic and anxiety attacks a day. I’ve been having constant nightmares and waking up in the middle of the night to panic attacks, my heart rate is constantly above 80 bpm when usually it was 50-70 bpm. It’s soo much harder to self soothe sometimes almost impossible. When I have anxiety it feels so much worse then when I had anxiety while using weed. My whole body feels shaky and hot, I can feel my heart fluttering in my chest, my muscles feel different, it almost feels like there’s a toxic substance in my body. My blood pressure is higher than it used to be too. Yoga is the only thing that calms me but after a while I start getting anxious again. I have very little motivation at all right now, all I want to do is sleep and just look at my phone but i know that will only cause me to become depressed like it has in the past. My sex drive is a lot lower and I don’t really enjoy masturbation like I did before or even sex. I’m just really afraid this is what I’m naturally like without weed and it’s not withdrawal anymore. Everything is a lot harder and I’ve been getting depressed way easier and my anxiety is almost constant now. I’m constantly worrying about literally everything. My physical and mental health and the physical and mental health of others, I’m having a lot of intrusive and obsessive thoughts that are a lot harder to get rid of. Any feedback or suggestions would be appreciated.",5

I am not sure what sobriety looks like in any form, I haven’t known it for 8+ years.

The anxiety is still there but subsided a lot. I've been seeing a psychotherapist once a week which does help especially to speak to some1 without fear or judgement. The depression is definitely quite high over the last few days. Has any 1 else experienced depression after quitting weed and how long did it last for b4 you felt back 2 yourself?

You will still be in doubt tomorrow and even after you quit. At 40 days, the temptation is still as real as it was when I was still smoking. The cravings subside tho.

When I smoked alone (which was how I usually did) I would smoke about 1-4 times a day for a while and then just 1-2 times a day, usually out of a hitter.  I haven't touched weed in about a month and don't plan to until I am an adult with my shit together.

At the age of 15 smoking definitely brought out some depression and anxiety. There have been other drugs I have done, but not close to as frequently as weed. Around the time I slowed down and completely quit this year I feel like I can barely hold a conversation outside of general ""How's it going/ nice weather"" small talk with people. Sometimes I find myself forgetting words and stuttering while talking. None of my friends really talk to me anymore unless we are gaming together.

So far it hasn't been to difficult to avoid cravings, I drank once or twice just for the hell of it but I honestly hate drinking and I get hangovers straight from hell so I feel reasonably secure in my sobriety. But I still feel like a total loser.

For some dumb reason I figured if I stopped smoking I'd have the willpower to make myself do regular chores, apply myself and catch up on the mounting pile of homework that I've been ignoring, spend more of my day being productive, or even spending my luxury time actually playing the games I own instead of watching shitty YouTube videos and scrolling reddit. 

I thought that I would cut away weed like an anchor and I'd be able to soar without the fog of weed to hold me down, being content with boredom. I thought I'd stop feeling compelled to binge on junk food.

I haven't gotten any of those things from quitting. I was always that kind of loser on my own. Weed was just giving me a buzz to dull the monotony of being *me.*

I dont understand why I can't make myself do things. I can't will myself into action. I sit at my computer, internally screaming at myself to clean the place, start my homework, *anything* but I'm remaining inert. I pull my attention away from my computer and end up scrolling reddit on my phone, I pull up my drawing tablet to start my next school project and end up watching TF2 videos on YouTube. Its like I dont have control over my life and I fucking hate it. I hate me. 

I wanted to look back on 2 weeks of sobriety and feel proud that I shook my little green monkey, but looking back I feel almost defeated. 

Why am I like this.",3

This is my 26th day sober from weed after years of heavy smoking. I've tried to quit many times more but I've always end up smoking after a while. This time I think the quitting was more mature, I don't need this anymore and since realising that I haven't had cravings. I have barely had any withdrawals, like earlier when I could not sleep or eat for a week. This time im also able to visit my friends who smoke and not feel like I want to smoke too when I have realised what pot has done to them and me.

I feel great, Im exercising a lot, eating much healthier although sometimes I eat some hamburgers etc. (which btw taste a lot better when you dont eat them everyday while high :D)  and what's the best that I'm now again interested to my uni studies! And ofc my brains are working better while studying so I just dont forget it all right after. I also again like reading and playing CS. 

Have to keep up with the good work and watch out for  the 30-40 day trap of feeling good about myself and smoking (been like that 2 times earlier in my life). Good luck to everyone!",33

Just to give you some background, I used to be a college athlete who suffered from a concussion problem that eventually led me to retiring from the game I loved. During that time of transitioning to being a normal student, I went through a really tough breakup as well. I really had a difficult time and turned to weed to numb the pain I had from headaches but also the pain my heart was feeling. It started with flower in joints and blunts and then quickly went to dabs. I would smoke to numb the pain and honestly check out from the world. 

Quickly I became dependent on it.. before class, dab. After class, dab. I didn’t even really realize what I was doing to my own world. As time went on, I continued this habit of smoking and it really effected my world. I went from trying to get A’s to being cool with just passing. I went from being extremely upbeat and conversational to keeping to myself and being more on the quiet side. My motivation for my future was also suffering. I had no confidence like I did prior to not smoking... I really lost myself to be honest. A year later, I’m deciding to take my life back. Weed has effected my appearance, my mindset, my relationships.. and I’m over it. I’m tired of it and I want to be the person I know I am. 

I’m here seeking advice from you all on any tips for a guy like me trying to quit. I’m really open to any suggestions you all have!! I’m currently on day 5 and I already feel like my appearance is changing for the better, I’m much happier, my mind is clearer, and my confidence is returning slowly. I never wanna go back so please let me know any tips or tricks:)",2

I’m nervous that I’ll do it because I’m always thinking about how I could handle it. But I wonder what I even want from it. Why am I even bargaining and trying to decide if I will? If I really was free from I wouldn’t spend so much time thinking. Maybe I just need more time to think about my motivations. I’m going camping with my boyfriend and it doesn’t bother me when he smokes and I really wouldn’t want to ask him not to even though he’s offered. That’s his journey but it is another layer of challenge for me because we’ve always bonded over smoking. I know it’s about me and being able to respect my own boundaries.

I just came back from a weekend of nothing but bong rips and eating shit food mostly the entire weekend. All of the times I quit, 30 days is the farthest I’ve went.  I know I can go without it, the only reason I keep smoking is because I’m lonely and have pretty bad anxiety. It’s only been 1 day and I already have insomnia. I can’t wait until the wave of withdrawals are over. I can’t remember the last time I didn’t feel like I had a weed hangover whenever I wake up. No energy and I don’t wanna get out of bed. I was so tempted to just rip it so I can fall asleep but I’ve already made the promise to myself. Also another plus is not eating so much food! And finally feeling full!

How do you keep yourself entertained to cope for this urge?,"Its weird. I might not even be qualified to post on this sub as I know a lot of you are quitting after years and hats off to ya. I'm a late comer to weed (I'm 24) as I finally ""caved"" junior year of college. Weed was one of the last things I tried because I really enjoy being alert and on the go. But slowly I developed a level of respect for the feeling of being baked and definitely dig it. I've had a drastic increase from maybe once a week to now being at probably five or six times a week since quarantine. Obviously I'm bored. Me and my ex broke up probably a month before quarantine and I dont have the urge to ever smoke when hanging with buddies or family, but when I get home at night? The urge hits me hard. I only smoke joints or edibles and only do it at night, but I know I've developed some subtle anxiety, binge eat like crazy and dont feel as sharp as I usually do over the last couple months. 

But it's weird because I dont ever even think about smoking weed unless it's like 9pm or later and I never have weed around the house, so I've turned into a regular recently at the dispensary but all I do is buy one joint (or two edibles,) every time. I have zero desire to be high unless it's late at night and I'm hanging by myself or if I'm hooping (I play so well high for some reason.) I feel like I've developed a comfort in it and I recently took a three week break about a month ago and learned that I've fucked up my sleep without weed. That's part of my motivation at night is to get sound sleep on it, but then I'm groggy in the morning and I beat myself up over everything I do, so you bet your ass I do that now with this. 

TL;DR I've started smoking weed nearly every night since quarantine. If someone read my mind starting in the morning, they'd initially think I didnt know what marijuana was, but come 9pm(ish) they'd think I was a hardcore stoner with massive cravings. Does anyone else have this type of ""addiction"" and if so, how do ya cope with it? 

Thanks everyone",4
