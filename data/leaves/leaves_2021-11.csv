Not sure if this happened because I am older at 64 yo, but I barely made it thru Thanksgiving with my two sons and all the food and house prep. I finally reached out to my GP doctor and she was so understanding and has put together a medication and therapy plan to help me through the readjustment period from all the years of medicating with weed.  I quit smoking cigarettes 5 years ago with the help of an online support group and hope to be able to share experience strength and hope here.

Not happy about that anymore, in fact I'm started to be a bit ashamed of it. I wasn't on another level, nor did I learn any secrets to the universe. What I've done is piss half my life away, the best years of it actually. Days 2 and 3 were a freaking nightmare. I really didn't know what to do with myself. I still don't, but that sense of anxiety has waned considerably the last day. It really turned out to be to my advantage that the last many purchases I made were extremely poor quality. Most of yesterday and today I've been angry. Like REAL angry. I play scenarios in my head that purposely enrage me.  It hasn't taken much to push me over the line. But tonight I feel a little better.

I have woken up and found myself in a life where I'm a twice-divorced man raising my 2nd son alone. I have a small business that surprisingly make money, and a small team that's been working with me for years. I sort of feel like an alien that's been dropped into a pre-made life with decades of memories implanted, but no real sense of ever 'being there'.  

Pot makes me quite content doing the bare minimum-in all things. The party's been over for me for a long time. The realization that I can't go back, I can't fix this, is growing and growing, and I fear I may have a serious breakdown once the full weight comes down on me. I want to go back so bad.  How did 35 fucking years go by so fast? I'm entering the 'horror' phase. I want to pick up where I left off when I was 18, but now I'm in my 50's. I read that the first 2 weeks are the worst, so I expect the next 9 days to be rather eventful. I want to ignore the feelings of loss I have, but another part of me says I should never go back to ignoring or numbing any real feelings. I guess the only way out is through, and I'm going to press on. Thank god for this group, or I wouldn't even have made it this far. I have to almost laugh when I think that to be a rebel nowadays, I have to NOT smoke weed.",5

I spend more than half my paycheck on weed weekly. Roughly $1,000 on weed in total this month. I'm down to my last $150 and yet I still gave in today. I think of all the things I could be saving for instead; traveling, moving out, etc. After smoking everyday for fourish years my tolerance is screwed so I barely even feel high anymore I'm mostly just smoking to ease the craving which comes back about thirty minutes later.

In high school I always got A's even though I didn't put in that much effort. School was never the biggest deal to me but I always did well. I scored well on the SATs and went on to an elite university. I started smoking weed occasionally during my freshmen and by junior year I was a daily user. Senior year I didn't have much to do and basically became a complete stoner often smoking multiple times a day. Throughout college my smoking never really affected my studies as I was always able to knuckle down and cram when needed. During senior year I started to notice my memory starting to fade but I was still getting good grades so I didn't really think much of it. 

Now I am two years out of college and my brain has gone to complete mush. It's actually unbelievable. I literally cannot think. My memory is almost completely nonfunctional at this point. I can watch an entire movie one day and not remember a single plot detail the next. It's literally like I have Alzheimer's and I'm 23 years old. I majored in computer science but I honestly couldn't tell you the first thing about how to code. It's not just my memory either, my overall thinking ability is also greatly diminished. I used to be really good at math but now even doing basic arithmetic is extremely difficult. The other day I did an escape room where you have to solve puzzles and I could barely contribute to my team. I felt so stupid and useless. I know I need to quit but it's been super difficult. You guys on this sub inspire me to try though. I've also been recently diagnosed as bipolar and am on significant psychiatric meds which is definitely a contributing factor. My question is this: if I successfully quit weed now will my brain function return to what it was? If so how long will this take?",22

Sleep is a coin toss tonight, I didn't set myself up properly to get a workout in. That may cost me a few Z's, but I will make the correction tomorrow.

I quit not so long ago and had some success but a level of stress drove me back, I wish I could control myself but it is a dependency for me sadly and no moderation is possible. I hate it, sadly. 

Bit of a random question, but did you guys experience any physical conditions within the first 24 hours of quitting? 

I've been completely fine in terms of clucking/cravings and I've started vaping because I like the ritualistic side of smoking; I go outside with a cup of tea and relax with this stray cat that I've fallen in love with (I rescued one before and have a strange connection to strays, I'm a weirdo) and I wouldn't mind maintaining that but I just don't have a single thing decent going on in my life. 

I lost all of my school friends because of something I've done in the past and I've lost my job. I used to be quite a big guy with a 405 squat and deadlift (low numbers but I was 18) and I no longer go to the gym. I'm a full blown bum right now with a gaming PC and I just want to quit weed to see if there is a better direction for myself again. 

I have epilepsy sadly and I think smoking does help it relax too. I have a lot of issues in life and I'm not here to be so sorry for myself but I'm just so messed up about my mothers drinking and the fact I can't live with my grandmother anymore because of difficulties with me and my uncle who lives there also and I'd kill to go back but he will not move out even though he is 37/38 with a kid. I'm quite broken in truth when I'm sober and I really REALLY despise my life. I am suicidal and have been for years but just cannot be bothered to fix myself anymore so I'm hoping quitting will motivate me to sort things out. 

I've had some physical issues today; bad stomach and intense heat all over. 

Are these normal? 

Disclaimer; sorry for the rambling. I am in a terrible spot in my life. Even my family tell me ""is this going to be a good time for you to quit?"" because of my state. I know they don't want to enable me and are trying to be considerate. 

TL;DR: I'm having a bad stomach (poops) and extreme warmth all over. Any tips? I'm going to be up all night. If anyone is from Europe or UK with a PC feel free to DM me. I'm up all night if anyone is similar. 

Thank you!",2

This morning when I woke up, I felt like I had a crazy amount of energy. I exercised, I made breakfast, I did a bunch of cleaning around the house. Then I spent several hours on a creative project that required a lot more focus than I can normally sustain.

I've been in a GREAT mood all day. Just...cheerful. Enjoying things I don't usually notice or enjoy. Food is more palatable. Music is making me want to move my body more. The silly antics of my pets are making me grin so much more than usual.

I was more willing to engage and socialize with roommates, too. Felt like I had cooler, snappier things to say than usual. I wasn't just looking for an excuse to end the conversation.

Normally around this time of day (right before dinner) I feel kinda prickly, low energy, hard to concentrate on anything. I usually just eat and then veg with some video games. But right now I actually feel like I could keep going with this project.

I don't expect this feeling to last indefinitely but I'm sure enjoying it now.",19

Today is the first day in months where i didnt smoke for a whole day. I plan to keep it going for at least a week, if im strong enough even longer, but i realise i maybe need to quit this habit in phases… I decided to quit cold turkey, and i need some advice. 

Im a 20yr old college student who started ocassionally smoking with friends around 16. Now, due to covid lockdowns and online classes, ive had a lot of free time and boredom in my live. My smoking habit went out of hand and i found myself smoking 2 to 3 jojnts every damn day… i got this fucked up voice in my mind that asks me wherever or whenever i am “when im gonna be able to smoke again”, having these thoughts all the time are killing me on the inside

I feel that it doesnt do my any good anymore and im hiding this problem for my wonderful gf of 2 years. She knows i smoke sometimes but doenst know im addicted like this. I wont tell her because it will only hurt her… If any of you have had similar experiences or advice, im eternally grateful

Hang in there everybody,

Love from Belgium",2

I'm embarrassed to say that my first post to this subreddit was 6 years ago now. I always found a reason to justify my continued use, and I really didn't think I would quit altogether anytime soon, until Thanksgiving this last Thursday.

Basically, I smoke everyday, even if it's just a tiny baby hit off a pipe after work before I go in the house. On Thanksgiving, I smoked a bowl (just one singular bowl) a few hours before we were set to have Thanksgiving dinner at my house. Everything was normal, I took a half-hour nap and then got up to start making some side dishes with my boyfriend. I was making green bean casserole when my vision began to go yellow, my ears began to ring, and my head went all swimmy. I told my boyfriend I needed to sit down and I did but it didn't help; the feeling just got more and more overwhelming and scary.

The next thing I know, my boyfriend was yelling at me frantically, trying to wake me up. I had passed out and fallen off the chair.

When I came to, my vision was black. I continued to go in and out of consciousness. My boyfriend was so scared he made the decision to call 911 despite me begging him not to. Looking back, it was definitely the right thing to do. I was not acting right by any stretch of the imagination. At one point my vision was blue and purple.

The responders took my vitals and they were fine. I was told I could just sleep it off and go to urgent care if needed. Basically the worst part was the embarrassment of essentially ruining Thanksgiving because I chose to get high, as well as some bruises from my fall.

The sad thing is, this has happened to me 3 other times previously, approximately once a year. I did not pass out completely the other times but lost my vision momentarily and couldn't control my body. If this had happened while I was behind the wheel, I don't even want to think of what could have transpired.

At this point, I know that smoking is a game of Russian Roulette. This WILL happen again if I keep smoking, it's just a matter of when. I never want to put my boyfriend in that position ever again; he was so terrified. He is a nursing student with lots of experience treating patients yet when he was trying to take my vitals he just kept shaking and crying. I want to do everything I can to prevent it from ever happening again. 

I have done online research on this and have found posts of other people stating it happened to them. They believe it to be a sudden drop in blood pressure likely caused by not eating or drinking enough before smoking. I will be seeing a doctor about it in case it is more serious. 

Anyway, I'm scared to quit. Despite this scary event, I still wish I could keep smoking. But I'm not that dumb. I know it's time. I wanted to share my experience with you all because your posts have really helped me so far and I will continue to read for support. Thanks for reading.

TLDR; I smoked on Thanksgiving, had a bad reaction that caused me to pass out, and 911 was called.",3

I am able to study for hours on end and not get distracted; I passed an exam I was putting off for over a year and I am continuing to study for more certifications. 

I had deep revelations about who my real friends are and who was just around when I was smoking weed. 

I have never had a better relationship with my family than after I quit smoking weed. 

I don’t need to smoke to entertain myself/avoid boredom anymore. I am perfectly content with playing video games, watching a movie, spending time with people, eating out, etc. all without feeling the need to smoke weed. 

I have zero cravings! When the thought of weed does come into my mind, it just makes me reflect on how much life changed for the better since I quit.

That’s now more than half of my life! 

My wife and I have been trying to have a baby, and the doctor tells us that I would have to be sober for at least 3 month before they can offer us treatment. 

So now I’m about 40 hours sober. 

I’m sweaty, irritable, uncomfortable. My heart races randomly. I barely slept last night and woke up drenched when I did. It is utterly awful. 

I’ve been reading the posts on here and it’s inspiring me to quit for good. I have been telling myself it’s only until we have a baby, but if I’m honest with myself, I think I would be much better off learning to facing the escapism fuelling the addiction and let go of the dependency. 

I don’t know. There are so many possible excuses. 

My life is great. It isn’t falling apart from my usage. I have my own business and I’m halfway through my PhD. I’ve always been incredibly productive even while being high all the time. I have been telling myself I smoke to help me cope with a chaotic life. 

Even my business partners don’t know how much I smoke. I take pride in that I’m a high functioning addict. 

I can’t muster up the motivation to say “no more! Never again.” I am holding onto the belief that this is temporary. But a part of me wishes that I’d never have to go through this again and that probably means letting go of weed completely.

Then I sat there momentarily, knowing I was going to give it back to my mom, but realizing that a year ago I would have stolen it without a thought. In those moments before running to show her what I found, I felt so much gratitude for my recovery and for the integrity that has come back.",1492

I’ve had a handful of friends pass away recently due to more sever drug addictions and I can’t help but to think that I could find myself on this path too if I were presented with a different drug. 
While weed has not impacted my work or relationships directly, I can’t help but to feel like I am only giving a portion of my potential self each day. 
I used to have a strong exercise and meal prepping routine and that has not been consistent since I’ve become a daily smoker. I love exercising, it’s what I know my body craves and desires to help battle daily stress and depression. However, now I have completely replaced that with smoking weed.
I feel a strong sense of defeat, I never wanted to become a daily smoker and now I feel like I’ve gotten myself into a hole and I’m really having a tough time getting out of it.

With some sober time behind me and with the new ability to look back more objectivity I've made some interesting observations.

Weed caused me to lie to myself to help justify my usage and I believed this for a long time.

**Lie:** Weed helps me sleep. **Correction:** Weed was causing sleeplessness. I couldn't sleep without it. Sleep without weed is much more restful.

**Lie:** Weed reduces anxiety and helps me relax. **Correction:** Long term use of weed caused my anxiety to rise way above my normal baseline. The best way to quell that was with more weed, leading to an endless and seemingly inescapable loop.

**Lie:** Weed enhanced activities like socializing. **Correction:** Weed caused me to be inside my head way more than normal. I'd worry about weird things that don't even matter and wouldn't even cross my sober mind. ""They totally know that I am not handling the way air is touching my arm right now."" - you'll get that reference if you're a comedy fan.

**Lie:** Weed gives me creativity and insight I'd not normally have access to. **Correction:** It would be adding to the lie if I denied that there was a weak thread of truth to this. However, those ideas would either be too outrageous, not grounded in reality or accompanied by a lack of motivation and ambition to actually do anything with it.

**Lie:** Weed makes me connect with people better. **Correction:** That was an illusion. I may have felt a connection but the reality is that it was not possible for me to really be in tune with people. I was not present with them during interactions, self absorbed and not truly there.

**Lie:** Using weed is almost like a super power others don't have. I'm special. **Correction:** Weed robbed me of time I can never get back. For each perceived benefit there were many drawbacks. I wasn't special and weed didn't give me any advantages in life. It held me back in ways that I'll never know. Who knows what decisions I may have made, or may not have made if weed wouldn't have been in the picture. Who would I have been as a person if I would have spent all that time sober instead? I didn't have a super power, I was pushed down by burdened of addiction. I wasn't in touch with who I really was. I was letting myself and those around me down. I minimized the harms it was causing and lied and falsely believed there were countless benefits. I believe I needed to identify with weed and being a stoner to be myself. I thought I was less of a person without weed but the opposite was true.",80

It gives me a false sense of happiness and contentment. Once that wears off, the world feels twice as heavy.

Weed does not soothe my anxiety long-term. In the short term, maybe, but only by dulling my senses and tuning me out of the things that cause me anxiety (school, relationships, work). Once again, the anxiety is twofold once I’m sober, because I’m still anxious and I’ve successfully avoided doing anything about it.

Weed does not make me a better person. It makes me someone more concerned with my opportunities to smoke than chances to be with friends, learn something, plan for my future. It’s made me an inattentive partner, a poor student, a distant friend. It has robbed me of my sense of self and control over my life, and I’m just grateful to be getting it back.

Everyone's recovery is going to be a bit different and I remember that for me, referring to other's timelines who had been there before me was helpful and motivating.

**TLDR:** The first two weeks were really bad. Over the next 6 months things slowly improved but was still a struggle. After 6 months to a year things gradually got better. Between the 1 year mark and now I've been able to focus more on life and I feel like I have purpose in life again. I'm happy where I am in life and feel like I'm moving forward and not stagnating like I was with weed.

**Day 0 to 2 weeks**

The most intense part. Pretty much thought about weed all the time but was determined. Peaked around the end of first week and tapered down over the next week. Physically uncomfortable, sleep was nearly impossible, just a few hours at a time at best. Mood was shit, I felt very flat. My work productivity was near zero. Almost no appetite at all, I didn't eat much these two weeks. I just did my best to take care of myself, slept when I could, ate when I could, relaxed when I could. Kept reminding myself this is only temporary.

**Week 2 to 2 months**

Still thought about weed pretty frequently but part of my strategy was to redirect my thoughts when that would come up. I started getting a lot of headaches, a few times a week. I napped quite a bit during this period - something which I didn't do very often before. I took hot baths to try to sooth myself. My mood wasn't very good. Not as bad as the first two weeks and while there was some improvement it wasn't much. Sleep started to get a little better but still very spotty. Appetite was starting to come back a little bit.

**Two months to 4 months**

This is the time frame where I started to notice some minor improvements. Things still weren't great. I noticed that I had a lot of anxiety and was depressed or felt low quite often. My motivation was pretty low. Also plagued by anhedonia - life didn't really bring me a lot of joy. I found it difficult to engage at work - sometimes I'd cancel or avoid meetings because I had trouble doing social interactions. Physically I felt fine by now. The headaches were going away, sleep, while not perfect was now adequate at least. Appetite was fine and I was eating on a regular schedule. Life was feeling pretty boring but I had faith that this too was temporary and that things would eventually get better. I was buckled in for the long haul.

**Four to 6 months**

This is where some more significant improvements started. Life began to have a bit of a shimmer again. I felt more alive. I felt certain excitement for things again, even if it was vague and minimal - it was there. Anxiety and depression were still present but started getting more manageable.  Sleep was even better than before, but still not 100% but at least I felt rested most of the time. I didn't need as many naps anymore and I don't think headaches were a problem at this point. I was not 100% but this was the the window of time where it was undeniable things were improving. Thoughts of weed still popped up here and there but my redirecting technique was working. I knew those old patterns of thought would be with me for a long time (if not forever) but it didn't really cause me any grief. I really felt like I was moving on.

**Six months to 1 year**

Steady improvement here. Very slow and gradual improvement but things were getting better and life felt more normal. My emotions started to return here. Anhedonia was lessening and I was getting more satisfaction from life. I was motivated to do things. Anxiety and depression weren't as much of an issue. I felt like I was really starting to find my place in (sober) life again. Sleep was almost back to normal and I was adjusted to the normal routine and rhythm of life. I kept working on my coping skills here and learning about my emotional health and things that I could do to cope with challenging feelings.

**Year 1 to 1.5**

The struggle with adapting to the sober life is all but completely behind me at this point. Finally I can focus my emotional and mental resources on improving my life instead of recovering. There are still some lingering PAWS (post-acute withdrawal symptoms) but its very minimal now. Do I ever get tempted by the appeal of the old lifestyle? Sure - but I know that 1 hit = right back to full blown daily use and it squashes any thought of weed pretty quickly. It's not a problem and I never dwell on it. Sober life is too important to me to risk it. I challenge myself socially now like being able to get through work meeting way more effectively and being more articulate and confident. When I go to stores I read the name tags of workers and call them by their name (I've never done this before in my life, even though I always wanted to). Lots of little improvements create big improvements. This is the most stress free I have been in life in a very long time. My relationships have improved because I put effort into them. I'm more in tune with people and the world. I'm starting to know what it feels like to be comfortable in life and to have purpose. Am I happy all the time? No - that's not how life works. Are all my problems gone and life just one day of bliss after another? Of course not - that would be an invalid expectation. I'm motivated to get out of bed every day because I'm curious of what life will bring and more confident in my ability to deal with whatever it may be - good or bad. I like life.",98

I had to quit immediately after finding out I was pregnant end of August (it was rather unexpected. We hadn’t officially started trying yet). I did end up quitting last January in preparation for this to happen to prove myself I was capable of not smoking and my mental state is COMPLETELY different this time. My motivation to quit mentally was 10/10. I was fully accepting of a sober life. If I magically woke up not pregnant tomorrow I would absolutely light up and not think twice of it. I miss it so much. I miss getting together with my best girlfriend and sharing a joint and laughing at life. 

It makes no sense to me because I thought growing a life would be huge motivation and give me drive to not want weed. I haven’t smoked in 3.5 months since I found out and I just miss it so much- unlike when I quit before and I was all in. How do I get back to a 10 on the motivation scale? This hiatus from weed may have to be for good, because I plan to breast feed and it’s still a big no-no during that time. So that’ll be at least a year of being weed-free at which point, why go back? 

I just needed to get this out because I feel guilty about it for some reason, even though I’ve been “good”.",5

It started out with just 3-4 times a month, but quickly became a weekly habit, and over the last few weeks and months even a daily habit. 

I never really looked at myself as a weed smoker, but over the last few months i felt really bad so many times because of my weed usage. I dont want to use terms like anxiety or depression , but i feel like i have lost all my confidence. I feel like i am not the same person anymore, especially when i am with my parents. I dont think they know that i am smoking weed. They love me so much, and everytime i am with them, i feel so fucking bad to disappoint them like that.

I want to become a lawyer and i feel like the weed could threaten that goal. So i decided to quit.

I took a similar decision with regards to drinking more than a year ago which I'm proud to say I quit practically completely except for a sip here or there every couple of months and even that is becoming less frequent as I'm identifying myself as a teetotaler to stop anyone from trying to convince me. 

I smoked for the first time this year. I was going through a rough break-up and I wanted to try something new and cool. Didn't feel much the first time, I guess because I didn't inhale properly so I wanted to try again and feel it. 

Then I made a friend who was a heavy user. He never forced me to do it, I chose to. It was fun as a novelty but I never liked the feeling. It was intense and exhausting.

The worst part is the paranoia. It affected my perception of my friends. It made me suspicious and a bit hostile towards them.

And certainly, just as with drinking, I would always make a fool out of myself which I very much didn't like especially when it happened with a girl I was hooking up with but whom I was starting to like. 

Smoking drained my energy to exercise, study, work, and perform my home and life chores. 

A sobering realisation was meeting and getting to know many long-term users that busted the imaginary aura of ""coolness"" that I had constructed around them. Many were living in not so pleasant life conditions. 

Again, I'm trying to be reasonable, few if any had their life destroyed by it but I could always feel they were being held back by smoking and the lifestyle in general which is a point worth emphasising too. 

Finally, I like sobriety. The state of mind I'm most familiar with. I know how to act and how my acts are perceived and I enjoy seeing the world as it is. 

I don't regret trying it and having these experiences, just as with alcohol I believe it takes many fuck ups to completely internalise that no, this time won't be different and that it always ends up the same.

I'm excited that I will have to deal with one fewer burden in life as there are enough in mine already. 

Don't forget to reflect and good luck to all!",2

:/

I’ve never posted in this sub but I’ve been an intermittent lurker for a while now. I love the community and support so I figured I’d share my story too. It makes it more real to talk about it and type it all out.

I’ve been a daily smoker since I was about 15/16. I’m 24 now, so almost 9 years of daily smoking during my formative years. In high school and college (before I dropped out, lol) I experimented heavily with other drugs. Along the way I also picked up the other kind of smoking addiction (idk if automod will remove it) and am now a vaper. I guess I should be happy I never fell into anything “harder”.

I think I have some repressed memories about childhood sexual abuse that may have occurred. I was hyper sexual as a child, and I’ve struggled with my mental health for literally as long as I can remember. I remember being like 13/14 and asking one of my friends if he ever thought about killing himself, and he was like, “what no! That’s crazy!” And that’s when I realized that most people probably don’t feel like I do all the time.

I’m also gay, and I was in a really toxic and unhealthy relationship with a girl for my entire high school career. She knew I was gay, and I tried to break up with her so many times but she had issues too and I couldn’t successfully leave the relationship until I left for college. At that time she got pregnant and ended up having an abortion, which was really hard and traumatic for both of us. Like everything else in my life, I smoked weed about it and “felt better”.

When I got to college I was really depressed and fiending for a fix. I was at a dorm meeting and picked out one girl who “looked” like she smoked weed a lot and became friends with her so I would have access in my new city. I found a friend group who was all into drugs and got really deep into that lifestyle for about a year. I ended up dropping out and living in a trap house for a while. I luckily escaped that scene and lived with this guy who I had a really unhealthy not-quite-relationship with for a couple years.

Fast forward a few more years to me being 22 and I re-enrolled in nursing school (thank god for fake pee!). It was around this time that I reckoned with myself and realized I was hopelessly addicted to weed. I made a resolution to myself to quit, and about 5 months ago I finally quit. I did it!
I was clean and sober for two months. I felt so good! Still depressed, but I was managing it and I finally felt like I could accomplish things and be a real person. Maybe I wasn’t really a weed addict? Plenty of people smoke weed without any problems. It’s not even addictive!

Narrator: He was wrong.

I convinced myself that I was like a normal person and I could just smoke every once in a while. Of course that was just the addict part of my brain trying to self-sabotage again. I smoked once, then again two days later, then again the day after, and then all day everyday whenever I wasn’t somewhere I couldn’t be high. I was addicted again. Of course I never really stopped being an addict in the first place.

My motivation and social activities once again fell of the face of the earth. I stopped doing my homework, stopped seeing my few friends, and barely held it together. That brings us to now.

I am so so behind on school work, and if I fail one more class I am dropped from the program. My future as a nurse over before it began. My professors have been understanding up until this point because I disclosed my depression, but I’m so behind now idk what’s gonna happen. Hopefully I can turn it in late and they’ll be okay with that.

I finally quit again 5 days ago and am deep into the withdrawals now. I know not everybody experiences them, and that they’re different for everybody, but for me I get SO FUCKING DEPRESSED. I can’t do anything. Everything feels so hard and I have no motivation at all to do anything. I just wanna lay down and not wake up. Or maybe drive off a cliff or something. I know I won’t do it, and I know it will pass, it’s just so hard :/.

I want to be normal. I want to not be an addict. I want to be happy. I want to be free of this drug.

The hardest part of all of this is I’m fucking smart! I don’t wanna be cocky, but school comes easily to me. I haven’t studied at all this semester (like not at all, not trying to exaggerate) and I’ve been easily getting ~85’s on all my exams. I have so much potential and it’s just all been wasted. I wanted so badly to be a doctor growing up, and I could easily have done it. It’s just this fucking depression and self-medicating with weed that has fucked me over.

When I smoke weed everything feels better. I don’t hurt. I don’t think about the stresses of school. I don’t worry about having so few friends and ignoring them all the time. I’m high. I’m good.

But really I’m so fucking low. I don’t hurt because I’m sleeping, jerking off, and smoking all day. I don’t worry about school because I don’t have any motivation to do any school work, so who cares. I ignore my friends because I’m so awkward and dumb when I’m high.

Weed does not help. I don’t want to smoke it anymore. I want my life back.

I guess that’s it. Im sorry it’s so long and rambling, I just needed to get it off my chest. Thanks for listening guys, and here’s to hoping I’ll actually stay clean this time!",4
2021-11-29 00:12:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/r4o6pw/lurking_for_a_while_finally_posting_20_days/,"Lurking for a While, Finally Posting - 20 Days","Hi everyone,

I've been lurking this subreddit for about a month now and finally decided to make my first post.

I started my journey on November 10th, just a few days after my 30th birthday. I decided I did not want to bring this addiction any further into my adulthood/life. On top of that, I finally was able to land my dream position as a graduate research assistant while I get through my graduate program.

I am a pretty ambitious person, but I could tell that for the past year or so, there are so many things that I have wanted to do or tried to do, but simply could not because everything just felt so overwhelming and stressful and so I would just stay in and smoke. I could tell myself any excuses - that I was doing well in school and doing everything I needed to do to survive but the reality as many of you know is that it is JUST enough and no more.

I wanted more and I kept increasingly getting more and more frustrated with myself at my inability to be more social, take on more responsibilities and just get out there and live life more.

At first I thought I would quit or drastically cut down once my long distance girlfriend and I moved in together after I graduated grad school, but there kept being a worry at the back of my mind wondering if I was even going to be able to quit when I needed to. Plus, I always worried about dealing with withdrawals whenever I fly out to see her. I didn't want to be gross sweaty, irritable and unable to eat any of her amazing dishes, or even struggle to fall asleep together.

So, it was the culmination of me turning 30, me trying to take full advantage of my graduate program and every research opportunity I can take and wanting a positive future with my girlfriend without any of this getting in the way that made me finally throw it all away.

Oddly for me, the first few days weren't that bad. Day 1 and 2 I had sleeplessness, minimal appetite but not bad, and that was about it. But boy was I in for a world of hurting come Day 3-6.

Night sweats and day sweats like crazy, horrible, horrible nausea like I have never experienced and absolute lethargy. When I quit, I was due to start my new position in about a week, but because the nausea was so bad and unpredictable I had to miss the first few days of work.

On top of that, I had tried to be more social and keep my mind occupied, so on day 4 I tried going to the movie theater with a buddy to see Dune - but only made it 40 minutes in before I had to run home to puke my guts out the rest of the day.

By day 7 -14, the nausea was pretty much completely gone. But my appetite was gone too. The sweats were still there, but I was able to sleep okay at this point.

Day 15, the nausea came back this particular morning with a vengeance. I am never able to eat in the morning since my appetite is still gone until at least 12pm and I can manage to nibble a little, but yeah , this happened to be Thanksgiving morning too and I had to cook, but I spent the first several hours horribly nauseas and trying to vomit so I could try to feel better. Luckily it did subside after a few hours but it was horrible to show up to my parents only to spend a lot of the time in the bathroom.

Fortunately after that episode, I was able to eat a lot of the Thanksgiving food decently so that was good.

Day 16 - 20 (Present) - I feel pretty good overall. My sleep is great, but I have to sleep a lot still. I can't wait for the day to have my energy back, but until then it seems all I can do is sleep every free moment I have. After Thanksgiving I spent all Friday and Saturday sleeping, pretty much. My appetite is still not back and it can be easy for me to feel sort of sick by eating too quickly or too much or when my body just isn't ready to eat. The sweats are still really bad as well. Probably the most annoying and embarrassing thing to deal with when out and about. Fortunately where I work the keep the temp about 18 degrees Celsius so it helps me not sweat as much there.

Edit: I also wanted to add that, I am a recovering alcoholic - last drink was early July 2016 and I experienced basically no withdrawals compared to marijuana. It's honestly nuts to me. The worst thing I dealt with from the alcohol withdrawals was depression and boredom, but I don't recall dealing with any physical issues, (I do know that they can be really bad - lethal even). I would have never in a million years guessed that I would experience worse withdrawal from weed than from alcohol. Who'da thunk.

Anyway, I just wanted to finally share my story/journey so far. I'll keep on keeping on. I'll be visiting my girlfriend sometime in February or March and I really look forward to having months behind me and being mostly my normal self by then.",11

A couple of weeks later I went to the doctor and was told I have a right bundle branch block (rbbb) reading on my ECG. I don’t know if it was the weed that caused it or if it was already there. Have been anxious and have also had a lot of cravings the last 28 days. I really am trying to stick to being sober and living a long healthy life.

I have my masters, have always have a had a career I enjoy and thrive in, have a great family, HAD a wife, house, dog, and friends. Practiced gratitude, gardened, meditated, exercised-ish. Pretty much if you weren’t in my inner circle, you had no idea I was a habitual smoker. Looked like the American dream. 

Over the past year, got divorced, moved 5 times and my dog died (still hurts tremendously). I still thrive professionally, but emotionally and financially I’m broke. I don’t blame weed for what has happened to me. My frankly complete lack of emotions. And living in my head. I’ve known I’ve needed to quit for years but just kept going deeper. I’m also at a point where I can forgive myself a TINY bit because…well if you’re reading this you know why. 

I have no idea who I am without weed. Am I really the POS guy who is selfish and self loathing. Or am I the guy in my thoughts who is positive, understanding, and lives in the moment? The latter has really never seen the light of day. 

I guess that’s the real fear. Right now, I can look at weed and say “yup once I quit that all my problems will be easier” but then never do, because what if my problems are harder and now there is nothing left to “quit” for a better life. I hope that makes sense. 

I have to quit at this point because the decision is SOOO BIG now. Just one day is terrifying. I have some anxiety meds I can take but not a fan of how those make me feel. Guess it’s worth it if it gets me off weed.

Thanks for letting me rant a bit. I Wish you all the best. And if no one has told you lately, I’m proud of you❤️",42

A lot of big life changes have happened since, namely graduating from university, getting a full time job, officially moving out of my parents house, and joining a 12-step program. 

I want to quit smoking weed because weed brings out my inner fears and puts them on the table, in a way that makes it difficult for me to process. I struggle with social anxiety, depression, and anxiety, and while weed is a coping mechanism for me, it isn’t a healthy or productive one right now, at least not the quantity that I am consuming. 

However I notice that I am struggling to accept that despite my intentions with smoking it, it does not help me. When I smoke I become extremely self-critical and because of my trauma, has worsened my depersonalization/de realization.

As I type this, I feel that I smoke because even though it doesn’t bring on healthy feelings, I feel more in control of these situations because I decided to smoke, knowing that would happen.. if that makes sense? I’ve experienced lows without weed in situations where I had little to no control, so the weed mimics that but on my terms if that makes sense. It’s sick. I need help.",2

I'm bracing myself for things to get worse than they are right now. Bracing myself for new waves of anxiety, depression, craving, physical symptoms, insomnia... I'm scared of confronting the future when things already feel so bad. Scared that even if I make it through the 2 week hump, the first month, that I'm going to be struggling for much longer. Scared of what things will look like in 6 months. That I'll still be struggling.

But then I realized that no matter how bad it feels, it probably won't be worse than I've already experienced.

I'm quitting because the anxiety got so awful.  
Because I kept hacking up phlegm that looked dirty.  
Because I started having heart palpitations that scared me.  
Because it was so unbearably uncomfortable to just EXIST at work.  
Because I felt guilty about not fulfilling my responsibilities to other people.  
Because I felt so flat and so low and so damn depressed.  
Because I felt scared all the time, by mundane shit.  
Because I couldn't eat and I had no appetite if I wasn't smoking. And if I did smoke, I didn't have the energy to cook a good meal or feed myself anything but junk.  
Because I was spending all this time tormenting myself, replaying conversations or interactions in my head, feeling like I had messed up, even if I had done nothing wrong.  
Because I wasn't on track with my goals and it was hard to push myself to care, much less to get it done.  
Because it made my head so foggy and my executive functioning so much worse.  
Because my life was painful, not where I wanted it to be, and I knew it COULD be so much better.

So you know what...if I could take all that shit, if I could withstand being internally tormented for years, I think I can handle a few measly withdrawal symptoms. Bring it on...

(That being said, I'm still a little scared, so if you have any helpful advice...bring that on as well, please. <3)",10

I was flipping people off if they pulled out in front of me while driving like 3 times yesterday ahah. Just a lack of interest in things it’s almost like I gotta SOMEWHAT force myself to do something that usually I enjoy but once I do it I’m fine but that lack of interest still makes me want to not keep doing that thing (video games mainly). And third! This is a big one, my appetite. I never, and I mean never, want to eat only time I will eat is if my stomach is like hurting or growling then I logically think we’ll I should probably eat. That’s a good thing because the reason I quit/am quitting is because I want to overall be better and just lose weight because when I have weed just in my system my interest in food is higher and in recent times I’ve lost weight effortlessly when I stopped smoking so hoorah to that.

I used to be a 30-40 joints a day toker, but quit cold turkey.  I would come home from work, instantly roll a joint, and while smoking, get right to rolling at least 5 more, and would have smoked 5 in 30 minutes to myself just to feel normal.  It hasn't been easy, though.  I work right across the street from a cannabis store;  it's 20 feet away and visible all day through the window.  


I say ""sorta"" and ""willingly"" because there was an incident where I was hotboxed at a board game night at a friend's place.  They were smoking indoors while we were playing, and when the windows were open, it was completely fine.  At it got later, it got chilly and the windows were shut.  It got to a point where I was starting to have trouble concentrating on the game.  I couldn't think properly, and I didn't realize why.  I had to leave before the game was over, and they seemed miffed, although they didn't say anything.  It wasn't until I got home that I realized I was stoned.  It was such an unfamiliar feeling at that point that I didn't recognize it, and I didn't like the feeling.


They weren't just smoking basic weed either.  They were doing bong hits of things like shatter, wax and fucking *diamonds*, which I'd never heard of but are basically crystals that are 99% thc.  No wonder I was stoned.  Afterwards, I was pissed.  Should I restart my days counted?  I did get stoned, although it wasn't my fault, and I got away from it as soon as I could.  


That number is really important to me, and is often the *only* thing that keeps me from relapsing.  I worked hard for each of these days, and the counter going higher (pun unintended) keeps me motivated.  It's one of the things in my life that I am the most proud of, because cannabis has nearly ruined my life.  The last 20 years of my life have basically gone up in smoke.  I'm 43 and broke, with no savings, assets and a minimum wage job.  I'm finally starting to turn my life around and it wouldn't have been remotely possible without quitting the devil's lettuce.


This friend has been passive-aggressive with me a lot lately too, especially in regard to board game nights, which I am frequenting less and less.  I know I need to talk to him, but I'm worried I'm going to explode on him if I do.  He's 95% one of the best friends I've had and 5% passive-aggressive bitch.  There are other issues that factor in here too that aren't related to cannabis.  I have my own issues that negatively affect our friendship that I need to deal with too, so I'm not 100% in the right either, but the fact that he hotboxed me knowing how much weed has negatively affected my life and how difficult it was to quit still pisses me off.


This wasn't meant to be a long rant.  I just noticed that it was 7 months today and wanted to say something.  Thanks for listening.",4

Today is my first day toward learning to be sober. I've been smoking for about 2.5 years, heavily for most of it and almost every day. The longest I think I've gone sober since starting is probably only a couple days. Last night I had a psychotic experience that in a way broke me. It was my breaking point. I started to dissociate after taking a dab, something I do nightly. Dissociation turned into a psychotic experience, hearing voices, the world shrinking around me and a feeling of existential dread. I'm done. I can't do it anymore. It happened one other time a couple months ago while high just less severe. I've been riding an anxiety high all day from it. I don't know where I'm going from here but I can't go back, not for a while. Thanks for reading, talk to you guys soon.",46

Started weed with the occasional edible once a week/ every two weeks, over a year and a half it progressed to daily, multiple times a day use. Today marks 7 weeks sober and while I'm proud of myself for hitting that... I'm so ashamed. 

I'm ashamed of the choices I made while high, I'm ashamed of living life in a daze for a year, for driving while under the influence,  for risking my life and those of others around me. 

I'm ashamed of the risky sex I had with people who were basically strangers while high, the way I feel like I used people and didn't give anything back. 

It's like in turning off my passion with weed, I turned off my capacity for empathy and self reflection too. Everything was just about the next time I could use,  and I was never high enough. 

I wanted to be anywhere or be doing anything other than existing in the present moment,  because to actually feel it was unbearably painful, and weed got me that, but at a price.

I feel so distant from friends,  family,  loved ones. 

I know I'm making the right choice but now that I'm not numbed from pain as much...I have to live with my past choices, and right now I'm hating myself for them",5

We decided a week ago that weed adds nothing positive to our lives and makes us lazy and unmotivated. So we just quit cold turkey.

Our college friends are also stoners but we love them of course. Regardless of the smoking they are lovely, fun, thoughtful people. We decided to make them a thanksgiving dinner last night. I let them know that there would be no smoking on our end but they could if they wanted to. but to my surprise, NOBODY SMOKED.

It was such a beautiful thing to sit around the table with them and have vibrant conversations. No post-weed haze silence. Just making plans and talking about things we hadn’t talked about before.

On the plus side, my brother has been through the exact same thing and I know he can lift my spirits, and I'm soo happy to finally see him after 4 years, and another plus is that I'm not craving weed one bit, if anything the idea of getting high right now scares me. On the other side, I know I'm about to drop a massive load of disappointment on my family this week. 

I know my brother is going to feel like it's his fault because I pretty much repeated his mistakes and he knows that in many ways, I look up to him, I just thought I'd have a better handle on weed than he did, I guess at some point the weed just took over me just like it did him. 

I also thought about my ex all day long, I know I'm at very vulnerable place right now and that's probably why I just want her by my side. I feel lonely!

I just don't get it, the other day I was soo happy and thankful for being able to finally let go of weed and I had , but today is like a cloud of sadness just kept raining on me, no matter how much shade I tried to find, it was always there.

2021-11-28 12:34:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/r49lj9/experiences_since_quitting/,Experiences since quitting,"Hey everyone,

I've been a lurker on this page for a long time now. I'm a young guy, just turning 20 next year. Between the ages of my late 16s to 18s, I was a frequent smoker. The summer into senior year, I was smoking every single day, multiple times a day. I knew it was bad for me but I kept doing it because I lived in a household that not only accepted my habit but encouraged it over drinking. I'm not here writing today to discourage usage of the green and instead drink, because that is not only a fallacy in judgement but not my place to decide. But, I digress. I continued on and off for the majority of 2021. However, nearing the end of this summer, I realized something: weed was literally not bringing me any pleasure, whatsoever. It was ruining my sleep schedule, throwing my appetite way off, and the biggest turn off for me that took way too long to realize: my drive to be successful in life was being completely and utterly destroyed. Yeah, I was learning to code, I was practicing investing to live more easily, but I was not really seeing any good, real success. Simply put, I was not living my best life. I have not smoked in nearly 4 months. The personal progress I have made in these months sober have been the most successful of my life. I am in the process of joining a startup as a UX and UI designer, pitching my ideas to the developer team, and hoping to soon become a dev myself, as well as seeing tremendous success in other capital markets. My hobbies are returning too, where my nights aren't clouded with vegging out and watching tv, but rather being productive - reading, coding, and playing with cryptocurrency. Removing weed from my life has been the best decision I've made so far. My dreams in life are so much clearer - no wasted time, no negative emotions or anxiety derived from THC, and better mindfulness. In my case, parting ways with the one thing I had stuck with for the past 3 years was the very best thing I could do for myself. That's all, I just wanted to share the remarkably positive experience I have had with quitting. It is 1,000% worth the effort.",5
2021-11-28 12:34:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/r49ld8/the_importance_of_realization/,The Importance of Realization,"As a disclaimer, this is a very long post as a result of a long internal conflict I’d never really told anybody in my life about before. I felt I needed to vent for my own sake and just to put it in words for me, and hopefully it might help you too if you’d like to read about it.

I’ve been an on and off smoker for the past 3-4 years now. Smoking in the first place is one of the greatest regrets I have in life. 

This past year (around the beginning of May), I started to regularly smoke again after quitting for my sophomore year spring college semester. Typically, after every finals week I’ve had in college, I somehow found myself smoking again. I told myself before every semester,

“I’m going to quit. I’m going to quit. I’m going to quit.” It was the classic trap of “I can quit anytime I want.” I’ve done it before, so it’s easy to do again, right?

It worked every semester up until this fall. The illusion is that every time you quit and start again, it feels 25x harder to quit the next time.

This past summer, I smoked way too much. I smoked while working. I smoked while engaging in my hobbies. I smoked before every meal. It became a routine. It wasn’t fair to the people around me, the job I worked, and it wasn’t fair to my body physically and mentally. 

I never told anybody about my addiction, and the friends I talked to (when we discussed weed or smoking) always perceived me as somebody “on and off” with weed despite that being far from the truth. A trait I’ve developed that I hate is that I always mask my issues and unhealthily cope and allow them to exist. 

My outward persona of a “controlled smoker” was like a lie that my friends (who didn’t know the reality) kept praising me for, and it was a reassurance that I told myself to justify continuing to smoke. I have a very strained and disconnected relationship with my family, and that specific emotional trauma that I’ve lived with for as long as I can remember didn’t help. Smoking was my excuse to temporarily numb the pain from that, too.

What added onto my issues was that I’ve always been somebody driven by the fear of failure. I was a good student in high school; tried hard, got good grades, created a great path for myself in college. I got into a great engineering program with resources I could only dream of. The people that knew I smoked who also knew about my academic successes thought I was a paradigm for the balance between smoking and life. At the time, that might have been true. The hardest thing I’ve ever had to admit, honestly just to myself, was that this balance slipped away from me. It was a shot to my ego that was hard for me to put into words, but you never really take action against something like this until you’re backed into a corner. 

Come late August when it’s time to move into my apartment on campus at my university, I had to make the decision of bringing or not bringing my weed up with me. I convinced myself I’d do it socially, and for extracurricular reasons. My in person college experience for the past 2.5 semesters was robbed from me due to COVID and I told myself weed would make it much more fun. I gave myself so many fake justifications, and I brought the weed with me.

This was far from reality. It turned into me smoking before eating, smoking before sleeping, and just being high for too much time. I procrastinated on my work, was driven away from my clubs and fun events, stayed in when I got invited to go out just because I was an idiot and got high. I honestly started using weed for excuses to avoid doing almost everything. It was terrible.

Every time I got high I told myself “when I come down, I’ll just get my work done then.” You can probably guess I never got anything done until I absolutely had to, and when I did get it done, the quality was shitty and had no substance. This is the worst semester I’ve ever had exam grade-wise just because I was too lazy from being high to put the work in and study. This whole semester I’ve been in a constant internal battle between my body’s desire for weed and the spirit in me that wanted to succeed, and it started to tear me apart. It was unhealthy and felt like it was eating a little piece of me every single day.

Over this Thanksgiving break I reached a breaking point. There was a night of self reflection where I felt paralyzed. I kept thinking of the time I wasted, the opportunities that I missed, and the life I didn’t get to live this semester just because of weed. It hurt, and it hurt bad. I cried to myself, I don’t even know for how long. I’m (unfortunately) a very emotionally cold and closed person, so crying to me felt foreign and crazy. I couldn’t tell you the last time I cried before that night. I had so much work that I didn’t do because I got high. I realized how bad my grades were slipping because I spent too much time high. I realized I was genuinely in a position to fail and it was killing me. I thought I was on a helpless track where I was throwing my life down a drain.

I had lived this fake life for so long of not telling anybody about my issues and letting them live under my bed. I got high over break one more time, but the more I got high the more anxious I got and the more my issues started to flood my brain. I was finally tired of it. The next morning I flushed my weed down the toilet and threw my paraphernalia out. It sounds easy, but holy shit, it was one of the most difficult things I’ve ever done. But I’m glad I found the strength to do it at the time I did.

A few days clean now, I still crave weed. My body isn’t used to not smoking. I can feel that I’m going through withdrawals, but I know I can’t do anything about it. I’m cranky sometimes, don’t wanna do stuff other times, but I’m just pushing through it. Time will heal it.

I’m forcing myself to be motivated, but I’m glad. I hadn’t woken up from sleep and genuinely felt refreshed in so long (weed blocked REM and I honestly probably hadn’t really ‘slept’ in months). I’m keeping myself active, regimenting my days again, planning in advance, and it feels fantastic. Although some of the damage to my current semester might be irreparable, the least I can do is just give it my all for the next 2 weeks before finals and try to be the best version of myself that I can be. Not even just for school or my grades, but to prove to myself that I can and will overcome this barrier.

I know as well as anyone how hard it is to admit you’re addicted. I didn’t want to admit it either, but I wish I had sooner rather than now. But that’s something I can’t change, but hopefully you can if you’re reading this and in a similar situation. It’s an experience I’ll use as a life long lesson that will hopefully build up my character in the future. It’s never too late to find the motivation to pick yourself back up again and get your life on track. Quitting weed is no joke, but the most important part is commitment and dedication for the betterment of you physically and mentally.

I hope that my journey had helped or resonated with you, even just a little bit. This subreddit helped me through this past week more than you can imagine. Again, sorry for the long post, but if you’ve made it this far then I truly do appreciate you taking the time to read a stranger’s story that he needed to vent to somebody.

That is no longer okay with me. I refuse to keep allowing this drug to infiltrate every dimension of my health.

I ask for your prayers, please. Although I don't believe in religion, I do believe that there is a higher power connecting us all, and She usually responds positively to prayers, so I'm hoping the beautiful people on this subreddit can help me convince mommy Deity that I sincerely want to cease smoking pot.

Thank you. 🖤🙏🏻⭐️",42

I am not feeling any urges to smoke since yesterday but the days do seem to be moving incredibly slowly. I am sleeping less and my sleep schedule is messed up with intense nightmarish dreams. My appetite reduced substantially, it feels good not to be thinking about food as much as i used to.
I feel slightly sharper but my stress is also relatively high, it reminds me of why i smoked weed in the first place two years back, to “deal with stress”. But all i really was doing was hiding from having to actually deal with it instead of facing it head on. My stress has always been there and its higher than most peoples but i need to find healthier ways to cope with it.

I’m also more willing to try new things and challenges, which i completely avoided while on weed. It seems to have made me want to stay in this fixed mindset and not grow, just do the same things over and over. However sometimes it feels like i am looking at the world and things dont feel real, idk if that makes sense",3

It is 5 years now that I smoke everyday.

Good friends, many addicted as well, and a positive future ahead. Nevertheless, I’m depressed half of the days, weed is talking away my brain, changed my emotions. If from the outside I can look happy to the most, my closest friends and girlfriend know it is not good for me. I am not in control of myself, I’m doing 1 little task a day, that can be cleaning the kitchen, or meet a person, and then I feel I did my job and start smoking. And it goes on and on, I smoke, eat shit, watch YouTube and porn. I tell myself this is the last one, every time, and soon after without even realizing it I’m smoking another one. I ended up stealing small amounts of weed regularly to friends. I was not like this.  I am not like this, I keep repeating myself. I don’t clean myself regularly, I don’t wash my teeth like I should. Every night I tell myself, tomorrow I’ll be myself again, I will wake up, do yoga, clean my teeth,start to work, enjoy my passions. I descovered this group today.

I rely on it to even function throughout the morning and when I don’t have it I tend to rate and sometimes act violently. I don’t really know what to do anymore every time I try to quit I get tempted and I wind up smoking again. I went to NA meetings for a little while and actually managed to build 68 days clean however I threw it all away and smoked weed again that was late 2020 and ever since that relapse I’ve once again been smoking every single day. Weed makes me so depressed to the point I can’t go 2 hours without feeling like I want to kill myself or lash out on somebody. Weed has also made me lose all my friends and all the support I once had from my family. The NA meetings helped a bit but they don’t help me fully. Sorry this post has been all over the place really needed to vent but now for my question why I made this post in the first place. I’ve been told that you NEED NA meetings to be sober and WITHOUT them You cannot achieve sobriety however I don’t know if this is true because they say you have to make 90 meetings in 90 days. Now I’d love to do this however I don’t have the brain to do it. What I mean by this is my depressed is so bad that there’s days I’d rather be in bed then get out and I don’t feel like I can just go to a meeting everyday especially the early stages of quitting weed when I felt really angry not to say I didn’t feel angry the entire 68 days tho. I apologize again for this post being all over the damn place but  I don’t know where else to go,2

At one of my favorite museums, I felt a wave of addict brain take over and try to convince me to break my streak, buy weed, and go home and make art. While looking at Basquiats and Warhols, I thought, surely they must've been high to be this prolific, what's wrong with smoking if my intention is to create something original? 

For the 5ish years I smoked I made a lot of art, it helped me make connections and develop concepts. I don't feel like painting when I'm sober, it's always when I'm high. My ego also inflates when smoking and I imagine myself as a great artist who hasn't yet caught a big break, which makes me isolate into the art-making process and over-produce while neglecting my non-art professional goals based on my actual career. 

So I noticed the trigger and the lure of an inflated ego, and now want to work on decoupling art from weed so I can start a sober practice with a more grounded reality of myself, and invest in my other dreams and goals that I don't use weed to advance. 

Shoutout to everyone here - a big reason why I didn't buy weed when triggered was because I checked in on this sub. It reminded me that the justifications are the addiction and it helped me be objective and aware before I blindly reacted. Seriously grateful for everyone's sharing and vulnerability.",10

Flash forward to now, and my partner made brownies about a week ago for himself. They sit on the table like they’re calling to me. Every time I walk past theres a tiny nag in the back of my brain to just take one bite, just a small microdose.

I don’t think I want to, but I don’t know. I feel like a loser for struggling with this plant so much.

I fell asleep on the train and missed my stop, and had to walk for another 20 minutes. On my way back, I got a wave of negativity just come over me, thinking about my family, my ex, my mistakes because of weed, and how much I missed out on living just doing the bare minimum.

The idea of change is exhausting when I was smoking daily, same routine that I'd complain and hate is the only thing I wanted. Wake up, **smoke**, go to work, **smoke before every meal**, get home and hop on video games, **smoke until I sleep**. Do it again. Everyday. 

I couldn't really be bothered about bettering my career or my life because I had a false sense of reality that I had total control over my life and everything was either going to work out fine, or i'd worry about it later. My life was covered in shallow and selfish pleasures, taking family for granted and being annoyed if i had to do anything outside of my daily repeated routine of video games and marijuana. You don't realize you're an addict until you try to quit. Now that I'm done I don't ever want to go back. I'm seeing how much more important my ""boring"" family is in comparison to what I used to think was important.    
I'm actually taking hold of my life for the first time in the last 3 years.  


People need to understand addiction is not what you think it is. I'ts not this sad constant low of life that you only think about drugs. It's a false perception that leads you to believe you could quit anytime. Addiction feels logical, and friendly. Almost like a small vacation from life.   
It is by no means the demons people believe it to be, at least for me. Weed brings me a fake happiness. A happiness without reason. Just smiling and laughing without any context.   
Yet no real happiness exists without reason behind it...   
I hardly remember my memories over the past few years yet I see the hours stacking up on video games, the ash trays always full, the empty carts 'collection' in the hundreds if not thousands.

I'm finding myself very jealous of people around me who are still smoking weed or can smoke without it affecting their mental health or their day to day life. Even though I'm almost 6 months sober, I really think what's holding me back from feeling truly sober and disconnecting from my emotional attachment to weed is a feeling of lack. 

I feel deficient for not smoking and not being able to ""handle"" it without it spiralling out of control. I feel stupid for having a weed problem for a relatively short time frame. I only smoked regularly for two years, and the last ten months of that period is when the habit started becoming detrimental to my health and wellness. I feel like I cheated myself out of properly enjoying weed because I was a pandemic pothead who abused weed and couldn't keep my shit together. And then I feel jealous of people that I think can hold it together, at least from an outside perspective (although I know what they say about assuming lmfao). I know that some of this is because I have internalized the pushback and discouragement from the people around me. But I think I'm also just flat out resisting full acceptance of the fact that I have a problem with moderation and that weed doesn't make me feel the way I want it to. It's not going to magically erase my problems or make me feel better emotionally. I'm going to feel like shit mentally - it will increase my anxiety and trigger depression and/or derealization like it has in the past. The emotional stuff will just wait around under the surface until I process it. And I'll fall behind on my goals and my life. I logically know that smoking weed is not worth it, but I'm feeling that siren call hard lately.

Lost my job, found out I was getting cheated on, got left alone, got my pets taken away. I started smoking like crazy, more than once an hour some days. And a pack of cigarettes a day too.

On Thanksgiving I went to check myself into inpatient so I could get clean and stop self harming. They sent me home, and I thought that was it, that no one was going to help me and I'd never get better.

But the next day, I smoked one last bowl and dumped the rest out. In a couple hours I'll be a full day out. I wanted to quit the weed and cigarettes at the same time, but I ended up buying a pack of cigs today as a compromise so I don't go buy weed.

I know this kind of slow stop and start is sort of pathetic, but I've been fighting this demon since I was 14, for almost half my entire life, and it has *always* won. The only time I quit I had to physically move house to an illegal state to do it. But today, I didn't get high, not because I couldn't, but because I chose not to. And when I thought I might falter, I made a compromise that kept me sober.

I don't know if this kind of post is allowed or not. There's no one in my life right now I can talk to about this, but I want to share this happiness somehow. For the first time, my willpower won, and now I will always know that it *can* win.",4

Realized three days ago and haven't smoked since.  I'm grateful for the come to Jesus moment—if I hadn't finally admitted the connection between smoking and my bouts of nausea and stomach pain, I think I would be over the toilet by now.

I quit cold turkey back in late December of 2019 after taking stock of the past year and a half of smoking and how it was impacting my life, but started again three months later and never really stopped until now.  When I first made the decision to quit, I had that gut feeling that if I didn't stick with it, things were going to get a lot worse. And they have.

I'm failing out of what was supposed to be my last semester of college, I forget things left and right, I have no motivation to do anything, even feed myself (okay, that might be the depression), rarely leave the house, and am generally complacent with life.  Now these seemingly early CHS symptoms are kicking my ass with random stomach pains and bouts of nausea.  My friend who smokes about the same amount also thinks they have experienced the prodromal phase, and they say it went away after a period of not smoking.  Even if this is true, I don't want to stop smoking weed just to avoid vomiting.  I got to this point because I use weed to escape, and getting over the prodromal phase of CHS is not going to change that.  I smoke because the world feels like too much for me, but I can't be a part of the world if I do.  It's hard to wrap my mind around the idea of never smoking again, and I really don't like it, but I want to quit.  I don't want to look back at this juncture in my life and regret ignoring that gut feeling again.

I don't really know why I'm typing this all out.  Maybe as a reminder to myself three months down the line that it's just not worth it.  Idk.  If anyone has any words of advice or encouragement, feel free to share.",7

I worry every time I get off of it and I long to have it again.  Sometimes I think I can ween off or even cold turkey it, but I seems I'm always back for more: it gives me this peaceful solace but destroys my relationships.

I'm about to see a psych and possibly get meds for anxiety and/or depression - appt scheduled soon.  But I don't know if that longing to be high will go away.  It's cost me so much.  I don't know how much personal fight I have left in me, but I'm so tired of the self hate, and the lies I tell my girlfriend.

I've slowed down my smoking the last few weeks and now made it to one week without any weed, but I know those cravings are going to come back. For me, the cravings are most serious when I drink (although I'm one week sober from that too), when I finish a stressful project, and when I've got some time to myself on a weekend afternoon.

While the first few were tough, after about day 5 it had been surprisingly smooth sailing for me in terms of not having too many cravings - so much so that I saw myself being someone that probably didn’t “count” the streak as much in the future. I just wanted to get to 30 and then let it become a part of my life. 

I had a small slip yday night. I was doing my annual Harry Potter / Pizza Hut marathon, which is usually weed fueled, and was just so dang sure that I’d have a craving I couldn’t resist ordering a pack of pre roll joints. I took one toke (literally), before realizing I didn’t want this, and didn’t smoke again, despite having four joints in front of me. 

Not gonna lie, I spent the next 20 to 30 mins a little stoned but after 45 mins I wasn’t high anymore and I didn’t continue the old habit. I gave away the joints to a neighbor this morning, but for 12 hours they were in front of me with no desire to light up at all. I also used that time to analyze where the cravings came from (fear of future boredom) and analyzed what happened in reality (Pizza Hut and HP are a great combo without weed and I had no desire to really smoke, esp once I puffed once). 

Would you consider this a streak reset? 

I know in the grand scheme of life, 14 days won’t matter, but I had a lot of people rooting for me (my mom!!!) that I don’t want to let down. I also worry that resetting to 0 will demoralize me, when the goal for me personally is to get to a place where a data driven streak count doesn’t matter as much as knowing intuitively how much better I feel. I truly expected that once I got to 30, I’d stop “counting” as hard - it was just the initial streak that was motivating.

Thoughts? I’m beating myself up more about the streak than I am what happened, since I learned so much from the latter!",15

Back on this subreddit just to talk this out.

Earlier this year I went almost five months sober from weed (was also abstaining from alcohol at that time) and I made it until mid June, where I decided to smoke a bowl after a particularly trying  week. 

I am appreciative I smoked that bowl as I needed a perspective flip that gave me insight of something I was involved with that promptly made me realize it was all a cope.

After that bowl, I started progressively smoking more and more to the stage I’m at today where I’m stoned pretty much again all day every day.

I recognize I’m better overall without weed, but I’m a person who is prone to probably too much enjoyment of altering their default state, so staying away as much as possible is wise.

In addition, I’m finally getting Facial Feminization Surgery in the coming months which also requires me to quit, so I have extra motivation. This will close the door on my transition, and I’m not letting weed get in the way of that.

Had a panic attack and thought it was something else due to some perceived underlying issues that hasn’t been definitely diagnosed. 

Initially the main symptoms were insomnia and anxiety. 
Anxiety was the first to subside although it popped up now and again due to personal live issues although nowhere near the intensity of the first 3 days 

Insomnia lingered, it improved as time went on however some days seemed like I was regressing. 

Loss of appetite lasted a week and was coupled with diarrhoea. This symptom didn’t bother me as much as the first 2 

Week 3 and I started dealing with tinnitus. This brought severe anxiety although still not the same intensity as the first 3 days 
Around then I started experiencing hypertensive spike, I remember the 3rd day of quitting, when I was in the hospital, my blood pressure was normal. Now it had gone up so much, it triggered more anxiety 
The palpitations although I experienced in the first week was now a concern 
Although my sleep had improved from the first week, I was still not getting enough sleep. Some nights I would sleep for 3 hours and then wake up for 2-4 and then sleep another 3, however the second sleep was usually worse and coupled with vivid dreams and waking up hourly or less 
In fact sometimes I would think I didn’t sleep at all but the vivid dreams suggested otherwise. 

The emotional turmoil from not sleeping properly takes it toll 
Some nights, usually after a couple of days of miserable sleep will be met with a decent night sleep. 
Each miserable night of sleep seemed to worsen the hypertensive spikes the next day

At day 41, all symptoms have improved, some more than others, some fluctuating but trending downwards. 

My last night before writing this was possibly the best, but I don’t necessarily expect an end to this, I can imagine things might regress a little but still follow the downward trajectory that has persisted. 

My main worry is that I might have done some major damage due to my 8 years of smoking weed mixed with tobacco , mostly in the evenings + my last 4 years of dry herb vaping and using black market carts Which culminated in a wake and bake high all the time, even waking up at night to Vape over the last 18 months during the lockdown. Making it a total of 12 years abusing cannabis. Only time would tell, hopefully I haven’t 

So what have I learnt ?
If I have abused any other drug or substance as much as I abused cannabis I’ll be dead, that makes weed a lot more seductive and deceptive 
Sure it’s better than alcohol and other legal drugs. Sure it could be medicinal, but try abusing ibrufrofen or aspirin, being medicinal doesn’t mean it should be abused.

I found pot when I was young, it seemed to help my ADD and got my girlfriend, who has some stomaches issues, really into it who eventually turned into my wife and mother of my son (we still together). 

Hind sight really is 20/20. Looking back, I can see so many opportunities missed and chances to take my life to another level that I let pass by simply because I couldn't see the potential. Because of the haze I wasn't able to actually see what I was doing and how it was really working. I haven't been able to focus on growing my career and pursuing ambitions that could have our family way ahead of where we currently are financially. I can see how the haze has kept my wife and I from living our potentials professionally and in our marriage.

Now my wife is hugely dependant on weed to the point where she will isolate herself with it in order to preserve her ""buzz"". It has become how she gets through her day. Smoking weed, maintaining the buzz and isolation to prevent stresses from taking away from her buzz. We had a relationship like best friend for years and over the last 5 years weed has become her best friend and I feel that there is less space for me -with her, in that way. We have quit a few times in the past but it didn't stick. Recently, I wanted to quit with her again because of the improvements we have both experienced in ourselves and our relationship previously. but now, for some reason that I dont know, she absolutely is not willing to give it up despite the dysfunction that it causes in our lives. In the past she had no quarrels about giving it up and going sober.

I'm quitting so I can be the man that I need to be. Maybe if I can become the man that we both need me to be and set a good productive trend, she might catch on. I honestly don't know. But I have to quit for myself and my family, so I will. I hope she will catch on. I want to be best friends with my wife again. I want to be her knight in shining armor like I used to be. I'm tired of being just the husband she lives with. 

I am really glad I found a community that supports this kind of sobriety. I don't have to quit alone after all!

i used to come to leaves in springtime a lot, as i was doing my first serious push of non-smoking after like 14 years of heavy use (it has had by this point total control over my life). back then i had promised to myself i will do a 40-day-pause, no matter the cost, i really wanted to prove to myself, that i am able to do it. and this platform helped a great deal to understand what withdrawing actually means. i spent nearly an hour every day, reading comments and sometimes posting stuff. i learned, that i luckily dont have any underlying psychological problems and that its just pure addiction. and i experienced, how after a rough start, it slowly got easier and easier. and i managed!!!!

but fuckin hell, how glad i was, when these 40 days were over. i felt so proud lighting up that first joint again. all my friends were proud of me as well. i really felt like i DID IT, if you know what i mean. 

first i was fine, but little by little the addiction came back. and soon enough i was back into my old habits.

 i'm working as a teacher (and i'm pretty good at that stuff actually) and in the beginning of the summer i got a new colleague. she was quite cute, quite straight-forward and after 2 weeks, she asked me out on a date. but i am slow with letting new people into my life. i didnt go out with her. i took my time, to get to know her first (thats the right way, no?). she stuck around and we started to text more and more. it felt pretty nice, like something with real potential. and in the beginning of september we kissed for the first time. it was a damn good kiss. after that i went on a long planned vacation. i didnt smoke, when i was abroad and continued texting with her. and i asked her, if she wants to go out with me, once i am back. she agreed. we wanted to play table-tennis, just the two of us. and i was really looking forward to that.

but i never told her. i never told her, that i am an addict. because i was ashamed. when i got back from my trip, the first thing i did, was rolling a joint. and then another one, and then another one. i didn't leave my house for 2 weeks. i was playing computer games. she asked me: ""hey, is everything alright?"" i didnt respond. i shut the world out completly. after those two weeks i went back to work (where i would meet her, full of remorse and shame). she was super-distanced. i tried being nice (but i couldnt talk, i coundt explain myself, i was so fucking scared of opening up to her). 

i asked her out 2 weeks ago. we went on a date, or thats what i thought. just that she told me, that she is seeing someone else now. and that she gave up on me. and that she stopped trusting me. the fear of losing her overwhelmed me and i finally told her. she looked at me and said:""Well, we can sleep with each other, if you like, but i am not dating a guy, who puts drugs first and me second. We can be friends."" And i realised i had lost her weeks ago. while i was playing computer games. 

i stopped two days later. now i am sober for 2 weeks. detoxing is a joke, compared to the feeling of loosing someone who you love. once i finally realised what i did, it felt easy to give it up. weed is not the problem, addiction is. and thats what i will get rid of now. no matter the cost. i feel i am a new person. weed is a joke, compared to real connections.

Connection is the enemy of addiction. I understand that now. and hey, leaves, i'm back for good.",8

I want to ask something about your experience, especially to anyone who did smoke for looooong time. I started when I was 17, both tobacco and mj and I'm 33 now. Unexpectedly, nowadays the tobacco's addiction is the easiest to fight against.
In this very sad and depressed period of my life (because of other reasons), I decided to quit cause I experienced a lot stronger lack of motivation and I feel like I'm interesting in nothing. And I actually don't remember what I liked before smoking, I was just a kid...
My rational mind knows that smoking is not helping my motivation at all but, at the same time, I am not sure I have enough tools to cope with the huge amount of free time I have now to spend with myself.
Have you experienced a sort of fear to don't know yourself without weed? Where to start from? I sometimes feels so late in life.
I can clearly see weed allows me to escape what I don't wanna look at, what I ask to myself is if I am ready, or if I generally ""can"", just stop hiding.",10

He’s just a grade A douche bag and stoner who claims he has ‘no obligation’ to help because he pays just as much for the place. Well, that probably explains why he doesn’t have any friends outside of us, who aren’t even his friends anymore. Its also sad to see how many people don’t wanna help…not that they should, or need to, but it does make me sad indeed. As a pre-med student I’m gonna have to keep my addiction under wraps for a while, until I’m recovered and more presentable I guess. It’s tough being bipolar, premed, and having a family that doesn’t support me or recognize that addiction is more a disease and less a deliberate choice, on top of all the screaming and yelling I had to endure as a child. I’m glad I’m out of there at least.

The dreams: horrible, horrible dreams, past relationships, past jobs, past close encounters, current relationships going sideways, just constant waking up in the middle of the night confused, angry, frustrated, but I started seeing a pattern;

These dreams were repressed thoughts, conversations I've never had or wish I had, a sort of cleanse that I kept suppressing with weed

Learning new things: while my memory is still a bit shot, I'm able to process new Information again, yes I gotta write it down because I can't remember jack shit especially directions, but adding new skills definitely boosted my confidence

Seeing myself in a new light: I finally see how far I've let myself go, physically, mentally, how complacent I had become, I had set goals but the more I smoked the more they got pushed away, I can now begin to form a clear vision of myself, how I want to be mentally, how I want to look physically, and where I want to be

Personality: I'm more charismatic around People, I don't just respond to comments with a nod, I can be funny and witty again, I can add to conversations, I can take charge of the interaction, I have found a leader I tucked away in a far corner

New hobbies: I've been working on reading new books, learning some 3d modeling programs, and other things to keep myself busy, but this has been the hardest part, focusing when I'm alone, not feeling overwhelmed when something doesn't work out, I've learned not too push myself too hard, somedays I just can't do anything and that's okay, I understand my body needs time to heal.

As my trip comes to an end I'm slowly becoming nervous again, part of my mind is slowly becoming excited at the thought of being able to easily acquire weed again, but I'm also dreading the thought of losing another day on the couch trapped within my mind, feeling powerless to the plant, after having this taste of sobriety I don't want to give it up just yet, but my mind keeps saying just a little taste to remind yourself of what the darkness feels like, to remind myself of the tight rope I walk everyday trying to deal with this ADDICTION

I decided to write what it gave from me and what it took from me, to no surprise it didn’t give me shit. it gave me basically short-term pleasure and I’d nearly always feel tired and burnt out afterwards. 

there was a whole bunch of reasons why I didn’t like weed , one specifically was who I become when I smoke. Lazy, not present , lacked discipline (especially with my diet), I just didn’t care for a lot of shit in my life. 

now my diet has completely changed, I actually am way better at getting things done and not only my energy has improve immensely, but my memory too. which was a huge thing I was concerned about. 

anyway, I send all of you trying and thinking about getting off - and those already off, lots of love and please try not to beat yourself up too much about it. it took me many times of trial and error to genuinely accept that it’s not for me, at least this time in my life. will I in the future? who knows but that thought just makes me nervous so I just take it day-by-day.",31

I can fully identify the benefits I gained from quitting (and why I quit to start with), but seem to be losing sight of this as I gradually fall off the wagon. I've continued pretty much all of the healthy habits I introduced into my life to help me get through, but keep finding myself making excuses/justifying ""just one cone"". I then feel incredible guilt and don't enjoy the high, but find myself rationalising using again within a couple of days. 

It's like there's another person in my head with different objectives/priorities to my true self - I guess that's the addiction. The worst part of this process of relapse is the sense of failure, and feeling that I don't have the fortitude to stay the course. I hate being back at 'day 1' again.

I'm smart. I'm resilient. I'm insightful and self-aware. I want to win this battle. I want to be free from this burden. I want it to be easier - clearly it won't be.",17

After having been a chronic user for so long and rarely ever dreaming, my dreams have been insane (most of them end with me getting shot over and over again.)

I just had a nightmare with a crazy series of dreams that basically made me feel like my life was over and I had nothing to live for. Kept telling myself that this couldn't possibly be real, still couldn't wake myself up, convinced myself that all this craziness was really happening. I was ready to give up on life, because I had been trying so hard lately to get my life right, and fight off intrusive negative thoughts.  

Then there were a few things right after that helped me realize this couldn't possibly be real. I woke up with my heart just absolutely pounding in my chest, i was basically hyperventilating, yikes! I had to run around double checking things to make sure this dream didn't actually happen! Thank goodness it was not real!! It was like dreamception because all these terrible things started when i woke up in my bed (in my dream) with the fire department, police department and my apartment management team at my door. 

All I have to say is just let these dreams happen, and then let them pass. Because even though it was terrifying, I couldn't have been more relieved, because in real life, I was still two weeks sober.

I smoked weed with really high THC and did edibles with high THC too.

I was completely fine for the first three months smoking. However after that I began to notice that I would randomly lose my train of thought during the days I stopped smoking. For example, I would have a conversation with someone verbally or over text and I would completely forget what I was saying. It got really bad and my mind went blank after just a few sentences.


I took a break for a month after experiencing these effects, but I made a poor decision of continuing to smoke again (however biweekly this time). Eventually I ended up quitting completely and I haven’t smoked in around 5 months. I exercise 3x a week, eat healthy food, and I don’t do alcohol or any substances.

My memory and train of thought has never fully returned to normally. Although it’s not as bad as it was before, it’s way more difficult to talk for long periods of time or make arguments. I still lose my train of thought/memory a lot more than I did before  I started smoking. I also still experience depersonalization but I’ve learned to live with that, it’s mainly memory that’s an issue for me because it impacts my life way more.

Has anyone else experienced this? Are these effects permanent? If not, should I wait this out or see professional help like a psychiatrist?",4

I think so.,"I tapered down off of a 6 month edible habit and went from 50-70mg/day to 8mg last night. Tonight will be my first night without it. I'm quitting primarily because I STRONGLY believe that it was causing issues in my relationship with my partner.

We had a rough patch a few months ago and I COULD NOT stop ruminating. I'd wake up angry over the same stuff every single day and its like no matter what I did, I could not get over our arguments and past fights and things my partner did. I blew things out of proportion and my reaction to certain things was too much.

Since tapering down, I've found myself far less bothered by things in the past and far less anxious and angry. I'm more mellow and accepting of things and its easier to forgive. I think the increase in dopamine results in a thought loop. I've searched ""ruminating"" on this subreddit and found other users echoing my experience.

Just an opinion in case anyone is going through something similar and starting to suspect it might be the weed. If you're going through hard times in your personal life, taper off or quit completely. The withdrawals suck, but the intense emotions of anger and anxiety from regular use mixed with interpersonal problems suck even more. I'll keep this thread updated as I progress.",33

Read till the end if you need motivation! I’m only sharing this to break out of the usual replies we see on here. I figure posts where people share a side of them are the most meaningful to me like Kurty last night and seeing his family for the first time in over a year sober. Here is my attempt.

————

I told myself about an hour and a bit ago to go out and grab a coffee to get out of the house as I work from home. I usually have a harder time these days as I work from home permanently now and before a month ago would have without a doubt been high. 

I jump in my car and head on out. I make a left onto the major street next to me and what do you know, a 40 pound dog with a cone around its head is loose in the middle of the road running frantically back and forth. I got a puppy two months ago (she has been the biggest reason for quitting this time after 24 years of solid use) and consider her my child. She has been the reason I have managed to stay successful this time around and couldn’t imagine losing her.

I pull over and put my car in park, lunge onto the road and try chasing her down. Watching the cars fly by us not making any attempts to be safe really messed me up. I kept running around trying to make myself visible but the dog at this point thought I was playing with her! After a few minutes I managed to grab her by the cone and bring her to the sidewalk. The elderly woman owner was crying hysterically. I carry her to her home and comfort the woman and she was in tears (and seemed a little intoxicated). She goes to me “you both almost got killed” and for a split second was reminded how lucky I was to be there at that moment and sober.

I’m always looking for a reason these days. Reason to smoke. Reason to not smoke. I ask myself is sobriety for me and rinse and repeat. After an experience like this I am reminded how grateful I was to be in a sober state and thank my little pup for helping me with my reflexes. I came back home with coffee and donut for the misses and I and immediately grab my dog and hug her. Gave her a few treats and came to take a shower.

I wanted to share this to remind you sometimes we just don’t know the reason to things. I hate hanging my hat on hope alone but an experience like this helped me realize I want to remain sober and have a clear mind here on out. I hope you do not need something like this to happen but on the chance it does, it helps reinforce the decisions we make.

We are all that dog on the road today. Lost, afraid…. Let people help you if possible. You are worth it. Keep wanting that better change and it will come to us all. Day by day. Breath by breath. ♥️",7

2021-11-26 15:14:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/r2vsca/day_one/,Day one,"For the past 8 years, I have been getting high nearly everyday. 

Yesterday was a tipping point for me. 

I had woken up in the pits of my depression despair. I battled my mind all morning. I did my gratitude practice, went to the gym and nothing was helping. I ended up going into nature and brought a joint along with me. As I smoked, my depression eased up. I felt better but it dawned on me that I was becoming too dependent on marijuana. For someone who prides themselves on being mentally strong, I felt so weak knowing that only getting high could help ease my calloused mind. 

So, today marks the first day of not smoking. I have been trying to quit for a few months now, but kept falling back into it. I think my breakthrough yesterday may be my saving grace this time. 

I was successful a few years back and actually went almost two months without getting high. I then caught a severe case of food poisoning that had me bed-ridden for nearly 3 days. I took one small puff and felt all my symptoms ease up. I felt a billion times better but I broke my sobriety, and as one could have guessed, I've  been smoking everyday since. 

Its wild too because I felt on top of the world during those two months. I got to a point that I was actually able to be around others smoking and I could turn it down without feeling a craving or want to get high. Being sober was much more exhilarating than being stoned to the bone.

So here I am, today, aiming to get back to that mindset. To no longer be dependent on a substance to bring me emotional or physical relief. It is a healing herb, but unfortunately, it has been abused in my case.

The only hurdle I see at this moment in quitting is the craving to smoke at night. It has become habit to smoke once the sun sets, and for this, I am nervous about tonight. So far I have not had the urge to smoke yet today, but I am fearing for when night falls. I think if I start going to the gym at night rather than the morning, it'll help rewire my brain and kick that old habit of mine. 

Does anyone have some other suggestions on what I could do to help ease the nightly cravings? I have read of a ton of different things, but I would love to hear to what helped you personally.

It started out as a coping mechanism, to take away the pain I was feeling. I stopped going out, stopped talking to the majority of my friends and just wanted to smoke weed with the one friend who got me smoking it. He'd just gone through a break up too so I thought we were the same. But not much later, I wanted to start doing things and going out, but it was too late because my other friends had moved on. My one friend wouldn't go out because he would always say ""no, I cant afford it because I need to pay off my debt."" and I understood, so I waited. Then he lost his job, I wanted to do things but he would say ""I dont want another shitty dead end job, I wanna wait until a decent job comes along"" and I understood, so I waited. And he never bothered getting a job. Just wanted to stay home and smoke weed. And now here I am almost 10 years after I started, sober, completely alone and regretting ever starting smoking or hanging around waiting for him to sort himself out. I should have cut ties years ago before it wasn't too late.

 I want to go out and meet people but my 2 other friends has families now so cant, the only chance I get to meet girls is at work and none are interested or have boyfriends. I've forgotten how to be fun or have fun because i've spent the last 10 years of my life, the best years of my life getting high with a guy i'm just realising was no good for me, making me become a shell of who I used to be. I've forgotten how to have fun, how to be fun to be around, I just feel boring and alone. I hate this hole i've dug for myself and I honestly can't see a way out. I want friends and a girlfriend but it just doesnt look like its going to happen now. I go to work, come home, stay in my room until the next day. I hate myself for what I've got myself in to.",6

My reason why is because I just realized that all the hours I've been putting in at work, all the time out of my life I spend slaving over my job is not worth me spending an hour's worth of a shift on weed.

To think that I've been endlessly disrespecting myself by working hard just to spend money on kush just makes me asked of myself. I asked the cannabis store I frequently visit what the total amount of money I've spent on their products and they told me I wasted $320! THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS?! On that store ALONE!! I'm lucky I had a mask on so the cashier couldn't see how quickly my expression changed from excited to just f**king appalled. I'm so ashamed of myself 15+ hours worth of a shift wasted on 30 minute highs.

If you ever want your reality check, check your bank account and find out how much you've spent by just typing ""cannabis"". It may not make you completely stop but that sh*t is going to keep adding up if you don't snap out of it. 

You and I are worth so much more than leaves.

I respect myself more than that to waste away any more of my paychecks on cannabis. You should too.",1

I've tried just stopping smoking, using vapes and edibles as replacement, but I always find myself going back to bongs. Nothing beats that feeling of ripping one.

2021-11-26 13:22:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/r2tgzb/white_knuckling/,White Knuckling,"41 years old here, smoked 25 years, sober now since June 2020.

&#x200B;

Most are probably familiar with the term and concept of ""white knuckling it"". Until recently this was me. All of my past attempts to take control of my life and specifically weed use involved a resistance. I thought it was about me being able to maintain the strength to be able to power through my weed cravings and deep desire to get stoned. I thought I was weak because I could never keep that force of resistance going for very long. Even though I wanted to stop and was trying I was still a non-practicing stoner - a dry drunk for comparison. 

&#x200B;

Being sober was a scary prospective for me - even though being clean was something I wanted desparately. My life had been built around getting high all the time and drunk and high on the weekends - it was how I coped with life's problems. It was how I relaxed, it was how I rewarded myself. Weed had become a committement for me - I was immersed in the lifestyle. I recorded all the strains I had smoked, grew my own supply, had strains for morning, afternoon, evening and bed. Weed was the solution when I had a headache, was bored, or not feeling well. It was the icing on the cake when I was happy or going to a special event. 

&#x200B;

Weed also caused a lot of problems. Weed messed with my thoughts, the things I thought when high were not the things I thought when sober. I'd often become anxious, especially after the first hit of the day, I'd had endless loops of negative thoughts sometimes and worst of all I always carried around this guilt for where I was and what I was doing with my life. It always felt like I could be doing more and doing better with my life but I always just turned to weed to sooth any worries I had.

&#x200B;

The change came when I became sober. I became sober before and as I was quitting weed. It was about a change of mindset. Instead of it being a resistance and being forced it was now all about the focus on being a sober person. There was an excitement about the possibilities a sober life would bring. I accepted many things: I'd have ""cravings"" (cravings, after a bit are merely thoughts, nothing special or powerful about them), I'd have opportunities to smoke that I would turn down, no matter how tempting it might seem to my addicted mind one single hit would send me back to full blown use again. Most of all I had to learn how to do sober life, learn new skills, adapt to being okay with just sitting with my thoughts and pain. Once I made this 180 it was so much easier and things started getting better in my life. I put A LOT of effort in improving my life and learning those skills I needed to succeed. I made it a priority. 

&#x200B;

Enough years of my life had slipped by, being high for most of my waking (and indeed sleeping) hours. How much more of my life was I willing to sacrifice to weed and all those negative thoughts and feelings? The time that had passed I was never able to get back but I was in control of the here and now and how I intended to spend the rest of my days, however many that may be.",59
2021-11-26 13:13:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/r2tayi/my_journey_so_far/,My journey so far!,"Hi friends, 

Wanted to share about my journey of THC recovery and this seems like the place to do it. 

I'm 24/M. I smoked weed pretty much every day during my junior and senior years of college and definitely had some enjoyable times. In the summer of 2020 I was extremely dependent on weed and realized I wasn't on the path I wanted to be on in life. My dealer moved out of my city and I decided I wasn't going to find a new source- I was gonna quit. Since then I have only smoked weed once!

But... enter Delta 8. At first I thought i found my answer- anxiety was a main reason for quitting weed and D8 was kinda marketed as being an anxiety-free alternative. It sounded great on paper. I bought some online and had some good highs but it ultimately led to the exact same patterns as with weed. I hate how it made me feel, compared to my sober mind i was more depressed, more anxious, more lazy, less creative, less confident/outgoing, exercised less, messier, etc... Yet i became pretty dependent on it. I 've been struggling with using on and off- i have gone months at a time without, but then seem to fall back into it. I know I feel better without, so it is frustrating to go back into those patterns. I find most often I can make it about 3-4 days without using and then I slip up. I try not to keep it around but it is so accessible around me I can get some in 10 minutes and that makes it pretty hard to resist when im craving a high. At the time of writing this I am 2 days sober. 

I wanted this story to exist somewhere publicly, for accountabilty.  I know thc in any form doesnt serve me anymore and i think its time to move on. But theres always a bit of doubt in my mind and i think taking a step like posting here will be good for me. I used for a few reasons– escapism (not wanting to deal with difficult situations/emotions), wanting a creativity boost, cure for boredom (which also is a form of escapism i think) and recreation (that ends up not being very recreational in the long run). I'm trying to face my problems head-on. A mantra I have when i slip up is ""I am ok with continually starting over"". I'm a proponent of self-compassion and letting mistakes be opportunities for growth. I'm big into having spiritual practices and making art or playing guitar in my free time so those have helped a lot as a replacement for getting high. I want to quit because it is making me mentally and physically unhealthy, it costs a lot, and i feel it is holding me back from bigger life goals. Its pretty tough to stay motivated though– some days i dont know if i really want to quit. Like i wish i could just use like i used to in college and not be dependent on it. But i know from experience I cant do that. So right now I want to quit- how do i maintain that sentiment when the cravings start creeping in? This seems like a place to start. A community. 

I know this is a little unorganized but i didnt want to edit or censor myself too much... Thank you if you've read this all :) - With love, Sam.",4

I want to be able to enjoy the occasional drink and have set myself on a 1-2 limit of beer or wine no hard liquor once in a while like one day on the weekend or every other weekend or even once a month. 

I know it’s a slippery slope and my sobriety means a lot to me. I also want to be able to like everyone else and have a drink occasionally. I know if I’m asking that if I wanted to be my best self the answer is no drinking. The best solution I can come up with right now is to moderate and track my drinking and the whys as to drinking.

I feel kinda guilty, especially because there’s a lot of stuff I could get done during this free time. My mind is trying to play the usual trick on me. “I need to smoke for motivation and then I’ll get _____ done, & it’ll be more fun because I’ll be high!” 
But I just keep reminding myself that if I smoke, it’s almost guaranteed that I will not actually get anything done anyways. Or I’ll start to tackle my to do list, & get distracted every 2 seconds because my brain is so foggy, leaving things half-accomplished & wasting the day anyways.
Today, I’m prioritizing my mental, emotional, & physical health, & doing ANYTHING besides smoking. Even if I do nothing today, it is a good day if I have a clear head & another day of progress.",6

2021-11-26 10:56:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/r2qfwc/weed_fixes_the_problems_that_it_creates/,Weed Fixes The Problems That It Creates,"Weed addiction is a different type of addiction, and I wouldn’t really put it in the same category as being addicted to harder drugs. When people abuse hard drugs, you can see that it has a very noticeable impact on the quality of their life. But with weed, a lot of people are able to keep their jobs, look after their families, pay their bills, and basically be a functional weed addict.

Even me, when I was smoking weed everyday, I was able to hold down a job, I had my own apartment, I was paying my own bills, so it’s not like smoking weed really got in the way of those aspects of my life. I was okay with my routine of coming home from work, walking my dog, and smoking weed, and I saw no problem with it at first. **But this is actually the problem, the fact that I saw no problem with it.**

It made me comfortable with where my life was at, and some people might say well you had a job, an apartment and you could pay your bills, so what’s wrong with being comfortable with a life like that? Where I was in life at that time isn’t really the point, the point is I knew that I wasn’t living to my fullest potential, and weed made me okay with that.

I knew deep down that I was capable of doing so much more; I wasn’t going to the gym consistently when I was smoking weed, I wasn’t eating as healthy as I should have been, and I didn’t have an active social life. I knew the reason for this was because I was smoking weed everyday.

If you are someone who is smoking weed everyday, if you were truly honest with yourself, I’m sure that you can also say that smoking weed everyday is limiting your potential in life, and you know you would be more in life if you didn’t have this habit.

But the problem is, when you’re smoking weed, you don’t really care about moving your life forward because you feel so good and content when you’re high. But when you sober up, you realize ""holy crap,"" I’m not really doing anything with my life aside from barely getting by, and smoking weed. This can cause stress, which can cause you to want to smoke more weed to forget about this, so it can become a situation where the weed causes the problem, and then also becomes the solution. It’s just a bad negative spiral.",83

I dreamed for the first time in a very long time last night. Even before I smoked I hardly ever dreamed so it was a really strange feeling. Felt very real. Strange feeling but not bad. Feels like my brain is working. 

Weed is the third toxic thing I am trying to quit this year. 

The first was a long term, very codependent, relationship that had spiraled hard during covid. We were happy together but we enabled some really bad behaviors and had for a very long time. I was also their only non-parental source of income despite us both having degrees. We're both twenty-somethings now but we met when we were teens and I think we enabled each eachother to be immature in a lot of ways. I ended things earlier this year and it was a very good decision. Financially and emotionally. 

The second is ranked competitive League of Legends. I have played competitive video games for hours most days since I was a child. For the past few years I'd smoke before playing. In my opinion this habit has done worse things to my head than weed ever did. Its been very hard to stop playing entirely, but I've been getting stoned and watching Netflix instead for the past month or so which holds my interest. 

Now that I'm trying to kick weed I am struggling with how to spend my time at night. Last night I ended up watching a League stream on Twitch to get to sleep. I know it's not a long term solution, as it makes me want to play, but it did get me through the night. I am hesitant to jump into new video games as I have a habit of spending thousands of hours playing them angrily. Maybe I'll replay the old pokemons.

A few people mentioned tea last night so I got a variety pack this morning to try. I also got a coloring book which someone suggested and sounds fun. I am going to keep trying new things like these until I can find something that works for me. 

Lurking this sub for the past week or so has been very helpful to me. Motivation. I might post again tomorrow. I might never post again. But I'm committed to this. If I can keep weed out of my apartment and stay occupied at night, I think I've got this. 

I appreciate you people and I hope you are well.

Good luck.

2021-11-26 09:46:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/r2p11j/a_metaphor_for_you/,A metaphor for you,"Imagine that the stress and anxiety of life falls in the form of raindrops.

Most people feel the rain directly on their body. They feel the cold rain bounce off their skin. They feel each drop glide slowly down their arms, onto their hands, down through their fingertips. Eventually, they watch as the drops fall off their body, having felt the chill of each drop completely.

At points in your life, it has felt like for others it rains, but for you it *pours.* Storms seem to last days, months, or even years.

One day, you see some peers wearing a new, thick wool sweater. You see them wearing it at fun events, most of the time when it’s not even raining. You see how appealing it looks, how much fun they’re having, and decide you’re going to buy your own wool sweater.

When you first try it on, you are taken away by the warmth of its grasp. You feel a comfort like never before. Most of all, you realize *I don’t feel the rain anymore!* The sweater absorbs the raindrops and suddenly you’re wondering where has this been all of my life?

Before long, you’re wearing this sweater constantly. You never leave home without it. The comfort it provides is now an essential part of your being.

The only thing is, *the rain hasn’t stopped.* The drops continue to fall, the storms continue to pass, only now the rain doesn’t bounce off the skin. The drops are absorbed entirely by the sweater. 

While you no longer feel the chill of the drops, you begin to feel the weight of the sweater. With each passing year it becomes heavier and heavier before eventually enveloping your whole self.

The feeling becomes maddening. You’ve convinced yourself that the weight of the sweater is more bearable than the chill of a raindrop.

But the truth is, you *can’t even remember* the chill of a raindrop, you only know the numbness and weight of the sweater. You’ve convinced yourself this is better, but you haven’t taken the sweater off in so long that you can’t possibly know. 

You know it’s time for change but you’ve convinced yourself you need the sweater. It’s all you know. The thought of exposure is terrifying.

In our lives, we use marijuana as a shield from the hardship of reality. Until we step away, we won’t realize that that shield is the weight that was holding us down in the first place.

Life isn’t meant to be lived comfortably numb. There are ups and downs but that spectrum builds who we are. The rain never stops falling, but with each consecutive storm we learn and grow stronger.

I ask today that you join me in taking off the sweater. Throw it away. Step outside. Don’t just feel the rain, dance in it too. I’m not saying it’s easy, but maybe we’ve been bundled up for so long that we’ve forgotten the refreshment of a cold drop of rain.",349

So far I’ve written down:

- cycling exercises 
- breathing exercises 
- work on posture 
- some video games
- family time 
- admiring each day being sober 

Doing this gives me the opportunity to train my mind to be more positive and to stop hyper focusing on the negatives. I didn’t realize I’ve let my brain think negatively and it’s become habitual for me to be this way. Realizing this was step one imo. I’ve also realized I love diagnosing myself with something new every day. 

I suffer from ocd/anxiety/sensitive stomach so my withdrawal symptoms seem more pronounced. Yes there are bumps in the road ahead so that’s why I think this technique works so well. 

I feel for those who feel lost and alone. I’m with y’all on that. Writing this stuff down paints the picture a little bit more ❤️",4

2021-11-25 18:44:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/r29odh/day_91_sobriety_update_how_im_feeling_things_that/,"Day 91 Sobriety Update (How I'm Feeling, Things that Are Changing, What it's Been Like)","Hello my brother, sisters, and kin of the r/leaves community,

Today I have been weed-free for 91 days. And I wanted to share a bit about what this transition has been like. The reason is to both help some of you along, and also as a form of self-expression I guess.

Of the first two months all I can say is that it sucked. If you have recently quit and feel terrible in any way - it's the weed. I felt extraordinary physical fatigue. I thought my brain was broken. I could not think or concentrate. I tried meditating and my mind was like soup. I felt *terrible* on all accounts.

Granted, there were a few days here and there when the sky was beautiful, the trees were rustling and reminding me that life is good, and I even had the occasional moment of happiness. You know, the kind of happiness where you're just happy to be alive. Because life is the reward. And it's suddenly obvious. 

But those days would come and go. They'd be buried beneath a hurricane of recurring symptoms that came back with a vengeance. Just as bad as it had ever been. It felt like it would never end. I didn't know what to do, and started journaling about how I was feeling each day not thinking that it would help, but as a record. 

Then, one day, I realized I felt pretty good. Not perfect, but a lot better. I went back to the journal. Only  two weeks prior I had written about how life was basically over for me. I was broken. I had been walking an endless journey of pain and misery and sleepless nights and accepting that life was just going to suck from now on. Those days felt so distant to me as I read back. It was like another life. But, the calendar showed 14 days. 

Keep going.

The thing that is the most incredible to me about this time is the extraordinary amount that has changed in my life in these past three months. I don't know what it looks like on the outside, and I'm sure it's not much. But the transformation that has happened inside of me is bringing me to tears as I write this. I'm not perfect, and neither are you. I spent 20 years hiding from a pain deep inside of me. I thought I was 'cerebral.' I was lonely. And it hurt real bad.

I have been sober for three months. And I am still aware of a certain cognitive fatigue that I carry. I think that will improve, as time has shown. Slowly. But, despite this fatigue, I can think again. I'm organized. I'm creating. I am productive as fuck. I write hours and hours a day and teach and express myself through work and a slowly growing social network. I have been pursuing a new career in a field that I feel my God-given talents are suited to. I have a family that I love, and we have created a different structure for our life that works better for all of us.

I have recently read a book maybe 30 times through called 'As A Man Thinketh.' I wanted to share a part of that book here as it perfectly describes these times. Again, just three months. The endless journey while moving forward and the snap of a finger while looking back. Here's what is says:

""That circumstances grow out of thought every man knows who has for any length of time practised self-control and self-purification, for he will have noticed that the alteration in his circumstances has been in exact ratio with his altered mental condition. So true is this that when a man earnestly applies himself to remedy the defects in his character, and makes swift and marked progress, he passes rapidly through a succession of vicissitudes.""

When I first quit weed, it was for a thirty-day tolerence break. But I felt *so fucked up* when I quit, I knew what I had to do. And for the first time in my life I feel like I am becoming the man I have always wanted to be. Someone of temperence, repose, kindness, love and putting others first. I have a lot of work to do, but removing the biggest thorn has been a miracle, and it makes the next steps seem doable as I understand my own struggles with compassion.

One tip for those of you who are having a tough time: I always found that connections with others alleviated the pain of the withdrawals. I have always been a bit of a loner, and maybe some of you are too. If so, make an effort. Rejection sucks. And I've had my fair share of that recently. But if you are vulnerable with the people around you, you will have more love in your life and that shit heals you.

If you're struggling, you are not alone. Keep marching forward, and one day, you're going to feel pretty fucking good.",156

I was sober last year, too. But, I skipped the holidays. I was invited to a cousins house, went and saw all of my family that I haven't seen for a while. Had a great time. I was offered drink several times and politely declined. Then, surprisingly, I was offered weed. We live in the Midwest and it's still illegal here, so it was definitely a shock. Apparently, almost my entire family just casually smokes now. Anyway, it was the easiest thing in the world to decline, and when they came back from the garage and they all smelled like weed, it didn't bother me. I just thought what I always think when people around me smoke: ""Good for them, but it's not for me""

Anyway, I just had a great day and I wanted to share. We're not stuck, we're not missing out. We're in control, and we CAN change and get better. Believe in yourself! If I can do it, anyone can.",67

so i’ll be leaving the country in 3 weeks and since i won’t have any access to weed during that, I decided to finally quit after over 2 years of being high 24/7 and pushing everyone away to hide the fact that i’m high (and the shame helps too). I’ve always been highly anxious and i’ve had depression since i was 14. Honestly though, fuck my high school bf for introducing me to this and then traumatizing me to the point where i now smoke to feel close to him (or any human) again :( 
Today is currently day 6 and it’s been a pretty scary and lonely time (this sub helps tho) and i feel all of the emotions i suppressed these years to be bursting out of me in the worst possible ways. I’m in university but I wish i didn’t live at home still because i’m taking my negative emotions out on my mom and sister. I know it’s normal to be irritable and anxious during withdrawals, but i’m on a whole nother level, man. They don’t know about my addiction but they say that my mood swings (most likely between me being high vs sober) have been taking a toll on them mentally and emotionally these past few months. 
I can entirely understand where my family is coming from though when they sat me down to ask if i should go on ‘mood stabilizers’ after months of me secretly wrestling with the “positive effects” of smoking (being chatty, carefree, ) and the negative effects (money, sloth, feeling cloudy and unaccountable) and my moods are on the “ultimate pendulum” as my mother claims. They only see the outside effects of how i decided to fuck myself over again with drugs. I wish i could tell them the truth, that the chemical imbalance is entirely a self-inflicted way of coping with how meaningless my life has always felt. 

TL;DR I guess i just wanted to vent and ask if anyone has any advice for my intense af mood swings? They’re so severe and i’m so confused that i’d honestly just rather numb myself again, despite how hard it’s been these last 6 days. The talk from my family didn’t help either since now i want to smoke more than ever to keep my emotions at bay and save them more pain",2

Been a everyday smoker now for a good few years, convinced myself that it was helping deal with my mental health when in reality it was making things worse … I became dependent on cannabis pretty quickly and relied on it to regulate my moods. 

My partner is also a smoker and has been most his life, he has autism and uses cannabis to medicate for that. I am under no impression that he should quit - it has taken me a while to realise but what is good for one isn’t always good for everyone. 

This group has been a massive help with giving me the strength to see that I have a problem, I relate to so many posts on here and  a lot of the tips that people give have been a massive help so far these last 5 days. 

It has been and continues to be super hard, we live in a small 2 bed house and while he has been super supportive of me quitting and smokes at back door with all other doors closed I can still smell it and wish to smoke with him. I’ve realised how much of a social thing that smoking is and how it was sort of our “bonding time”

On the flip side of that,even after such a short period we’re arguing less due to my mental health being more stable and I’m less explosive. The loneliness of not smoking is hard though.

Physical symptoms aren’t great, around 4pm everyday I start to suffer from temperature changes - my body feels like it’s boiling alive and I’m dripping with sweat. I have headaches, no appetite, and my sleep is terrible. I had my first dream last night in a long time, it wasn’t a pleasant one but wow.

My brain goblins have tried to convince me that I am not addicted, that I can have one or two tonight and be okay but I’m taking it an hour at a time and pushing through. I cried earlier because I just couldn’t cope and nearly caved. 

I’m not sure whether there is a point to this post, if anyone has any advice on how to make things easier while my partner still smokes that would be great though.",1

Not gonna lie, it sucked hearing that. I know my friends have a lot of respect for me and see me in high regard for other reasons, but knowing that I'm also come across as a struggling stoner sucks.   

I've had a few good stints without weed with the longest being five months. Just this past summer I was at a point where I felt I had a really healthy relationship with it. I'd smoke maybe once a week, if that and it always felt like a conscious choice. 

Then near the end of the summer I went to a few parties and smoked a bit more. The balance I had achieved was starting to waver. 
Add to that some really challenging life stuff and it shattered completely. I've been smoking pretty much every day since. 

Over the past few weeks I've realized that I've gotten to the point where I'm stoned all the time and no one can even tell. I'm still doing well in school and seem to be doing alright at work. I haven't received any complaints and I still 'function' at a passable level. But I know that it's not okay because I see that I've gotten to a point where I feel like I 'need' to smoke just to get through the day. Even if I start out sober, there's inevitably a point where I 'need' to smoke to get through the rest.

I'm sure lots of you know what it's like feeling like you 'need' to smoke just to function and it's not fun. Even if no one else is remotely aware of it. 

All that to say, I stopped about 4 days ago and am happy with the decision. However, I can barely get through the day now. I am so freaking tired and even looking at this screen right now to type has me feeling slightly crossed eyed because I just feel so exhausted.  

I know it gets better but this first part really sucks and I just want to scream into the void. Anyone else feel an extreme level of exhaustion and difficulty focusing for the first bit? Maybe y'all have some tips to get through?

I have been exercising which helps a bit with energy levels but I'm also trying not to drink coffee for other health reasons. 
Maybe I do just need to sleep for like a week and I'll level out eventually. :P Bleh.",7

(I wanna give you some context first before I go into what I wanna discuss/talk about.)

I am 21 years old and the first time I started smoking was at 15. I really started getting weed when I was 17. I smoked on the weekends with my friends who where around the same age as me. We all where just dumb teens trying to have a good night. I went from monthly to weekly to daily to excess. All kinds of consume patterns. Currently I am sober from weed since new years eve. at this point it is easy to stay sober for me.

I am still hanging out with these friends. Our friends group got bigger over the years. Some of my friends still like to smoke weed. The youngest addition to our friendgroup is a 17 year old guy. About a month ago we were having a party. One of my friends who is also 21 smoked some joints with him. I know it is kinda weird but since he is 17 I see myself in him, and It kinda bothers me how he is offered weed by someone older. I mean I smoked too when I was young but I was doing it with my friends and I didn't know better. Knowing now in retrospect where addiction can start and can go, it really bothers me. I don't wanna say I am some kind of saint, but I am genuinly worried since he was very drunk too and puked later that night too. 

I feel like a hypocrite because I've been doing the same thing at 17, and had similar experiences and now ofc in retrospect I know what I did. I also don't wanna blame my 21 year old friend for giving him weed since if I was 17 I would have loved if I had someone older to smoke with. 

I don't really know where I wanna go with this anymore...

how do ya'll feel when you see young people get into weed?",0

I’m almost 3 1/2 years clean. The ONLY reason I stopped was because I suffered major health issues from smoking.

Now that it’s about to become legal (something I was so heavy invested in when I was still using and never thought I’d see the day) I wish it wasn’t.

Don’t get me wrong. I’m obviously happy for every user that got wrongfully criminalized for so long. But for me personally it sucks.

Obviously there’ll be shops popping off everywhere and my brain is already painting pictures of me doing research (now that it’ll be state regulated you’ll exactly know what you are smoking) and finding a strain that only gives me a comfortable body high and doesn’t make me risk becoming psychotic again...

By the time this will be finalized I’ll probably have back my drivers license - which I obviously lost due to cannabis in the first place - and am already telling myself that I’m only going to do it at the start of a vacation or when I know for sure I won’t have to drive for a few weeks.

It might be the backpain the last couple of weeks, that make all this seem to be smart and rational thoughts, but luckily deep down inside I still know that they are not!

I really hope it’s still this way when the day comes and I walk by shops on a dayli basis...

She doesn't partake and supports me either way, honestly she's the best.

I'm worried that nobody will like me while I'm sober, that I'm just a grumpy asshole and everyone will see it now. Maybe my friends wont like me anymore, maybe my wife wont love me. What if I won't love myself? Am I even tolerable to other people when I'm sober?

No matter what I can't shake the feeling that stopping will result in me losing everything I love.

Have any of you been through it?,"From the age of 18 until about 24 I was a very chronic smoker. I started at 15, but until my senior year of high school it was a very sporadic thing. Just the few times I got my hands on weed, no more than a handful of grams a year. At 18 I moved out for college and had a job so I picked up smoking weed a lot more frequently. Still not terrible, but I was smoking 5-6 nights a week and the nights I didn't I felt bad. By the time I was 19 it moved into every day and not just at nights or weekends, and then to being high 95%+ of the time I was awake. I'd wake up and smoke, I smoked between classes (college), I'd smoke on break at my job, the few times a year I saw my family, etc. That went on for about 6 years. I'd go to bed every night promising I would get better, stuck in an endless loop of thinking about all the ways I was wasting my life away just to get up and take another hit because the high was starting to fade and I couldn't sleep sober.

I don't really know when or why but over the last... year and a half or so, weed has really lost it's appeal. I wasn't even trying to quit, but somehow I'd say I've successfully done it. I smoke maybe 1-2 times a month (but often go a month or two without smoking at all), and that's usually just a hit or two, I don't enjoy it and get nauseous and realize why I don't smoke anymore. I feel like I haven't really even mentally processed it until now. Like weed was so ingrained in my life for so long, and I don't know how it fell away, for the most part without me noticing. I got off work last night and a guy offered me a hit from his joint. I turned him down and it made me realize how far I'd come.",4

Still, I can honestly say I do not want to smoke and it's a relief that I'm no longer trapped into that habit. Me of the past would feel like it would help me get through these days but I've come to realize that avoidance is not the type of help I need.

My daily routine looks something like this: From 5am to about 5pm I work and do things like housekeeping. After 5pm, I spend the rest of the day smoking. Through Covid and HomeOffice, I've developed such a strong routine over the last few years that I can't manage to break out of it. 

I think what keeps me from quitting the most is the fear that I will never be able to ""enjoy"" all the activities I do stoned again. 

Mostly I watch streams on Twitch or videos on YouTube ( Lame, I know ). However, since I have spent the last few years ALWAYS doing this stoned, just the idea of watching my favorite streamer sober in the future makes me kinda nervous. (Which for me is already a sign that it is time to stop). 

Every time I decide to quit, I subconsciously invent excuses to only watch the next episode / stream stoned. The next day I swear to myself that it really will be the last episode. The day after again ...

Knowing if I will be able to enjoy the streams sober in about a month or so like I can now while stoned would probably help me a lot to stop.

Just me and you.
I don’t have to talk for you to get it–you just do.
You’ve been, to the best of your abilities, a confidant.
When we sat on the roof and you wrapped your arms around me,
The weight across my shoulders was a preview of the heaviness to come.
Death, heartbreak, shame & regret....
Unwavering, you’ve been there through each.
And it makes sense, because that’s how we became acquainted.
This was before the roof though.
Keep track.
I was 15 when we met; the sky had already fallen down and I realized that the
marble was actually plaster.
But it wasn’t until the roof that we fell in love, after I’d accepted all of
this.
I vowed to never love or trust again and you agreed that this was a wise
choice
–save for you of course.
You promised to protect me and dissolve all of the pain.
My end of the bargain was apathy.
They just don’t understand us!
My mom hates you and I would too if I were her– a reminder of all of the hugs
and “I love you’s” that she didn’t know how to give.
“It’s not her fault though, she didn’t realize”. See, you taught me that.
The judgement and disapproval come from not knowing the real you
Or the real me
Or the “real” synergy we’ve created over the years.
I pay you reverence and you help me get out of bed in the morning.
You’ve rocked me to sleep, reminding me of God’s presence in the midst of
silence.
“No, they DO like you. It’s fine Sara”, you insist at every entrance.
It’s hard to leave you because I miss you already. I don’t even know that I
want to.
It’s not you, it’s me.
But, is it really me?
Or is it you?

Just want to run through my day so i can look back on my progress during sobriety & recovery. 

So this morning I woke up at 4am with hot flashes feeling nauseous. I didn’t get sick though, so i decided to smoke to try & go back to bed. i didn’t notice heightened symptoms after i smoked, so i smoked once more with my best friend and then decided it was time. I left my stash & grinder with her so I wouldn’t be tempted to smoke again, because I for some reason have this mentality that as soon as I start feeling better I can smoke again, but after my 3rd go of CHS I know now that isnt the case. 

Panic attacks & crying all day long. Around 4pm I drank around a half bottle of propel, made myself get sick an hour later because I felt so bad.  Considered taking a visit to the ER after that for some sort of nausea/panic relief, went to the bus stop with my boyfriend , had another panic attack and had to come back inside. Was reassured by my boyfriend and best friend that the er would probably tell me the same thing everyone else does & it would be a waste of time. but I feel helpless. Not as much so right now, I took anti nausea 2 hours ago and it seems to be helping me a bit. Just hoping my family doctor gets back to me tomorrow considering she’s setting me up an anti anxiety prescription and I know the one she’s prescribing helps my episodes. I’m not in pain, I just feel helpless and miserable. Hopefully things are a little better tomorrow.",4

Within a few more years I was smoking pretty regularly.  There's no question that for the last 20 years it's essentially been a daily habit, and for the last 10 years it's been almost hourly, and that's no joke.  I'm in my 50's now and my entire adult life has been through a haze.  I quit drinking 226 days ago, it began to spiral out of control about 10 years ago.  But this is harder. 
 
I'm older and graying now, and the last time I had a clear head I was a child.  MJ has literally defined how I have lived my life and what my habits are, I don't even have a frame of reference for living as a grown man and a non-pothead.  I feel emotionally detached from almost everyone and everything.  Social events come and go.  I've missed occasions that would have been moments to remember for all time.  I read about people here quitting, that have smoked daily or so for 5, maybe 10 years, and I read about the hell they endured to quit.  That really terrifies me.  I've read reports that suggests after 2 weeks the worst is over, and that the brain receptors are functioning normally after abbot 4 weeks.  But is that for someone like me?  I feel saturated to the core.  

Anyway, I'm out.  Literally.  I ran out tonight.  In the morning I'll wake to a house that is completely void of any pot.  I don't know if that's happened in decades.  I don't know what to expect, and this is so much more daunting and frightening than when I quit drinking.",63

At night all I want before I go to sleep is to flatten the mind back into the dreamless empty that sleep used to be.


But in each of those moments I remind myself that there is no progress without struggle, and I have spent so many moments high resolved that I needed to quit. I can’t forget that now.

I spent about 800€ per Month on weed (it didn’t hurt my pocket but I could have used that money for some better things). So I decided to quit because I recognized I wasn’t just smoking after work, I started to smoke while work (I guess I did it because I just worked on my own) and I just went down that road, I was smoking before traveling for work, I was smoking after client meetings, some days I smoked and didn’t work at all. And because of that I wanted to quit, the first few weeks were horrible… I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t focus, had moodswings and depression but after all of that I overcame it. After like 2 months it was possible for me hanging out with friends while they were smoking and more than a year later, I don’t even know how it was to be high but my brain slowly says “you did over a year, where is the harm in smoking one?” and the struggle begins again. It isn’t really helping that my country is about to legalize it so I could buy it at a shop, everywhere they talk about how happy they’re because of the legalization and I am happy for them but I struggle so hard at the moment and I didn’t think it would come to this point after that long time being sober😅",16

I’ve attributed weed to my reasons for weight gain and body issues, eating problems with binging, and most of all, distracting me from actually living life. 

One of my biggest problems is choosing to get high alone instead of dating, going to the gym, working on myself, etc. it’s such a coping mechanism yet it brings me farther from serenity. Funny how that works. 

Weed personally makes me more depressed, more distracted, and more anxious. So why do I do it? Why is it so hard to quit? 

What are some things you all do to stop falling for it? What about socially, how do you fight the urge to hit the J with ur friends? 

How do you feel after a month, a year? Is it really worth it to quit?

It wasn't a bad experience and that leaves me conflicted. Cannabis has ruined my life for the last ten years and has stripped me of growth since I was 16. But I've been feeling very depressed lately as is the season for a lot of people, and the joint I smoked made me feel better. Today I feel myself being pulled in that direction again. I don't want to slip back into those bad habits but the devil in that flower keeps telling me that there may be a healthier balance available. I know I'm an addict.

I think that this is the longest I ever succeeded!

The thing is that I’m single for something like 7 months after a 4.5 years of relationship with what so far was the love my life..
And since then I’ve been in some dates and things but nothing serious.. I know it’s not the sub for this but I still think about her every day.

I’m really enjoying my time alone and discovering myself, it’s also help me with the sobriety I guess.. (At the end of our relationship we started smoking a lot together which I think “helped” a lot to the ruin of our relationship.

I’m now in a position that I have the chance with a new girl that I’m really attracted too and I really want it to work!
She is kinda a “stoned girl” and she loves weed.. I know that this days a date with a joint around is something pretty common.
I know it’s not everything and I really think that I’m finally strong enough to be around the temptation and say NO.
I also find it really unnecessary for me to help me enjoy more or something.
But I will lie if I will say that’s in not doing me something. To smoke with her, maybe it will take us to some cool, fun and interesting places.. maybe we will have a cool date and not just a usual restaurant, or a pub, and a joint could fit well..

I know I’m not supposed to talk like this but I just wanted to let you know how I feel about that.
I actually finding smoking weed, and be enthusiastic about this, is in someway really immature.

Does anyone had a similar situation before?
Rather than “just” not to smoke with her, do you think you can add something? 
I’m really looking forward to hear you guys.

Thanks a lot for reading and sharing your journeys here and not making me feel alone.
Keep safe 🙌🏻

TLDR: after a hard time being alone after a break up, I’m about to date a beautiful “stoned girl” which is what I think “out of my league” and I kinda want to smoke with her in order to help it work.

It's been one hell of a year.

Quit a toxic job, started a new career, ended a terrible relationship as a side-piece, stuck to therapy, reducing my prescription medication, moved out from parents, found a healthy GF, started going to the gym again.

Still get the suicidal days, but at least the crutch of instantaneous happiness isn't keeping me down from finding consistent dopamine. Resetting my reward systems was tough, but I'm glad it's better!

Week 1: erectile dysfunction issues gone

Weeks 2-4: explosive anger, but euphoria from running/exercise was INCREDIBLE. Grinning smiles whilst running... Who gets that?

Week 4: no cravings

Months 2-12: normality

I was surprised how fast I recovered after that first month of rage and jittering.

My wallet is doing better too, but sadly cigarettes took over, so that's the next task to beat. Still spending a good £300+ less per month as opposed to weed budget.

Thanks to everyone who shares their stories, definitely helped on down days and when opportunity arose to smoke again.

First it was just for fun with friends, then it was to make chores/errands more enjoyable, then just at night to wind down, until eventually I was smoking all day every day just because. Nowadays I can't say that I even enjoy it much anymore, not really. I'm just doing it to cope with the fact that I feel like I don't like myself, my life, or anything else about my existence.

I am near constantly very lonely and/or depressed. All my friends have moved away, and I have little motivation to go out and make new ones in my little college town because I too will be moving in 3 or 4 months. Any hobbies I had I have since lost interest in, and just the thought of having to be sober and do any activity crushes me with feelings of discomfort and sadness.

Weed helps me be okay with wasting my life just sitting inside, re-watching old shows again and again. Every once in a while I'll get sick of myself and try to quit, but weed is literally the only thing my brain lets me not feel horrible about. Not good, but at least neutral. I always cave in after a few days of my depression and loneliness worsening.

I don't remember being nearly this depressed and socially anxious before I started smoking daily. I'm not sure if the weed caused it or just worsened it, or if it's something I would struggle with even if I magically quit today. But I do know that the weed allows me to put off dealing with these issues. I wonder: even if I did quit, would my life really improve? It sure doesn't seem like it every time I try. One of my biggest fears is putting all this effort into quitting, only to succeed and realize I still hate myself and my life just as much while sober.

I know I need to get professional help, but I can't afford any kind of mental health related treatment in my country. Does anyone else out there struggle with extreme depression and loneliness tied up into their weed addiction? It's like all these complex issues are tangled up together and I have no idea how to help myself with any one of them, let alone all of them at once.

And so, I put down the joint. I went off the res. And you know? For about a week and a half I felt really good. And then ... I decided to hit again. I was watching a movie, what's the use? Well I had another giant panic attack. I had to take a prescription medicine (that I do in fact have a prescription for, for panic attacks), which I almost never use. 

Keep in mind, the first week I felt great.  No anxiety, very pleasant and healthy. But it didn't last.

Ever since then, Ive had daily anxiety. Not a moment goes by when I'm not aware of my elevated heart rate, the sweating, the fidgeting, the panic, the nausea. It's horrible, it's been 4 days of constant anxiety. I've been diagnosed in the past with anxiety disorder, but it's still never been this bad.

I had a couple panic attacks, but mostly tried to ignore it by gaming, taking long showers, or binging shows. About a week ago, I noticed my gf hadn't been to class in a while. When I asked her about it she broke down, and confessed the same feelings of self-loathing and denial that I had been keeping to myself. The idea that my complacency was destroying her motivation and positivity hit me like a train.

as mentioned in the title I was smoking weed for 7-8 years now, but always knew that I want to stop smoking in order to get to my full potential. 

I'm 27 years old, in my 11th semester and hopefully writing my bachelor's thesis next semester. 

1.5 years ago I finally found my passion for programming, which has nothing to do with my bachelor.

I was in a really bad spot financially and mentally the last years, and last year I already tried to quit after 3 weeks of vacation in another country where I didn't had access to weed, but as soon as I got back, the thoughts of one particularly exam made meed really anxious, depressed and whenever I thought of it I almost panicked out. 

So I told myself that I will only be able to quit smoking after having taken that exam... And after building some basic knowledge of programming. 

Well, last month I finally took that exam and achieved a really good grade. That was a huge hurden for me mentally the last years. 


1 day later I flew to vacation for 2 weeks and used that chance to quit now. 

I'm 5 weeks sober now... But am still sweating every night and having weird dreams. And some bad decision I made in the past still make me feel really depressed,
allthough I'm in a better spot than I could ever have imagined at the beginning of 2020.

But somehow Its really hard for me to focus for several hours to study consistently my programming stuff, and at the first error message I get really demotivated and find it hard to keep my focus. 

I'm currently working on building my own web app, but I'm progressing so slowly and want to know, how long does it take until my brain recovers to normal state? It feels like I could work way better on weed. But going back is no Option... that leads to me laying on the couch and fall asleep for 2 3 hours every day in the afternoon... 

I feel tired and have no drive, and everybody else seems to get his or her shit right. 

I have a loving girlfriend but she doesn't really understand my struggle, she is doing everything that she can, but mentally it's not in her skillset to help me out I guess. 

Don't know what to expect from this post, I smoked almost 3 gs of heavy weed with bong during the last year... When will my brain get normal again? 

Stay strong guys... One day at a time

I have IBS, Interstitial Cystitis, as well as BPD and Depression. 

I started this viscous cycle when I got my abortion. I was so ashamed and guilty and it wasn’t what I wanted so I tried to smoke weed and cover up the pain. Now 4 years later I’ve been pretty much high 24/7. Anytime I’m awake. I’m personally trying to grow and now feel chained to this addiction. I’ve been seeing a therapist for the emotional help and now I am getting closer to making the decision to finally quit. The only thing stopping me is the withdrawals. My body hurts all the time. With all of my medical conditions there’s really never a time I feel “good”

When I stop using, my body rejects everything. I can’t eat, all I do is puke, and have tummy pains so bad that all I want is a hit off my stizzy. Not to mention I also snap emotionally and become rly unstable and irritable. I’m trying to plan my sobriety around work vacation so I can try to plan for the withdrawals. But can anyone please give me some advice to ease my withdrawal symptoms?

I don’t want to live my life like this anymore. I want to be “free”. There was a time and place for weed in my life, but now I’m abusing that.

&#x200B;

* **Sleep**. I sleep better and wake up more rested. 
* **Gym**. I *want* to go there and *want* to hit my food macros. Feels great. 
* **Emotional balancing** is starting to kick in. I can feel again. Pride, happiness, but also disgust and sadness. I'd rather feel all of those than not feel anything at all.
* **Clarity**: I feel like the brain fog might not have completely disappeared but my mental clarity has been improving massively.
* **Taking care of myself**
   * Cooking including meal prep
   * Living in clean room
   * Personal hygiene is on point
   * Clean clothes

&#x200B;

Most of all I feel like I am regaining control over my life, more every single day. **Quitting the weed is not a miracle fix to my life; quitting weed allows me to work towards my goals.** 

That is the deal I've proposed to the universe: I stop using the weed and in return I want the ability to work and progress towards my goals. I've been taking care of my part of the deal and it seems like the universe is upholding its part aswell. 

To anyone struggling: Things might not instantly get better when you stop using and you will face hard days, perhaps days that are harder than during your active addiction. But one thing is sure: things will not improve as long as you don't do what *deep down* you know you should do.

**The best time to plant a tree was 10 years ago. The second best time is now.**

At the start it really helped ease off my anxiety and overall stress levels. I was happier, more energetic and started to enjoy life again (was heavily depressed until start of 2020). 

Weed improved my life in every aspect. I’ve learnt a lot about myself (not through weed, but through being more calm) and improved myself in every flaw I could see. 

However, 2021 changed that. Weed is now a drag, I feel lazy, tired and overwhelmed by the most normal situations. I have a terrible memory, I’m unmotivated and don’t want to do anything. Smoking is so engrained in my daily routine, that I’m seriously confused on what to do with my time now if I can’t smoke. 
At the same time I don’t really want to smoke.

Today marks the first day where I’m officially quitting. I took some breaks here and there, when I’m with my gf I can never smoke as she doesn’t vibe with it. So this year I smoked maybe 4 out of 7 days a week, 2 times a day. 
But now I’m done. 0 out 7 days will I smoke. 
I know that failure is no show stopper, but I hope that I don’t even get to the failure part.

I think another big reason is that I have had an unlimited supply after the plants I grew last year got huge and I ended up with over 7 pounds dried.

As for the symptoms, after I quit, I feel lucky as I have had almost none. For me, smoking was more out of habit than anything else. My lungs feel a bit better and I can smell more things though.

There's definitely people who don't smoke. But for some weird reason, every party I've been to, even if it's not with friends I already know, people seem to smoke weed. It's an extremely social thing - almost like it's a part of culture now.

It's been almost two weeks since I've quit, and I feel so much better already. I just don't want to stop meeting a lot of my really close friends, because almost all of them seem to smoke. What do people do for fun otherwise? Drink? Even drinking is bad for you. I'd argue even worse. 

The only viable solution seems to completely eradicate your social circle and start anew. It's not like my friends would force me to smoke, they would actually respect my decision. The difficult part is that one of the primary reasons they would hang out is to smoke weed itself.

I'd smoke before breakfast, before work, i'd vape in the bathrooms at parties just to get my fix. I wanted to quit for so long but I never did. 

Relationship after relationship ended because I was hiding this big secret - my addiction. I even moved to California so I could live in a legal state and acquire weed easily. For years I would rather sit alone in a room and smoke than connect with the people around me - and that makes me really fucking sad to see now. 

The past year i've thought a lot about quitting. But never did. And finally a few days ago I decided it was time to go cold turkey.

But you were the one who always had the best stories.

I had forgotten what it felt like to spend time with you. The first few weeks are always full of regrets, rage, sadness, nostalgia over what could have been. Emotions that I had been burying deeply somewhere in my head all these years without you. The fake smiles and laughter on my face every day while I buried everything away as I shot off into space. Ignorance really was bliss. Every time you come back to visit, the floodgates open up, long-forgotten emotions coursing through us. I feel sad, not knowing when or where a particular feeling is coming from -- it's all a blur. But I feel *alive*, experiencing everything with you after all these years. How could I have forgotten how this felt like?

Oh, the things that have happened since we last met. I wish I could remember all those details. But the memories are always hazy; random flashes of happiness, sadness, excitement, despair, love... All these years that have gone by. All of the memories created, lost to time. Are they really my memories if all my mind can muster up is a pathetically dull, murky image?

All of the life-long friendships made; all of the life-long friendships lost. Secrets and stories shared that no longer matter. Conversations with beautiful souls who I happened to cross paths with, long forgotten. Promises made to those who I love and loved. Were they kept or were they broken? I wish I could tell you, I really do.

The pain and suffering inflicted on those who loved me. The friends with around whom we developed our first sense of identity adults. All of those real human connections that brought color to this thing we call life, all lost in this decade-long haze of apathy and hedonism. All lost. 

Despite the tragicness of it all, life has turned out okay. I met a girl. She loved us enough to marry us in the state that we were and still are. That happened 3 years ago. I wish I could remember the thrill of seeing her for the first time. The first time we spoke to each other over a slice of pizza. The butterflies in my stomach when going out for coffee for the first time. The sparks when our hands brushed each other for the first time. That first kiss in my car on that cold night on the dark street outside her first apartment. I only remember that those things happened, but I wish I could remember each beautiful detail.

All the missed calls from Mom, worried about where I was. The sadness I was not ready for when she called for the last time. The little sister who I was never there for, who never got to know her big brother before life really hit her and she was forced to grow up. 

Oh how I wish I had treasured those days. I wish I had really been there all this time. All I can do now is look back, tears streaming down my face.

I wish you had been there for me earlier. But, the past is the past. I’m happy you’re here again now, friend. Please stick around for a while this time.",86

I'm 26 and have been smoking weed 10+ times a day since my early teens. I had no plans to ever stop.  I have definitely browsed r/leaves since early college, but I was never for real about quitting. I love weed. 

I was diagnosed with CHS (Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome) after a 10 day, near-death hospital stint and instructed that I could never smoke weed again. I quit for 3 months and then went back to it after I gambled away a good portion of my money on fucking GameStop (thanks, reddit) and lost my nice NYC apartment. Figured the least I could do for myself was treat myself to ""one joint"". I then smoked every day for four months, the symptoms started to come back and I booked it to rehab because I was in a dark hole of repetition. 

It's been 136 days and I'm still having terrible nightmares. I'm still lethargic, depressed and anxious. I'm lazier than I was when I was high. My best friend hasn't spoken to me in 5 months and don't think she ever will again. I tried to talk to her tonight for the first time since I was in rehab and it didn't go well. I don't think we'll ever be friends again. 

I feel weird making this post (from a burner), as I've almost written posts on here about how great it is to not be dominated by my pot addiction anymore, and to try to motivate others in this group to get to how many days I'm at. 

But I'm kind of having a breakdown tonight and all I want to do is get high. The funny thing is I'm not even thinking of smoking real weed, I saw that Delta-9 stuff for sale at my local 7-eleven and have basically been arguing with myself to not drive there and smoke it for the past four hours. I just want to get high and escape. 

Any suggestions are welcome. Peace and love.",3

It was never an issue of affording it, if anything it was always health reasons. The sickly chest pains I'd get from painting the inside of my lungs with that goddamn candlewax on a hot burning metal rod. I've never taken a dab in a parking lot around children and didn't feel like a low life junkie piece of shit. Not to mention my short term memory is inherently terrible, so weed makes me a mess. 

When I look back and all I see is my one stoner friend who I share virtually nothing in common with. He's a nice guy, but he's 30 living at home, screams at his mom like you've never see. Unfortunately he's my only friend IRL, so for the time being, cutting off weed means cutting off my social life.

I used to say I need to quit because I didn't believe I could keep a job as a software developer, but I don't feel that's true anymore. I'll admit I've yet to meet another stoner coworker who isn't some sort of slacker, but weed pulled me through a lot of studying in college and really anything in my life I didn't want to do.

I don't like the way weed makes me. I jerk off 4 times a day, I eat out all the time because every little chore feels like a waste of my high, and my chest is so heavy from inhaling yellow goo that I don't exercise. I'm also just an awkward, boring, mess of a person that has little joy.

I'm just very confused, I know I need to quit weed, but it seems like every time I quit, I smell people smoking and see them having a good time. It feels the more decriminalized it becomes, the harder it is for me to quit. All I can di is remind myself it's not for me, but that doesn't last longer after I say ""You're only 27, enjoy life"", or ""your lungs dont hurt that bad"". I wish I could just have 1 bowl at the end of the day, but I can't, that's why I'm on here. It's so hard for me to quit because I can still see a life with weed, I just keep seeing this 40 yr old version of myself that probably isn't genuinely happy unless he has his weed. I believe weed turned me into a born again virgin from ages 21 to 24, I had no sex because what's the point when I could just get high and watch porn.

I've quit multiple times, longest being 5 months. Up until like July, I went 4 months but got back into it because I was so unhappy with other unassociated health problems.

I know this post is scattered, I've abruptly decided to quit today after almost taking off after a week and my friend scooped me for a 3 day binge as we celebrated his promotion. I have a very hard time with Thanksgiving and family overall. I truly don't want to go, but you all know how that is. They're going to drink, but I don't see any fun out of it, especially since I'm going to be quitting weed again. Any advice?",3

I remember being really outgoing back in the day and I slowly realized my whole existence depended on the spliff I was going to have at night. It wasn't even about the high, it was more the anticipation of the joint I was going to have. As the years went on I started being a bit of a recluse. I would party and stuff but not socialize with a lot of people like I used to. My circle became smaller and smaller.
My relationships also took a nosedive since nothing was that special anymore if all nights ended with us getting high.
I don't want to completely shit on smoking weed but anyone that says there is no negative to it is silly. Being a stoner in some cases mean you hang out with other stoners, even if you usually wouldn't hang with that type of person. It gets tiring honestly.
On my last night, I smoked 3 joints to the face, threw my lighters, ashtrays and papers into the bin and took it out immediately. 

I started by literally forgetting that I was a stoner, forgetting that I needed to smoke at night. It was weird. I told myself Ive never had a joint. Seemed to work. The first 2 days are tough as nails but I drank lots of tea and hot cocao. I spent some time writing and playing pokemon go outside (caught a shiny lol). Since I couldn't sleep without a joint, I decided to watch all the Spiderman movies starting from Raimi's ones. At some point I just fell asleep. It only got easier after that.
I'm sharing my experience as it might help others, obviously you shouldn't do exactly what I did.. You should just do what you want.

Sometimes we forget that there are highs in reality itself rather than at the end of a doob. ✌️",32

I didn’t decide to leave it myself, it was my financial state, I had no money to buy it and because of that one uncontrollable situation I am now very happy. The first night I cried myself to sleep cause I usually depended on a joint for that and I of course didn’t have anything.  From that point onwards my sleeping routine has been fixed, I am now early to bed and early to rise. I started exercising, I realised that weed had made me incredible lazy and I had started to accept that comfort zone as a way to live life but that is not the case anymore ( I’ve only been working out for 4 days now but Atleast it’s a start ). My focus and the ability to pay attention on things has improved, now I am more aware, more curious and I love that. The only thing I can’t seem to start is working on my projects ( I am an artist, a graphic designer ). Weed had somehow made my brain numb, I couldn’t think things, like I couldn’t or rather wouldn’t think about anything. It made me emotionless where I just took things as is and never tried to change them for the better ( or even worse ), I just did nothing ( just sat and watched tv ). So I wanna now start focusing on some work, I wanna put some pressure on my brain to start practising and applying itself so that I can work towards my long term goals. I wanted to go and study abroad ( I live in India ), I wanted to travel and collaborate with local artist, live in the mountains and work from there and that is something I want to start focusing on now. I hope it happens for me!! Cheers",23

I've been struggling to quit weed for years now. I started about 8 years ago (my freshmen year of high school) and have been smoking nearly every day since then. I have tried to quit a bunch of times and have never been able to do so for even a short period. Whenever I see weed my brain goes backwards and I forget the mission to stop. I will tell myself I'm not going to smoke today and the moment I see weed, convince myself that it's okay if I smoke. I don't know why I lack so much discipline. I'm moderately disciplined in other things (gym, reading, etc.) but when I smoke all of those go down the drain.

Anyways, I'm home this week for Thanksgiving and have gone 4 days since not smoking! I found a dab cart in my room but fortunately it wasn't accompanied with a pen battery and I was able to withstand the urge to go buy one. I really hope this time is the time I can quit for good. When I return back to my apartment, weed will be around because of my roommates. I'm hoping this week off will get my brain back on track. I really want to stop.",4

I’ve had a lot of tests done and touchwood, I’m all in the clear. But it’s just really hard to convince myself it’s all been worth it when I think how pain free I was when I smoked. (I only smoked cannabis from January-July but I did hammer it in this time).

Thankfully the panic attacks are over I think. They ruined my life for the first 3 months but now it’s the constant stomach issues and the headaches that are crippling me. Just gotta keep remembering that healing isn’t linear but boy is it tough. 

I live with two stoners and no longer have any desire to smoke. The crippling health anxiety it gave me made it easy to resist but oh man the physical sensations are still there and it it hurts like a bitch. I’m convinced death is around the corner and it’s just no way to live.

Not physically but I have started to feel the mental effects of not having smoked. The best thing I can describe the feeling to is the feeling that life is repetitive and boring (which I know it isn’t) but when I have urges to smoke and I don’t, thoughts of pointlessness and overall depression encompasses my mind and make it really blurry to see through. I used to take anything that would get me high but about a year ago I had a incident and had to go to day treatment rehab center. At first it seemed as a nuisance, but meeting the people there and the counselors actually made me feel at home in a way I just can’t describe. The way everyone there was experiencing something similar to me and were also there for me was something I’ll never take for granted. Through the program, I still smoked weed and never completely quit, however my use went from several times a day to maybe once every two days, so it definitely helped. But, today is the day I’m leaving and so are my counselors and I feel like shit. I made some promises to some of the people I held close there that I would never use again, knowing very well I would probably smoke that night and it’s something I just can’t really get over. My natural response is “oh I’m sad, I’ll just go smoke” and I’m trying everything in my power to keep up my three days sober. I figured since I left I would be a new person and refrain from smoking in honor of everyone in my life who wants the best for me (especially the people at rehab) but I still feel some urges to have one last smoke session, which I’ve done several times before.

At least my original objective has been completed, which is an extended amount of time with no THC.

First of all, I‘m still quite new to this sub. Reading the threads and questions here has made me realize how many are going through the same (love-)hate relationship with marijuana. I figured writing a few things down might help me clear my head a little bit and make me more accountable this time.

The last one and a half weeks I found some things more enjoyable. It feels nicer meeting friends and family again, because it was either hard for me to be around people being high and not really being able to focus on the actual activity (even if it was just coffee and chatting for a bit) or I was just waiting to get home to be finally able to smoke some weed alone in peace. 
I don’t miss the paranoid highs either, the guilty conscience because I‘ve told myself I’d stop the next day for the 100th time in a row, and I’m happy about the money I saved already.

Although I feel like my sleep improved and luckily I have no problem falling asleep (I take sleeping meds anyway), I have been feeling very groggy during the day. I always did sports on the regular, but at the moment it’s actually harder than it used to be. I thought not smoking weed would make that easier. Everything just feels very hard and my motivation for anything is low. I really hope this will improve on my journey. 

I realized that’s it’s not just weed keeping me from being the person I want to be. My biggest problems are my lack of focus as well as a lot of procrastination. While I do believe smoking on a daily basis or at times very regular basis has carried these traits too far, I need to actively work on myself to improve concentration and build habits to fill the void. I try to put my phone away during uni/work to focus, force myself to read to do at least something, but it’s tough, especially with my brain thinking about weed 24/7. I often think I’d rather be high, but of course I know that’s not getting me anywhere. The urge on the day I relapsed drove me mad. It reminded me of binging/bulimia I went through in my early twenties - an extreme, overwhelming urge. Anyone got tips on building good habits and keeping them and managing the urge? I‘d really appreciate it. Hope y’all have a good day.",6

It was a surprise for me, I thought that was going to be there forever.
Of course it didn't happen overnight and it is so so hard in the beginning. My mind was screaming. I wanted to bang my head against the wall at random times in the first few weeks. I felt desperate like I didn't know what I was going to do. What do sober people do when they feel sad, stressed or just bored??
What helped me in those moments was to talk. Talk to my loved ones, my therapist and the good people of leaves! I couldn't have done it without the support I got on discord. When I felt like I was going to relapse I would go talk to someone and that made me feel so much better. Also going on discord as much as you can for the group chats. Even if you don't feel like saying anything just reading other people's experience makes you feel like you're not alone.
I don't have any other advice for when you start. It's going to suck, I'm not going to lie but I promise it gets better. Like a wise Baboon once said 'Every day, it gets easier. But you gotta do it every day. That's the hard part. But it does get easier' Withdrawls will pass and cravings will decrease and one day you will realize that you're not even thinking about it anymore.
One important thing to keep in mind is that your journey will most likely not be perfect. Please be nice to yourself. Relapse is a part of recovery so don't beat yourself up too much if it happens because it can be counterproductive. Hope this helps someone",26

What I’m making this post about is that I can’t seem to stay busy, I’m not the type to share my problems with other people but I need help. I can’t stay away from weed because… well idek why anymore it hasn’t gotten me high in close to a year or two. It’s a blur as well.

But what’s important is to try to stay busy to get away from it, but I can’t. I try to go to the gym first thing in the morning since I use to be a regular consistent goer, but now some of the workers notice I leave the gym after only 5-10 minutes of arriving. I leave because I want to be in bed and not be paranoid and anxious and facing with the world head on? If I do face it head on I feel my chest and head get hot or swell up.
It’s the same thing with boxing, I couldn’t push myself to stay in the gym and eventually stopped going, same things with other beloved activities like video games. 
I feel like because I’m not doing these regular everyday things to me and because I can’t I’m getting more insecure.

I got to work which I work for my family, and I come home much earlier than my brother because I can’t seem to keep it together, I’ll get mad or insecure from weed. My parents know about my weed problem so they allow me to leave work early.

I keep trying to occupy my time but I fail each time by not doing it, and going back to bed, also I haven’t quit weed it self since I smoke at like 3 am today.

TL;DR: Does anyone know instance where weed made it hard to function throughout the day for than 15 mins at a time and do things u once loved, and made u insecure? How to fight it off?",3

read this for the backstory, skip to the next paragraph if you don't give a shit. i've had a lot of issues with substances. more issues with my eating disorder, but weed tends to follow. i've spent copious amounts of money & i've just kinda normalized it. right now, i'm smoking everyday. i'm not eating much, but that's not the point of the post. i have a treatment team who is helping me establish a plan to help me get through it. i think a part of me believes that weed is good for me, when in reality, it really isn't the best. the only thing it helps me with is sleep and OCCASIONALLY helps my eating disorder thoughts,

ANYWAYS, so about the title. i recently applied to a dispensary (being impulsive bc i want to move the fuck out of my toxic environment - which i believe will help). i have a training in 3 weeks for a receptionist job. i would never bud tend, so that side of the temptation would be gone during the day. i think it's an easy job & has a lot of perks (not related to weed). i want a fun, easy, light job. i've had too many customer service jobs with people calling me horrible things lol. as i said, i have had substance issues in the past. i also haven't told my therapist & lied to my family saying that i would work at a call center (they hate weed).

These are my symptoms so far; would love to hear if any of these are in common with you guys.,"First 5 days: extreme urge to smoke, took out my weed from behind the closet and almost smoked it, but flipped a coin and it landed on tails so I drank instead; couldn't sleep

First two weeks: increasingly extreme irritability and rage; sensitivity to sound, like people talking too loudly on the subway felt like they were asking me to punch them in the face; increasingly vivid and sometimes horrifying dreams (I know this one is common)

Third week: Sometimes I feel great, particularly when I'm with friends. But when I'm alone I feel very moody and sometimes catatonically depressed, like I have no feelings for anything at all. I can't stop sleeping during the day on weekends, and in general I'm very fatigued -- enough to panic about it being a thyroid disorder or something. On Sunday I slept the entire day and when I woke up for real finally I just started crying. Felt out of breath the whole day and worried it was a lung issue, but my roommate speculated it could have been a kind of day-long anxiety attack. 

&#x200B;

I'm increasingly convinced I want off this drug long-term, not just for a month as I had previously decided. I hit a month on December 1st. But I'm also worried that rather than clearing up after a while, the symptoms could only get worse. I don't crave weed anymore. But instead I'm becoming crazily exhausted and depressive.

Still puffing as a habit but experiencing extreme anxiety when I smoke and even morning after. Heart palpitations, wild thoughts, scared thoughts especially regarding mortality and well-being.

Heading into my late 20s now with kids and feeling like I got the world on my shoulders. Hang with stoner buddies and feel like a teenager again. Stuck between growing up and being stuck in a teenage body. Smoking makes me feel like a legit bum.

Felt kind of centered and normal.

I've grown out of it. It's time to leave it in the past. My body is telling me it's over. My soul needs me to move on. I need to find abundance and joy. It's there for me. Time to take it. I loved my time with weed especially as a young teen / early 20s but like many in my family (uncle and mom) it just caused something to go awry and kind of schitzy.

So I been dealing with this cycle for about a year and a half now. 

I have always had an anxiety disorder, but this past year I think my smoking has caused it to go haywire. 
during quarantine I was smoking multiple times a day, I experienced my first smoking induced panic attack and nearly blacked out it felt like I was having a heart attack. 
Whenever I smoke instead of it being what used to be an enjoyable experience, I am now accompanied by hyper-paranoia. And I mean…. It’s not like I’m just scared I am literally looking through windows scoping out every car thinking that someone might be stalking me. 
This paranoia doesn’t occur when I’m sober (sometimes if I have a bad panic attack the high anxiety will linger for a couple of days) 

I like it when I’m sober from weed, I am able to freely enjoy life. And typically when I go back to smoking the first day I’ll be fine but by day 3 I’m going crazy. 

I don’t know why I keep smoking if I know it’s driving me crazy. And I get mad at myself sometimes because I wish I had the self control to stop",19

Something I always forget is that my anxiety is so bad it causes me to physically feel ill. So while I kept thinking weed was making me feel ill, it was actually my anxiety that was making me feel other symptoms.

My therapist made me realize this by making me talk about my other bouts of anxiety as a child and talking about how I overcame those hardships before.

While overcoming withdrawal symptoms is a win it’s only the beginning of my journey back to being my true self. I now know that my anxiety will never fully go away and it will always be a part of me. The key is to normalize it and put in the work to manage it. Understanding this has put me at ease. I thought sharing this would also give others piece of mind.",22

I was a regular smoker for 3 years, smoking every single day. I started as a treatment for my migraines, as I found it really helped with the pain and nausea associated with my migraines. But I started using it more and more. My nausea became a daily thing, not just when I had migraines. It turned into chronic abdominal pain as well. I had multiple medical tests done, including endoscopies, colonoscopies, MRIs, ultrasounds, and nothing showed any internal issues. I continued to smoke the weed to cope with the pain and to curb the nausea. I was throwing up all the time, and it was completely destroying my life. 

About 6 months ago, my doctors messed up with a contradictory prescription, combining 2 medications that they weren't supposed to combine, causing me to land in the hospital. During this time, I was being pumped with other medications and was afraid of the weed interacting with these medications, so I stopped cold turkey. 

Let me tell you... weed withdrawal is a THING! Even after I got out of the hospital, I continued to stay sober. I was extremely anxious, depressed, nauseous, no appetite, and miserable for 3-4 months after quitting. I could barely get out of bed most days and was posting on here all the time, questioning my decision to quit. Hands down, the hardest thing I've ever done. But it's worth it! 

Around the 4 month mark, I realized that I started to feel better. I started to feel hunger again and was no longer nauseous. I started to wonder if it was the weed exacerbating these issues all along. So a couple weeks ago, I decided to try the weed again. Not to start up smoking daily again, but to see if the nausea returned. And guess what? IT DID! The morning after smoking, I woke up nauseous and miserable. The nausea continued for about a week before subsiding. I haven't smoked since, and I don't plan on it. 

I've heard of CHS (cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome), and and wonder if that is ultimately what I developed. However, the typical ""cures"" of hot showers and capsaicin rubs on the abdomen never did anything for me. 

Regardless, I am relieved to have found the cause of the chronic digestive issues and nausea, and finally see a light at the end of the tunnel. I'm hoping that by posting my story, I can encourage others to stick to their sobriety and feel optimistic. I know I questioned if quitting was the right solution for me, for a long time. But I finally now have the answer that quitting was 100% the right call. 

It's a TOUGH road ahead to quit, and you won't feel better right away. But there is a light at the end of the tunnel. You have to be STRONG to quit, and I believe in all of you! Anybody who needs help, please feel free to reach out!",16

My journey started when my pipe got clogged one day and I said FUCK IT, I was sick of unclogging that pipe and sick of being a miserable fuck. It was super scary to take the leap, but a year later, I don’t regret it for one second and my life has changed in the most beautiful ways.
The first couple months were incredibly difficult. I was dealing with immense emotional pain that I had buried for years that was finally starting to resurface. But I came out on top and took up meditation as my new form of medicating. And I learned and felt SO much. I started reading tarot daily and listening to my intuition and my body and made some beautiful friendships and memories with magical humans along the way. I ended up finishing school and getting my first park ranging job shortly after. Living at Clear Lake was one of the best things I could have done for myself to allow myself the space and time to heal to grow. I soaked up so much sunshine and watched so many spectacular meteors and chased butterflies and birds for days. I encountered the most spectacular souls and sang and danced my life full and I felt immense gratitude for the life I’ve been given and the present moment and I believe it all started with accepting what is, instead of resisting it daily through my bad habits. Today I can feel so much more than I ever could before I quit. I’m freer, I’m happier, I’m more grateful for the life I have and I’m more eager to chase my dreams and live my best life yet.
And to all of you out there struggling to let go, take the leap. Give up the bad habits keeping you from living your life and LIVE to your highest potential. The light is deep down in every one of us if we choose to see it, and if we choose to be it. CHOOSE LIFE.

Unfortunately, it also makes me tired, not remember things, feel unmotivated, and most importantly, I don't think it's helping me deal with trauma, it's just making it quiet. 

Anyone have any tips on how to resist in the moment? Like right now I can say I don't want to smoke, I'm at work and have no access to weed. But at night, the uncomfortable feelings settle in, and it's hard to ignore the temptation of going numb. Because the arguments for it can be so convincing! But I don't want to be numbed out for the rest of my life.",59

I have been enjoying reading through the forum and seeing that there are many others on the same path as I. It hasn’t been easy but I have had to stop for my own good after smoking chronically for 5 years straight. Im now 20, and haven’t been having many if any cravings, and am enjoying dreaming again. I have been driving a lot for fun as im in the process of scheduling my road test. 
My issue has been that I have been losing interest in anything and dont feel fulfilled or encouraged to act like myself. I binge eat and game a lot to escape honestly.  I have been neglecting/ignoring my family and old friends, missing family gatherings because I just feel embarrassed of who I am currently.
Ive always been a good student even when smoking but in this past year i dropped all my courses twice now and am transitioning careers into nursing. I look forward to it and being able to occupy my time but in my downtime, i find it hard to have self esteem be social given that i havent been doing much and find it hard to want to do anything about it. I just wanted to share and see if there is anyone that has been in the same situation and have advise to alternative mentalities and open back up into society.",3

I just bought a timed lock box so I can taper down more without continually fighting my addict brain. I’m hoping the gradual decline will make actually quitting feel less painful than it has in the past.

I know how important it is that I keep going, but on days like this where I'm already down, not smoking just makes everything so much harder - I miss that boost of endorphins that'd make even the most menial tasks fun. Playing video games just isn't the same anymore either, and that used to be my go-to outlet when I was struggling with my mental health, even before I started smoking heavily, but now even that just feels like a chore.

 But what I noticed though is that now I'm cumming too fast, I had the same issue also some other times when I didn't have access to weed or was for vacations for example. For the last 3 years or so whenever I had sex or masturbated I was high. Sometimes I would edge myself over the span of two hours or so while doing two or three joints. I felt nice, it was pleasurable. While high, my stamina was pretty great and my then partner would really like it. Now I  can't even last a minute while jerking off and it drags me down. It stresses me out and it has made me not pursue dating or one night stands because I feel that I won't even last a minute.

Idk is the best answer
Like how can I think of a time being high and remember how normal that felt, n be sober without feeling a change or am I just placeboing and falling for every dillusion in front of me.
It made me enjoy life more I suppose. It did whatever I wanted,n it had its up and its downs sometimes. Sometimes I used it for fun. I used it.
Now I feel lost and hopeless. Im even high now but knowing ill be without it just makes this high horrible.
Honestly I feel a bit insane sometimes?
Is this normal?
I get emotions from ideas that I typically can surpass, even when in a pretty sober state before smoking. But now I imagine the worst case scenario for everything.
I keep phycing myself out constantly..
Idk maybe this is just how the end of the cycle is supposed to feel before taking the necessary steps in ""recovery"" for lack of term.

I ask for help regarding anything I've stated and also have follow up questions to those dealing/having dealt with these issues.

1. Did you psyche yourself out alot
2.what do you do to cope now
3.is the best idea just forget about it and not deal with the idea that it can cause any upcoming issues? (Withdraws, patterns of thinking caused by)
4.cope with the fascination of the being high (how to not demonize it? While maintaining creating a new normal)
5.how has your journey changed in life, way of thinking? 
6. What normal transition int thought pattern? Emotion? Ect should one expect with quiting?

I understand everyone can be/is different. But even weed now is hitting me different, not always but I sometimes just feel ""too high"" which I had never gotten before. But that feeling makes me feel out of control

A year later she broke up with me for reasons that were more or less related to weed. My addiction made me selfish.
Then I managed to stop for a while, and things took a short turn for the better.

After my appointment with the immigration office a couple of months back, I realized I might actually get deported, and I relapsed hard!

I completely numbed myelf to thinking about the whole situation. Anytime I feel that anxiety about to hit I just rolled up, which was all the time!
I don't know what's wrong with me! I completely distanced myself from my family since I've been keeping everything from them and I'm running out of lies and time!

The only thing I had going for me was my job, I was good at it, and I felt like I still had a small contribution to society, 2 weeks ago I was fired because I exceeded the maximum hours allowed on my work permit, and now I'm even facing charges.

I just tossed away everything, I tried quitting so many times before that I'm losing hope in my self. I keep thinking about my ex, my college, my missed opportunities, and all I can think is that I am such a fucking idiot for letting so many just slip through my fingers because I would rather get high. At some point I've had people throwing opportunities at me, I could have had it all!

Something I noticed about every time I quit -- it's really only the first day that is *hard.*

It's only ever the very first day where I actually have to resist cravings (I live in a house where weed is accessible af), and I have to say ""no"" a million times in the day. I have to resist when my roommate offers me a dab, I have to resist a loaded bowl of weed that is just sitting on the kitchen table, and I have to resist walking to the store and just buying a pre-roll.

But after the first day, it's really astounding how fast the substance completely leaves my mind.

After that first day, suddenly three weeks pass....

I open my dresser and see a pipe and think, ""oh... a pipe? Oh, right, I used to smoke weed.""

So, common advice, just try to make it passed the first day at first.

Don't think of it as ""quitting weed forever,"" but think of it as, ""quitting weed for today and seeing how it feels.""

And then wake up the next day, think about how awesome it was that you didn't get high the day before.

And then think about how awesome THIS DAY is gonna be, since it will be your 2nd day without smoking weed.

And then, before you know it, the days won't be ""Day X without weed"" -- it will just be a normal day of your normal life.",16

(I’m now 23yr old male). Have a solid job, finishing up my bachelors in psychology. Went 3 months without touching weed awhile back and was finally seeing real growth, consistency and results. Went on a trip to Michigan with my family several months ago during the summer and relapsed completely. Have been dialing it back somewhat just weekend smoking but feel as though that’s simply a justification to smoke..I can list all the pros and cons of my personal experience with weed and the negatives far outweigh the positives. I really value my health/wellness and exercise. Focusing on a balanced diet and regular exercise is my best coping method for my OCD/anxiety and it empowers me and makes me feel the best about myself. 

Weed gives temporary relief to the anxiety symptoms but at the same time it induces social paranoia, munchies and makes me lethargic which ultimately makes me feel poorly about myself which I smoke again to escape the negative feelings.

i’ve never posted on reddit but this seems like the kind of community I need at this time. I started smoking regularly when covid hit and gradually got to the point of smoking daily for the last six months. i’ve never had any negative side effects, if anything it makes me more social/talkative (i’m pretty introverted) and frankly I just love it. I guess I like myself better when I’m high. but man, it hurts to put that in writing, haha 
I guess the only bad thing is that I couldn’t control my munchies for the life of me, but I never really saw any weight gain as i’m pretty active anyway. my lifestyle is healthy other than that. I eat decently, run pretty often, work on my feet all day, and am finishing up my masters. weed was the thing i’d look forward to after a long day, a way to treat myself, to escape. ironically I think my sense of humor and general ability to hold a conversation is SO heightened too. my confidence has also sky rocketed in the last year. I feel like i’ve learned so much about myself. 

ANYWAY, I just got a really exciting job offer and am now panicking about getting drug tested…. that’s not the only reason I want to quit though. in some ways i’m just flat out disappointed in myself for developing an addiction to weed. I always thought I was stronger than that, but considering that the growth i’ve seen in myself recently is all thanks to a substance, I’m terrified that all this progress i’ve made on myself is going to crash and burn if I stop smoking. 

so, I’m on day 6 today. 
I suppose the point of this post is to get some kind of advice as to how the hell I’m supposed to keep this up long enough to get a year and a half’s worth of thc out of my system, or at least until I stop thinking about it. i’m sure it’s different for everyone, but I didn’t expect this to suck so much. it’s helped that my friends are in on it enough to keep me accountable, but it’s more of an internal struggle for me— my thoughts have taken a darker turn, and today is the first day i’ve felt so down for no reason in a long time. any and all advice is appreciated ❤️",7

I also hit a joint.,"I was with some friends at a bonfire last night when one guy pulled out a joint. When I saw him pull it out, I reminded himself I shouldn’t hit it, and wasn’t too worried about feeling like I’m missing out because I’ve turned down weed before and still had a good time. But when it was offered to me, my monkey brain kicked in and I accepted it without a thought.

It felt good for a minute or two, but then I just became anxious and overstimulated. Still had an OK time but I felt paranoid that I was being awkward the whole time (probably was cuz that’s just me but weed made me unable to control those thoughts). Pocketed the roach for when I got home because I knew I’d want more. Spent most of my buzz waiting to feel normal again because I enjoy my brain working properly and didn’t like feeling impaired.

Though hours had passed and I was good to drive, I could’ve gotten a DUI when a cop lit me up while I was on the side of the road around the corner from my friend’s place looking up directions to get home. He shined his light in my eyes and told me to pull over to a safer area and rest.

Today, I met with a friend I met in rehab who’s always been there for me. We had planned this in advance, and he doesn’t know I used. I didn’t tell him what had happened because I don’t want to break his heart or for him to worry. But I don’t feel guilty and I’m not beating myself up because one day of smoking does not take away from 510 days of sobriety. 

While I’m dealing with some withdrawal symptoms and cravings for more weed, I realize that the best way to stop craving it is to *not* smoke again. I’ll probably feel off for a few days and have strong cravings, but I’m truly grateful that I’m sober today and that I get to experience the beautiful feeling of my body and mind rebalancing.

I feel a sense of numbness/emptiness over and inside me, and while I am extremely optimistic that I can get back on track with my personal life goals, I have a deep horrific fear about slowly sobering up and having all my negative thoughts, guilt, and hatred slowly hit me without any way to cope with emotions.

I got into community college, and have maintained a 3.0+ GPA, but this year I have gone downhill in work ethic, motivation, and happiness. I also got a lot of aid for school. Life should be going great for me because I have it all, but I am scared shitless of my life right now because of the guilt of what I have done this past year.

I have spent well over 3k this year. I had never had even 500 bucks to my name growing up throughout hs, and ever since the pandemic started and I got into college I have a lot of money thanks to aid and a car from my savings. I cannot fathom what I have done, and the pain and guilt eats me up everyday.

Some days I cannot function because I feel like throwing up from the guilt and pain of burning my money away. My familys always grown up financially unstable, and I let the idea that ""everyone has their vices"" trick me into burning this much money. I don't spend any money on videogames or online stuff like some of my friends do, and haven't gone out at all since covid.

I feel like a failure at 19. I started my adult years even lower than square 1. I have a lot of fear and dread/guilt everyday for the absurd and unreal amounts of money I have spent. I feel like no one else can be this stupid with money, and quite literally ""BURNING"" it away.

I cannot seem to be able to accept that I am a ""good person"" while at the same time having burned my money and brain all year while my family and parents work hard everyday.

I've been getting high every Friday-Sunday for the last 4 years. When Monday rolls around, I feel _awful._ Like genuinely sad about my life and lacking any motivation to do anything. I can ""survive"" my clean days (M-Th), but it feels like a means to an end – those days are so insufferably bland. Nothing brings me joy. Everything requires herculean effort. I spend 99% of my time alone. I say no to dates, to meet ups with friends, because I know I'll be bored and joyless. 

I'm having this realization that my brain might simply be unable to make dopamine like it used to. It is dependent on weed for that function now. The problem is, I am deeply isolated. Many of my friends moved away during quarantine. The new connections I've made are weak, and they're always out doing something fun or traveling, and I can barely motivate myself to do basic chores. 

Just so we're not mincing words, _this is likely driven by weed,_ right? I have always been an introvert, but this extreme asociality seems to be a product of weed dependence, because people don't bring me joy. That breaks my heart. People are all that really matter in this world, and if I can't enjoy their company, what am I doing here? 

Weed isn't even that fun anymore. The first hour is nice. After that, I just feel heavy-eyed, drowsy, with little euphoric/creative/trippy thoughts, but rather feel slow, mellowed out, and indolent. The day after, I always feel devastatingly tired throughout the day, just biding my time till I can get high at night.",8

2021-11-21 14:43:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qz2phg/to_my_fellow_musicians/,To my fellow musicians,"I've improved on the guitar more in a few months of sobriety than I have in 5+ years of constantly getting high, all while devoting roughly the same amount of time towards it—talk about inefficiency. This is due to a few factors which I'll explain below.

**1)**  The first and probably the most obvious one is my dramatically increased ability to memorize and retain information, which as we know, is about half the battle when improving at our instruments and many other skills for that matter. I'm not even exaggerating, it use to take me weeks to memorize a set list of songs and now I can practically do it in a few hours of practicing. When I worked on memorizing songs while high, I could eventually get it down but then the next day, or even later on in the same day, I would forget and it seemed like it just wouldn't stick without constant repetition day after day. It basically felt like an inordinate amount of effort for something that really didn't feel like it should require it. Now it's almost like I have a pseudo-photographic memory in comparison.

For example, I memorized the chord changes in Cherokee and Blue In Green out of the Real Book in less than an hour. I could never even dream of doing that back when I was high all the time.

**2)**  The second thing is that my mind doesn't subconsciously start wandering when I'm improvising or working through and developing musical ideas. When I was high all the time, I would start working on something and then after 5-10 minutes I would slip into mindless noodling for an hour without even realizing it. Then I would ""wake up"" and be like, ""Wait, what was I doing again?"" This drove me nuts and was very detrimental to my practice sessions in retrospect. Noodling can be fun and can help get things under our fingers, but practicing things with intent is how you really maximize your time spent doing it.

**3)** The third is that I have a noticeable increased drive to learn more. This, like the other things I mentioned, also applies to other aspects of life beyond just playing music. I use to learn a new technique or musical device and then exploit the crap out of it while driving it into the ground for months on end without learning anything new. Then I would get so bored with what I was playing that I would basically be forced to learn something else out of sheer disenchantment with the instrument and it always felt like such a chore. Rinse and repeat.

Now I'll learn something new, practice it and get it down, and then upon doing that it will feed my motivation to move on to the next thing. My increased ability to retain information, as mentioned in my first point, obviously makes this whole process easier as I'm not forgetting things as I move along.

**4)**  Now for the thing that likely many stoner musicians are thinking about. Since quitting weed, my creativity has not suffered at all, and if anything, has improved. There's not much else to say on this one. It is what it is. I'm just as capable and driven to create new songs and ideas as I ever was while abusing marijuana. Don't fool yourself into thinking that being high is where your creative vigor stems from. This is a common sentiment among the musicians I know who get high and I haven't found it to be the case whatsoever.

**5)**  Now for the bad part. I was so conditioned to get high while playing guitar that when I quit using, I found it very difficult to practice. It felt like a chore and I really had to force myself to do it. I couldn't stand it for more than an hour at a time and sometimes even less. This legitimately worried me and I began questioning whether I was as passionate about music as I was lead to believe for most of my life. I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a couple existential breakdowns during the early days of sobriety as a result of this.

This disconnect eventually dwindled with time. The problem is that it happens slowly enough to the point where you sometimes don't even notice it until one day several months down the line, after your mind has cleared up and healed itself to a certain point, the passion resurfaces itself in full force. Everything clicks and you begin to clearly see your potential with a powerful drive to harness it.

From what I've read throughout this subreddit, this isn't specific to playing an instrument. It seems to be par for the course with many of our interests and passions that we built around using weed. Part of getting off of an addiction is relearning areas of our life without it, but I can tell you from personal experience, it is exceedingly worth the struggle and then some.",20

It all started in July 2020 (started in the first lockdown because i was bored) since even the very first time i smoked weed i was cool with it, i enjoyed it, i never hit a whitey, i never got paranoid, i was always cool and went with it. I continued to smoke maybe 3 times a month with no issues up until around February 2021 where i started to smoke almost every day because i was going through a breakup, I still had no issues at all at this point i had still not had a negative experience with weed everything was cool and i enjoyed it. I continued this perfectly fine until one day June 19th 2021 i bought some lemon haze i rolled up .5 in a rizla silver and went to smoke as i usually did (at this point it was standard procedure) i smoked the joint standing out my front door while eating my kfc everything was fine while smoking it it tasted fine nothing was odd, I finished the joint went inside and sat on my bed, The second i sat on my bed i out of nowhere felt my heart pounding extremely hard and extremely fast (im not joking it felt like my chest was being punched from the inside) when i noticed this i got a bit startled and felt a bit panicky so i went through to the living room where my grandad was (he smoked weed alot when he was younger) i told him what was happening and he said its probably just my blood pressure lowering and my hearts beating faster to compensate. At this point i was completely overwhelmed in panic and did not believe what he was saying i started to get stabbing pains in my chest, left arm, neck and lip for some reason, This was followed by complete numbness of my limbs (i was convinced i was having a heart attack at this point) so i said to my grandad what was happening to me and told him i thought i was having a heart attack and he said trust me son your not, then he took me outside and he told me to walk around the car park until i started to feel more clearheaded, This worked after about id guess 15-20 minutes of pacing around the car park my head began to clear up and i wasnt having racing paranoid thoughts. We then went inside and sat down again my heart was still beating superhard and super fast but i tried to not start panicking again he gave me some orange juice to drink and put family guy on the TV because we both always laugh our asses off watching it and he told me to just sip my juice and watch family guy. I did exactly that and about an hour an a half later (im guessing) all of the heart stuff and panic was gone i felt completely normal again. That night when i was falling asleep i suddenly woke up because it felt like my heart had stopped so i jolted up gasping for air and then went back to sleep. The next day i didnt think much of it i just assumed that it was the strain since haze is known to cause paranoia in those succeptible to it so i didnt think it was weed in general, Still though i told my self id take a break off it and i did until the 21st of July 2021 when my and my best mate went camping he had some lovely stardawg and he rolled us a joint maybe .8 -1g in it with some tobacco he took 4 draws off it and gave it to me and i took 3 draws off it and gave it back (expecting to just have some relaxing effects to enjoy the view from where we were) but sure as shit the same fuc\*\*\*g thing happened to me again although this time i tried as hard as i could to just ride it out since i didnt want to make my mate paranoid. After this i have dabbled with weed only taking a few draws on and off with different strains mostly heavy indicas my friends have rolled up and sure as shit the same thing keeps happening. 

Now i am dead set on going completely clean off of weed ive tried taking breaks ive tried different strains and the same shit keeps happening and theres no reason to put something in your body you dont enjoy so im done with it. Id also like to mention that every time the weird paranoid heart racing thing has happened my lips have gotten bright bright red with a slight purple to them and feel like they have swollen up but visibly haven't swollen at all.

The last puff on a joint literally hurt, and I knew I was done.  I got sick right after with strep (from my kids) and then I started noticing I was breathing harder.  It got worse, went to Urgent care.  They treat it like asthma.  THen I went through an episode where I couldn't smell anything but gas for 2 weeks.  I was starting to freak out.  At Halloween I was so weak I could barely take the kids trick or treating.  On the way to work one day I felt weird and short of breath, and it wasn't really improving.  I felt pressure in my chest and genuine pain.  I freaked, went to the Ed. THe did a CT, blood work, and an MRI.  Everything checked out except my sky high blood pressure (150/90).  Dude tolk me I probably had some lingering viral infection in my lungs, and that everything checked out.  That was a month ago.  Now they hav me on lisinopril andI usually have one bad  episode of racing heart and high blood pressure once a day.  I'm fairly certian I gave myself chronic bronchitis to boot.  THe chest pain comes and goes, it migrates to different regions of my chest.  It frequently wakes me up at night.  It's been almost 3 months and this is still goign  on.  I'm scared, deeply scared.  I got a referral to see a pulmonologist and a cardiologist which I plan to do as soon as I can.  I wish I'd never got into cannabis.  It's so easy to dismiss it, but  I was addicted, without a doubt.  And now I feel like I'm going to pay for it for the rest of my life.  Still, it's only been 3 months, some symptoms are better.  My bronchioles are still gunky, I still hack up mostly clear gunk.  But at least I can smell again.  Even when I  was a heavy user I was very fit.  Now I'm  afraid to jog or do pullups/pushups.  I usually get in a lame walk with my kids and that's about it.  They  don't get to ride my shoulders and I'm less inclined  to chase them all over the playground.  I guess I just have to keep the faith that I haven't completely wrecked my health.  One thing is certain,  I will never consume cannabis in  any  form ever again.

2. Weed
3. Mania
4. Family
5. Friends
6. Higher Power

Actually 2 and 3 belong together — because weed always leads to mania

And me being my bp1 self I always have the same thoughts — “I can fix my bp. I have the right set of tools now, I’m older, wiser, lol, sexier, more together, slinkier, leaner, stronger, etc now. I found the secret to combatting anxiety and depression and social awkwardness… the green goddess, the seducer…, Hey, I’m not drinking, I’m drinking a lot of water, I’m working out… you can do this… You a strapping 24 year old, single, no kids stud that will keep it together this time!”

Even time I crash and burn everytime, I always think that the next time I will find the right combo of weed intake, insight, water consumption, seconds of holding my breath, and witty stories that will prevent the full blown mania.

Anyone have the same feelings towards the weeds? Share pls.",4

In case you were following my earlier posts, you might notice that I should be further along than I am.

The reason for this is that I relapsed on what would have been day 3. I smoked that day and then the next day before throwing out the stash again on what would have been day 5. I've been waiting to catch up to where I left off before posting again.

I am obviously not recommending a relapse to anyone.. but in my case it actually helped solidify the fact that \*none\* of the relief I sought in smoking is available to me any more. Smoking on those days was pure stress and foreboding. I had excused myself to it as ""well, this is where I'm at right now,"" but it immediately started triggering paranoia and a sense of sadness at the fact that I was backsliding.

This was actually really helpful because before the relapse my brain simply would not stop ""suggesting"" weed as an option for my time.

After the relapse it's not really trying the same maneuvers any more. It feels a bit like I've finally accepted that it's not going to help. I've ""smoked through"" paranoia enough times to know that it is an ""option"" but I'm super glad to be on a different path through this.

Some other thoughts from today: I smoked spliffs while tapering and so now I have a bit of a nicotine addiction. I'm trying to be aware of transference but the truth is I was probably already smoking as many spliffs as I did at least partly due to a nicotine dependence. (I definitely don't recommend picking up a tobacco habit while quitting weed but I also think it is really dangerous to potential success to try quitting everything at once.)

I'm truly grateful to the community here. I might judge myself but I never feel judged by others on this subreddit. Thank you for reading.",5
2021-11-21 06:46:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qytcie/quitting_weed_finally/,Quitting Weed Finally!,"Hey guys, 22-year-old male here started using marijuana when I moved out to start university at the age of 18 so about 4.5 years of consistent use, with rare 1 month breaks in between when I would visit my parents.

Since covid started, I moved back home, and that 'excuse' to visit parents and be sober was no longer present, at first I didn't smoke at all being home, but after a about 1-2 months, the devil thoughts - ""just one joint won't hurt"" etc came in, lets just say since around May of 2020 I've not been sober excluding maybe 3-4 nights at max. It's almost like that break coming home to my parents being sober kept my use in check and didn't make me realize how out of control I actually was getting.

Ive attempted so many times over the course of 2021 to quit the furthest I went was 2 days on holidays with the family, and honestly ive never felt as sh\*t as I did those two days... and I was supposed to be having fun on vacation with loved ones.

I've now taken a trip overseas to try force myself to be sober, I know its not ideal but when I smoke I hate myself for it but if I try be sober somehow I end up messaging my plug at 9-10pm at night and getting on.

As of 15 minutes ago, marks day number 5 ive been sober. This thread has done wonders for me and thought I would share my story in hope to get some support!

Life just feels so boring at the moment without it, hoping thats just a dopamine imbalance thats leveling out slowly.... I never expected withdrawals be like this ",1
2021-11-21 06:26:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qyt2xu/timeline_of_positive_changes/,Timeline of Positive Changes?," I quit weed 10 days ago. I just got my drivers license and bought a car and realized that if I get high everyday, I won't be able to drive it anywhere. That just made me feel so small and worthless. Then I read this book about quitting and it completely opened my eyes to how weed was ruining my life and rendering me a shell of the person I truly am deep down. It was a godsend. It made me so motivated to quit, and that motivation hasn't faltered much in the past week. For whatever reason I never really suffered withdrawals. Some cravings here and there, maybe a bit of insomnia, but no night sweats, no bad dreams, no irritability, none of that. I feel incredibly blessed.

One positive change I've noticed since quitting is that I feel sharper all the time. Being sober, undeniably brings me confidence and self-esteem and just generally makes me feel like a bad bitch who can get in her car and take over the world at a moments notice (and not have to wait until tomorrow when I'm sober to drive anywhere). And I'm really excited to feel more changes. I smoked pretty much daily for the last ten years and I can only imagine the damage I have done to my personality and psychology. For one, **I have not laughed out loud in many years.** This is the cost of weed that hurts me the most: I can't laugh. Not even a little. I envy people who can have conversations with others and chuckle when someone says something even mildly humorous. I feel like laughing together brings people closer and I believe I have weaker relationships with people because of my inability to laugh at anyone's casual jokes. I feel like it's just so odd when someone lets out a laugh, as people do, so often during casual conversation, and I'm just standing there awkwardly half-smiling at them. I believe it makes things really uncomfortable. That's the main reason I quit weed. The book I read told me that it was bringing me anhedonia and I figure that's what's keeping me from laughing.

I'm just wondering about the timeline of positive changes. When do you think my ability to laugh will come back? Can you share with me your timeline of positive changes? Like, when did the brain fog go away? When did you start to feel wittier? When did you feel less depressed? When did you stop feeling like an imposter at work? I know it's different for everyone, and that's why I would like to get input from multiple fellow former stoners. What were the benefits of quitting weed for you, and approximately when did they come about? This sort of information is what has been keeping me motivated for the past week, and I believe learning more about the benefits and when they come about will keep me motivated forever. Is anyone willing to share?

Thanks so much in advance, and I wish you all the luck on the world with your journey. ❤",11

I left my meaningless job my full time job is to quit weed and reduce other medecines (didn't start on this yet).

Everynight I am having nightmares, I am stuck 10 years older than I am in my nightmares.
I never had **dreams**. When I was a kid I was complaining about not getting good sleep/hard time getting to sleep and my parents needed to wake me up at 6 because of their work (well needed.. haha.).

I know I didn't mention the other medications because I don't want to leave too much traces which will reveal my identity when we'll reach a metaverse internet. (Not paranoid about this **yet**).

The period I am stuck at is pretty much the period I started smoking everynight and then everyday, all day.

Do you relate to this ? Or is this another thing I fucked in my brain cuz of the meds I've been taking ?
It looks like after 10 days I'm getting older a little bit (in the nightmares).

In my last post someone explained me I have a backlog to process is this it ?

Had I not left my job I couldn't do it because I need 12 to 14 hours of sleep, to me a night full of nightmares doesn't really count as a good resting night, is this me being a pussy or does nightmares affect the recover phase of sleep ?

The fog is starting to clear, the dreams are insane although most of them are thriller/nightmare type of deals (I keep dying in my dreams quite a bit).

I'm eating one relatively big meal a day with lot of salad and veggies, non-processed meat and some carbs like potato/rice/pasta. Started to eat more chicken as well, instead of just red meat. My IBS-type of symptoms are slowly diminishing, which is huge as well! The motivation gets better each day as I notice more and more positive things.   


I haven't touched a bag of chips nor any kind of munchie-food - and I'm not even craving for those! Sure, I miss weed a bit, but it's only 9 days in so that's perfectly understandable.

It has been a ride. After quitting, and the usual 3 weeks of crankyness and insomnia, I became sad much more often (haven't cried in years before that) and I realized why I started smoking so much four years ago: Reality is not ehat I dreamt it to be. Some people are disrespectful, downputting, ecen though I try to be respectful and understanding, but I was basically a doormat. Also, connected to this, my love live sucks since like a decade.


After 3 months I thought the worst is over, and back then I often woke up at night and just felt like a total loser, regarding my PhD and regarding my love life. I has gotten better, but it is still not good. 


I take my problems much more serious now and decided to take life in my own hands. I started therapy (but still feel, they can't help me, somehow). I finished my PhD and can finally do something about the sexual harassment from my supervisor, that has been annoying me like hell for 4.5 years. I will try to focus more on the things in life that I want, instead of just surfing some wave nearby. Sadly, looking for a corporate job (which I might have to do if I fight my PhD supervisor, who planned a post-doc position for me) puts me down; working 40 hours in some shitty company doesn't sound like I am going to like it at all!

I need to work on my mental health, and I *need* to save my money. 

My girlfriend is about 5 months pregnant. I about proposed to her today, but I didn't want to have my family there to be apart of that. My mom would try to get me to reenact the first time so she can take another 5k photos and show them all to strangers just trying to enjoy the lights with their families.

Day 1 started with me dropping her off at work and headed home to play vr for a bit, scrolled through reddit for an hour instead then got a call from my friend that works with her saying I needed to call her OB. I immediately picked her up and we rushed to the ER. Turned out she had a uti, so they gave her antibiotics and something to help sooth her bladder, and they checked to make sure the baby is doing well in there.

We did get to go through a walk-through of Christmas lights with my immediate family and niece, and she definitely enjoyed it. My mom took us out to eat and it was a good time. 

I wanted to go buy a cigar or something just to smoke something after the e.r. and the family.. but I quit cigarettes earlier this year to save money. Catch is, all the money I saved ended up going to mary. My priorities have been in absolute shambles and I'm ashamed of it, but I have to fix this and keep my head on straight, ill be raising a family here soon.

I'm 25 and have don't remember a day going sober for just over half of my life. I used to say ""im a stoner, not a pothead, I don't need it"" but 13 years of smoking daily proved me to be a liar there.

Oh and I've worked out twice today to avoid cravings. Thank you to the multiple posts on here and comments that gave me that idea! Its alot harder to think about weed when your arms feel like jello! Lol

What a start of sobriety. 

On mobile, so formatting is bad, but i know my sentence structures are even wost.. so apologies lol

Tldr;just passed 24 hours sober. Girlfriend is pregnant, went to hospital (she's okay, baby's okay), I've been pathetic when it comes to saving money, and working out helps cravings so far.

Whether their family are rich or poor, have PhD's or barely got by with a GED, are privileged or marginalized.... their family is frankly, circumstantial. They didn't get to pick after all. 

I used to have pretty high standards for who I chose to call my friends. After all, like the saying goes ""Friends are the family you pick for yourself."" So I tried to choose wisely. I wanted friends that brought out the best in me. That I was proud to associate with.

All that went to hell in a hand basket over the last 20 years the more I smoked. The deeper my addiction to weed went - from smoking casually to weekly, from weekly to daily, from never at work to always blazing before work, 24/7 - the more  I smoked, the more I tolerated acquaintances that were, frankly, pathetic. The only thing we had in common was to get baked.

I felt myself ""dumbing it down"" in order to hang out with people because they were my hook up. I watched myself tolerate boorish behaviour; intolerant behaviour; thoughtless, careless, ignorant behaviour - just because I wanted to go over to their place, hang out, and smoke endlessly. I exposed myself to circumstances where these ""friends"" took advantage of my good nature. Took advantage of my desperate, sad need to always have someone close at hand that wouldn't judge my addiction.

They took advantage of my financial stability, my career liaisons and my skills. They tarnished my reputation with people who I \*did\* respect ! And... I LET THEM !! ""No one can make you feel inferior without your permission."" Oh how true ! I rolled over and kept my mouth shut any time their behaviour rankled me. Because, these were my smoking buddies and my hook up.

Over time, not only did my addiction deepen and get worse, so did my resentment towards these friends. I resented how, every time I left their company, I felt worse about myself. I resented spending my free time with people who left a patina of ""loser"" on me. That's a super judgey-judgemental thing to say, but seriously - I have standards. Or at least I used to. And I re-set my bar astonishingly low for years in order to feed my weed addiction.

One of the hardest things is to re-calibrate relationships in light of sobriety. I don't hang around with people like that anymore. Everyone is on their own path, I know - but they're still addicted. Smoking 24/7. They are unemployed and unemployable. Doing nothing to contribute to society, or to volunteer at organizations. Ignoring their crippling physical and mental health issues. Never improving their minds by reading or watching things of substance that focus on ideas - they prefer to gossip and indulge in character assassination for entertainment. When I view these old friends now through a sober lens, I just want to disengage as quickly as possible.

At this point, I believe they were put on this earth to act as a warning to me. Quit smoking weed now ! Lest I end up like them.",102

I am a very creative person, and many say I inspire them due to how much motivation and drive I have for all things I do, yet as I have gotten older, I have noticed a withdrawal of interest in many of my favourite activities, increased social anxiety and reduced short and long term memory.

 I am not a daily smoker, but I have had periods as long as 3 months where I would smoke most evenings. At first, getting high was a big appeal to me due to a perception of increased appreciation for music and of increased creativity, but slowly over the course of the first year of smoking I noticed it became much more difficult to engage in the things I took interest in.

The dreams though… are getting crazy.  I smoked for about 15 years mostly daily but with a low quantity (1/4 a month, or .5 g cart in 6 weeks).  I always had dreams, but not that many.  For the past month, I’ve been having super intense dreams and I’m exhausted no matter how much I sleep.  

I’ve been exercising by mainly walking 3-5 miles a day, and doing Pilates and yoga workouts as well.  Trying to eat healthier, cooking most of my own meals.  

I’ve got bi-polar type 2, and I’ve had to adjust my meds.  I always felt weed was helping address a gap (cuz I hated taking prescriptions for the anxiety) but now I’m realizing it was probably making them work all wonky.  I wonder how much my med adjustments are affecting my sleep and dreams.  After I quit, I was sooooo depressed and anhedonic, and my doc reduced the mood stabilizer because apparently it keeps serotonin from releasing.  It’s crazy to think that I felt good before, when I was probably just making my brain do crazy overtime because I was giving it extra chemicals to balance.

I smoked all day everyday when I lived with them for 3 years during undergrad. They don’t know I struggled with addiction or that I have quit. I keep thinking of things I’ll tell them when they ask if I want to smoke. “Nah my highs haven’t been good lately,” I’m trying to cut back,” etc. but “I tried moderating and could not because I’m addicted” seems like too much to admit. 

The other side of this is that I’m thinking, well if there ever were a time for me to smoke, it would be tonight. I recognize that as my addict voice talking, but when you don’t feed it for a long time, it gets really calm and rational sounding. That’s scary. I know smoking at all is a slippery slope for me that will lead to me calling my dealer tomorrow, or wanting to wake and bake tomorrow morning.

I’ve come to realize the reason I felt like this was because I was on weed. While on weed, during the off days I’d feel like my mind was in a hazy state. That’s why I couldn’t focus. I attributed my shitty training days to not having weed, but really it’s all because of it. 


I have had multiple training sessions without weed and so far they have all been awesome. I was so scared but realize now it was all in my head. I’m moving just as well and it feels good knowing I’m in control of my body.

I was high every day, sometimes coming home from work to take a hit on my lunch break. The pandemic got me out of control… high all day every day, even on the clock.

I finally started to try to get my shit together early 2021. I was noticing dental issues, I was constantly broke, and weed was just… making me feel insane suddenly. Like, panic attacks I had never experienced before… my lips would shake sometimes? I was smoking so much but like never really feeling high at my highest of tolerances.

Downloaded a sobriety app, could usually go a few days. For a few months I’d try off and on. In may I got to 49 days and then smoked with a hookup, bought that night, then smoked for a few weeks. Same thing happened a few months later with a different person. I was like “I didn’t smoke on my birthday so why the fuck am I smoking with these random dudes from Grindr???” 

I realized a key to my success was setting boundaries! I tell hookups they cant bring cannabis can’t come into my apartment. My partner can smoke when I’m over, but it has to be in a different room and they have to use mouthwash afterwards — the smell is too deliciously tempting! Sometimes, when I’ve felt weak willed, I’ve asked them to hide their stash because joints have a habit of looking so yummy.

I’m super proud of myself!!!! It hasn’t need easy at all. I probably joined this community like 4 years ago thinking “I should cut back” but like… I didn’t really have the desire to actually quit. I tried cutting back for years but it never worked — I’m simply unable to moderate my usage. At some point… I just had to accept that. I’m okay with it now. My partner has cut back and I’m truly amazed that anyone can moderate themselves, but it’s just not in the cards for me.

Anyway, being sober was hard at first. At first I was bored all the time, and knew it was because my brain felt like it was looking at a puzzle missing a piece. I knew I had to retrain my brain to exist without cannabis, so I was just killing time every night waiting for the next day. I wandered around stores, made plans with friends who don’t use, and… jerked off so much, haha. At some point, maybe 3 weeks in, my brain relaxed and I wasn’t thinking about weed every hour. At some point the cravings were fewer and farther between. I still get cravings — I think I broke at 50 days last time because it’s like “see I can moderate myself! I can have a joint,” but it’s a bad idea for me personally! Being sober from cannabis is the right choice for so many reasons, and any reasons I can think of to smoke aren’t good ones. I almost smoked when a hookup unexpectedly had cannabis tonight and I almost took a hit and then I was like “I didn’t smoke for any holidays this year. Why the fuck would I ruin 53 days for this dude I’ve just met??” Glad I stayed strong!

I’m proud of myself for quitting and what  I’ve been able to do with the ability to focus! Played video games I couldn’t concentrate on before, worked on my own art (I’m a stand up comic which requires a lot of brain power to write well and a good memory), and I’m even learning to play some songs on the keyboard. I hang out with friends longer because I’m no longer thinking about the J waiting for me at home.

Anyway, stay strong. Just because you are having trouble staying sober now doesn’t mean it’s for nothing! You’re working on it and that’s all that matters ❤️",42

I swing between absolute resolve to never ever smoke again and happy and relieved with the decision, to 'fuck it, I'm not even that bad, I've just convinced myself I'm an addict'.

Funnily enough the fuck it moment always occurs in the evening when I'm triggered to smoke and the never again thoughts are in the morning and earlier in the day when I'd never normally smoke (no judgement in those that do, just how my life is right now. I used to wake and bake on the regular).

So I need to recognise this is the addicted voice talking when I decide to smoke/drink despite my desire to pack it in at other times.

When I quit drinking I read a lot of Belle Robertson's stuff and she calls this voice Wolfie and I've realised it's always there whether it's talking about booze or weed. It's always there, lurking. The voice that says 'fuck it, abandon yourself, you're not even that bad you're being silly and dramatic trying to be sober, just relax have a beer/have a joint'.

I am on day 5 of not smoking. Yesterday was absolute bliss. I felt emotionally balanced, clear headed enough to speak proper and very motivated. Today.. not so much. I have had the urge to smoke but it wasn’t necessarily a reality. I understand what I am feeling is temporary and endgame is to feel like my old self again. I was hanging with my buddy who was smoking all day why we played video games. I could see the defeat in his eyes as he gave into his inability to abstain for his own reasons. Bowl after bowl it was like a never ending cycle. Not one time did I feel the need to smoke with him nor did I insinuate. I am incredibly driven to keep this going.. smoking has caused serious issues with my vision over the past few years. To the point where I’ve lost a lot of sight. I’ve had two surgeries to install filtration devices in my eyes that send fluids to where they need to go. In the past 5 days my eyes feel better until today, when I was around my friend who was smoking and hot boxing the room. I know its common sense that I shouldn’t be in the same room while he smokes. It actually makes me wish I was further in my sobriety. I just feel that I am emotionally charged (full moon also). When it’s unwarranted. I am looking forward to this long awaited unpause in my life. Some days are just harder than others and I’m willing to accept that in my recovery process. This has been a bit of a ramble but.. I am feeling better. Just dealing with a lot right now and it makes me feel what I call the “chicken little affect”. The sky is falling! When really.. I’ve dealt with my problems in all the right ways.",8

I’m so glad and happy I found this beautiful community during the pandemic, cause it helped me quite a lot 💚 and it might just help me now again… Please? 🙏🏽

Let me tell you my story: I’m a 25 y/o guy that has smoked weed since I was 15 years old. I started as a rebellious little kid social smoker, then I left it, but when I got into college at 18-19 y/o I started smoking heavily.

Spent around 4 years heavily smoking (2016-2020) until the pandemic came and I started suffering from extreme severe panic attacks and anxiety (which never happened to me before) and they were first triggered by smoking. The elements of the pandemic added even some more severity to my case: Being locked down, lonely, with my thoughts, and also doing my college thesis (my final job to graduate)… All of this stress together made me a ticking bomb of panic attacks.

I obviously had to quit, started going to therapy and got prescriptioned for about 3 months (first time taking these kind of meds too).

By like 4-5 months later, I started feeling better, the attacks were gone & my mind was clear… but then, I started hanging out again post-pandemic and guess what????? I relapsed :)))))) jokes on me.

I started smoking once again back in September-Oct 2020, and hadn’t stopped ever since. At least 1 joint daily, with the excuse that I had gotten better and felt great again so I had to basically mess everything up -.-

Anyways… Now I just literally got bored of weed and tired of the feeling it have me (tiredness, mind numbness, not wanting to do anything or see anyone, etc)… I genuinely am fed up. So last sunday I smoked and decided that would be the last time.

Im on day 5 of not smoking and honestly it feels really good, I have no withdrawal symptoms at all, more than a very mild chest tightness due to mild anxiety (smoking made me way worse).

I even still have some weed left and don’t wanna see it or touch it, or not even feel the craving. It’s almost as it repulses me now… So maybe this time it’ll be easier to quit??? 

Im very scared to fall again in the cycle of panic attacks and hardcore anxiety, and having to medicate myself again after I already quit the prescription meds almost a year ago…

So… Do you guys think it will happen again, the strong anxiety and symptoms? Have you had a similar experience? Please let me know! I really wanna get it through this time!!!

TLDR: Read at least the last 4 paragraphs 🙏🏽 appreciate it",3

Feel so much better. But today I put an unlit cig in my mouth as a joke & feel like I relapsed even tho I'm sure I didn't smoke it.﻿ Fuck OCD. Still, the ​worst days sober are still better then the best days high","I was trying to show off/act silly to my friend that I can have a cigarette in my mouth and have the control to not smoke it. However, right after that, I had a hard obsession if I did light it or not. OCD made it near impossible to stop for years, but here I am, one month smokefree, 20th October 2021.

I feel so much more alive, confident and less anxious. I look so much better cause I stopped everything cold turkey. However OCD and anxiety still throw everything at me daily to relapse, but I won't give in. I have more compulsions about smoking then cravings to be honest. Like: ""you had a cigarette in your mouth, you sure you didn't smoke it/have a little nicotine in you by having it in your mouth and so on'' and it makes me feel like I'm relapsed even tho I'm sure I didn't. So not only cravings make it hard, but these OCD obsessions make it the hardest thing ever. It would make me relapse even though I don't want to.

I have no cravings anymore since day 2 because I started working out from day 1. I was sick of feeling sick. An anxious, coughing mess, I was looking more forward to quitting then destroying myself (kinda the Allen Carr method, not dreading the quit process but actually enjoying it.)

I remember flushing my weed and cigarettes the day before I quit only to get more the day after. Then I said, if I don't quit now, I will never succeed.  I also obsessed about quitting ''the perfect way/date/on the perfect number/not on a 13 and so on. It was almost impossible, but not totally impossible. I also stopped another OCD compulsion, formatting my PC at the slightest error and reinstall Windows 10 times a day. I stopped everything that's bad for me on that day. It's the hardest thing I ever did, but the most rewarding.

Even though OCD is throwing everything at me to relapse, I am looking forward to month 2 and staying smokefree for the rest od my life. 

I even went clubbing sober without cigarettes/weed and alcohol. Really challenging myself.

The worst days sober are still better then the best days high. Proud of myself",16

2. I never liked weed, or enjoyed it. From the beginning I hated it and the idea of it. 

I honestly haven't really come across people in addiction/recovery circles who have shared personal experience with one of the above points. 

For the first one, it seems that being in denial of ones addiction is something everyone goes through, but for me ever since I started smoking daily when I was 18 I realized I was addicted when I tried to take a break for a weekend and couldn't last more than a day (In retrospect I think, telling myself I was addicted from the beginning actually harmed me as believing I was addicted may have made it more difficult to stop). 

For the second point, I really absolutely hated the feeling the first time I got high, it was terrible. Same with subsequent times. Eventually, I learned to tolerate it and got used to it sure. Eventually I even learned to be able to laugh and have some fun while high. But I never accepted/believed or truly felt this was something I liked, and that benefited me. I always knew this was something that would keep me back and that I didn't want to do. Basically I'm saying I never went through a ""golden period"" phase in my smoking career where everything was fun and I enjoyed it. Its always just been an addiction I desperately wanted out of. 

Not posting this to say ""Hey look at me, I'm special/unique"". I'm posting this in hopes of finding others who have had the same experiences and finding out Im not so unique in this regard.

Started smoking a bit more frequently when I was 17 with my best friend, who is 2 years older than me and loved to smoke a lot of weed, constantly. 

My ex gave me an ultimatum that it was her or the weed when we got serious (she hates drugs) so I stopped for her, and then when we broke up after 3 years I was so angry I rebelled against the values she instilled in me and went on a weed spree. This was around June 2020.

Since then I have pretty much smoked every day. I did sober Jan this year (successfully I might add!) and have taken a couple of 2 week breaks in between without much hassle. 

This is the big one though. I’m at the point where I’m smoking about 7g every 4 days, and it’s affecting my mental health drastically, being that I already suffer from severe depression and anxiety as it is. I really want to do this though, and I want to better my life. 

Found this community and I was so relieved to see that others are dealing with very similar issues to me, and that there is somewhere I can turn to when in need.

I've been non stop smokin everyday all day for about 5-6 years. Only two times during that time that I went 1-2 weeks without. Once in 2019 for 2 weeks, involuntarily, because I was on tour in Asia and couldn't get any. That was brutal. We were flying everyday, and our sleep was on the plane...add in jet lag and withdraw, oof. Last year I quit, voluntarily, for a week until my stupid ""friend"" roped me back into it. We don't really talk anymore because of unrelated reasons but it will end up being a good thing. I should have just stopped in 2019 after I got back from Asia. 

I now have 0 friends because of this stupid ass drug. I lost some good friends and band mates because the weed made me overly paranoid and anxious, I thought they were talking shit behind my back and I snapped. Fuck. Weed helped with the anxiety initially but over time I think it had a tendency to make the flareups worse when I had episodes and it also became a trigger.

Friends I have made since using weed have all been fake. They just used me to smoke some of my weed. The one dude I thought he wanted to start a band with me but I started noticing every time I would go over to work on music we would just get stoned and end up accomplishing nothing, AND it was ALWAYS my weed, he's *never* smoked me up. I knew what was going on but it was better than having nobody, plus they were people to at least chill and smoke with right? 

I am not gonna say weed hasn't helped me. I think it really has rewired my brain into *not* being so anxious and angry all the time, and really made me very self aware of things I probably would not be aware of if it weren't for weed. However, it's overstayed it's welcome. I wanna get shit done and it just makes me unmotivated and lazy now. A lot of times when I get stoned now I wish I was sober instead. I think it's time to leave it behind for good and grow from it.

 I started learning programming last summer and I wanna be sharp. I have learned a lot, but I know I will be way better at solving problems and being more creative without the fog. I know I would definitely be further a long now if it weren't for weed. A lot of lazy days just hangin out on reddit/youtube instead of programming. I am getting giddy just thinking about how much sharper I am going to be and all the cool shit I am gonna build because I will have the energy, focus and brain power to really give my %110. I wanna get a job programming too. I don't feel I will accomplish my goals as long as weed is around. 

Weed is **not** totally harmless. I was in denial about it for a long time. If you have some physical disease/pain/ailment or insomnia weed is a godsend. It's not very good at being a mental health drug. Not in the long term anyway. It serves it's purpose, it's better than a lot of alternatives out there **for sure**, but that doesn't mean it's harmless. Spoiler: It's just as destructive and invasive on ones life as any other addiction can be. 

I feel like I will succeed in quitting this time. There are gonna be some tough days but I am hoping this sub will get me through the rough times when they arise.

I smoked bud for a close to 6 years starting in junior year and ending my senior year of college. I started the same way most of you guys did, hitting a makeshift bong in the woods and eating a crap ton of McDonalds. Looking back on it those days were some of the most fun I have had. But knowing where it got me I regret it. 

As time went on I started smoking more and more. By the end of high school it became my whole identity. I was known as the dude that was always high and I loved it. 

College was when my smoking habit got out of hand. I went to school to play a sport but ended up quitting. At the time I thought it was because I hated the sport but looking back I hated not being able to smoke weed all day. I found a group of stoners like myself and proceeded to get high all day every day. At my peek I was smoking a half ounce a day. 

Obviously this caused issues, got in trouble a few times with police but no charges, thinking back I got so lucky as I would constantly have some amount of bud on me. On breaks from college I would hit a gravity bong in my family bathroom at least once an hour. My parents totally knew and were pissed but I couldn't even imagine not smoking at least once an hour.  

By senior year was when I realized that I had a major issue. It wasn't that I didn't want to go to class it was that I would get physically sick if I didn't smoke. I felt like I couldn't leave my apartment so I continued smoking and my grades plummeted. 

I started having breathing problems and severe anxiety everytime I smoked but even that wasn't enough to stop me. It got to the point where I would have 1 major panic attack a day after smoking. Eventually I threw all my bud and smoking supplies into the river and told myself I would never smoke. 

But of course I did. I smoked a couple times after that and that's ok. But at this point I had my mind focused on quitting. Let me tell you it was hard to stop. I felt like I completely lost my mind at a few points. I was a real mess for a while, anxiety through the roof, splitting headaches, severe breathing issues. I really thought I was going to die for a while. 

But I am here to tell you guys going through what I did that it DOES get better. Smoking doesn't stop these issues only time and recovery does. Learning how to manage your emotions is way better than lighting up. There is no magic trick. Time is the only thing that can help. Use this as an opportunity to grow as a person. 

It has now been 2 years since the last time I smoked. I can say that my anxiety is wayyyyy down. I feel better than I ever did while smoking physically and mentally. I have a good job and am pretty happy where I am in life. You can do it too.",111

But the scariest part is when I imagine the best things that could ever happen to me, I don't enjoy them. I can imagine achieving all my goals in the future, and it doesn't feel good. Because weed isn't part of it. My life is shit but I'd probably feel the same if life was great. Because I think I preferred weed to anything life has to offer.

12 days sober so far. I was wondering how you guys cope with not smoking anymore. For me, I noticed an uptick in alcohol consumption and now i have to actively restrain myself to switch from being an everyday smoker to drinking alcohol regularly or substituting weed with other stuff which i also really like and used to combine with weed.

I guess I was wondering how do you guys cope with the gap that is suddenly there after quitting? It's probably rather pointless to simply substitute one addiction with another but ever since quitting weed I am simply bored by being sober. It's not even so much that I crave weed horribly due to anxiety or depression, I do notice that this is definitely becoming better, but after years of abuse and being high soberness is... well, boring. I am fully committed to not go back to weed because I see how much it hindered my development over recent years but not changing my mindset in any sort of way with drugs legal or illegal seems, as I said, boring, and to be completely honest (since this is kinda like a self help forum?) almost pointless in my eyes. Really wondering ho you guys cope with that.

I currently just broke a 1 week+ streak of not smoking. It felt really amazing to stay off the for that long.

My experience smoking is mainly having friends who buy and I hang with them and we smoke together and play video games.

When I visit my friends, I am triggered to smoke because I am in their home, living room, etc. And when I hang with most of these friends, all we do is smoke.

One friend in particular mainly stays in their apartment all day or after work and sits on the couch watching Netflix.

I am a very active person and love to take walks and go out places.

This person is open to this idea and has told me several times that they support me not smoking and will deny me weed if need be.

As a side note this person also has feelings for me even though I have a partner already.

I feel immense guilt when I try to keep distance from this person physically.

We stay in touch via phone and texting but I really want to go without seeing them.

If anyone has any advice I'd love to hear it. Again this may border on more personal boundaries rather than boundaries with weed but I am open to thoughts.",3

Like two months later I find myself smoking every single day, if I didn't smoke i would get so irritated and depressed, so, well, I noticed that i was having a problem. But because of the circumstances of my life in that moment I thought ""well when I get back to Argentina I'm quitting with this"" hahaha I wish!!! Now I am in Argentina and I think I'm so far from what I expected when I was in Colombia. When I came here, I thought i wouldn't have the money to buy weed (and I don't) but one of my friends gives me weed ALL THE TIME, and ironically I smoked sooo much weed here than in Colombia!! Now I am sooo depressed, my life is going nowhere, I don't have a job, and the most terrible part of this is that I can't talk with people if I'm not high, I can't enjoy music or films either. I completely lost my life's sense, and the short periods of time that I don't smoke I even thought about suicide.

All my friends I made were from school, from the same classes.

For the past 7 years or so, my social circle were 2 smoke buddies from school. I never felt comfortable being really open with them and make our friendship deep, worthwhile. 

Whenever I was out drinking with them, I almost never talked to anybody else, I always stick with ""my people"" 

At 25 years old, I never had a GF. I had one for like 2 weeks when I was pretty young (14yo) but since then, I put almost zero effort approaching women or even online dating. Probably out of fear, laziness, lack of self esteem.... I don't honestly know. 

Now, when I don't smoke anymore, I don't even see my smokebuddies and honestly, it feels like they outgrew me, they can manage their consumption, they can live proper lives with or without it. I can't do it and I feel like relapsing. 

My life is life of a constant failure and yet... it feels like I have zero motivation or will to do anything about it. I am over 2 months sober and I still do those same things as if I was toking all day, everyday. 

Now I know that I used weed to medicate, it made me feel something and it made me forget. I can't imagine my life without it. But I know that if there is even a small chance to turn my life around, I can't go back to toking. Because then nothing will change for sure.

I don't know of I am some kind of Autist or something like that. Because I don't know about anybody who would live like that. I don't know about anybody who would live like that as a result of smoking weed. 

I never even had a proper job, I worked low paid, easy part time job only. Which I lost and I lived from my savings for almost a year. Of course still living with my parents and I will be 26 next month. 

Weird thing is, that I don't think about it. It gets sad only when I write it out. That's the time when tears come out of my eyes. But for the rest of the day, I feel kind of okay, which is crazy because nothing is okay. Nothing. 

This will only lead to relapse and I know it. I need to start doing something, but I feel like it is too late for me. Despite all of this, I can be witty and funny, I know that if someone would get to know me, he would know I am worth a lot, as crazy as it may sound. 

It feels impossible to go out alone, in a bar and start talking to strangers. It really feels surreal. 

Maybe I had always low self esteem, social anxiety and weed made me overlook those issues. I don't know. 

I am honestly thinking of relapse, but I know that it isn't the way to go. I just don't have anything to live for, I am basically useless piece of meat. 

Feel free to comment, I will be glad for every input. And honestly I don't know why I am even posting this, maybe just to vent, maybe just to reach out to someone, maybe just to tell you that it isn't always bright at the end of a tunnel of addiction.

It’s good to keep in mind: we are either working on recovery or we are working on a relapse. Though I considered weed to help me at one point, it was an addiction that was only hurting me at the end of the day. 

I am now on my way to the gym to work out this extra built up tension and stress.

I've been off weed for four months now, the longest I've ever gone without it in the last couple of years.
Occasionally I'd get strong cravings, but would manage through them (don't have an easy way of getting it anymore and I'd just occupy my time with something else). But for the last couple of days I've daydreamed about smoking a joint, with a strong feeling of how it would just feel so good and would make for a nice evening... 
I'm in a position to smoke and am seriously considering it - my main concern is reseting the timer on my phone, four months seems a lot to me, but that's basically the only thing bothering me (apart from my rationale telling me I should just go to sleep or try to manage this anxious period differently).
I mean, it's not like I'm gonna start smoking daily, I don't have the means. I also know that I couldn't tell anyone because I already have intense guilt just imagining telling the people I love that I'd smoked.

UPDATE: Not gonna smoke, my plug is unavailable (higher intervention I guess).",11

I quit at the start of Sept. Went through absolute hell with withdrawals for about 6-7 weeks before the doctor prescribed me some medicine to help. I am now off that medicine and doing great! 

I'm on week 10 now, and still get waves of nausea/retching, and spells of anxiety. This week was pretty crappy with some mood swings.

I smoked heavily daily for about 18months and quit because I felt it was giving me anxiety (when I haven't really had anxiety before).

Talking to some friends who quit, they reckoned it took 3 months to feel normal (yay two more weeks for me!). They had similar experiences with the anxiety thing. 

I know everyone is different (and how long is a piece of string), so please share your experiences here :) I'd love to hear it",2

-Remembering the consequences and reality of having a smoke when I start romanticising it and visualising the ritual (consequences such as paranoia, craving and eating shit food, anxiety, restlessness, regret)

Biggest thing is learning how to COPE/ACCEPTING with the withdrawal symptoms rather than just trying to prevent them. I wasn’t doing this enough and once I started devoting more energy into that I noticed improvements instantly.

What helped me the most was friends and family and realizing that I’m never alone. Even when the anxiety hit and everything seemed bleak, the thought of my friends and family and knowing they’re always there for me would literally help me so much. 

Another key thing I’ve realized is getting out of your “comfortable zone” is so important. While I was experiencing the usual physical and mental withdrawal symptoms last week, I realized how much of an introvert I am and decided to see my family and friends to distract myself and ease my mind. I just wanted to stay at my apartment and sleep, thinking that was my comfortable zone when in reality it was my mind making me think my symptoms are worse because all I would is just think about the negative things. 

When I started going out to see my family and friends, I realized that my mind was playing tricks on me and even though I was still feeling the symptoms, i was way more positive on life and could feel more improvement. 

If anyone is struggling early in their journey, please read this and realize that family and friends are literally the best medicine out there and they will always love you ❤️",20

2021-11-18 15:04:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qwyapn/high_again/,High again,"So, September 7th is when I decided to say goodbye. I really thought that would be the last and final time, but we all know how this goes. You forget about the bad times, remember the good times, tell yourself if you’d “just moderate” it would’ve be bad to have “just a little here or there” (ffs we wouldn’t be in this mess if that was possible!).

You still have this sensible voice in the back of your head that’s keeping you going. “Don’t do it! It’s a trap!” It shouts “Remember what happened the time before last, and the one before that! You CAN’T moderate, and you know this! Proven it, in fact. Don’t lie to yourself and go back to the cycle!”

And I was listening to that voice and doing just fine.. and then a really stressful and unexpected event happened, and then ANOTHER ONE happened, and well, we know what can resurface with stress: UNHEALTHY COPING MECHANISMS! WOOHOO!
What was my BIGGEST unhealthy coping mechanism? Well, aside from having an unhealthy obsession with trying to eat as little as possible, it was weed!

Though I still needed to stave off. I had responsibilities I needed to attend to. I couldn’t do that when high, so I couldn’t get high. 

That logic worked for a while, but then things simmered down again and set into a routine. The stressful event, while always plausible to resurface, returned dormant and I was able to go about my day without too much worry. Good news, but now I didn’t have worry holding me back from getting high..

It was last Tuesday, the 9th (I made it just a little over two months without getting high, so yay me I guess?). I had a really fun impromptu day with my friend and everything was a blast! As the day is winding down and I’m getting ready to drop him off, a thought dawns on me: “We’re near a dispensary…” So, what do I do? I go to the fucking dispensary…

I pickup 100mg of gummies, telling myself “no more than this.”. I tell my friend after I finish that pack I’m not going to buy anymore and, if I have that much self control, maybe I can repeat it in the future and just become one of those “once in a while” kind of people I’m sure many of us kind of envy.

I go home at the end of the day and I get moderately high. It was great. Next morning I have both lecture and work, so I attend those and bam, that’s already 8/9 of the hours in the day gone and I’ve spent them sober even though I have weed at home. I can totally do this. Well on my way to becoming one of those “once in a while” type of people…

The next day is a holiday. No lecture, no class, just me and a fuck tonne of free time. I get high a bit in the morning, sober up to see my friend for a couple of hours, and then I proceed to pop that last 3 gummies and, well, that’s it. Guess we’re done here….

WRONG. On my train ride home I’m trying to think on what the closest dispensary near the train stop is. I decide I’ll get a little disposable vape with no more than around 0.5 grams. I do that (well, the only disposable they had was 0.6 grams, but close enough?).

That was Thursday night. Now, everyday for the past week, excluding today, I have been high at least a handful of times during the day.

Thankfully I have to physically go to work and drive to get there because that requires me to be sober for hours before I get behind a wheel. So, I’ve been sober for anywhere between a good 8-10 hours a day, on days I work. Sunday I literally planned a whole trip to get errands where I’d have to drive just to force myself to not get high in the morning and save it for the evening (it worked, I didn’t get high till sometime around 4/5pm.).

Anyway, fast forward to now, I currently am in possession of a dead disposable vape I told myself I would throw out this morning cause it’s trash day. I told myself even if it still has weed in it, it has to go or I’m going to go straight back into the whole I was in before, but the battery died on me last night so I got only a very light, barely noticeable high. This is good, right? Yes, except last night I as trying to negotiate myself I to why I should just use it I’ll it’s all the way gone..

Now I’m completely sober, completely weedless, probably the complete way I’m suppose to be, and yet all I can think about is how nice it would be if I was high, and how nice it would be if I got some more for later, and how much I just want to go to the dispensary. Even if I don’t go today, I was telling myself “Oh, you can be sober today and just get some tomorrow. *Thats self control*”. 😂

Bitch, no it ain’t! If I stopped using it yesterday, craved for maybe a day or two, forgot about it, and then went and got more in a week or two or even longer and just did that small amount, then yes, perhaps that’s a normal persons level of liking weed and that’s how a normal person is able to exhibit self control. Myself? NOPE! I’d be at work thinking “My shift is off at x-amount of hours and it’s going to take me x-amount of time to drive home meaning I can can get high in this amount of time!”, and I did. 

Sometimes I’d burst through the door,  go straight to my room, and immediately take a hit or two when I REALLY needed to use the bathroom. I literally didn’t want to spend another moment sober, not even the couple of minutes it takes to take a piss. That, is not a healthy or reasonable relationship with weed. That is a very toxic, UNHEALTHY relationship with anything, muchless weed.

Here’s what I presume will happen today: I’ll spend it sober. I’ll take care of all my errands, all my responsibilities, I’ll go to work, come home, and then I’ll wake up the next day and “fuckit it’s Friday I don’t work today time for high pt. II.”

It’s not heathy. It’s not good. If I do put weed back in my mouth I want it to be when I’m not jonesing for it so much, but realistically that’s when I’m least apt to do it and it’s probably not what’s going to happen now.

I don’t know. Just thought I’d share because I don’t want to bore my friends with my “oh noe I’m getting high again!” spiel. Thanks for listening!",4

On my fourth week sober and going really well, tried multiple times to quit but this one is THE time! Not going back now.

Daily smoker for 10 years as was my partner, the thing that has made quitting so easy this time unfortunately is that my partner has developed this condition called

 CANNABANOID HYPER AMESIS SYNDROME

CHS is reported as a rare condition in long term daily smokers but I have since learned it can even happen to occasional smokers who have not smoked for long periods of time. Basically when you stop smoking you become violently nauseas and can’t stop throwing up for days on end. After 3 visits to the emergency room, IV fluids and a tonne of anti nausea meds we got it under control but I was seriously worried for my partners safety. As well as the nausea some people can experience all sorts of horrible anxiety and panic related symptoms, this is a serious condition. The “good” news it that once you have it you can’t smoke ever again as once you start smoking then stop you will have to go through the whole withdrawal process again with the acute vomiting. We did it twice not knowing it was related to weed the first time and fuck me the second time was so much worse. 

Just wanted to put this information out there that if you are trying to quit and get these severe symptoms don’t hesitate to go to the ER as long term dehydration can fuck you up and even kill you. 

Take care everyone and remember that you can do this!!!",4

4 days ago my friend came over to smoke and we smoked 1 bowl and laid down on my bed, and I noticed my vision started getting colorful. It steadily got more and more intense until it became the MOST INTENSE experience I have EVER had. I was visited by a godlike interdimensional entity and with a booming voice he told me to stop smoking weed. I then started to have the most vivid hallucinations ever. I was on another plane of existence. I remember my conciousness travelling to the spirit realm and flying through the sky, I was surrounded by beautiful parrots all different colors and they circled me, turned into flowers with happy faces and then exploded into a colorful rain, I then landed in an enchanted forest and went inside a tree but in the tree was a massive city. I think you get the point. I was tripping like I had never tripped before and once I finally came back to earth I decided to listen to the foreign entity. I haven't touched weed since that experience (except nicotine and caffeine) and I legitimately think this time it will stick. I'm excited for what the sober future will bring :)

Also, my friend had a totally normal experience so the weed was not laced. I was only on weed. Idk why this happened but I'm grateful to that entity for the divine intervention.

I guess I don’t really remember how bad it can get? I absolutely had periods in my life where I had a horrendously negative relationship with weed (basically smoking EXCESSIVELY to the point of passing out for hours of napping then waking up and doing it again). 

Part of me feels like since I smoked throughout all of my adolescent years (ages 14-23) it’s ingrained in my brain to respond especially positively to weed. I was the kind of stoner that smoked but still got all A’s throughout college and excercised 3-5 days a week. 

My main reason for wanting to quit at the end there was that I just felt so socially disconnected from everyone — I didn’t feel human anymore because I was just high all the time (literally just about every waking second) in every kind of setting possible.

Weed helps the boredom be okay- what is an agonizingly dull 10 hours of my day becomes mildly amusing as I watch TV or scroll down social media. It's also good because it helps me nap at times, which I absolutely am incapable of without it. 

I'm okay with continuing to use it to help me sleep.

2021-11-18 06:31:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qwnsw6/listen/,Listen,"Hi. I posted a couple of weeks ago about how hard it was quitting. For 1.5 years, I use to smoke multiple times per day and night to help w my chronic pain. Sometimes I’d smoke when I had little pain and it made it worse instead of better. So, that amongst other reasons, lead to my decision to quit. I’m going to be hard on you guys, so be prepared. After I stopped smoking, my pain almost tripled in intensity and frequency. I’d be on the bathroom floor shaking w pain thinking about taking a hit to make it stop. But I didn’t. I kept telling myself, the withdrawal symptoms will fade. I did some other stuff to help that I can’t say Bc they won’t post my post lol. But I got through it. Im now 1 month clean and the pain has finally gotten better. 
My point: my chronic pain is back/leg/intestine related. If I can push through THAT, through excruciating pain where I’d scream into a pillow and contemplate jumping out the window, then so can you push through the sadness, loss of motivation, loss of appetite, any other symptoms you have. I’m here to remind you that it’s all about your own willpower and mindset. Once you decide to quit you need to understand there will be intrusive thoughts. It’s up-to you to ignore them or give into them. You can do this. Stop relapsing. Love yourself enough to be your own stern parent. It could be worse and count your blessings. That is all",16

I have now completely stopped consuming Weed almost 4 Months. I feel like waking up out o a dream and from my personal experience knew it would take about 3+ months to shake off most of it. I have a lot of other responsibilities to look after and I‘m slowly getting into that.

Still not that easy and go to my therapist weekly. I have some social anxiety issues which weed made much worse. But here’s some background, some timeline on my consumption:

I am now 34 years old..
15-22: Smoked every Day, most I stopped was for about half a year when I had to finish my apprenticeship. 

23-32: Smoked absolutely nothing. Found a stable job, met my now Wife and we started a Family (Two Kids, now 4 and 6).

Then with almost 33 I started smoking again… some family stuff from way before came up and I could not deal with it. Slowly I started smoking more and more again.. I’m not that kinda person that can smoke one Joint per Day… So my consumption went up and up.. 

Then my Boss quit - and I still partly blame me for it even though it had more to do with how the company (Big Company with 5000+ Employees , we were at the Headquarters) treated him. The company found nobody to replace him and just hired somebody for a regular position and put us in another already existing team.

Long story short I had more things to handle but could not handle it - but got no other position offered it was just excepted that I do way more than what’s written on my job description. Slowly everything came apart.. and my consumption didn’t help. Homeoffice because of COVID was bad for me - I need some external structure for me to be highly functional.
I then had a lot of stress with the new Boss which led to me getting sick. I went to a clinic for two weeks, stopped smoking before I entered and haven’t smoked since.
But when I had my first meeting with my Boss and HR about getting back to work, they informed me that they dont want me back and will fire me. I knew that was a possibility so wasn’t to shocked but still it was and still is hard to swallow. I was there for almost 9 years.

Luckily they can not fire me until december and habe to give three months notice until March. But I try already looking for a new job since only being at home is also not good for me. Instead of weed I now use gaming for escape.

Looking for a new job is also hard for me, my avoiding personality makes that a slow
Process. 

But I look forward again - and I am so glad I stopped it with the weed. Just wanted to share a bit.

Have a nice Day all!",6
2021-11-18 05:02:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qwmjtp/will_my_body_ever_heal/,Will my body ever heal?,"Hi all, 6th day here. Been smoking since I was about 15, so 14 years or so now. 

The thing that I find so difficult is what it’s done to my body. I’ve lost a lot of my hair and my teeth are pretty yellow, with eroded enamel and chipped bits. I also never grew an inch since I smoked, but that’s defo too late to think about now. Also my skin isn’t great and my eyes have these great big floaters in.

I look at myself and compare myself with what my dad looked liked at this age, we’re worlds apart. 

I know some of the damage is permanent, and it comes from a combo of smoking, sleep deprivation and mental suffering. 

However, I just want some reassurance that I can turn things round and that my body can still recover and I can look like a normal healthy young adult. 

For me, it’s these invasive thoughts that I’ve permanently damaged myself which makes me miserable when sober and usually leads to me relapsing.",1
2021-11-18 04:27:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qwm2ni/the_phantom_high_i_got_questions/,The Phantom High - I Got Questions,"So, I did not really know this was a thing until now. 

I have basically been smoking chronically for at least a few years with a few small breaks here and there. I made the decision to get completely sober after realizing I could not be happy in life while I'm using weed (some people may be fine using it and some people may actually need it, I am not arguing that)

Anyway, I just wanted to share my experience to let people know how this is affecting me. If you quit weed, and you're still feeling high, YOU are NOT alone. I do also have some questions at the end of the post. This was originally longer, but I didn't want to bore anyone to death. 

Previously when I've quit smoking, I have had some groggy feelings shortly after quitting. But this $hit is intense. I am currently on about day 5 or 6 of quitting and I feel higher now than about 99% of the last few years I've been smoking. The weird thing is it comes and goes. One minute, I'll be outside walking and be like, ""Wow, I feel really good, present and healthy, like I can finally breathe and enjoy life."" 

Then all of a sudden when I least expect it.. BOOM 💥 I'm super blazed. But its not just a feeling. Since this has been happening, when i feel stoned, I check a mirror and notice that my eyes are super red, strained, and they feel dry. Now, my eyes have always been extremely sensitive to THC intake, meaning they get super red easily, so it's easy for me to notice. But with these random phantom highs popping up, my eyes get redder than the devil's 🍆.

I never realized how much I had been saturating my cells with THC. So much so, that my body is burning off fat and taking any THC in those cells straight to my brain to get me high. Of course, my brain is doing anything that it can to get the dopamine it's missing from the past several years of smoking 🚬 🍃

This is seriously blowing my mind, and driving me a little bit crazy. I do not want to touch another drug ever again, hell i do not even want to drink again. I've never had such a strong personal desire to stop smoking before, so this is huge for me, Im finally all in on quitting, like never before. This is making it really tough. I feel so stoned right now, walls feel like they're moving, everything looks weird, its extremely tough to focus and conduct my thoughts. Sure, youtube, tv shows, movies, music are better when this hits me, but I don't want it. 

Weird thing to note... I don't get the munchies at all, in fact I have no desire to eat at all, not from nausea, i just don't feel like it. I think this is my brains way of saying, ""Hey, don't worry were gonna be living off your body fat for a while. Its good for both of us, you'll lose a little weight, and I'll get my dopamine."" Well F♡CK you, brain. 🙃

If you read this far, I would really appreciate maybe some information from you. 

How long can I expect for these ""getting high out of nowhere"" feeling to last? (When will they end) 

Why do I feel so much higher than all the times I've smoked over the last several years?

Can I speed up the process? If so, what would be the best way to speed things along? Ex. Exercise, detox, sauna, nutrition etc. 

Is there any way to stop this feeling in its tracks when it arises? 

Why does my brain hate me?

Can I shut my brain off for a bit?

Why does smoking a cigarette now intensely trigger this even though I don't even get buzzed from ciggs anymore?

Any other random tidbits, articles, links you have would be helpful to me.

I would seriously love any and all information you could give me. I am trying so hard to get clean FOREVER, and I don't want this to get in the way.

Thanks so much for reading and I hope maybe this helped someone else not feel alone in their struggle towards getting off the leaf.

You can do this, you really can. Your brain is a muslce and the parts required to quit are atrophied, just keep pushing and do that last rep. We got this.

I started towards the end of graduate school in 2019. Prior to that I smoked quite a bit before college. I really hope this is the last time I pick up this habit. I’m slowly realizing that this plant does NOT serve me. It turns me into an; unfocused, lazy, incoherent, and anxious individual.

I can’t even believe that I’m an engineer and I was abusing cannabis. I mean, everyone I work with is so Type A they never would have guessed. I am a fit person, clean cut and don’t sound or dress like a stoner which probably didn’t give anyone indication that I was an addict.

Since I’ve stopped consumption the dreams have been WILD. I feel significantly sharper. I am recalling information so quickly that I surprise myself. I also feel like my mental bandwidth has increased. I’m no longer eagerly waiting until 6PM to get stoned. It was becoming overwhelming to constantly romanticize getting stoned after work or on the weekends. 

I feel free. I know I’ve got a long way to go, but I finally have come to realize this plant is not serving me or my goals. 

I’m excited to workout sober. Im excited to finally start reading more on the weekends. Im excited to put together all those entrepreneurial pursuits I’ve been day dreaming about. Im excited to be clean. 

I wish you all the best in your pursuits of sobriety. I’ve read so many posts, and nearly all of them resonated with me. I’m thankful for this community.

2021-11-17 20:26:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qwe8py/what_i_learned_15_years_later/,What I learned 1.5 years later,"41 - smoked for 25 years. Many failed attempts to stop or control. Eventually resigned to being a stoner for the rest of my life. Something changed on June 14th 2020 and I stopped. It wasn't just that specific day but an accumulation of experiences and knowledge that lead to finally stopping.

Here are the key factors that helped me:

&#x200B;

* I had to work on my psychology. I knew I was in a trap and it was one that most of the time I wanted to escape from. I had to put effort into learning how to do that.
* Focusing on ""the pain"" of being without weed wasn't helpful. In actuality is was more painful being on weed than it was without. I needed to focus on the future and the possibilities of a new life.
* I had a lot of flaws, some caused by weed, some innate or learned through experiences that would have happened regardless of weed. I could no longer hide from those. I had to put effort towards fixing those problem and flaws I didn't like about myself. It wouldn't be easy but I had to accept myself for who I was and tackle these problems one at a time.
* Accepting that I was an addict for life. There would be times I would be tempted to have weed (or drink which would always lead to weed). From past experience I knew that for me, it was an all or nothing deal with absolutely no exceptions. I can not stress this point enough. One hit of weed right now would lead to daily hits soon enough amounting to thousands of hits over the year 2022. It's pointless to envy people who can have some weed or beer in a controlled manner because its just not something that I can do. Those old brain pathways of neurons and synapses are like a dried up riverbed. The water is still going to flow through if I let it.
* Taking care of myself. I continued exercising (hard) and doing other things that were healthy for both my mind and body. Recognizing when things were bad and trying to do something about it. This is important in general but it was especially so in the beginning. I spent a lot of time soaking in a tub of hot water and I took a lot of naps (both of which I almost never did otherwise). I did whatever was at my disposal to try to feel better that wasn't smoking weed.
* Disassociate. I had to detach from the lifestyle. I was fully immersed. I grew weed, made edibles, watched and read weed content often, kept track of the strains I had tried (hundreds), had morning strains, afternoon strains, evening and bedtime strains, strains for pain, strains for anxiety, etc. Everyone who knew me knew I was a stoner, and I portrayed being proud of that (I wasn't actually). I was a stoners stoner. I had to disconnect from that lifestyle and leave it behind and find new things to fill that time.
* Knowing there was something wrong with me that was going to be neither easy nor quick to fix. I had to be patient and have faith in the process of allowing my body and brain to heal.

The first two weeks were not fun, the first two months were better but still not fun. By the time month 6 rolled around there were some glimmers of hope. By the time 12 months had come and gone I'd go for long lengths of time without even remembering or thinking about my past life and relationship with weed. I still believe I'm recovering currently, at least partially but now it is more about getting my life in order from the years of neglect. I'm finally starting to learn what my true self is like, who I am without a drug influencing my thoughts and therefore choices and actions in life.

In my mind I'll never have ""made it"", it will be a continuous effort (though more minor as time goes on) to maintain this boundary that I've put up between me and weed (and booze). I'm happy with that, its just a small side project in my life and I can now focus on things that really matter and have meaning to me.",305

I've noticed how my mental health has started declining heavily and i always make jokes around my other stoner friends about ending shit and about how fucked up bud makes me. Of course i always mention that in a joking way which means they have no idea about the reality of the situation.

&#x200B;

So I want to write out something for myself, why I want to quit in the first place

&#x200B;

* Weed does not help or do anything really. I used to say that it helped make chores more fun, but once the chores are done, I'm either still high or will smoke some more. 

&#x200B;

* It doesn't help me sleep, it actually makes me stay awake so I can ""relax,"" which means forcing myself to stay awake, overeating, and passing out so I can wake up groggy and with a terrible bathroom experience.  

* It doesn't help me relax, it pushes my worries under the rug, only for them to crawl out again once it wears off. I have been exercising again and watching what I eat, but when I get high, I will always eat more, and always choose junk.

* It doesn't make me a good partner. She doesn't like weed, so when I sneak out to ""walk the dog"", my reward is spending the rest of the night worried that she will notice I'm high. I'll spend half an hour just waiting for the smell to come off

* It's not a reward for working hard. It makes me stop working earlier so I have time to smoke before she comes home

* Yes, without it, the cravings are bad. I bite my nails a ton. I spend hours online reading about addiction and moderation instead of doing something that makes me happy or relaxed. Weed won't cure the cravings, just push them under the rug...

-anxious and /or depressed

-crazy addicted like scrubbing resin out of your bong or the last particles of keefe out of your grinder only to get at least a little bit high

-become a social recluse and hide from the world

-actually slower, like impairing your ability to think, socialize etc. 

-think too much, like overthinking and fantasizing a lot, especially if its about crazy shit or wild dreams and plans that you never follow through with anyway ( because youre too high) 

-plan everything you do around weed, so when you decide to go out, its usually with stoners going somewhere you can smoke and if not you already plan when and how you can sneak away to take a quick puff

-unreliable, be it to yourself or others ( or both), because you forget everything and if you dont, you dont feel like doing any task besides buying more weed if you run out, or some papers if you emptied another pack ( way faster than you would like to admit) 


Its probably time to stop. And the best time to stop was probably a long time ago. The second best time is now. 

Just dont be like me. Do anything, but not that. I was that guy for way too many years and wasted waaayyy too much time, potential and chances in life. I fucked up my life in ways i couldnt even imagine 5 years ago, even in my stoner phantasies. 
Of course its not only the weed that made me do that... Im struggling with mental issues since i was a teenager and had my fair share of heavy setbacks, from childhood on to the heaviest ones that happened only a few years ago.


Now i can easily see why i got addicted, i tried to mask the pain, run away from my problems etc. Guess what: you cant run away forever, because it will catch up to you, way harder than the last time. You cant hide from your problems and you cant hide from yourself. You may manage to lie to yourself consciously, but subconsciously you know you are full of shit and it will show over time, in ugly ways. You cant even mask the pain in your soul: one day, it will be stronger than the drug, and theres no coming back from that.


I wouldnt say weed made me do those stupid things, think in stupid, self harming and sabotaging ways, or make these stupid decisions. But it affected and impaired me in negative ways and in combination with my self harming /sabotaging/loathing mentality, super low self esteem and addictive tendencies it was the perfect cocktail for a disaster.

And every time i tried to quit, it gave me a glimpse of what i could have been, and what i can be now, and how extreme the negative effect of my weed habit is on my life and personality. Im 500% sure i would have made way better decisions in my life and a way healthier / ""better"" mentality, +my life wouldnt have turned out so shitty if i never touched weed... Or at least didnt smoke like a junkie and kept it at a ""not life impairing"" level.

Every time i quit for a week or two, sometimes even a month, i had no brain fog anymore, could think straight, had way more energy and focus, was way better received by people because it wasnt a burden to socialize anymore (and people feel that), and so many more positive things... While its the opposite when im in my smoking daily mode, and i dont even wake and bake most of the time and start smoking in the late noon after work. The list above is only an excerpt of the problems that vanish as soon as i quit.


I dont know if anyone reads this wall of text, but i know there are  people like me on this sub. And ive been lurking on here for a good while. And even if only two people read it, if one of them decides to quit because of this thread, it was worth it. Even if its me.

Thats why i chose to quit last night. Today is day one again and this time for good. I cant keep wasting my life like that, i already destroyed way too much. My life could have turned out way better, even despite all the setbacks i had to endure. I was just too caught up in the weed flash to make the right decisions that would have been no problem with a sober mind.


The reason im sure i can do it now is that i put in a lot of work since the pandemic started, reevaluated everything about me and my life, faced my problems , be it mentally or in any other aspect of life and finally started to make lasting, positive changes on my mind and life. I finally took an honest look at myself and didnt shy away to make the right moves anymore, even if i felt uncomfortable. Also smoked way less than ever before since i started. 
I cant and wont let weed, or better said myself, fuck this up again. It might be the last chance i have to turn around my life for good. 


Thanks to everyone who made it this far. I wish you all the best in life and hope you will finally manage to break free from these chains. May life be good to you and always remember to bring as much positivity in this world as you can. You will be rewarded for it, someday.",187

It was something fun to do on the weekends, like drinking. It made me feel all floaty and carefree, helped my ADHD brain slow down a bit and appreciate the little things, life was good!

When you like weed enough for it to become a part of your daily routine, it often becomes easy to not realize which parts of oneself that you *didn't* like, before being introduced to weed, start fading away as your usage increases. Maybe it helped you ease up and make new friends. Maybe it helped to not be so hard on yourself when you falter in one way or another. Maybe it helped with not being so angry, or irritable, or anxious. Maybe it helped you eat more, or less. It could be anything. 

The point being, after a long enough time of exposure to this substance that can help in ways you can be conscious of **OR** unconscious of, stepping away from it and having your brain revert back to the way it was before beginning with weed, can (and will) make those things we may not have liked about ourselves start creeping back.

Quitting weed isn't just about quitting weed. It's about making the (often tremendously difficult) life and personality adjustments that we may or may not have realized were holding us back before we started using in the first place. It may also be more about our environment/surroundings than our personality as well. Like I said before, it could be anything. 

This doesn't sum up **everybody's** struggles of course, but I've been around enough users and former users (myself very much so included) who fall into this category of recovery. It's not easy, and a support system like we have here is so important in helping you see through the fog!

""People have a glass of wine, or drink a beer or two after work, this is just my equivalent. Besides, it's just a plant.""

Yes. It's just a plant. But what no one tells you, is the things that come into your life along with this seemingly harmless plant. The endless nights of gorging myself with unhealthy meals from Uber eats. Watching pornography that made me feel ashamed of myself. Being too anxious to leave my house. Not wanting to see any friends. Having no motivation to accomplish any of my goals. Lying to my parents about why I couldn't talk to them on the phone, because ""I was working.""

I think it’s because stuff is just too damn strong but also used for way too long.  So it all came to a head a couple months ago when I really didn’t feel right so I just stopped cold turkey on a Tuesday. 

That Saturday I felt really bad, worst chest pain ever, heart racing (it was stressful day as I’ve got twin toddlers and a newborn was on the way). I went to the ED and they did a full work up, blood work was fine, chest X-ray fine, thank God.  Heart rate and blood pressure a bit high.  I guess what I’m asking is has anyone else dealt with this post quitting after a long time using?  

Is it normal to have anxiety related chest tightness after quitting?  I’ve also had a bit of numbness in my face recently that comes and goes.  Otherwise I feel good and way more “clear”.   I just want to see if anyone else has experienced similar as your body gets used to not having THC in it and how long will this last?  Anything to help with the anxiety?

It was a cheat code, an escape hatch for my brain when being inside it became too much. 

I wanted to exist in that liminal dreamy space where music sounded better, colors were brighter, and food tasted extra delicious. Where anxiety melted away.

But now I’m realizing that all those things are already true and I don’t need weed to make them better. That nagging feeling of needing to “up the brightness” so to speak of every experience… I realize that might just be me unable to be at peace in my mind. Maybe that’s why I’m an addict. 

I successfully managed to limit my booze consumption to pretty much nonexistent. 
But I’m having a harder time with weed. 

Lately though I’m getting motivated to stop because it makes my anxiety much worse. I smoke in order to mitigate my symptoms, but now I find myself unable to manage them when I’m stoned even just a little bit. 

I’m not sure if I’m the only person on here who catastrophizes a.k.a. believes things are worse than they are. When I’m honest with myself I can admit that weed never really made my anxiety better, it just made me think less about it. 

Now when I light up or even Vape a little bit I feel that horrible mixture of guilt and stasis. I’m just stuck in my mind still, but the weed pushes me even deeper into it now. 

Because on top of the anxiety I now have the guilt layered over, guilt that I’m still smoking at the age of 33. Shame that I haven’t done more with my life in my time on earth. Fear that I may have damaged my body irrevocably. Anxiety that I’ll lose the people I love. Catastrophic thoughts about worst case scenarios that only exist in my mind. Now that I think about it it has definitely exacerbated my lingering PTSD.

All that’s left to say is I want off the ride. I want to quit this once and for all. I don’t even want to be a weekend smoker, I just wanna live a life free from these chains. 

I feel shackled by my habit. I’m tired of viewing myself from the lens of *I’m an addict.* I’m so much more than that. 

While I consider myself in recovery and have definitely made progress, I need to do better. I want to find a better more holistic way to treat my anxiety…cause this ain’t it 😣",12

I distinctly remember that when I quit, I had no major withdrawals or problems. Cold turkey. After 33 years of sobriety a pot shop opened one block from my home.  I started with edibles and ended up vaping.....the disease of addiction was awakened and I was hooked again within weeks. 

Lessons learned:

The THC content these days is so massively powerful and THAT is what is fueling withdrawal. This shit is toxic, and yet it is being sold with no regards to strength. And believe me, the growers and retailers will never voluntarily reduce the content or levels of THC. Like cigarettes, they want you addicted. It means profit, profit, profit.

33 years clean...living proof here that no....you can't pick up again. Not next week, not next year, not in 20 years. This is a powerful drug.....it is cunning and baffling.  It waits for you to go back into your addictive disease and then it gets it's hooks into you again. 

Addiction as a  disease causes insanity. How else would I explain why my habit is more important to me than taking care of my emphysema and COPD?. Why else would I drive under the heavy influence, endangering others? STEP 2. Came to believe that a power greater than myself could restore me to sanity. (That power is this sub, meetings....whatever it takes).

I was a heavy smoker for 5/6 years, realised I need to quit for good, and I've gone over a month without weed, which was rewarding for a time- but I have become more and more depressed over the past week or two and I'm looking for some insight/perspective.

People who have quit successfully and now have 2/3+ months under their belt, was your primary aim to quit smoking or was it to sort your life out? I am concerned that my aim was to simply not smoke and  I've not put enough emphasis on replacing that with positive things, achievements and goals.

Also any suggestions for UK mental health organisations that specialise in recovery outpatient programs are greatly appreciated.

Thanks!",3

1. I’ll smoke with some friends at a concert/party, think to myself “wow, this is great! So relaxing”. The good memories of hanging with friends gets confused with good memories of getting high

2. I get dissatisfied with life, come to the conclusion that life is gonna be the same regardless of whether I smoke or not (definitely not true)

2021-11-17 10:27:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qw1p7e/23_years/,23 years,"I started smoking in my early teens. Used to be with friends but most of them quit because they stopped enjoying it.
I on the other hand still love to get high on a daily basis and I really crave my weed when the evening comes.

I think I can be considered a high functioning addict. I have had a 10+ year relationship, I have 2 happy & healthy kids, a successful IT consultant career and a network of good friends.

Over the years I have started rolling smaller and smaller joints, just so I could smoke more of them (I don't usually smoke cigarettes). 
A typical evening for me is getting behind my gaming PC after the kids are in bed, and start rolling and smoking until it's about 2 hours after a healthy bedtime. So every morning I am wrecked (gets harder the older you get) and it takes me a few hours and an equal amount of coffees to wake up. It has affected my job (I have not been where I could have been), has been part of why I broke up with my ex and has made me more introvert than I am.

On the other hand I can really look forward and enjoy those first joints of the day, which makes me not ready to give it up, at all.
The last years I took some breaks ranging from a week to a month. Every time I am looking forward to the deadline of the break after which I resume smoking with a vengeance.

Fast forward to the pandemic and I had a full blown relapse and threw the whole year away. I had saved up $15k in the time I did not smoke (thank heavens I still have that money, although it is put away.) I started getting active again. I started making music again. 

That all went to the crapper real quick. I started smoking once a week, then once a day, all the way til it was before every activity from waking up to taking a shower. Hanging out with people just to smoke and eventually I started tripping again too. Sleeping too much, Got too complacent with life and treating weed as if it were a piece of me that is missing when Im not smoking it. Stopped saving money too. 

It feels crazy to revisit the same community that helped me quit now that I have had such a horrible relapse.

Insomnia sucks. And you know what ? TOO FUCKING BAD ! I did this to myself. I willfully, thoughtfully and carefully planned to smoke as much as I did for as long as I did. The reasons why, I'm still sorting out. But whining and bitching about insomnia and sweats won't change anything. Suck it up, buttercup, is what I think to myself. What helps me suck it up, is to realize who else in the world suffers from insomnia. Like these people:

\- new parents. I don't have kids, but I sure know tons who do. Their tales of sleepless nights, feedings, colicky babies.. chronic insomnia that goes on for months and months.. Yeah. New parents. They're not sleeping either. My parents didn't either I assume. Nobody's parents did. For months at a time.  


\- menopausal women. Half the population on the planet is female, and any of them over the age of 50 is probably struggling with ""the silent passage"".  Millions and millions of women - Insomnia and night sweats. Your mom maybe.... You hear her bitch and whine about it ?  Yet this is going on, all over the world, each day, every day. Millions of women, operating on only 3 hours sleep and drenched in sweat, yet still holding down jobs, running households, companies, doing volunteer work....Me and my weed induced sweats and insomnia can suck it up.  


\- people in the hospital. Ever been hospitalized overnight ? Ever try and actually \*sleep\* ? yeah. Right. Machines beeping. Some random hacking, groaning, crying, screaming.... Everyone in a hospital right now. They probably can't sleep either. And I bet what's wrong with them is way worse than my crappy weed addiction.  


\- refugees. All over the world. In camps, in tents, without comfort, without family, without friends, without medicines.... Yeah. They can't sleep either. And I'm going to bitch about getting by on 4 hours ? Again - suck it up, buttercup.

&#x200B;

You get the drift....  


There are millions of people awake every night. Who struggle with getting a basic human requirement: sleep. Rest. For reasons medical, physical, gender-related, based on adversity....And if I am awake because of withdrawal symptoms, I figure, y'know.... I brought this on myself. And maybe just spend my time awake contemplating how I'm fucking BLESSED !! to be dealing with insomnia that is \*only\* the result of me doing a stupid habit with an addictive substance. Versus being awake because, like, a bomb is going off near my house every 6 hours for the last few years.",112
2021-11-17 05:12:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qvw5zt/4_years_ago_i_nearly_died_in_a_car_crash/,"4 years ago, I nearly died in a car crash.","I spent half a year in a wheelchair, a year in physiotherapy and although I'm partially disabled, I made an amazing recovery over the next 2 - 3 years. I didn't go through all that, I told myself, to simply return to my mediocre, stoner life, wasting away the years and achieving very little. I felt that that would be doing a disservice to all the doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, helicopter pilots and all the other people who helped me. Almost like if they knew how I waste my life, they probably wouldn't have bothered. (I knew that was not the case, but it's how I felt about myself.)
It was time for a change. A BIG change. 

So I made a list of all the things in my life that I needed to fix for a long time but did nothing about. 
1.Lose weight. 2.Start to eat healthy. 3.Exercise. 4.Quit smoking cigarettes. 5.Quit drinking beer every evening. 6.Work on my relationships (particularly with my wife) 7.Work on my spirituality, mood & happiness. 8.Learn the language (I moved to a foreign country 5 years earlier and only had a basic grasp of the language, which left me isolated and not fully participating in everyday life). 8.Quit smoking weed.

Why was quit smoking weed last on the list? Because I knew that would be the hardest. I smoked daily for 26 years. Getting high was my life. My reason for waking up. I only knew adult life as a stoner. I thought to myself, I'll start with the other things on the list first. 

Fast forward 1 year: I've lost weight, I do some exercise (although not as much and how I planned) I've quit beer, I smoke less cigarettes but couldn't quit completely, made little progress with the language and I'm still getting high every day. In short; I'd made a bit if progress, but not nearly as much as I wanted to.

4 months ago: Something happened that didn't happen much in 26 years: I ran out of weed. I found myself in such a dark and angry place, it shocked me. I found myself talking to people and behaving in a way that I didn't recognise and didn't like. I didn't know when I would get more weed. I started to despair. But just 2 days later, a friend unexpectedly gave me a joint. I didn't know how strong it was. I was not used to not smoking for 2 days. I was tired. I thought it would help me sleep. So I smoked it.

I got so stoned, so paranoid, so uncomfortable and way too high to sleep. I can't remember a time in my life that I disliked being stoned so much. For 2 days, all I wanted was to be high. As soon as I got high, all I wanted was to be sober. ""I don't want to live like this anymore"", I told myself. I found my list. I crossed off number 9 from the bottom of the list and wrote at the top of the list in big letters: No. 1: QUIT WEED.
I haven't smoked since.

Fast forward to today, 4 months since I last smoked weed:
1.Quit weed: sucess. 1.Lose weight: success. 2.Eat healthy: success. 3.Exercise: more success than I could dream of. I learned about and started bodybuilding. 4.Quit cigarettes: sucess. 5.Quit beer: success. 6.Work on my relationships: success. 7.Work on my spirituality and mood:  success (I read lots of books on the subject) 8.Learn the language: more success in the last 4 months than many years previously. 

In short, I've achieved more in improving my life in the 4 months since I quit weed, than all the rest of my life put together. My ambitions for the next 1 - 2 years: enter a bodybuilding competition and become a motivational speaker in a language that I'm still learning. I know FOR SURE that such big changes in my life would not have happened if I was still smoking weed. 

I'm not completely sure why I wrote my story, you will make your own conclusions. But I hope I can inspire someone in the same way that other people on this platform inspired me. I don't know you all personally, but I feel like we've got a special bond. We understand what each other are and have been going through. 

Good luck to everyone out there. ❤",94

However, upon quitting booze I fooled myself into thinking I could just take the edge off with a little smoke here and there.  But I can't do that, I just can't. It will always eventually get the better of me. Hence here I am, speaking my truth.

Only problem is ever since I quit I feel like it’s getting in the way of my relationship.  I assume she’s cheating on me and even get insecure when she goes out with her single friends. I don’t really say these things to her, because I know it’s crazy, but it’s like ever since I quit, my anxiety in the relationship has gone through the roof, which is something I’ve never experienced before. I’ve been with this girl for 2 years, and these thoughts are just really effecting me because like I said they only started once I quit weed. Not necessarily because I believe them, but because I hate that I’m having them. 

I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this since quitting, and if it will stop? Also I started smoking when my mom died, and my dad was recently diagnosed with cancer, so I don’t know whether my brain is just maybe in an anxious state right now.

I must admit, I relapsed last week, and a few times before that. I'm now at day 3 and feel like I'm back on track again. I'm not giving up

Through this process I have tried to make it extremely difficult for myself to get my hands on weed. I live in Rotterdam so I have literally a shop on every corner of the street, which makes it very hard, but I usually can resist the urge to buy some. I just tell myself not to leave the house when I have these urges again, which works most of the time.

The addict in me though, does not really want to stop and when I dispose of my weed I feel like I always left a tiny window of opportunity for myself to get it back. I know it's stupid, but at that time I just can't imagine myself going to that trouble to get high. And man, what was I wrong about that. My most recent attempt involved me trying to break open te floor of my bathroom to recollect a bag that I had thrown away there. Luckily, I didn't find it, but I felt so embarrassed for doing that. Now I know I have to throw it out in a garbage bin somewhere far from my house. Its really embarrassing, but there's just no other way.

On the other hand, I feel like it's comical in some dark and sad way. I'm sure I'm not the only one that did something like this. I thought maybe sharing some of those stories can make it all a bit lighter and make people not feel so bad about it. I don't want to excuse it offcourse, but I think it's important not to take ourselves so seriously all the time. Sometimes we do sad and stupid things and get crippled by the fear of going through something like that again. In my opinion, it's way better to know how to laugh about it, while knowing that we don't want to go through something like that again.

My tolerance got so high, while being depressed I lost all appetite, that I think I started to get malnourished and started feeling dissy or nauseas during the last couple months of my addiction. 

Going to the doctor on friday to do the general checkup to ease my health anxiety, but I think I've had a lung infection for 2 months or so that has not healed at all while I was smoking mixes (tobacco and weed). I quick tobacco and nic about 3 weeks ago, and quit bud 3 days ago. Btw, I think because of this infection I was having trouble sleeping on my left side, And last night I was able to. So small wins!

Because I'm in Australia that variation in strength of weed I could get my hands on contributed to the no appetite while high. I would go through an oz of some top stuff in 2 weeks, and then smoke low-grade home-grown stuff. Repeat.  

I felt really good last time I quit and fell back into it after a weekend trip I went on with friends who smoked bud. Of course. And then the mixture of issues with dealing with alcoholic dad and a mum who smokes bud every day ( she helps me a lot, but because of her use, she didn't see a problem with mine), and not being able to resolve them got me back into the dark hole of smoking morning to night.

* Practicing meditation daily
* Speaking to a therapist weekly
* Exercising almost daily
* Journaling weekly
* Practicing mindfulness daily
* Eating healthy daily
* Minimal/occasional use of other dopamine highs: porn, alcohol, video games, junk food etc.

**I've Noticed that there is no improvement in:**

* How I emotionally process things
* How I overthink
* My focus
* How I can't get out of my comfort zone

**What's gotten worse:**

* My social anxiety, and general anxiety
   * Heart palpitations, loss of sleep
* My depression
* My sleep
* Hopelessness
* Inability to do anything more productive with my idle time

**I've learned a lot about how cannabis has messed up my brain, reduced the activity in my amygdala and hippocampus, so I am wondering:**

* What are some non-supplemental ways to heal the brain?
   * I've heard about depression treatments like transcranial magnetic stimulation of the brain
* When is anything supposed to start getting better so I can have some hope?

Many people have mentioned depression and few have even mentioned suicidal thoughts. These can certainly be a part of withdrawal, but know it can also be a part of something deeper. If you’re having recurring suicidal thoughts, please consider seeing a therapist or psychiatrist to talk about your options. I am not a psychiatrist but I have an undergrad degree in psychology and it may not be just a symptom of withdrawal. I know withdrawal changes the dopamine and serotonin we produce and it can cause depression. But if you’re in a situation where you want to self harm or are considering suicide, know it could be a deeper issue as well. Don’t just allow yourself to struggle because you believe you’re withdrawing. 
If you do see someone, just be sure to be as upfront as possible about your situation and sobriety and allow them to help make the best decision for you. Sending you all positivity and hope the struggle ends for you soon. 

Sincerely,
A girl on day 13",10

I quit cold turkey a year ago, and did really well for 3-4 months. I got through all the initial horrible symptoms, and eventually got to a point where i could enjoy activities and get through days without  thinking about weed at all. Unfortunately I had really bad lingering GI issues, and it was actually my doctor who suggested I restart using weed t (""just a little hit in the morning"") to help. Of course, me being me, that was not sustainable and I quickly wanted more and more, and then more of it. I soon found myself back into my old pattern of smoking all day every day. I was kinda annoyed that a medical professional suggested I use again, but more annoyed with myself for using that as an excuse. 

So fast forward and now I am on day 3 again. I started a sobriety clock (I use an app called nomo if anyone is looking for one) and when I opened it I realized I quit on the exact same day I had last year. I would have been one year sober had I stuck with it, instead of starting all over again.  

Right now my emotions are all over the place and seem impossible to control . I am mostly irritable and extremely depressed. I feel ready for bed the entire day, but toss and turn. My body temperature regulation is entirely out of whack, vacillating between being drenched in sweat and chills. I get hungry, but then feel disgusted after a couple bites of food. I know these are all normal, temporary symptoms, but that knowledge does little to dissipate the loneliness I feel at the moment.

Hello friends. I've been using every night for about 10-15 years. Over the past two years I have made roughly 10-15 efforts to quit. The longest I was able to do so was 14 days. I've developed an uncomfortable amount of daily mental health problems. Feelings of sleep deprivation, fatigue, irritability, mood swings, low levels of tolerance, feelings of unhappiness, no motivation, lack of discipline, anger, etc.

I am a full-time professional poker player and have been for 7 years. A performance based profession requires sharp mental health. I simply have to choose not to work when I feel I am compromised. I am supposed to be averaging 30-40 hours a week of work and I have been averaging 5-10 hours for the longest time. 

This year alone, I've listened to about 20 audiobooks on self-help, stoicism, or mindfulness in hopes of a remedy. I wake up put efforts towards better morning habits such as listening to meditation primers, motivational videos, eating healthy whole foods, hydrating, exercising, only to find myself battling my mental health constantly throughout the day. I really want to get back to my career full time without feeling compromised.

What advice can you give me to prevent another perpetual relapse? I've been able to get through the first week or so. I've noticed in my past attempts I relapse when I am overwhelmed from the side effects. Most individuals can show up to work and go through the motions even if they're not feeling well, but if my decision-making skills are impaired because of side effects I can lose a lot of money in my career.

Also want to say, even though I haven't found success in my attempts to quit I appreciate this subreddit. I've read the struggles of many of you and I'm proud that you're all fighting.",6

I smoked daily for a year and a half with very heavy use in the last month I was smoking, going through about a 

day 1: morning nausea, but I think I was in the prodomal stage of CHS when I was smoking, and it was related to that. purposefully only slept about 3/4 hours the night of day 1 to make sure I would be very tired the next few days, hoping to combat some insomnia. 

days 2-4: intense nausea and no appetite. made myself stay up and also only slept 3-4 hours these nights--for some reason, it felt better to do that than to deal with insomnia caused by withdrawal. super emotionally fragile, on the verge of tears all day (I'm a woman, might be a parallel to increased irritability in men, but also felt a little irritable). started taking gas X every night because the morning nausea was unbearable, helped a lot, also took Dramamine but less often because it made me so tired). got absolutely random bouts of extreme anxiety and knots in my stomach. second day was the worst because of the onset, by day 4 I was kind of used to it. random shaking and chills throughout the day.

days 5-8: nausea continued, but I got a doctor's appointment with a family doctor day 4, after telling my whole family what was happening on day 3 (partially due to how emotional I was). Got anti anxiety and anti nausea medicine. unfortunately the depressive symptoms hit here. felt like literally NOTHING could help--and most likely nothing could, because when you're used to getting extra dopamine from weed, your brain doesn't just go to 0 dopamine, but actually goes to negative dopamine. my best tool was calling my mom (lol) and crying to my friends. every time I thought about walking to a dispensary I picked up the phone. I had to keep telling myself it would go away. the only thing that helped was reading, and so I let myself do that as much as I wanted, even though I had a lot of other work to do.

day 9: went to my first AA meeting (not too many MA meetings near me). met such supportive people who all were so nice to me, and got my 24 hours sober chip, which actually made me feel somewhat good for the first time since I quit. literally quietly cried through the whole meeting and barely spoke, lol.

days 10-16,17ish: kind of leveled out into a place I would describe as 'rough' but much less chaotic than the first week. started to dream again. a few small things started to give me that dopamine back. worst symptom was throwing up my food--nausea continued, and then escalated into actually throwing up, at least once a day, which I very much hated. dealt with a few hours of huge depressive feelings a day, but once it passed, it passed. felt pulled to start meditating and do spiritual practices again. attended two more meetings, met a lot of really nice people. never stopped feeling the urge to smoke--became more confident I wouldn't take a random turn into a dispo, but I would get excited at the end of the day to 'relax' and then realize I couldn't. had a strange, surreal feeling that I'd lived one day since I quit, even though I knew I was sleeping and resetting--I think because I smoked every night, I just felt I hadn't ""had a night"" since I quit, it was a really weird feeling. lurked in the leaves discord several times. cried a lot, complained a lot, met with my family doctor weekly, who referred me to a social worker, and started searching for therapists. started coughing up a fuckton of phlegm, and momentarily thought I had a cold, but it was actually a smoking based response my doctor said might last several weeks to a month or two.

days 18-21: throwing up a lot less, feeling a lot more hungry. sat down and did homework for the first time in weeks. still dealing with bouts of intense anxiety, and coughing up phlegm, but a lot less so (the phlegm was really gross the first few days). started actually being able to smile back at people when they said they were proud of me, started realizing how much each day mattered to me and how devastated I would feel waking up on day 1 again. it snowed, and I felt happier than I have felt in a year and a half just looking at it. realized how disgusted I've been with myself, made me motivated to start turning into someone I can love again. really looking forward to my one month chip. still feel like shit as a baseline, but it's more complicated--dealing with emotional stuff I was hiding with weed. proud of myself for that a little bit.

if this is helpful at all for anyone I'll update again in a little while! I told myself I would post here when I saw the light again and I'm beginning to glimpse it filtering through the clouds. still threw up my favorite meal on my favorite clothes last night and sobbed, but got in the shower, cried it out, and submitted a 15 page paper I thought I was going to miss entirely. might have to drop a class, but I think I can forgive myself for it. if this is what day 21 is like, I can't wait to see day 30, and 40, and beyond. anyone in those early stages: I didn't think I could do it. the worst part was knowing weed would take the symptoms away, but I also knew weed caused each and every single one of them. if you need help with anything feel free to message or comment. you can do it!!!!",6

If you went through something similar to this during your path to sobriety, just know you’re not alone and that you will get through it.

I started smoking a little over 2 years ago when I moved to California. I had always chased dopamine hits through alcohol and impulsive decisions, but weed was the quickest and easiest fix, so I got addicted pretty quickly. The worst it ever got was when I started hitting my dab pen around 1pm and stayed high for the rest of the day. My partner expressed concern about how much we both were smoking and suggested not buying carts anymore. Only smoking flower made a huge difference, but I still smoked at least daily to get that hit of dopamine. I was down to one bong rip a night when life came at me fast lol

I was out of town at my cousin’s wedding with no THC for 5 days. This is usually no problem for me—I would just be a little irritable and more stressed. Then day 4 came, and I had 2 panic attacks—one during the wedding ceremony and one during the reception. I flew home to CA the next day and then withdrawal was in full force. Anxiety, panic/paranoia, lack of appetite, fever, night sweats, nighttime panic attacks, the whole shebang. It was the worst 2 weeks of my life. I thought I had hyperthyroidism or hypoglycemia before I even considered it was THC withdrawal. 

The anxiety eased over time with help from my doctor, and I’m now eating even more than I did when I smoked. My mood is more stable, and I don’t rely on that bong hit to mellow me out at night. For anyone who’s struggling with chemical addiction or withdrawal, just know that it gets better, and you do have the strength to live your life without substances. Here if anyone needs to talk.",7

I've been sober for a really long time now and I know all the reasons why I shouldn't be doing this .. I'm a daily lurker here and the sub has helped me many times but this time is different.

I'm sick of being depressed all the time and coping, this isn't living

All I want is a joint to be horny as fuck and fuck some girl.

To enjoy food or what not, I want the escape yes even if it will take me to bad places, it's not like now I'm happy or even close ..

Not sure why I'm posting here, probably you guys will say don't do it and what not but I just can't take it anymore.

I'm sick of coping and being depressed!

I told a friend I'll be at his place in two hours to smoke

and asked someone to arrange me some weed.

Haven't done the deed yet but 99% I will.

Told my parents I'm planning to go back to smoke and they really against and I'm sure they will be disappointed.

The truth is I already had psycosis and went to a mental institute but still I just want to smoke, fuck it",3

Im in my head a lot. In school. In conversation. I had depression, and some days, I would get overwhelmed and do nothing

Weed was exciting. It made everything, anything, fun, so I would smoke before cleaning the house or folding laundry. It was such an easy upgrade

But it was too easy. I would tell myself that I was done with today’s to-dos, so I could reward myself with a smoke. 

But because of this, i never thought about the other to-dos, long term plans. Starting a project due later. Looking up places to fix my car. Studying for exams that were a week away.

I would focus on the now, but not on the later, until it all came down on me.

Smoking started to make me focus on other things. Whether people could tell if I was high. If I smelled. Whether I was hungry or if it was just munchies. 

All these thoughts did was make me paranoid and overeat.

It was a fun ride, but if I keep the future under the rug, itll just build until it all comes back to bite me",5

I was raised in an area plagued by crime and violence and I wanted out. Then I met Mary Jane and she gave me a way to be comfortable in the hell I called life and my life was essentially halted from then. I am now 24 with half of my life being dedicated to a small, green plant and my issues had not got better. My external circumstances had changed, I had graduated from university and moved in with my long term girlfriend who I love with all my heart but my depression, anxiety and OCD remained. 

I had tried previously to quit but the emotions I felt were too intense and I made life miserable for those around me so I gave in and relapsed. I must have relapsed over 50 times after telling myself this is the last time. My dad was a drug addict who committed suicide so it was clear to me that I was sensitive to substances and depression. 

After years of trying to quit and not succeeding, I came to realise that it was my mind state that needed to change and that my thoughts, my past, my addictions and actions were not who I am and that I will not be doomed into enabling the cycle of addiction and mental illness continue. 

I understand that it has only been 3 days and that I have been sober for longer than this but something feels different this time like I have be born again. Usually when I quit, the urges are too overwhelming and I spend all my days thinking about smoking until I break. This time, I have hardly thought about smoking. Instead, I have filled my time with activities such as meditation and exercise that have taught me to not listen to that voice in my head because that's where the issue is. Weed in of itself is not an issue but the voice in our head constantly pushes us to take it because we do not want to deal with reality. 

Three days ago I decided to face reality and not hide from it anymore. I could not have done it without this sub so thank you, you are all incredibly special.",5

My parents got divorced when i was 8, and my dad went to Canada (i live in Denmark) so really far away, and have seen him very little since then.

My mom and step dad are nice, but i never really mentally got over being abandoned like that. Which has manifested as anxiety, a general need for people to like me so they wont leave as well. Makes social situations that's not work exhausting, because my mind is always trying to read peoples facial expressions over analyzing everything. Usually takes a couple of months before i'm comfortable around new people.

Anyways i started smoking when i was 18, and that relief of just shutting down my brain was a godsent. I finally was able to make some actual friends, and not worry so much. Although i never started dating, and still to this day haven't had a gf (im 29 now). 

It seemed like the perfect fix, but as the years went on, it started not being enough my negative feelings shined through and i felt sad even as i was high. 

Then i quit cold turky back in the sommer of 2018, everything seemed good for 7/8 months, until i relapsed. It just feels so good to me and doens't really hinder my work. After that i quit and started 7 times, never lasting more than 3 months at most. Which is where im at now...

I've gone to two different psychiatrist, trying to work through all my issues, and by now it just seems like my problems aren't solvable. Like i realise why i feel the way i do, but i'm not able to rise above it. I just have to learn to live like this, and those prospects just seems so grim, and i feel like not living anymore. 

I work out everyday, am pretty fit/strong, have a great job earn more than my parents ever did. Live close by work, a fine apartment, and some savings. Like i shouldnt feel this way but i do... 

All i can really think about is starting again, because for those 2-3 months until my tolerance catches up with me, are the best time, because and can just relax and enjoy my life. 

But afterwards i start to feel just as bad as when i didn't smoke, so i smoke more and more until i get the will to quit and do so.

Other than working out, i have no hobbies, and nothing interests me, game a bit but that aint even really that satisfying. The only thing that makes my life worth living is those few months of bliss when i start smoking...

But as time goes on it gets harder to quit and just getting to the 3 month mark, is tougher and really just several months of shitty existence, so im getting more and more afraid that when i relapse i wont be able to quit again, and just fucking end it...

People have told be to stuff, but i have zero will to try, and my anxiety makes me not want to at all.. i've tried dating but everytime they say i seem like a great guy, but they just arent feeling it, and it just kills my self esteeme, and has been the reason i relapsed before. And im at point now where i cant even bring myself to write any of my matches on tinder because im propably starting to loose faith in anybodies abílity to love me.. 

Anyways thanks for reading if u got this far, i dont really now why i wrote it to be honest, im just bored atm working from home. Thought i'd type it out maybe it helps.... Anyways have a good day.",1

Anybody else been in the same shoes and can relate?","I'm writing this, my first post on reddit, as I've been following this forum for about 5 months and have yet to run into any post that I could identify with. I've been wanting to try quitting for a while now, yet every time I look for support or advice all I find is people who feel weed negatively affected their lives and held them back, which is in no way relatable for me. 

I've been smoking since 13 and am 38 now. Every day, all day for most of the time. Sold for many years so I had ample supply, then knew all the right people to get it dirt cheap no matter where I went. Now I own a cannabis association in southern Spain so weed is and has always been a huge part of my life. 

I grew up in BC and southern California, and have moved to a few different states and a bunch of countries (Peru, Canada, France, Spain, etc) since. Kept smoking throughout and never had any serious issues because of it. If anything, I was often told by close friends that weed seemed to be the only thing that calmed me down and that they couldn't imagine me without it. 

I finished community college then university at 25 (worked throughout) and been making $220K+ for 5 years now as I started my own business a decade ago. I have a wife and kid, we stay on the move and I can't say the bud ever made me counterproductive unfortunately... I say unfortunately cause if it had I may have found a reason to try and stop. 

Is there anybody out there in a similar position who quit and found it had a positive effect on their life? The only reason I often think of stopping is because I'm tired of being so dependent on a substance. I quit drinking for 3 weeks every year but I can't do the same for the weed and hash, and that bothers me. It'd be nice to see how I feel sober for a while  and not to stink around my son. And if it doesn't work I can always go back (since there isn't anything stopping me). I'm looking for some motivation so if anyone has any advice or feedback I'd love to hear it.

First off I want to say how grateful I am for this sub. In times when I feel mentally weaker/cravings get stronger I turn to this sub and it’s really been helping me out a lot. I want to thank each and everyone of you for your contribution and know that it’s really appreciated.

That being said, I’ve been having a tough ass time the last week. The first weeks of sobriety really worked wonders for me. I felt like I had more energy, and my personality really was out there again. I was kind of picking up on life where I left of before I got in the smoke - shame - isolation part of my addiction. I started being less disorganised by keeping an agenda, hanging out more with people I truly value and starting projects I had been procrastinating for so long. Things are looking up for me in that sense.

But the past weeks have been tough on me as well, with this week being the hardest. I feel like depression is kicking in more and more and I find myself a little unable to deal with it properly. My shoulders have been so tense ever since I quit smoking weed. I think I relied on weed for stress relief so much these past couple of years that I now find myself unable to properly relax without it. My sleep is all fucked up lately, I wake up really tired every morning, even after a solid 8 hours. I find myself procrastinating quite extreme this last week, I’ve been missing important appointments and I’ve increased my drinking frequency, which I don’t like. I never was a big drinker.

What’s also hard is the fact that I left this big ass disorganised mess I have to deal with by being high all the time for the last couple of years. It all feels like so much lately.

Wow, this was a big venting session for me. Thank you if you’ve made it this far. I want to end on a more positive note and that is that I know in the deepest of my heart that I have to go through this in order to reach my dreams and fulfil whatever purpose lies for me on this earth. Sometimes I wish it would be easier, but then life would be like an easy ass videogame and where is the fun in that right.",11

Today is day 0, myself and partner smoked last night and both agreed enough was enough. I want to quit cold turkey as I’ve found moderating to be pretty much a slippery slope back into the daily grind (I’m sure I’m not alone in this struggle). We smoke in the evenings, I have done so pretty much daily since 2012 and I am not sure who I am without this habit… I’m fking nervous to say the least! 

I’ve been smoking cigarettes since around 16 and j’s with tobacco, too. I’m vegan and recently saw a post about the animal testing facilities tobacco companies use, forcing poor animals to breathe cigarette smoke for 7-10 hours a day. That was enough to make tobacco repulsive. I’m working hard to form the neural connection between suffering animals and my habit. Has anyone found anything that has made cannabis repulsive, too? 

We’ve made plans to go to the cinema tonight to see the new MARVEL film, giving us a good excuse to not smoke. Do you have any tips for how to continue to have the self restraint when we get back home late this evening? 

I read a comment last week that said “choosing to quit isn’t an action but rather choosing not to act”. I love this concept and wondered if anyone had found any evening activities to fill up the space? I want to form a new action/habit and would be grateful for any advice. 

Also, if anyone is willing, I’d appreciate having someone I can message to hold me accountable during these first few weeks. This was suggested by my therapist, initially pointing me towards an MA group. I feel comfortable in this community and trust there is a member of this thread who is capable of helping to support me. 

This is my first ever post, which tells me that I’m taking quitting seriously this time. I know I can do it, but I don’t really have the best support system when it comes to quitting smoking. It would be wonderful to have some support from this community, I feel stronger just for posting. 

Thank you in advance to anyone that reads or comments on this post. I am so grateful for this community, it’s really powerful having a place where my dependence is understood. I want to stop holding myself back and so here I am, taking the first step.

Earlier this year I finally realized I actually had a problem and leaned into this subreddit for help. I was able to make it from end of May/beginning of June to mid of August. I felt amazing, aware, present of everything going on around me. My finances got better, my mental health started to rebound, and I wanted to make sure I was “clean” for when I proposed to my fiancée. 

Well, I proposed in July and made it over a month before relapsing… it started as a social smoke with one of my best friends. I told myself it was just the one day, I was only doing it socially, it would only be that one day, I wouldn’t lose control, it was ONLY just that one day, blah blah blah. Same song and dance. You know what happened. 

Every single day since relapsing (I actually do mean EVERY. DAY) I have regretted it and feared these exact symptoms coming back. The nausea, vomiting, chills, sweats, insomnia, etc. Looking forward to more of that tonight. 

Here’s to hoping I lean into this sub a little more this time and keep my goal of getting married next year as just my authentic self as my motivation. 

TL;DR - Relapsed back in August after almost 3 months clean to propose and be better fiancé and partner. I couldn’t work up the courage or motivation to start this process over again until now. Regretted it consciously, every single time I smoked (Multiple times a day). Looking to be more active here this time, and use my wedding next summer as my motivation. 

Apologies for my novel above and thank you to those who read it. To staying strong!

Been smoking daily for 8+ years with a medical license provided to me as I have PTSD was prescribed cannabis as an alternative, Time to put down the fix and work on mending myself. 31 y.o. Male, Father to three, Husband to someone better than me, I'm here for support.","So here it is, Honest and ugly.  


I'm 31 years old, Male, Three kids, been with the same person since I was 13, (That's another story, But To stay on point, She doesn't smoke, However encourages I do as she found in the past it helped my mood.) Recently I've come to the conclusion that cannabis has had a huge impact on my life, Not necessarily in a positive manor, not overly bad though.  I come from a broken home, My mother was addicted to Speed, for a number of years and had trouble remaining a present force in my life up until I was about 15, Where at that point, I'd already formed what I would come to see as my Family. 

  I started using cannabis to when I was 19 after My son was about one year old at the time. Prior to that I was straight up, A fall down piece of shit. Still am, But I've sobered up in the sense that I'm no longer making 50 gallons of wine at a time in the garage at my mothers house. (I was about 16 here)  ahah.

 Anyways, After our first son was born, I realized that I was perpetuating exactly what I'd received and I as displaying the same sort of behavior I wish I didn't come to know in my childhood from a parent. 

Neglect, Intentional or otherwise, doesn't matter when at the end of the day, I'm stoned and satisfied and Absent to the fact right? I came across The Poem Man In The Glass in another post on this subreddit actually, It has me reflecting and thinking, This is it.  


Truthfully, I know what caused my intense feeling of connection to cannabis, And I can explain it now only in retrospect, as is often the case.  

Connection, Its been lacking in my life with most people, My parents weren't readily available. I got a lot of grief about my mothers life choices from peers and their parents, Alienation doesn't begin to explain being the child of a drug using suspected minority in Canada, Furreals.  (My mother is very often mistaken for first nations and Identified as such as she was told she was. Only recently thanks to 23 and me have I discovered, She is either Not my mother, Or she is most certainly NOT First Nations.)

Back to Connections, In the absence of, I have formed bonds with people I figured would be with me throughout my life and I have made efforts to ensure this is the case. I am still very close with all the same people I was close with when I was in my teens With one exception. I lost my friend to a Cerebral Aneurysm during an epileptic seizure, (Grand Mal.) He left behind so many shattered worlds. He was trying to get things situated so that he could has a surgical procedure where they would cut into his brain and remove the scar tissue in an attempt to stop or atleast slow what we would later find out was progressive and only going to get worth with each seizure. (More seizures, Made more scar tissue which further broke down his brains ability to communicate, causing neurons to rapidly fire of triggering more seizures. It was truly hell for someone who so desperately just wanted to live and was actively working towards it.)   

Here's the thing, just before my buddy passed, We spent like two years, Everyday, All day, just blazing, And I still, to this day, can see the fucker sitting on my basement stair step in his red and green grinch pajamas and leather jacket, CM Punk white shirt. Really, I've come to associate my use with his company, Interestingly enough, I begged when died that he might haunt me. Sounds Morbid, But   
I was firmly locked in the throws of grief. I'd lost many family over the years I'd had ""Connections"" With.   But this was different, I lost my Comrade, see the difference in this loss was, I'd known Dillan, (My friend that passed) Since I was 5 years old, When he was 8 he moved into the same apartment building as me, spent all our childhood together and whelp, Frankly was my confidant in many things, My home life, The abuse and the forms it took. My quiet desperation for love and acceptance in a place where when I looked around, There wasn't much. (Grew up in Poverty clusters, you see lots of welfare Christmas' in broken homes type of deal and the only guys that stick around are the ones that don't have jobs because its easier to mooch off of single mothers who feel they have limited options. fucking gross.)

 I genuinely thought that was the norm and came to expect very little out of life, I figured, If I could find someone to like me. I'd be set. (Please remember the Man In the Mirror Poem, This is pertinent,)  

I've known, For a long time its been time to quit, I use cannabis as an emotional crutch, A means to hide away while I can be jeerful and snide in a sarcastic or facetious nature without consequence. (Can't hate/reflect/judge/ruminate what I can't remember right? More Bowls!)  My friend passed 5 years ago, and while he loved cannabis, He didn't love what people did with it, Hide away and project their nasty shit onto other people.   Become Toxic I guess, (I'm not saying every person who smokes pot becomes toxic or is because they use, I'm just saying, In my case, Its not helping me to reflect on the shit I say, That's for sure and while my friend was alive we felt it made people complacent and uninterested in being involved socially and frankly, Just not give a shit.)

So what does a 31 year old male with serious bonding and abandonment issues do?  


\--------------\~\~\~\~\~START\~\~\~\~\~--------------

That's where I'm at, New life starts now, I've quit using cannabis and tried to address these issues head on before, But first, Sobriety. 8 years in and I firmly believe I can quit and take some time to fix shit that's broken. Maybe stand to be okay to see that man in the mirror so to speak. Ahah, I think I get The Man Who Sold The World a little better now.   


I hope to be face to face with the man who didn't sell the world when I look in the mirror. To be happy with who I see and with what I am doing.   


Pardon the Diatribe, If you managed to the end, you have my thanks. I hope someone can find something in my mindless meandering that resembles their experience and maybe that helps them feel not so alone and motivated to move forward. Cheers.",104

The past few days have been awful. I come from a family where my elderly parents still keep things from their kids. I realized why I was always getting high these past 24 years. I lost family members, friends… the whole nine yards. I’m married and have a dog and a good life. One many would take and run. I came from a poor past and worked my ass off to get here, but for some reason it doesn’t feel good enough.

All my hobbies are no longer any fun. I can’t watch shows or play games. All I want to do is be away from people. The thought of people getting older and dying is getting to me. I lost my sister this past year to cancer and she was the main reason I wanted to stop and change. Today I’m reconsidering it badly, though. I don’t feel like I can do this much longer.

Honestly folks… I’m falling apart. I really think I’m about to cave in and go back to my old ways. I feel like a fucking failure of a human and really see little point to correcting this problem of mine. I’m already here and at 40 don’t think I can make friends easily anymore. Why bother?

I know I’m not alone. I know future me would be let down if I did go back. I’m just falling apart by the day and honestly cannot see the light.

Smoking for about 3 1/2 years 
Carts mostly

Hello everyone, I wanted to quit smoking for sometime now, and today I’m starting.  I want to sort of document and share this experience day by day to see how My progress goes, and maybe  help out one of you guys on the way! I’m 20 years and in about a month im turning 21. since I was 17 I started smoking thc and haven’t stopped since then. The longest break i have taken is 21 days.

My experience with weed starts with smoking reggies (low quality weed) but got me pretty high still since it was the first times I smoked. After a month or two of smoking, tolerance started to build up and I started to look for better weed. Keep in mind I live in Mexico and sometimes is kinda hard to find good quality weed. I did find some but to my bad luck what I also found are CARTS. Carts in that time were barely popping off in our city so it’s was something new to me. After buying my first cart and trying it out, for me at that time it was the best thing that could happen to me ( I was so wrong haha) I just needed one rip to get me incredibly high and the effect would last me through the whole night. I still remember that cart lasted me for about 2 months, being all day and all night high without any worries, little did I know I was just fucking me up and building really high tolarence that it really doesn’t help you in anything at all. 
 
After I finished my first cart, I guess you know what happened. I immediately went for another one and just kept buying. The bad thing is that the carts wouldn’t last me 2 months,  it started lasting me 3 weeks, 2 weeks and so on to the point that I would finish a cart in under 2 days. The convenience of it not smelling and discretion of the pen was so useful for me that it was so easy to be hitting it all day, every day. 

I got to a point we’re I would feel sick and nauseous even if I hit it or not, that’s when I took my first brake which I lasted 21 days. My plan was to go a whole year clean but after certain stuff started to happen in my life from which I decided to indulge a little bit again, and that would lead me to start consuming daily again. 

Literally fell down the whole again 

But hey! That’s what we’re here for right?

It doesn't matter how many times you fall, what matters is that you pick yourself back up and fight harder!!

I liked smoking because it helped me out on ideas, being creative, thinking out of the box etc. But NOW I want to stop because instead of helping me out I just feel like my whole brain is cloudy after I smoke, plus there’s a lot of black market carts and I don’t really trust them. I’m not here to say that weed is bad and stuff, it can help you out in many ways, but hear me out, TOO MUCH OF ANYTHING IS BAD. Keep your consume moderate, be safe and use verified carts only, or if you can smoke only flower even better, orrr if you don’t smoke much better!!

Like I said in the begging I going to try and share with you guys my day by day, like a kinda blog, so I’ll keep you guys posted. Feel free to comment advice or questions you may have!",7

This time around it's very obvious to me why that didn't work out. The lack of progress in my life wasn't the core issue (it was certainly a big issue) - it was that I wasn't able to respond to new issues in a healthy way as they popped up. 

Big take away: I'm not going to reach a state in my life where I've got all my problems solved, but I am going to reach a state in my life where I can solve all my problems.

I smoke half a gram a day at most a gram and always do it at nights. It doesn't interfere with my daily duties or with my work. I even finished 2 year college in here while getting high everyday I managed to graduate with 3.68 GPA. 

 It relaxes me and helps me have a nice time when I am alone and last few years I am alone most of the time.

I couldn't believe after I read your experiences that I am actually addicted to this. As soon as I arrive home first thing I do is rolling a joint.

Same thing with fluids. I've puked 4 times this week just by drinking water.

I just want to eat again. 2k cals. Feel energetic.  

I'm sleeping but I'm so lethargic because of lack of nutrition that I'm waking up and feeling like I'm literally dying. Brought me to tears yesterday. That's how unwell I feel.

I think if I wasn't forcing electrolyte consumption daily I would have been in the hospital by now.

Any tips? I'm relapsing by tomorrow if the pounds keep shedding like this. I look gaunt. This looks like a hard drug detox not a Marijuana detox.

I’m currently at 36 hours and feel like absolute garbage, it hurts to look at my screen while typing this. 

So I guess my question is how did you guys stop smoking? What were your first steps? Did you quit cold turkey, or gradually? How did you make it more bearable, or am I just being impatient? I am also so used to smoking every night and watching tv and binging, so what do you do now at night? 

Thanks all :)",5

If you're trying to quit, you should definitely make your own list and keep it in your reach (like on your phone). I hope this list help you and motivate you to quit and stay clean. Tell me in the comments your top reason(s) to quit, it may inspire me or inspire someone else.

 

1. Addiction and Dependence. I can't be happy, relaxed or active if I'm not high, I can't sleep or eat if I don't smoke.

2. Not being myself. I'm stupid and crazy when I'm high. I hate my actions, the things I do and say while high.

3. Work. I can't handle the easiest job. I can't focus after a smoke day. sometimes I go to work high and mess up everything.

4. Mental illnesses. weed is giving me many mental problems, like depression, disconnecting from reality, not knowing my personality and more illnesses I haven't discovered.

5. Memory and brain cells. I forget about 40% of what I did and said while high. my memory is fucked up now. I need to stay clean to recover.

6. Using hard drugs. I use dangerous drugs irresponsibly when I'm high.

7. Money. I buy many things I don't need or like while high. I spend a good amount of money on weed.

8. Family. I'm a bad son and brother when I'm high or having a withdrawal.

9. Smoking tobacco. I will never quit smoking tobacco if I smoke weed

10. Future. I can't be a husband or a father. I can't have my own house.

11. Unhealthy Food. I eat too much when I'm high and when I'm sober I barely eat.

12. NoFap. I always watch porn and masturbate when I get high.",30

I feel like weed has gotten me through some extremely difficult times and has allowed me to put myself in a frame of mind where I have been able to recover and work through some of my issues but now it's holding me back, and causing issues of its own. My efforts to separate myself from the people and places associated with my marijuana use have so far been successful, but quitting completely is a different beast. I think the longest I've gone without weed in the 3 years I've been using is 2 weeks. Every time I try to quit I go through the same cycle. I'll have spent like, $200 to buy an ounce, get halfway through and start feeling guilty because I'm burning through it so fast, throw it away or give it away, and in a week get cravings so bad I cave and tell myself ""I'll just order a little more to get me through"", rinse and repeat. Y'all know the fucking deal.  I want to live fully, without that constant fog clouding my brain. I want to use all the money I spend on shit related to weed to travel and enrich my life and the lives of others. I've finally gotten into graduate school, which is something I've wanted for almost 10 years and I am terrified of squandering this one-time opportunity that I've worked so hard for. I'm also struggling with rationalizing how I can compete with insanely intelligent and talented (and sober) people when I'm high pretty much 24/7. I don't think I can handle quitting cold turkey but I want to start tapering. I have two weeks until the semester ends, then the entire month of December ""off"" with no classes, but I'll still have research. I am looking for some support and suggestions of how others have tapered and how they've dealt with the withdrawal symptoms, especially during high-stress times. I would love to hear your stories, and I am here to support you all as well. Thanks!",6

I started smoking when i was 14 in the 8th grade with my older brother. i have a disorder called hyperhidrosis(excessive sweating) which started to bother me around the same time. also known as the silent handicap the disorder only affects about 3% of people and fuck its so mentally draining. when i started getting high i started to get uncomfortable with my appearance basically body dysmorphia which i already had problems with. i became delusional and just in my own world where i feed myself lies and just wanted to get high all the time and not do anything. i would prioritize it over everything, and i know i have an addictive personality i wouldnt even wanna brush my teeth if it killed my high.  getting high was my main priority when i got to high school and when i hung out with my brother so basically i always getting high, and then life happened i played football but i broke my hand after a fight with my dad in 10th grade. i dropped out to try online school because i got severely depressed because that was the first time i tried to quit smoking and was somewhat successful to take football serious(i was pretty good too i could've at least got a scholarship to get a degree), i was tired of feeling trapped by my addiction and i ended up moving to my moms to try and get back on track. i was to far behind in my credits that i had to go back to online school when all i wanted to do was go to school to see my friends and play football but my addiction and disorder were in the way and my mental state. i came back to my dads to visit end of senior year. at this point life was hitting me like damn i gotta make a change again because high schools almost over and i need to make a decision on what i wanna do(i wanted to still play football obviously even tho i had put no work in up to that point in academics or working out since i started smoking, i was so lazy and delusional i thought everything would just fall into place somehow i had nobody to help me or guide me )my judgement and decision making got bad because i got caught up in a bad situation i should've never got involved in and got arrested, so i never finished high school and now i was dealing with legal issues (i looking at 4 - 12 years in prison)i had to do a year in jail and got out of jail a year ago on halloween, i felt like i had got robbed of my life. now being a felon too i couldn't do so many things and so many peoples opinions changed about me not like i care what people think anymore, they made me out to be the villain all because my friends weren't really my friends and i made a couple bad decisions, but with 16 months sobriety one of my only ""friends"" i'm close with still, got his card and got me to smoke because its legal(i'm on probation) something i thought id never get back was my sobriety and i blew it all just like that when i see how depressed and lost i was now before. now since January i've been smoking everyday. it led to me start doing other bad habits again (more addictions) but weed thats always been my problem. now i'm severely depressed again at an all time low i thought i couldn't hit again, i crashed my car in may suffered two fractures one to my rib and scapular never got health insurance to cover it like everybody told me to, back in august i got a staph infection in my finger and it ate away at some of it so its slowly healing (some might not come back dr. didn't know) another bill on top of that. now i just feel the worst i've ever felt physically and mentally like my body's gone through so much and mentally i'm checked out i'm running on auto pilot, because this must be the depression they portray on tv and movies i don't wanna do anything even if its starting to get my life back on track. i just wanna give up at this point, it wouldn't be as hard if my addiction didnt control my life on top of a stupid disorder that i everyone says i blow out of proportion because of my mental issues (literally drip sweat constantly from hands/feet/armpits and even my ass). sorry for the long vent post(which is so half assed and says so little) or rant whatever been up all night gave up on trying to articulate how lost i am. i feel cursed and stuck at this point with life. i don't know where to start and i'm tired of being in emotional and physical pain.",18

Yesterday felt weird. I realized that I would want this forever, and be doing it one day at a time. The time really flew. I also had cravings all week for the first time in a while, but they finally left when I made it. 


This time last year, I woke up in rehab angry. I was smoking two grams of wax a day, with flower on the side, and drinking up to a bottle every night, so I checked myself in. I was angry that I was expected to never use again. I had been living like a raccoon. I was going out in the dead of night, wallowing in physical and emotional garbage, and lashing out at anyone who got close to me.


I discovered an atheistic spirituality in rehab. ""God"" became ""good orderly direction"", my ""higher power"" became community and life. I made friends, got out of my shell, and rediscovered hobbies. Eventually, the cravings started to fade. I was eating and sleeping like a non-user again. I was emotionally regulating. I became a more recovered person, though the withdrawals made me lose about ten pounds. I was discharged after 21 days. 


I entered a sober living environment, and my life changed. I met my sponsor, and a sober community. I discovered a program through narcotics anonymous, and slowly started working the program. It changed my life. 


""Easy does it,"" is the phrase, but life had other plans. My relationship I started in treatment continued to flourish. Having dropped out of school, I started work for the first time. I moved out on my own, and started paying my own bills. 


It hasn't been an easy ride. I will admit that there were struggles. At one point, I voluntarily put myself on psychiatric hold to avoid using and self harm. There was a growing curve,  and stress involved in working and relationships. But I made it. One day at a time, things got better.


My advice to the newcomer is this: you have two options, using, or abstinence and recovery. The easier option has more suffering, and the harder option has inevitable pain (though suffering over it is optional). The first two weeks are the hardest, because you have to deal with withdrawals to recover. There's no way around the pain, though management of symptoms is possible. I also recommend discovering what connects you to life, and worshipping it above all else. Gratitude is the key to lifelong growth, along with honesty, open mindedness, and willingness. Continue on in your journey, and great things will happen.

Been smoking for almost 11 years now, at first for fun, but now it's a dependency. Everything I did was with weed, from work in the morning til I went to bed at night. I used it to escape, life was rough in my 20s, I just didn't get it. But now that is all changing.

I am 31 now and life has turned a page. It is no longer a drag anymore, I have many things to be happy about. 

So why is it so hard to stop. Why is it that the moment I say I don't need it anymore does it haunt me.

 When I wake up in the middle of the night, when I eat, when I hangout with friends, when it's just my wife and I watching a movie, I crave it! It has even started to hurt me, causing minor chest pain if I smoke too much. But even knowing that, the moment I start to come out of the high I want back in.

I have tried quitting 3 times in the past month, but always find myself back. Today starts attempt number 4. 

I suppose I am writing this as a hope for find people who I can relate to, who might give me some words that might help. I don't know what they are, but reading many of the posts on the page has filled me with some hope. Almost all my friends smoke, and though they don't push it, telling them that I'm quiting just gets me a ""good luck"". Even if you took the time to read my story, thank you, I hope life is amazing for you all",5

I intend for it to be the longest I've ever had. For the first time in my life I'm okay with saying I'll never smoke again. It's been a long time coming. I'm a human and an addict so I do keep in mind the possibility of relapse, though short from someone forcing the smoke into my longs I don't think I will.

I gave myself a week off from my responsibilities. Game all day? OK. Eat takeaway every day? Sure. Watch 2 movies a night? Whatever helped me stay sober. Ironically enough I noticed that the last few days engaging with my responsibilities helped me stay sober more than ignoring them. Sober me is not happy to sit on his computer chair all day bar from a trip to the gym. Sober me wants to create, experience, and live a fulfilling life. I do not mind putting in the work for these goals.

So this week I'll slowly start picking up my responsibilities and will restart the progress of holding myself accountable for the state of my life. I'll write, make music, read, work out, cook and do all of these things from the comfort of a clean home. I struggle doing these things while high; I want to do these things while sober.

I was not able to go cold turkey. I stopped smoking cigarettes first and switched to vaping. Then I stopped smoking joints and used a vaporiser. Then I only took 2 hits in the morning and nights each. Then I took one hit each. Then stopped the morning hit. As of 1 week I have completely stopped. I still have grinded weed in my bag ready to be smoked. But I have totally overcome my urges. I do not get cravings anymore. Now I have a mindset the I am not a stoner anymore.

A big thank you to this sub and all its members. Reading your posts always kept me motivated to quit. I shared my method so that others can use it who have been unable to quit cold turkey. I trumied it many times and failed. I slowly cut back my consumption. It intentionally took it super slow. I never put pressure on myself and took 2 months to slowly wean myself off. As a result I never got any anxiety or cravings. Maybe my method will can help you. If you want I can elaborate my plan.

Funny thing is yesterday was a bad day. I felt the same bad feelings but my mind did not make me want to smoke. I just had to wait it out. It passed and mind went back to normal.

Thanks again for helping this former stoner quit after 15 long years. I smoked weed to escape from my reality, but I just eneded up not adressing big problems in my life which will ever go away if I did not stop weed. 

Good luck to everyone and stay strong.",16

2021-11-15 00:40:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qu98e8/told_my_friends_today/,Told my friends today,"Today I told all of my friends, I’d say 80% of who smoke, that I have come to the conclusion that I need to stop smoking for my well being. 

I wanted to tell them because I keep relapsing, and I think the reason is that I was trying to go it alone. Sure, I’ve had /r/leaves and this community is fantastic, but it’s really easy to not look at it when I simply want to indulge the temptation. So I figured if I tell my friends, then it has to be real. Then I can’t avoid it anymore when the desire comes to relapse, there will be a support network. 

I was scared to tell them. I didn’t want them to think I was weak, I didn’t want to make them feel ashamed of their weed usage at all, I didn’t want them to think less of me. And ultimately, I was scared because I realized that this was a step that would truly cross the Rubicon, I wouldn’t be a hidden weed addict anymore and I would never again be able to relapse with the same amount of ease. With all these fears in my heart, I told them.

The response was beyond unbelievable. They comforted me, told me how much they loved me and how important it was to them to help me keep this promise to myself. They made some lighthearted jokes about the situation that made me feel like I was not going through this dark, sad experience foe the first time since I accepted my addiction. They even all came to the conclusion that our group should be getting out and doing more than sitting around smoking as it is. They made me feel safe. 

Today is the first day since I quit that I’m not afraid. I’m very lucky, I realize that I have a special and accepting group of friends. But my advice is: tell your friends. Don’t try to walk alone through this pain if you can help it.",11

I’ve read so many posts on this page, appreciated everyone’s candid and relatable feelings, tips and tricks, and have had fleeting moments of trying to cold turkey quit, usually resulting in hating myself for being so weak when I would sneak a hit in a moment of anxiety or discomfort.

I moved to a state three years ago where weed is legal both recreationally and medically, I have smoked through college, going through phases of frequent to very rarely and had quit for close to a year before moving. When I got here, my husband and I smoked fairly regularly to go to sleep and to have a chill Sunday afternoon here or there. Through the pandemic we started smoking frequently. Me, more so than him. We started trying to get pregnant this July and after each month of no dice we both got super nervous marijuana was playing into us not. We’d discussed taking 100mg worth of edibles this morning..I was three days late today and decided to take a test. And there it was, a positive. Insta-quit time. I never was motivated enough to do it for myself but this little Lima bean inside of me made it make sense.",16

I returned to full-time engineering school this fall, and it's going... bare minimum acceptable. I used to be an excellent student. Luckily. Looks like 14 years of heavy weed use didn't actually reduce my intelligence. But it has ABSOLUTELY effected my frustration and boredom tolerance, which it turns out is more important than raw intellectual capacity when it comes to actually completing your homework. 
I know the conventional wisdom is to enter recovery and get stable in it before going back to school, but I'm a stubborn piece of shit and apparently I need the threat of failing at something important to me to reinforce my desire to get and stay sober on a daily basis. 

But it's been a frustrating stutter-step process. I can't really do my high level math and physics homework high. But the first weeks of sobriety leave me rolling the dice on a daily basis for whether my brain will function even a little bit. I want to get sober to be more productive and intellectually engaged. But my sober days are my least productive because all I think about is wanting to get high or how uncomfortable everything is. So it's been a back and forth on again off again for the last few months. And I'm just exhausted. I'm just ready to quit and be done. If staying sober tank's my semester, fine, whatever. I'll repeat some classes. 

I'm day 2 today. And feeling OK. Not enjoying dealing with my chronic pain again. I know I need to work out and get some of those sweet sweet endorphins, but it's hard to motivate myself when all my joints feel like they are filled with broken glass.

I feel really great about that but I also feel hopeless (kind of) but also optimistic. I have so many emotions going through my brain all day, like overload, and behind all those emotions there's this little voice in my head telling me: ""fuck it dude just smoke, you'll feel better, this food will taste better, you'll be able to sleep.""

I've been smoking daily for almost two years (since it became legal here in 2020). About 7 grams a week. it really started up with the pandemic. I started smoking at night just to relax and then almost immediately went crazy with it. I'd wake up early as shit, hours before everyone else in the house, just so I could smoke and smoke and smoke. it quickly became an all day, every day thing, smoking almost hourly.

For the last nine months or so I've felt like I'm always moving through a heavy fog. My brain is slower to react. I can barely hold down a simple conversation. Have no motivation or drive. I feel like nothing. I feel like I'm empty and that I'll never be full again.

I don't feel like a person anymore.

The weed's also zapped my creativity. I'm an author. My last book came out at the beginning of 2020 and I've barely written a single word since. (Writing's not my only source of income but it is *a* source of income, couple drops in the bucket really but it all adds up).

On top of everything else I'm just embarrassed. Mostly because it's just weed. I'm not saying ""it's just weed"" to diminish mine or anyone else's struggle with marijuana abuse. I'm just saying that it's kind of embarrassing to tell someone you might be addicted to weed. I don't know. I've had other issues with addiction in the past, back in college. I got clean off all that other shit, had a good five years of 100% sobriety. I was feeling great back then (100% sober) I wrote all 5 of my books in that stretch of time.

And now just nothing.

I've read a few other posts similar to this, so I'm sorry if this is some cliched bullshit. But I really just wanted to get all this off my chest. Don't really feel like I can talk to anyone else about all this.

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I really just want to feel like a person again. I want to be able to look my daughter in the eye without feeling like a massive fucking failure. I want to laugh. I want to be able to eat and sleep (without weed). I want to write again...",8

It's been about 10 years of being high every day. I'm terrified.,"Hi all - as a usual resident of /r/trees, this is my first time in /r/leaves and could do with a bit of comfort.

I'm 33 (turning 34 in a month) and autistic - so as you can probably imagine, weed has been a easily accessible comfort for me for at least 10 years. It's probably more than that, but I honestly can't remember when I first started getting involved.

Recently, I made a promise to my girlfriend that I would make a conscious effort to taper off the amount I'm smoking (about 3.5 over 3 or 4 days, I used to smoke at least 3.5 a day 2 years ago) - this is due to me wanting to make a better effort for saving up money and trying to improve my mental and physical health.

It's been less than 24 hours and I'm drenched in sweat with a tight chest, the urge to cry and all my anxieties are just getting worse as the night goes on - with the big dread of it all coming from whether I'll be able to get a decent sleep (I'd usually just be so blazed that I'd pass out whenever worked for me) or whether I'll just be laid awake, staring at the ceiling wishing I was high.

I'm currently going through a difficult situation with moving house, which is accelerating my stress levels even more than usual, and now I'm incredibly self-aware that the one thing I usually turn to is now something I'm trying to avoid.

I don't really know what I'm asking here. Anyone who's past the really difficult part - how was it for you? How did you distract yourself when you feel you've run out of ideas?

Thanks for listening, everybody and good luck on all of your respective journeys. Even if you don't have faith in yourself to get sober, I do.",19

 I've quit multiple times and relapsed because it's been absolute fucking hell gettin off it.

 You can do this. And if you relapse, don't kick yourself over it, just try again when you feel you can and want to. Making that decision and trying in itself is a massive step and I truly believe that first decision and each subsequent one changes your brain chemistry towards really wanting off it.",51

I’m about to graduate college and I’m applying to a graduate program and would like to be sober for that, and even if I don’t get in, I don’t want to start my work life in a haze either.

Any advice or others experiences would be helpful, it just feels like I’ll never be able to be sober.",6

They’re good people and don’t pressure me to “just have one”, they’re totally fine w my decision.  But seeing everyone get loosely goosey made me want to just take one little hit so I could be on their level.  It just put me in such a bad mood I went home and was asleep by 10.

Disc prolapse ~11/12 years ago was the reason I started smoking weed ~10 years ago. I‘m over three years clean now and have more than enough reasons to stay clean, but whenever my back hurts for a longer period of time, my brain loves to tease me...

Last Monday, a whole fkin week ago, I suffered from lumbago picking up my laundry basket...

Since then I’m basically just laying around. Walking and sitting is just not doable for more than a few minutes.

At least it got better over the week (not a lot, but better). Except for today when I woke up worse than day 3.

I wish there was a way to simply replace my useless cunt of a spine and it’s muscles.

It’s my gf‘s birthday tomorrow. I took vacation for the last week and tomorrow + Tuesday to prepare and celebrate with her. Instead I’m just not able to do anything at all. As understanding as she is I know she’s disappointed about me having to see a doctor tomorrow instead of her. Damn sure I am...

In „times like These“ I really miss the effect of not giving a shit about anything from smoking. And that’s stupid.

Moral of the Story: cut ties to your „weedfriends“, or make sure the ones that you keep in contact with support your sobriety. I’m not sure if I could resist if anyone came by offering a bong hit right now.

Learning experience for my self: I get triggered way more by physical than emotional pain. I didn’t relapse when my mom died recently. In some way that hurt(s) more than my back ever could or did.

Prior to that I would puff if it was being passed around at a party. My boyfriend (28M) doesn't smoke at all.  

Lately I feel like I'm in a fog. I own and operate a successful small business.  Although my business is thriving I feel like business isn't running as efficiently as it could.  While I'm at work I am totally sober but as soon as I get home before I do anything, I hit my bong.  When I'm high, I still am able to complete my house work and odd tasks that need to be completed. My problem is I cant think beyond that moment. 

Last night we hosted a gathering at our place.  I had a few drinks but I was mainly ripping bong tokes all night.  We had a good night and I believe everyone had a good time. Reflecting back on the night I realized that mentally I was somewhere else.  

I sat there in space unable to contribute or offer any input into what was happing or partake in conversation.  I was to high. Not just last night, but every gathering with friends and family. I get stoned and then I sit and wait to come down.  This is a pattern, and I'm embarrassed that I'm always that girl in space.  I asked myself this morning ""what is the value in that?""

Today is the day. I want to be better, I want to be here. I want to be relevant!!

There is no moderation when you are a slave to this shit, it's never ""good enough"", and it's the stoned me that realizes that, I have never made efforts towards quitting while sober, at that state it's like I'm not controlling my own body, my addiction does, I just NEED the hit.

I know what I really need is to get away from this dark and blurred part of my life, once and for all, but I'm scared, because the me I'm trusting to solve this problem is the dopamine craving me that will also have to deal with withdrawals, constant reminders of the addiction in my environment, bored and alone, with the fucking lie in the back of my head that it could all be more enjoyable if I gave up.

I quit because my girlfriend was completely checked out of our relationship and ready to move on, but I convinced her to give me one more chance if I promised to quit smoking. 

She doesn’t want to help me quit this time because she’s tried before and stated that she felt taken advantage of. This time it is all my decision and all on me.

It was easier to quit this time than the other times, but I had a horrible day yesterday which resulted in some withdrawals. I was moody and apathetic. My girlfriend and I got into another big fight, and since she was so close to calling it quits a week ago it was easy for her to officially break it off for good this time. We’re living together for the time being, but we’re both in difficult places in our lives and it seems like things have come to a standstill. I am emotionally unavailable to her (and when I feel like I am she says it’s not enough). 

I’m not sure how to feel. Maybe this is for the best. She says she’d rather just cut the dead weight of a boyfriend with addiction than waste her time and maybe she’s right. In a lot of ways I’m dragging her down. 

But I have an overwhelming feeling that I’m making a huge mistake. I lost a lot of opportunities and familial relationships previously in my life due to my weed addiction, and Im afraid I’ve lost the best one yet. She believed in me once, but I don’t even know if there’s a way to get that back. This last week she was distant towards me and it makes sense since she was so ready to end things between us. I don’t know if I can repair this relationship while fighting my addiction without any support, and if I can I don’t know if I want to. If it really is over, how could I find the support I need to quit right now?

Side note: I really believe she is a much better person than me. I think I love her, but the way I treated her is no indication of that. The issue is repairing the relationship is positively draining and my comfort drug is no longer an option.",1

Thankfully, my relapses have been shorter and shorter. My last one only lasted a month of daily, which is good for me. The reason why I quit again is because of my friend and her negative words. She asked me why I didn't have a grinder, and I said that I plan on quitting weed again soon. Her response was a laugh and a drawn out ""sureeeeeeee"". That night, while high, I threw my weed in the garbage, packed up my bong and put it in a suitcase under my bed... I really need to get rid of it, but I have this voice in the back of my mind counting on my failure. 

My friends have always been less than supportive on my quitting journey. But hey, atleast I've managed to quit. I think they just project their inability to even question the thought of quitting on to me and my unsuccessful attempts.

I stopped for a week in March of this year, stopped for more or less a month in July/August and now I'm clean again for about a month and some days since October. 

I've always been afraid of addiction/didn't think I'd get it because I could ""quit anytime"" however my body actually became addicted to it and I've suffered withdrawals. I just felt so embarrassed and disgusted that I even let myself reach such a state. <- why I'm clean (or trying to get clean)

So far, when my days are good - it's amazing. But It's tough as hell a good chunk of the time, like when I'm alone and stressing about life. It makes me want to turn back and stop trying. And it's like fighting a tiger to keep moving forward. 
I kinda want to just get so blazed for 1 night cause I want to run away from problems/thoughts I guess but I also really don't want to start back at day 0 again. I still have a stash just sitting there. All unopened since I quit right before I finished the cartridge I was using. There's no immediate urge or craving for the weed itself - just wanting to run away from myself. 

Are these thoughts just coping mechanisms kicking in due to familiarity or is this also something from withdrawal? If it's the latter, will these thoughts be forever?

I started when I was 30 and now Im 33. When covid made its entrance and I started working from home, I gradually came to smoke every day and also during the day. This is also where I didnt even really appreciate it anymore but it became more of an addiction. Right now Im at that point where Id rather stay home (i live alone) and smoke than go out and do something.

At the same time ive always managed to function relatively well. I am a professor at uni, bought a house, finished a phd, do crossfit 5 times a week etc. 

This week i contracted covid which forced me to stop. I tried to light a joint a couple of times but after 1 tiny hit I immediately threw it away cause it tasted bad and i felt that i didnt want kill my lungs.

In my head Ive been wanting to stop for a while now, but I couldnt set myself to do it. Ive been struggling with depression, anxiety, low self esteem etc. all my life. I have therapy and medication and all that but bottom line I dont like life. Hash has a way of easing my mind. Its the only thing I do like...

I feel that right now might be a good moment to quit since Im off it anyway. Ive gone through the night sweats, vivid dreams etc. The thing is that Im worried about what comes next: the emptiness, lack of joy, anxieties etc that I was dampening with hash. 

I dont know what i want. Or maybe i do but I dont want to admit it to myself. Im afraid and sombre. I could use some advice from you people who are probably going through or have been going through similar issues... i know that people whove managed to quit say that life is better at the other side, but to be honest it wasnt any good before i started smoking either. I doubt it ever will be.

I’ve decided to quit  indefinitely and have been trying for the past several months. Usually around the 1-2 week mark I start to get bored. I get through the worst of the withdrawals, and then I start to miss it. I managed to be highly successful at life while also being high most the time. Because of this, I could always justify my heavy usage.  Many of my interests and identity were formed while smoking weed. Good music, yoga, hiking, climbing, road trips, even studying and meditation were all enhanced by MJ. It helped open my mind and be less judging of others. I have 3 sisters, and my older sisters introduced me to it. Once I started smoking with them, I finally felt like they thought I was cool enough to be accepted. For the next decade, my sisters and I have bonded through passing the bowl around. It was literally part of every activity. Solo smoking became like self care. I was a big fan of rolling jays and appreciating nature or contemplating human consciousness. When times were good or when I needed a break weed was always around. It’s hard to imagine a life without ever having another joint, but i know if I have even one puff I’ll be right back into the thick haze of daily smoking.  My two older sisters have finally quit due to pregnancies. My little sister still smokes daily but somewhat moderates. I’ve always been the overachiever of the bunch, but the biggest stoner of all. 

I’m an all or none kind of person, and I really hope I can continue with none. I suppose I’m just coming on here to express how it’s been so hard to quit because weed has been so deeply woven into my life. It’s a challenge to let it go when it’s been coupled with many positive experiences.",5

Being sober made me realize that my friend doesn’t treat me very well and doesn’t respect me. I’ve been trying to stand up for myself but it’s causing drama in our relationship, and even though I know it’s good to demand respect, I don’t want to lose my only consistent friend. But they continue to send me weed-related memes even though I’ve made it clear that I don’t want to smoke anymore, and gets upset with me if I express any desire to branch out. 
I told them about a painting class I was interested in, they told me it was “lame” that I didn’t want to sit at home with them and smoke while we waste time doing nothing. I don’t mind that they smoke, but I need more fulfillment in my life that I won’t be able to achieve if I’m stoned all the time.

There are some positives: I’m no longer comfortable with complacency, I don’t feel like shit all the time, I got my appetite back, I’m having pleasant dreams now, I can focus at work.

Right now my goal is to make it to the new year, then reflect on my relationship with it and decide then. 

I smoked weed nearly daily for the last 6 years of my life. I did it through a dry-herb vape so it wasn’t massively expensive or unhealthy. I mainly used at night, until the pandemic came and I started using throughout the day. I was always one of those “weed is medicine and it’s better than alcohol” people. 

That lasted for about a year and a half… I guess I felt that it wasn’t even fun anymore. I felt I needed it but didn’t want it. So I quit and here I am. I just felt it making me so complacent. 

I expected it to get easier, but ever since I hit one month, it’s gotten harder. The cravings are worse than they were the first week off. 

I think this is because on day 28 and day 31 I was around people as they did it, and I had to use a lot of will power to turn it down. Then yesterday I received a new piece that had been backordered, and I wanted to try it so bad. I think exerting all this will power is making my cravings worse. 

I just miss it so much. I feel very empty. I am having trouble finding hobbies and social things that fill the void, and it’s hard to try some of them because currently money in my household is very tight. Partner is unemployed, I’m stuck at my job until he finds one.

Before a couple months, I used to only smoke  on certain occasions (once or twice a month). I am in university now and have started smoking everyday. I have tried to stop smoking three times, with the longest break being 2 weeks. But I always end up smoking again. I have always prioritized my studies and spending time with family, though weed has made me careless in my studies and irritable/aggressive towards my family. My parents are immigrants who work hard and pay for all my expenses. Whenever I smoke, I wake up the next day overcome with guilt and later that night cry myself to sleep. Clearly, weed isnt for me. I want to quit and dont buy anything myself. What makes it hard is my roommate/childhood-friend who smokes everyday and lets me smoke with him. l always give in to his offer and the thought of quitting disappears from my mind. He might just be a bad influence or I just cant think for myself, maybe both. I tend to overthink alot and this paired with smoking has made me feel like shit for the past month. I don't have anyone that I could talk to that would understand my situation. I just wanted to ask for tips to prevent myself from relapsing.

I didn't make this post just to tell you I'm 6 months free, it's more important than that, more below, but basically I quit 6 months ago, cravings are still here, but not often, weed used to help me in some creative aspects and to calm my mind down, but it was starting to be a problem as I didn't do anything important that I have to get done. 

&#x200B;

Quitting weed I expected a big change, did not happen, slight change, I find that I can spit out a sentence easier and I talk to random people without issues, my humor is top notch as it always was, I can be the life of the party by simply not smoking. I still struggle finishing and starting tasks, I can't focus, I would say I have ADHD, BUT what I noticed is I feel physically weak, tired, my sleep is still a mess, bad schedule, BUT no matter how much sleep I get I feel tired, short breath most days and light headaches (it's still a problem even tho they're light). So let's stop now for a moment, I know weed is a problem for a lot of people, but what I advise you to do before blaming it on weed is get some health tests done. Why? Because I see a lot of people listing a lot of symptoms and while weed can cause withdrawal symptoms for sure (I KNOW IT because I have a lot of friends that can't quit) I still advise you to get these tests done:

&#x200B;

1. complete blood test, you might be anemic or something
2. sleep apnea (lots of types, restless leg, snoring)
3. diabetes
4. post covid 19 symptoms (some people have chronic issues for a long time AFTER they recover from covid)
5. vitamin deficiency
6. maybe your in the process of quitting sugar or caffeine at the same time (these are serious drugs, especially sugar)
7.  hypothyroidism 
8. maybe you're addicted to tobacco if you rolled tobacco with your joints

I'm no doctor, but I've done some serious self learning ever since I quit and I'm finally getting some health issues checked even though it's so hard for me to do those. 

There is something that might be connected to me feeling psysically bad or it's straight up weed's fault and that is DOPAMINE.

I love my hobbies, but I just don't enjoy them off weed, I don't feel motivated to start, I can't focus, some days I feel ""hyped"" to do them, but rarely. I hope my problems are physical, if I find that I'm perfectly healthy be sure I'm gonna blame it on weed, I'm gonna do it so often I will make sure everyone stops smoking it. Once I get these things done I will update you in a few months time how I'm feeling off weed while perfectly healthy.

&#x200B;

tl;dr yes, weed is a problem, but make sure you are physically healthy first, your health is the most important thing in life

&#x200B;

If anyone wants to know my quit weed app stats:

weed free for 6 months, 21 days

Avoided joints: 101

Grams not smoked: 61.18g

Grams not smoked every minute: 0.00020833g

Total money saved: 244 dollars 

&#x200B;

I know what you're thinking probably ""what? this guy didn't really smoke much"" and you are correct, I never went out of my way to call a dealer, I smoked socially, usually would be fucked up from half a joint, it would take me hours to finish a 0.3g joint, it was slowly starting to become a problem, I wanted to smoke every day, I noticed I don't like it anymore, it makes me anxious, paranoia is not fun (even though it's just deep stupid weed thoughts lol) and I'm 10 times more lazy, sleep is even worse, yes you can fall asleep quicker if you're baked, but you don't get deep sleep, this has been scientifically proven.

Wrong, i immediately went back to being the anxious fuck up that i grew to hate. Started skipping workouts, eating shit food from uber eats, stopped reading books, ignored people hitting me up, and basically killed every good habit i built. The last three weeks have been absolute mental hell. Its like i was finally building the life i wanted, just to kill it immediately. I think part of my downfall was subconsciously feeling that I do not deserve all the good things that I was building when i quit, which is complete bullshit i deserve it all and more. But today is a new day, I threw my stash out, cleaned my room, did yoga and stretched, and now im going to play bball with some old friends. No matter how many times i mess up, i will not give up.

I have felt very motivated to not smoke since then and honestly haven’t missed smoking at all. 
In spite of this, I have gradually started to feel an eager to roll up again, and it gets worse from day to day. I know it would be stupid as hell to start again, but I just can’t shake off the feeling of how insanely high I would get if I just rolled a single joint again.

I'm writing this here to keep some accountability going for myself. I really feel like this time quitting might be different. For one thing I've managed to reduce my intake from 3-5 grams a day to max 3-5 grams a week.

Today started out with me throwing away the rest of my stash. This move immediately made me feel better, which is a bit surprising to be honest. It felt ""right"" and that's an important ingredient in quitting: wanting the right outcome is imperative. Quitting without really wanting it has never worked for me.

I'm hoping that the successful tapering will make some of the withdrawal symptoms less intense. I will report back about that here, in case my experience can be helpful to anyone else. My first time quitting I had the entire list of problems at what felt like maximum setting. Not interested in that this time around, no thank you.

I'm looking forward to remembering to more fully experiencing and remembering my dreams.

Has anyone else experienced this? I tried talking to a GP but they just recommended testing for covid and bad smell can be a result of that. (I've tested and I don't have it - I did have covid a 3 or 4 months ago, and my sense of smell did go, but it seems odd that this would happen months later)

I got a free mountain bike today, it's trashed but the bones are okay, that i plan to turn into a gravel esque bike to go gravel riding with my buddies and I'm super excited because i know I'll likely be able to work on it since i won't be spending that time high. I realize most days won't be like this for awhile, but if i have the promise of these days i think i can handle it. This is much more pleasant than any time i spent high.",6

One thing I have learned through my recovery is that thoughts are just thoughts at the end of the day. My thoughts are not who I am rather just the voice within that makes those thoughts surface. I feel off the horse two nights ago and one thing that hit me like of ton of bricks, was that my brain has tricky way saying its okay when I know in my heart its not what I want. Here’s some things I noticed when I am sober 

- I am more attentive to my surroundings 
- I enjoy feeling my emotions instead of letting my emotions feel me if that makes sense
- I genuinely enjoy myself when I am sober its weird but my body appreciates me taking care of it. 
- I am available when needed in case of a emergency 
- I can communicate better than high
- I have more time on my hands don’t have to plan my next “high”. 

The brian is a tricky thing it will have you thinking that weed will make things better when it does not. I wish more research showed how detrimental the effects of cannabis is and that it can lead to addiction. Hold steadfast in what you believe. It takes a while for your brain to re wire the reward process. Hopefully this helps someone in need, these are just my thoughts. Life is better sober for many reasons just remind yourself of that when the brian is saying yes. Heres to stopping for good. Mary jane was fun , but I learned that life is more fun than being a slave to cannabis. The saying being “high on life” is true. Never again will I give that up for a temporary feeling. We are all in this together. One step at a time one day at a time. A moment sober is better than a moment filled with anxiety.",7

I've been a smoker pretty much full time since i was 16 with a few breaks of a month or two here and there and one break of around 18 months. I was probabably smoking around 1g a day. I had a bit of mental breakdown last winter due manly to social isolation culminating in a panic attack on the motorway and i improved dramitically in january when i quit smoking, sure enough i started again a month or two later when the world began to open up after covid. Recently ive found myself going down that same path getting agrevated by littlr things and decided to stop smoking again.

The physical withdrawl sympons lasted a couple of nights and my appetites returned. I'm falling asleep easier albeit with waking up more often during the night aftet crazy dreams. I'm feeling more present in everyday life, my social anxietys becoming less of an issue and friends and colleagues have noticed me being more confident.

During the working week im busy working 11-12 hour days sometimes staying in hotels as im a subcontractor working 80ish miles away from home and going to the gym a couple of times so i dont have time to get bored. Come friday however i'm finding myself dreading the weekend as i dont feel ive got anything to look forward to.

I eat right, workout 4 or 5 times a week meditate daily but it feels that now my only interest in life is self care and things that benefit me. The truth is however that when i was smoking i didnt have any other interests either just my mind was busy with dealing with anxious thoughts about anything and everything and now these have subsided dramatically im not sure what to do with myself. 

This post is really just a place for me to put my thoughts into words. But unless I can find a way to find some intrinsic value in anything i can see myself back smoking again and having a panic attack on the motorway at 80mph as i did this time last year.",2

I'm (40M) two weeks into quitting after smoking every day since I was 19 and I just don't know who I am anymore. 

I can't concentrate, I can't enjoy much of anything at all. 

I make videos for a living but editing has become the most tedious thing I can imagine without weed. I have projects I don;t know how to finish. I don't even know if I enjoy any of this. 

I can't play guitar, food is just barely palatable, sex is boring, I don't feel any joy whatsoever. Music is pointless and I just want to sit and consume media created by others and not create. 

I've lost everything I used to value about myself. 
I'm getting fat (well, fatter - I have quit smoking cigarettes and alcohol in the last year (and amphetamines the year before), so I'd already put on a few kilograms) and have little to no self respect left. 

I can sleep without any help finally but that is largely because I'd already cut down from like 3-4 grams a day to less than three grams a week a few weeks ago. 

My girlfriend and I just moved to her dad's rental out of town (2 dogs and a rabbit and no rentals anywhere near town) and I've been shit about never seeing my friends. 

I can't see my best friend because she won't even let me hang with him without losing her mind if I even have a single cone a week or so, says I get withdrawals even from one cone a week.

She might be right. I honestly don't know why to get out of bed. I am depressed as fuck, I hate everything without weed. Life before weed was just like this. Always on the verge of giving up, always ready to lay on the couch and endlessly flip channels. Never able to concentrate at school. 

Weed is the only thing that's ever made life tolerable. 

All I do is stare at my computer trying to work but endlessly scrolling. 

TLDR; I hate my life without weed. 

Please tell me this gets better.",128

I’m lucky I have supportive family / friends to talk to, but they don’t quite understand what quitting weed is like.

Lately I’ve been dealing with a sports related injury and have had a lot of chronic pain :( I’m gonna see a physical therapist this week, but in the meantime I’ve been having mean cravings. Like looking up where the closest weed shop to me is and weighing out the importance of my close relationships cravings.  Back in the day whenever I was sore after a workout, or had any kind of flare-up, I would just spark a blunt and totally bliss out.  Just knowing that possibility is out there is so tempting.

I haven’t had urges this strong since I first quit in January 2020, although they definitely came on again when quarantine first started.  I know some people use weed for purely medicinal / pain relief purposes, but even a gram of weed for me is tossing a match at a dry field. There’s a very real chance one gram turns to an ounce and then I get caught up in the momentum of being high all the time.

Just needed to vent. I am hoping some  meditation and gentle exercise will help until the PT starts. Hope everyone’s having a good day.",6

I was just like coasting through my whole life in a cloud of smoke. Kinda letting things just happen and taking no control what so ever. I'm so incredibly ashamed of the person I was and far too many of the things I've done in that time. I could sit here and try and blame my problems on so many truly fucked up things I've been through but it roots back to me and how I have chosen to handle everything in my life up until recently. Today marks 5 days. I haven't smoked weed at all once. I'm quitting cigarettes. Instead of going through a carton this week I've smoked 6 cigarettes and have spent a total of zero dollars. It's been so much harder than I would like to admit and sleeping has been damn near impossible But I'm really happy with the changes I'm making and just the state of myself. I look my best I feel my best and I'm thinking my best. I'm taking action and making plans for my own future. I'm playing a role in my own life for once finally. I know it's not much but these 5 days have changed my life. I can see a real future for myself and it really just fills me with happiness sometimes. In just a few months now I'll have hit my goal and start getting MY own house. That I'll have worked for by myself. Which is something I would have never thought I could be capable of in the past but I know I can do so much more. I'm going to do so much more regardless of what ever life throws at me. I've like always thought something would change but I never did. I don't need a big event or some sign. I don't need a new year because this is a new me! It's never too late for change.

I don't know if I can moderate because I haven't really tried. I struggled moderating before I quit because I felt physically addicted, not mentally, because mentally I always wish I could moderate, but my body needed it for sleep and it was just an everyday routine I was used to. But now that I have broken the routine, my brain thinks I can control it, but I'm scared I won't. I have been successful with quitting caffeine...And now I will occasionally have a cup maybe once a month, and I don't feel the urge to keep doing it.. I don't know if I will be this way with weed and I don't really know what kind of help I am looking for with this post, maybe stories of  experience with being able to moderate?

I really just want to smoke a bowl and relax one night like having a beer, but I don't like drinking because of the side effects.

Partially because of the health consequences (smoking is harmful), but also due to the cost (edibles are very expensive and they are the only “healthy” alternative to the dab pen).
Since the time I’ve stayed sober my anxiety had been drastically reduced. My social confidence had improved, my mood as well. My sexual drive is through the roof. And my energy is practically limitless. I’ve successfully avoided trigger factor relapse (in my case it’s boredom & fatigue). But what’s the most important is that I feel x10 better in regards to the academics. Coffee became an alternative to THC and helps me to have a kick ass mood. So far I’m doing great! I want to let everyone know that it’s much better to stay sober! I feel godlike, I feel like relationship with my family had seen an improvement as well!

Well, here I am. Been smoking for 26 years (started smoking at 14, daily at around 17, mainly hashish), and have never stopped except for the occasional holiday in foreign cannabis-hostile countries (but booze was a substitute). Recently had some shitty moods, feeling depressive, and was an emotional train wreck. I also felt it was sucking the soul out of me.

One of my best friends (hi K.!) introduced me to this forum, and I spent a lot of time reading testimonials that got me motivated to take the step. So I went cold turkey last Sunday evening, today's my 5th day sober. Yay!

So far, luckily, I don't have much cravings, but my sleep is erratic, and I sweat like hell. I spit tar/resin specks when I cough. I feel like shit, but I guess that's the price to pay for detox. I do breathing exercises whenever I think about smoking, and I drink a lot of herbal tea in the evening to calm my mind. When I'm bored, I come here to read some encouraging messages, it truly helps! I thought this would be more painful, but I guess my motivation takes over the bad thoughts. I just wish it won't worsen later, as I read it could take some time to fully heal, with possible downsides/withdrawals... Wish me luck.

Anyways, I had to share this with you. I hope someone would relate and find inspiration to quit, as I did with other fellow testimonials. I'd like to thank you all for the support and love you provide, I honestly think I could not have done that without you. Stay strong!

With love.",14

I only came to the realization that I am addicated when I turned 21 but still I did not take it that seriously then, I thought I could function with it and I could have a healthy relationship with it but oh boy I was wrong. When I look back now I have not really done anything with my life or like my mother said “ I am wasting my potential”. I dropped out of college because I was always so high that I could not even focus on the simplest classes and my grades went down so bad that I was so embarrassed to continue so I dropped out of college and at first I thought this was gonna be a short break from college but here I am after 3 years and I have still not got back, right now I am working a minimum pay job that I am not happy at. I’ve been trying to quit since the last 2 years but to no avail, the longest that I went without weed was 2 months in these 2 years. I seriously don’t know what to do or what went wrong. I can’t even think straight, my brain is always fogged up and there is no motivation for me to even clean my room. I wake up and the first thing I want to do is smoke and my brain can’t function if I don’t smoke and after that I go to work and come home and smoke and the only thing I am thinking about the whole day is when can I go back home and smoke and this cycle has been continuing for so long and I want this to break. My relationship with my family has gone to shit I don’t even talk with them because I am always high. Mental health has gone zero, self confidence I can’t find within myself. I have no respect for myself now and the worst thing is social anxiety. No friends and no circle groups and you know where that leads to (DEPRESSION) and I have this recurring thoughts about suicide which is a bitch. So can someone please help me man.

It's really hard having to face life for what it is again. And if that makes me sound weak, I guess I'm weak.

I'm here to share this humble milestones in hopes to inspire others that are struggling I'm their withdrawals and struggling to get aquatinted to sobriety. This is a long read. Take from it what you want.


In this topic, I will talk about how bad my weed addiction got, what changed in my life to finally make a bigger change with a better chance at sobriety, my first 2 months sober, and my evidence-based advice.


1. Letting my Addiction Control my Life:


I began smoking at 16. It was the first time I felt like I belonged to a type of crowd. For the first time, I was hanging out with groups of people that I thought were cool. I liked how the stoner crowd was into alternative music/art/videogames, walks in the woods, hated school as much as me, and they were generally friendly.


I was smoking multiple times a day (mostly by myself) for 11 years. ""Weed isn't that bad! I use it to sleep, and it helps make work more interesting."" Was my flawed reasoning that enabled me to waste so much time getting high. I did crazy shit to get weed, I did crazy shit to try and moderate weed. I loved getting high for everything, from sleep, to work, to hanging out with friends, to working out, waking up, I found a reason to get high for every occasion. 


I tried switching between moderating and quitting THE WHOLE TIME I was a stoner. The only times I was sober was when I worked a summer camp job (1 month) and even then I was sneaking res hits at night. My coworkers probably knew what was going on. Whenever I tried moderating outside of that, and the quitting lasted between 12 hours and 2 days. The biggest obstacle between myself and sobriety was insomnia. 


I don't want to think about how much money I've spent on it. I'd steal weed from my boyfriends, I'd get high in the bathroom around my brother's kids. My brother was always pissed at me for that. I coughed up tar so many times and would respond by telling myself I'd moderate... Tomorrow.


In 2017, I switched to vaping THC. I thought it helped, but in reality I was getting way more THC than I ever would if I was smoking herb. My tolerance was high as shit all the time. It was so much easier to get high during work. I was still coughing up shit from my lungs. I honestly believe I've invested more THC than Snoop Dogg or Bob Marley. 


I had no idea that I was relapsing every time I went back to smoking weed after taking little breaks. Every time I relapsed, my paranoia and anxiety got worse on the first hit of weed from breaking tolerance. I ignored it, and continued to pave the way through my addiction.


2. The Last Straw: 


My current boyfriend and I were doing ""sober months"" that were very easy for him, harder for me. Last April, I went 2 weeks without weed. I wasn't sleeping at all. Due to my lack of sleep, I made some mistakes at work that I was scolded for. I got so hard on myself I suffered and extreme mental breakdown. I couldn't make it through the sober month. I smoked again, and loathed myself and my addiction for months after that. I went back to normal being high all the time. My boyfriend told me I needed therapy.


I was trying out many different therapists with the hope of focusing more at work and addressing my weed addiction. Many therapists would overlook my weed smoking, saying it wasn't a problem. Hello??? I was wasting so much money on therapists who didn't really do anything for me.


Finally, one therapist listened to me. She said ""Do you want to stop smoking weed?"" I said yes. She sent me the contact information to a local addiction center. After I week, I contacted them. My insurance covered this entirely, it is cheaper than therapy. Of course I will try this. I smoked all the weed I possibly could on the day before I went to this addiction center.


I had no idea what was in store.


3. The Sobriety


I had no idea how serious this addiction center was. I'm an ""out patient"". They deal with alcoholics and drug addicts. I was embarrassed to go here, most of the patients are people who are addicted to much harder drugs and alcohol.


I get drug tested twice a week, attend 2 hour group therapy sessions 3 times a week, and 1-on-1 therapy once a week. It's intense and takes a lot of my time. I have no idea how long I'll be here. I will get formally discharged when the therapists and social workers here think I am ready. This addiction center is helping me beyond what words can describe.


My therapist at the addiction center has me doing intense cognitive behavioral therapy. I have a very low self esteem and lots of negative self talk, like most addicts. This isn't for everyone, but this is what I have to do every single day in order to remain sane and sober:


Mornings: wake up at 4:30, oral hygiene, listen to a meditation for 5-10 minutes, write down 10 positive affirmations, do yoga for 15-45 minutes, get ready for the day, be at work by 7.


Evenings: in bed by 8:30, no tv, no social media. Read a self help book I til I'm tired, listen to the same 2 hour sleep hypnosis video on YouTube. This is the first time in my life I'm able to sleep on schedule. It doesn't work every night but it usually does. 

Weekly activities: I attend addiction recovery meetups in person at least 1x a week. This is usually AA, but I want to try SMART recovery because I do not believe in God. I will have to do 12 step, everyone who stays sober for 10+ years do something similar to that.


I have had the easiest time being sober because of the tools the workers at the addiction center gave me, but there are still a lot of challenges.


Week 1 was the worst. Day 4 was the worst of week 1. I got the worst anxiety of my life. My body was so uncomfortable. My stomach was in knots for days, I lost weight I didn't need to. At work, I had to go to the bathroom and lay on the ground and breath deep. I thought I was bothering all of my coworkers just by being there. I had no idea anxiety could be so physically painful.


The first month in general was good and weird. My energy levels never exceeded 4/10. The smell of weed disgusted me, it reminded me of my lifestyle that I want to move past. Everything seemed like a chore, nothing made me euphoric or happy. I thought a lot, ""Is this what sobriety is? Feeling mediocre all the time?"" No, it's not, it's withdrawals. They last WAY longer than 2 weeks.


I realized one of my closest friends is actually a terrible friend. I blocked her number. It was hard to do but I've got a cleaner mind because I don't have her texting me dumb bullshit all the time. I put up with it because I was high, and any attention was good.


I'm 2 months in now. I don't have any cravings really, but that's only because of how hard I work on myself. I was using weed to self medicate a low ass self esteem. I'm still learning about bad thought patterns that were invisible to me in the past. Weed makes it easy to ignore and to elongate all the bullshit I put myself through mentally. I celebrate every day sober, but I'm not at the finish line. The first few years are so important to create new habits, I'm guessing this will be normal by year 3 or 5. I have to be patient and keep working to progress.


4. My Advice


Of course, take this with a grain of salt. There's a LOT of people on this subreddit who haven't been sober for more than 6 months, we are all very new to sober living. This is the first time I think I have a chance at sobriety, and it's only because I'm doing these things.


Get help from addiction specialists. They know what you're going through and they know how to help. Listen. Find groups of people that are also quitting getting high. Marijuana Anonymous is good, lots of online meetings. This subreddit is good. Read books about quitting weed, they're out there and very comforting in the first month of sobriety. Work on yourself. You need to become an entirely new person if you want to stay sober. Don't drink. It's a slippery slope. The chemicals in alcohol will slow down your recovery process. Fill your life with other people who are also able to have fun sober. Talk about your sobriety with people. Don't count on moderating in the future, it probably won't work. Be vigilant. Even if you've been sober for 3 months, you are still in recovery. Don't be afraid of AA. I'm atheist. The ""higher power"" thing is literally just ""things that are more powerful than you"", like space or the ocean or biology or whatever you want it to be. When most people say ""spiritual"" they are referring to being mindful, living in the present, and being an honest person. You need to work on your mental health in order to stay sober.


Once again, take it all with a grain of salt.


Anyways, I'd be amazed if you actually read this. Thank you for your time. Keep it real.",40

After I ceased medical marijuana in March I became hypersensitive to everything, including coffee, which gave me really bad anxiety. I’ve drank a latte or two every day for years (long before marijuana) without ever experiencing any effect, so it took a day to realise the cause. I was really bummed out. I switched to decaf and figured once the withdrawals were over I’d be able to drink coffee again. I try regular coffee every few months to see if the effect is any different, but it’s sadly not, though the other withdrawal effects settled after a month and more so after two, gone (I think) by the end of month four, though the things the weed was helping with are naturally more of a problem (I took it for ptsd). Kind of concerned it won’t normalise. I miss real coffee! Decaf just isn’t as full bodied or nuanced in flavour. Anyone else had a similar experience? I’d love to hear from you!

Also, might make this point a seperate post, I suddenly became aware of other’s fidgeting and it’s really annoying and anxiety inducing. Probably unrelated but it’s the other thing that comes to mind that hasn’t eased over time like other withdrawal symptoms. 

Thanks guys :)",3

When I first started trying to quit back in august I was certain and determined but after two weeks I had convinced myself that I could be an occasional smoker. I managed that for a little while but by october I was smoking everyday, picking up, etc. 



So I'm at day 1 again and I think having someone else to talk to through the process will help me stick to it. Another voice to help drown out my addict brain when it tells me I can moderate or wait to quit or not quit at all. I'd love it to be a two way street where we can lean on each other for support through cravings, triggers, etc. 



A little about me: I'm nearly 30, im looking for a full time job that utilizes the degree I finally finished getting this year, I used weed to help cope/avoid my feelings related to past trauma (abusive mother and past partners. I have done work in therapy on these but definitely still have baggage to unpack regarding them), I have friends, a sister and a partner who I theoretically could talk to about my weed addiction but they all either wont get it cause they can casually use it or they're just as heavy users as I am (lucky if an oz of flower lasts 3 weeks) but not wanting to quit/think they have a problem. I have a dog. I enjoy board games, DnD, crafty things (bujo, clay, etc.). My goals include regular exercise, a healthy diet (with meal prepping), starting my career in advocacy or policy, and moving (currently in a single room with my dog and the vast majority of my belongings in boxes surrounding me). My longest time not smoking was a bit over 100 days (""proving"" to myself I'm ""not"" an addict pay no attention to the fact I nearly immediately went back to smoking just as heavily as before once I ""proved"" it). And I think my biggest obstacles this time are, dispensaries are everywhere now so deleting my dealers number doesnt actually cut off my supply, I want to stay friends with my heavy smoker friends (I've known them since before any of us started smoking and we have fun playing games together), and I cant seem to bring myself to toss my favorite bong and my grinder (I guess I haven't accepted the idea of never smoking again though I've begun accepting that I lack the self control to moderate myself)

I didn't even foresee that it might happen as I have never been a cigarette smoker. I feel ashamed, and I'm not even enjoying them. But boy am I secretly sucking them down.

I suppose the point of my post, is to seek reassurance that it hasn't undone my hard work with quitting weed, nor taken away from my achievements so far.

Or has it. Has it!? 
What if I get addicted to those instead!?

The problem is that often the joint turns into a weekend of smoking, I still don't smoke a lot but often smoke a bit through the whole weekend or if I smoke on a Sunday, fuck up my week projects with having evening joints during the week.   
It's still enough to not be as productive as I would wish and would need to be. When I'm not productive on the weekend (or nights sometimes) I start my week or day with all the stuff at home I should've done and it piles the stress on.

Everytime I manage a 2-4 week break I feel so much better and am more happy with myself and my life. I just somehow get drawn to the idea of getting ""a break"" from adulting, just chill and not worry. How do I get over this feeling of needing a break from living normally?

It had not only become a tool used to relax but a large part of my personality, all my friends were stoners and I’d often find myself annoyed at how unmotivated we were as a group, unable to go out to anything relatively social because we would rather be comfy and get blazed. 

That is until last summer when everyone went home, I stayed and worked in the city. I had no one around me to smoke with, my stoner buddies had left. While in the past having my own flat to get blazed in all day by myself would have been a dream it turned out to be far more lonely than I expected. I found myself immediately dropping weed in favour of working out or hanging out with friends that weren’t stoners and I began to have a great time. I began to feel less lonely and more connected to the people in my life again, weed was no longer playing a role in my connections to people.

Weed made me comfortable in my small circle of stoners and when they had gone all that was left was the weed which was quite a sad reality. Weed had made me blind to how limiting it can be in both my social life and larger life goals. I’ve taken up more hobbies, become fitter and made new friendships. I even attend my lectures these days 

I do love all my stoner pals and our friendship has proven itself beyond the bud which I couldn’t be happier about. I can still chill and shoot the shit with them like old times but I’ve also got my own things going on now. So I say goodbye to weed for now, you made me into who I am, you gave me great friendships, you were fun while it lasted x",12

For context he has been smoking since 15 and over the last 8 years he has admitted to spending roughly 2 months (in total) of those 8 years not high.

Anyway. We were chatting away and we ended up getting into some sort of debate which lead me to ask him what he did last weekend. 

He replied “There’s no way I can remember what I did last weekend, can you”?

For me this was eye opening. I didn’t smoke as much as him but I could remember what I did last weekend. The fact that he couldn’t remember but said it like I was asking him what he had for breakfast 583 days ago was frankly quite sad.
Also that he wasn’t aware that it is just him that couldn’t remember and expected me to also be unaware of what I did last weekend. 

For me, remembering life is crucial. So you can remember the good times and remember what you have learnt from the bad times. Even just remembering what you did last weekend or something novel.

Anyway, this stuck with me and inadvertently pushed me to quit. I hope it may help some of you stay on course by considering the alarming effects weed has on your short/long term memory.",23

Past times quitting: I couldn't stop focusing on what I felt I was missing. Everything seemed better with weed so I eventually caved.

This time, so far: I'm mostly thinking about and appreciating those things I was missing when I *did* smoke. I keep thinking about it like I'm still a user, but what I'm using is effectively anti-weed (meaning nothing). Every day without weed is, in my imagination, one more day in the experience of my natural ups and downs. I don't feel sober, exactly, because I'm constantly kept interested by the way my brain is changing by the day. 

Movies are *more* interesting when I'm sharp like this. I'm *more* interested in what I'm doing and thinking.

This perspective can't last forever as I'm sure that before long I'll just feel normal again, but so far it's been a helpful tool in getting my foot in the door. I'm *excited* not to feel drawn towards weed in order to proceed with other things I want to do. I may have quashed my feelings and ambitions for years but, man, I never forgot them, not really, and they've started flooding back in and I just keep thinking *holy shit, I can talk to people again. I can focus on something. I don't feel exhausted all the time.*

What's made this time different so far is the fact that I was just fed up with all the negatives of being a stoner. In the past I didn't have much else to look forward to, and thus always went back after a day or two, but this time it's like going on an adventure, and I keep finding new 'relics' in my mind that encourage me to keep going.

I've been depressed a lot too. But I find those moments come less frequently and less intensely the longer this goes on. Even when I was a stoner I was pretty good at self-discipline (and the way I looked at weed was as my single exception to the rule), so the fact that I've laid down the law with myself this time keeps me from agonizing over the idea of giving myself permission to give up.

I dunno, just some thoughts. This subreddit is, as always, super helpful. A couple days before I quit I started reading the top posts here and that helped me to hype myself up, too. Thanks everyone <3 stay strong!",12

I feel as if my emotions are a ball in a racquetball game. Before anything comes out of my mouth I force myself to think about if that's a nice thing to say, I never had that problem when I was smoking all day every day for the past decade. Today's been a revolving door of sadness, anger, guilt, shame and everything in between.

But with that being said, I still got things done. I'm more awake than I feel like I've ever been and have no fear of being in public. I was productive for once! Played guitar, lifted weights, chopped firewood. I could really care less what people think about me right now which is a great change. Right now if I saw an old friend on the street I would smile and say hello but previously I'd turn the other way and hope they didn't see me.

To be honest, I'm not really looking forward to tonight. My dreams tend to be on the not fun side so hopefully they're a bit more joyous than they used to be.

But hey, I made it to now at least. I'm very happy to have found this community of like minded people who are tired of their addiction. It got to a point where weed did NOTHING good for me and it still took years for me to get the courage to kick it out of my life.

It started with fantasy and science fiction novels and eventually blossomed into a full blown obsession with literature. 

I’m now 42 days sober from smoking grass habitually for over 20 years and I’m slowly coming to realize that I had been robbing myself of this simple and essential pleasure all that time. I still read and collected books - well mostly I bought them and left them unread on the shelf - but I was only able to keep my attention focused enough to read a handful each year at most. 

Lately I have been devouring novels again and I’m realizing how much the hazy mental state and constant short term memory loss had cost me. Not having to re-read the page I was trying to focus on because my mind was constantly wandering is such a blessing and it’s something I don’t think I could ever sacrifice again for the simple comfort of getting high. 

When I was smoking it would take me weeks to find the time to get through even a small book and all the time I was reading I was restless and constantly checking how many pages were left in the current chapter so I could finally put it down and go smoke or do something else. 

If you find yourself bored and restless, even if you’ve never considered yourself much of a reader, try picking up a book in sobriety and falling into another world. I know it sounds a bit cheesy but I don’t think any drug could ever give me as much pleasure as cracking a new book and enjoying it cover to cover in a few sessions.",39

I have smoked weed since I was 14, but really rarely, 4-5 times a year. Then I got a job, didn’t smoke it for years and around 3 years ago I worked in domiciliary care (go to peoples homes and provide care) and I was struggling. I was broke, I had no social life, I was so so tierd and lonely and struggling , I had a few mental breakdowns, and lost touch with everyone. 
but I got through without defaulting on rent or bills, I made just enough and I would just go to my mums for food as much as I could, she never knew how bad it was. 

I got a new job in supporting people after they come off drugs and alcohol - fucking ironic I know… you’d think id have really known this would happen lol! - and boom! Covid! Lockdown! End of the world! 

I lived alone, worked alone and from home, was bored but made the best of it! I was dancing around to feel good, doing crafts and doing theme nights on weekends, going out for walks all the time. 

Then I just felt lonely and bored, I couldn’t see anyone. But suddenly I kept seeing my next door neighbour loads, and I knew she smoked weed, I could smell it sometimes faintly. So we got friendly and one day I asked her if I could maybe buy a spliff, just for old times sake. Well, she was a dealer, only small time on the side for extra money. So I bought a ten bag, that would last me three weeks to begin with, I was smoking once a weekend and I was fine. 
That was June 2020. 

Now it’s November 2021, I met and moved in with a wonderful partner, omg I love him, he’s amazing and supportive! His family loves me and mine love him. I have a new job coming up , and I’m so excited it’s going to be great! I’m in counselling and working on my mental health, which is really helping, although hard work. 

And we regularly see my cousin and her partner, which is why I’m here. She also smokes weed so we started doing it together. Maybe once a week on walks. And it slowly crept in to us meeting loads to smoke, and we would both smoke when we weren’t together. 

Please note I never, ever smoke when I’m working. It’s the evenings and weekends. 

So, we come to this evening! I had a panic attack this morning, and have been dodging my counselling , and it’s because I’m anxious and overwhelming myself. I’m tierd all the time and just so unmotivated. Our home is a state I’m neglecting my work. This has to end. 

My partner says he’s supportive but I think it’s effecting him too. 
So I don’t want to have treatment, because it will literally be with coworkers lol, and I’m going to document my journey here. I’m determined not to lose everything.

It wasn’t a pretty sight, very emotional, I haven’t cried like this in years. 

I am taking time off work to grieve, but my live-in girlfriend smokes and I don’t push the no-weed-in-the-house rule because she’s a teacher and nowadays they’re getting a shit sandwich. 

I’ve been sober for about 2 months, I’m anticipating this is going to be a difficult thing to get through without smoking. 

I’m not sure what the point of this post is, maybe I just wanted to jot down what I’m feeling to a community that has helped me stay sober for this long.

Not necessarily motivation to not smoke, cause I'm still very motivated to at least go a week without, then a month, etc. But I mean more specifically the motivation to do anything else with my time. I smoked because I didn't have the energy to do anything, and the weed (+alcohol) made the boredom more tolerable. But now that I'm sober, the boredom isn't tolerable and it makes me get other urges like overspending or just being lazy and laying in bed watching YouTube all day.

I want to do things, but I get overwhelmed so easily which makes new hobbies unenjoyable. I'm a perfectionist, I get enjoyment out of excelling at something but the mere act of doing something ""fun"" isn't fun. I guess I could call it anhedonia, I'm not depressed because I do have hope for the future but I'm just so bored and tired all the time. I've spent so much time putting my life on hold that I don't know how to restart it because if I fail I know it will trigger me to fall back into my patterns.",2

day 4. after 6 1/2 years of smoking with no breaks-i'm not going to lie i thought i'd feel more proud in making it this far. don't get me wrong i am looking forward to getting to day 5, something sounds so exciting about hitting day 5 lol. but stepping into sobriety has reminded me how depressed i've been since a child. it's a part of me i've learned to accept which i think is why i became so heavily addicted to weed. 

my two biggest withdrawal symptoms have been no real appetite, hard time falling and staying asleep and the usual cravings for a hit. which are actually really easy to push away as long as i'm focused on something like a post or video-then it's like i forgot i even was craving it. so that is definitely a good thing!


last night i was experiencing heavy anxiety due to lifes bumps in the road and took an anti anxiety medication which completely took over my system today leaving me in a slight daze so today had little to no productivity which i feel slightly guilty for. i definitely need to get off my phone because the one of only reasons i quit was to improve my quality of life but that's impossible looking at a screen all day and trapped at home. but i remember when covid first hit and we went on lockdown, everyone was freaking out about us having to stay home locked up and for me it was not a hard adjustment at all because i only ever stay home when i'm not working. (i live in the dry hot desert of las vegas where you HAVE to spend money if you want to do something so its hard breaking out of the house) so maybe I'm coming to the realization that maybe it's me who is the problem not the weed. 

sorry for the word vomit but these are my current thoughts during detox. i'm hoping tomorrow feels good and the cravings continue to settle more and more. 

goodnight all!",3

I have lost majority of my friends and I miss how social I used to be. I’m an engineering student and I found myself smoking a lot more than usual at the end of each night. I decided 4 days ago to really make an effort to quit after multiple failed attempts. I cut out the people who I was smoking with and it’s been easier to refrain from using as I no longer see them anymore. I have gathered four of my close friends to quit smoking with and we are all feeling pretty strong withdrawals lol. 

I know I am prone to addiction as a result of ADHD and it’s like I’ve been watching myself fall down a path that I never wanted to fall down over the past 2 years. I wanted to know if any of you guys have any tips on how to manage the symptoms because it’s pretty damn tempting. 

I kind of wanna post a daily update of my progress and I think that posting here every night will help me achieve my goal.

Hello to everyone who decided to upgrade their lives and give up this old habit that drained them emotionally, physically, and mentally! A couple of days ago I made my 25 day post and received a lot of positive messages and comments regarding me changing my life completely! Today I wanted to check in for a month and also throw in some tips that personally worked for me and just some thoughts of what I noticed. 

So far I am using a way to count sobriety days but alsoto calculate exactly how much I smoked and how much money I was throwing away. 

Days not Smoked 31
Grams not smoked 49
Money saved $1,134 USD

Now I want to also say this is just the amount I saved on weed. That doesn’t include fuel I spent driving to pick up from the dispensary and driving to smoke on random trips and spots, money I saved on being lazy and always ordering take out food and fast food and all the overpriced drinks I bought. Here is my approximate guess for the 30 days.

Fuel $150 more or less. 
Food and drinks $500+
Interest on credit cards that I was always using $100 plus.

I never noticed these amounts until I quit but weed forced money out of me that I didn’t even have and was making me dig myself deeper and deeper into a financial crisis. 

I will be posting more on all the other aspects of positive change but I just wanted you guys to see what it did to my finances and that was one of the biggest mental ruins of my life because I would always think about money problems until I fell asleep and from the moment I opened my eyes in the morning. 

Good luck to you all my friends hopefully this will get some of you thinking and motivate some! Let’s keep upgrading our lives one day at a time, we have so much work to do and so much happiness to gain through this journey!",14

Sometimes I forget dreams exist for a long time only to be reminded by a family member about a crazy dream they had.  My heart all of sudden drops at that sentence '' you won't believe the dream I had last night"" it's hurts more then any other negative aspect of smoking weed only because I learned to ability to lucid dream as a kid.

Current state - 36 Male UK smoked since  around the age of 14. Smoke daily that's easily 3-6 joints an evening, never before or at work (in the past yes) some mild use of other things a few mad times i dont feel guilty about tried crack once and thought wtf and never H. I've ended up spending £1400-£2000± a year if not more on weed habit alone then tobacco papers bits and lately more occasionally drink on top must be roughly £3000± habit (if not more) 

It's about the last 7ish years that my actions have started to become more of a substantial problem, never physically aggressive but i puff my chest alot and it's at pretty much everything. 

I know that I'm pissed off with me, i know that I'm going to have to face my self and the selfishness of allowing cannabis to control what I do with my time. I'm going to be aware of how much time I have wasted. The longest gap in smoking was 7 weeks. 

So after lurking here on r/leaves for a while now I'm thinking Day 1 isn't day one, i feel there are things that one really needs to put in place and to do, to really get on a level to confidently execute a Day 1 scenario that will have some success.

I started smoking when I was 15, unfortunately I had a friend who introduced me to it. Since then I haven’t gone over 2 weeks without smoking. It’s crazy to think about now, just how few days of my life since then that I haven’t smoked.
I have attempted to quit several times since then, a couple of which were real legitimate efforts like I’m making now, while others were honestly just bullshit or “t-breaks”. I think a major reason these past attempts didn’t work were because I was in college, and a lot of the people I hung out with smoke.
That’s not the case anymore, the only thing tempting me to smoke weed is myself. It’s strange to me to think of weed as such a negative thing like this. While I don’t think it’s fair to blame anyone but myself, I do think I’ve fell into this societal trap of thinking that weed is completely safe. I know now that’s not true. I actually think South Park had the best explanation of this, in that, sure weed isn’t inherently dangerous, but it makes you okay with being bored and that can be a dangerous thing.
I’m quitting because I need to smoke weed now to feel normal, and yet at the same time, I know that I’m not myself. I want to be myself again.
For anyone that is looking to quit, here are some things I’ve noticed help out:
1. Get rid of your paraphernalia.
Sorry to sound like a cop, but you know what I mean, this is the difference between telling yourself you’re going to quit and actually making an effort to.
2. Distract yourself and reward yourself.
Your brain is pretty simple when you break it down, and it’s seen weed as a reward for a very long time now, you need to replace that reward with a different reward and when your brain is looking for weed as a reward you need to ACTIVELY distract yourself.
3. Remind yourself it’s possible.
There was a time when you didn’t rely on weed, you didn’t come out of the womb with a lit joint in your mouth (if you did though more power to you).
Thank you for providing a place for me to write down my thoughts, I’m not the type to air out my problems on the internet, but desperate times call for desperate measures right?

I was sweating a lot and the nightmares where insane, I woke up drenched in sweat screaming on multiple occasions. I used weed to self medicate work related ptss. And the last few months in combination with drinking, I didn't smoke for fun anymore but wanted to get as ""fucked up"" as possible. I realized this was ultimately self destructive behaviour and decided to quit.


Another reason was starting a new job which I really like, which enabled me to go to work on bike and get some excersize while quitting as well. I also got more involved in new hobbies, mainly wood working and trying Pu Erh teas. The later can get kinda expensive, but is still cheaper then weed. 


I still have difficulties from time to time, where I really want to smoke, as I live in the Netherlands where weed is legalized and readily available in the city I live. I still drink, but cut down to only weekends. I never had a problem drinking untill I started smoking if that makes sense. Maybe because I smoked so much I didn't get the ""desired"" effect from weed as I lived the foggy faded out kind of high where I was completely gone and lethargic.


I don't know if I can keep this up for ever, I know some people may find this unmotivating but it's the truth. Now that I quit smoking I feel lonely sometimes, even a friend to talk to with similar interests seems nice, don't get me wrong I was always a loner, but now I have more time and clearity of mind to think about it I guess. 


I don't want to go through withdrawals again and notice my relationships with family, friends and even my pets have improved a lot. The sweating subsued after a week or 2 and so did the nightmares, they gradually faded into more mellow ""normal"" dreams. So I keep that in the back of my mind. So far I realise that's way more important to me and the people in my close vicinity than just a few hours of being high. I might start smoking again in the future... But not today... Maybe tomorrow.... But not today.

I’m now three days fully sober, and I am just about done my quarantine and I don’t really feel sick from COVID anymore. However I do have increased heart rate and from time to time slight breathlessness. I do usually have increased anxiety when I don’t smoke, or am having withdrawal symptoms and i have pretty bad health anxiety on the regular. I am scared and unsure if this increased heart rate and breathlessness is from COVID or me quitting, or just my regular health anxiety. 

I don’t know what to do. Did you also have shortness of breath and increased heart rate when quitting?

Getting high tends to muddle everything into one experience, which is why it's so hard for us to separate the different emotions we are feeling. I separated my emotions out when I quit and now they each occupy different places in my inner thoughts.

The most effective and motivating emotion I was able to distinguish and define was Melancholy. I gave it it's own scene with its own objects and setting and plot and this is what I have.

There's the kitchen table, and I'm sitting at it.. well not me but more of what I imagined I looked like sitting there everyday after work for 12 years, pipe in my hand. There are no objects on the table; none, just the pipe and i'm holding it. There is nothing in the background or foreground; not that I didn't care to define it but because it appends nothing to the experience. The less there is in the scene the more I capture melancholoy.

I'm standing there sober, somehow just out of the scene and I imagine a cooling sensation coming from behind me, like an open door or a sheer departure from where I am. I don't think about the past or about my time at the table I only think about the version of me sitting there now. ""What am I looking at? my phone? What am I thinking about; is it joyful? Will friends join me around the table? will the scene change?"" I answer those questions in order, 1-by-1 and I repear the answer to myself. Then, once I've asked all the questions and gotten all my answers a funny thing starts to happen. Those answers form a story and it gets sadder the longer it goes. Then I think of the conclusion; and what I get isn't a life event or change of heart I actually get the full feeling of my wasted time at the table. I can feel the hot thick air of the dimly lit living room; I think of the lack of color and light; I think about where the friends that weren't sitting with me were actually at. I start to feel pity and then I start to feel angry at myself and then comes my salvation.

&#x200B;

I don't have to convince that version of myself anything. I don't have to change his mind and I don't have to help him.

I don't WANT to help him.. I don't care about him.

And then I turn around and there are my friends and my car that is broken but i'm looking forward to fixing this weekend. I see a table outside where there are people eating lunch and there's an empty spot. I see sunshine. I feel compelled to ask them if they want to catch a show tomorrow night and then; with a slight hangover of the conversation i just had with myself a say

""Nah don't invite him, he wouldn't want to go anyways"" and then I forget about him and walk though the door.

He'll always be at the kitchen table. How sad.",1

I knew sleep issues were to be expected but this is now taking a huge toll, I am litteraly like a zombie and it's making me doubt whether it's worth it.

People seem to agree that sleep issues don't persist beyond 3 weeks. Has anyone experienced longer withdrawal symptoms and seen the light at the end of the tunnel?

I stopped smoking a few days ago after daily heavy smoking for 6 years. I am 21. When I smoked last, I felt really dissociative and super anxious and like I was in a dream. It really scared me as I’ve never felt that from smoking before; I literally smoked a ton all day. Since I’ve quit, I haven’t even had any cravings to smoke because I am afraid I’ll feel like I did last time. I’m on day 3 and I feel incredibly weird.

My thoughts aren’t making any sense. I can’t stop worrying about small things. I can’t eat. I still feel like I’m in that weird dissociative state I was in when I smoked last and it’s really freaking me out. I know my brain is telling me it’s time to stop but these very weird feelings I’m getting don’t seem to be subsiding. They come in waves. Sometimes I feel really good (still dissociative) other times like right now I just feel very anxious and scared I won’t be able to snap out of this brain fog. It’s actually a really hard feeling to describe through text. It’s really making my mind race and freak out over small things.

It’s been a wild week for me… learning how to manage my time, my emotions, and learning how to seek support. I’ve also been abstaining from cigarettes and alcohol, so I’ve been on edge a bit. The last 2 days have been easier for me. 

Been watching a lot of YouTube on science stuff so I understand how dopamine works and how my addiction physically controls my body, so I’ve been very mindful of ways to get over the hump and start my day

But my roommate started a new job last Monday that means he has to leave the apartment at 5 am, and I know it’s not his fault (we’ve talked about) but this is a reallyyyyy bad time to not be getting quality sleep, especially after working through minor insomnia for the first few days. Construction next door also started last week, so afternoon naps aren’t possible 

I tried running a fan in my room to drown out the noise last night but it didn’t work and I’m up again at 5 am after staying up til midnight and can’t get back to sleep. Then the construction starts in the morning and I give up on good rest 

So here I am with goals I’ve set for the day but I can barely focus. Trying to relax with some Netflix or YouTube but my brain isn’t making enough dopamine so I’m bored as fuck. Im having trouble finding the energy to do anything and it’s aggravating that I can’t be active nor lazy. 

Im not going to use but I’m frustrated that I have to figure out how to feel good about today when I’m worried I’ll just be agitated the whole time and won’t want to get anything done

I don’t think there are ‘benefits’ to quitting, but it does take some shitty things away (constant thoughts about weed, cravings, expensive, bad lungs). I guess it’s good to get rid of those bad things. But it doesn’t automatically benefit your life or make anything better or fix any of your problems. It’s easy to blame weed for being lazy, unmotivated, wasting life. But at the end of the day weed isn’t the problem. If you quit weed and it made your life better that’s great and I’m happy it did. I just wanted to say, for other people who don’t feel that way, that it’s okay, because it means weed is a symptom not the problem, and it’s not enough just to stop smoking weed, you have to try fix everything, weed is just a tiny piece of a much bigger problem.

Cravings were intense, crazy surreal nightmares and cold sweats every morning, a lack of motivation, and a deep anger I could not understand. By far, Day 3 was the worst, but I managed to push through despite the intense anxiety and self-hatred I experienced throughout the day.

Now I am only a few hours from Day 10, something for the past 8 months that I never could of dreamed of and I believe everyone can do it as long as you're working on this problem of ours consistently. Relapse and breakdowns do happen, but to know that you'll move on and learn from them is one of the best tools you have at your disposal. Here's my list of noticeable differences and I hope it can inspire or help anyone who's struggling to reach any milestone! 

* Stronger motivation
* More self-confidence
* Better eating habits (started with one egg each morning and a small dinner)
* Slightly improved breathing
* More focused and larger attention span
* Better memories
* Strong and more vivid dreams / nightmares
* Stronger willpower
* A better method of planning
* I can more clearly envision a greater future for myself
* More fulfillment
* Enjoyment in simple tasks
* Better sleep schedule (This is one of the hardest to maintain, but it has become easier to control)
* More organized work
* Less stress and anxiety
* A better comprehension of concepts

 If you're struggling to quit or suffered a recent setback, do you understand why and where do you stand currently? One of the biggest turning points was understanding my ""shadow reason"" for quitting smoking and maybe through some discussion, we can help each other out in some way!",13

I’ve just replaced weed with a shitton of sugar, fast food, alcohol, energy drinks, and YouTube, and I honestly just feel super lost. The main reason I quit was so I could do better in uni and not waste all the money that I’m spending for my classes but I can’t seem to stop replacing old bad habits with new ones. My grades are worse than they’ve ever been. I’m failing my classes and I think quitting weed just made my emotional reaction to that worse because I can actually feel.

The reason I’m posting this is because I want to see if anyone has experienced anything similar or has any advice. 

I don’t want this post to discourage anyone thinking of quitting because it has still helped me a lot and there’s no way I’m going back but I guess I just thought that quitting would have a bigger impact than it did.",16

For the first 4 months of the year 1/2/21 - 4/20/21 and then I started to slowly go back to using “only with friends”. Then somehow back in may I was able to get a GF for the first time in my life. I eventually told her about my problem w/ weed and how I “stopped” and she was so kind, accepting, and firm about how she was proud of me overcoming it. Then some time in July I started to spiral back into smoking not just with friends anymore but by myself. From wax pens to edibles I’d buy them and hide those things from her until she caught me. The first time she joked about it but saw the way I was lying about it and knew it was a problem. She has trust issues from her past Ex’s cheating on her and didn’t appreciate the lies I made in order to hide my addiction. She thought that eventually I’ll start lying about other things like if I’d cheat on her. I made a promised to her that I stopped but in the end it was just a lie I told her and myself. I’m typing this today because I was just caught for the 5th time just before our 6th month anniversary. Each time I was caught/confessed I saw the pain in her eyes and it killed me. She saw the man she loves fall back into addiction and lie about it multiple times. This of course killed the trust she has in me about my strength of being sober. It made her scared that I’m lying about other things that would hurt her and it tears me apart. However I absolutely fucking love this girl. The way she laughs is so real and genuine it makes me giddy inside. Her smile and kind words of encouragement remind me of the greatness I am capable of. Our friends and families love both of us and want to see us as a pair each time there’s a party or gathering. And her inner strength from overcoming hardships that I cannot fathom surviving myself has my admiration to where I look up to her as an example of what it means to be a pillar of strength in our own communities. Somehow she see past my faults and loves me for who I truly am but now she’s hurt and guarded. All because I couldn’t be honest to myself and her about my weed addiction. I fucking hate that I’m in this position again but this time I’m dragging down the first person to truly love me for who I am. I wrestle with the thoughts of just sneaking away and buying some weed to get high everyday. But I don’t wanna lose the person who means the world to me. She’s my best friend. Idk bro I’m just sick and tired of always wanting to get high and hate myself for hurting those close around me. I wanna be strong enough to face reality sober.

2021-11-09 20:06:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qqi9y9/day_101thoughts_and_benefits/,Day 101…..thoughts and benefits,"Hey Everyone, wanted to check in with some details on my journey and experience since I have hit 100 days. It is the least I can do for a community that has helped me through some hard times and gave me the motivation to keep going. Background for context, I smoked pretty much everyday for 10 years straight only stopping for a few months in that time for t-breaks and drug tests. I also had many failed attempts at stopping but this time I promised myself that it truly needs to be the end. I am quite proud of making it this far but I know I still have a long road to go. Below are some of the benefits that I have personally had.

Benefits:

1. More restful and peaceful sleep. Also I have been able to get in a nice sleep schedule.

2. Noticeably “healthier” breathing and lungs.

3. Less extreme emotions.

4. More self confidence

5. Stronger belief in myself along with less negative self talk.

6. Better workouts

7. My personal favorite…..huge decrease in social anxiety. I actually have a desire to meet new people and build relationships.

8. More focused on building a better future for myself.

9. Stronger connection with others. I feel like I am naturally being more genuine and caring of others problems/needs.

10. More positive mindset in general. Strong desire to succeed.

There are even more benefits I have experienced but I won’t make this post too long. Only cutting weed out has not gotten me to this point but it has been a huge catalyst. I have greatly reduced my porn intake and been on a consistent workout routine since quitting. I try to also listen to positive audiobooks and YouTube content. By no means am I perfect, I still like to drink with friends and have a good time but overall I am focused on building a positive and healthy life for myself. The last thing I’ll say is……I know how hard it is at the beginning mentally and physically. If you are reading this I want you to know that you are already on the right path even if you haven’t stopped yet. I believe in you and so does everyone else on this sub. You can DM me just to BS or talk about quitting and I would be more than happy to chat. Finally, thank you to everyone here. You don’t know how much this has helped me.",22

I’ve been reading these posts for days and all of them have helped me. But I wanted to share my story.

I’ve been a daily smoker for the past 6 months. My parents are both chronic smokers, my mom has been smoking every day since she was 13. She doesn’t believe weed is addictive, and thinks it’s the cure to everything. I believed her, at first.
The reason I started smoking in the first place was because I’m a transgender man, and I went through a lot of gender dysphoria. Picture it like a constant demon eating away at you, telling you you’re never good enough, holding you back constantly from everything you are. Not too different from weed withdrawal, I suppose. I wanted to escape from that.
And it worked wonders at first! I felt more like myself than I ever had in my life. I was absolutely ecstatic where I’d usually be crying and depressed, and life was amazing, even for just a short while.
However, that changed when I managed to get medicated for my dysphoria. Once getting on testosterone, those problems went away. I started feeling good and happy about myself without the need of weed! But the addiction to weed stayed. In fact, it only got worse.
I guess I wanted to reward myself for the lifelong suffering I’d endured, and my parents were always offering me a joint… I began waking up and smoking every 20 minutes to an hour. I couldn’t possibly tell you the amount I smoked… Up until recently, I couldn’t even tell you the last time I’d been sober, either.
I quit four days ago. I said i’m done. I’d overcome the reason that I started, and that problem was pretty much out of the woodwork. I felt like I found myself, so why bother anymore?
But now withdrawal symptoms are kicking in. They haven’t been nearly as bad as my previous problems, but reading all of the horror stories about PAWS scared the shit out of me. Seeing poor people go through weeks, months, and even years of extreme anxiety and depression makes me feel like I’m going back to where I began again… somebody lost with only regular depression and anxiety as their friend. I’m going back to college in a couple months, and having my grades drop from something like that would be the last of my wishes right now.
Be honest with me. How long does it really take to get better?  Will I actually reach this unfiltered, natural happiness people describe? Or is it a useless endeavor? 

Thanks guys. You’re all champions. Every single one of you.",7

But for the last 6 years it’s felt like a continuous bender that needs to stop. I’ve tried to use the weed as a way to stop drinking and smoking cigs, all that happened was another thing that entered the party. Every day after work I either wanted a drink or weed, sure time to time I quit but they all kept coming back. I’ve found myself making excuses, lying, rationalizing my habits. I’ve been selfish, not present, my kids are getting older, I can’t play off my habits. My wife is always pissed and yet has also absorbed my bad habits as well.  My late 20s post military fun has blended into my early 30s and I don’t know where the time went. I don’t want to look at 40 thinking the same things.

And oh boy, some nights I would eat enough sweets for a whole family.

I am 15 days into quitting and one of the huge benefits is that I have absolutely zero interest in eating sweet stuff. I still enjoy a diet soda here and there (not even everyday!), but as far as candy or other sweet treats go I have zero craving or desire to have even a normal serving. Sweet shit just doesn't sound good anymore. 

I am trying to get fit so I see this as a superpower. I am hoping that this will be a relatively permanent thing as I rebuild my diet and start eating lots of veggies everyday as well.

Other aspects of quitting have not been so nice, like the sleep issues, mood swings, depression and irritability. But I will take this win and happily go about battling my demons. I look forward to finding other ""superpowers"" gained from quitting cannabis. 

What superpowers have you gained since quitting?",1
2021-11-09 17:07:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qqemh4/accept_and_plan_for_the_known_and_unknown/,"Accept and plan for the known, and unknown","When I quit weed for what I'm working on being the final time, I had probably a half a dozen previous attempts from which to gain knowledge. Additionally I had read forums and groups such as this and whatever literature I could find on what to expect.

Every other time there were always excuses: I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, my mood was shitty, I've stopped for long enough that a little now won't hurt. You name it and I used it for an excuse to get back on weed.

One of the early attempts was foiled because I felt that after two weeks, if I still wasn't feeling well then I guessed that is what sober life must have been like. I reckoned that if that is what being sober felt like then I didn't want any part of it. That was a great excuse to get back to weed because you know what happened after I had some? I felt better. I felt better until after a few weeks or months when I had reached my old quantities and wanted out again.

On other occasions I had started again because I felt one nights sleep was more important to me than stopping right now, or being able to enjoy a meal because I hadn't allowed my body enough time to heal and get through withdrawal. I was able to eat, and I was able to sleep after I smoked but again, a short time later I was back to my old usage levels and wishing I could stop.

Overtime, through learning and through my experiences I recognized that there were a lot of things that would be working against me to stop. It wouldn't take weeks, and maybe not even months, but it maybe be a year(s) before I completely felt better. There were a lot of things known to me that I could prepare for. I also anticipated some unknowns, that turned out to be things such as headaches and requiring naps to be able to function properly.

It always took a lot of thinking and mind churning before I would build up the moment to stop once again. I also knew that the momentum and courage that it took to quit didn't come around too often so when it did the next time I needed to be prepared, and to take advantage of the momentum.

I've accepted that I'm a weed addict, and likely an addict to any intoxicating drug I could choose to put in my body. I know that, without question, any amount of weed will eventually send me back to where I began no matter how sure I am that I am ""better"".

I know and have accepted that life will be difficult and stopping weed won't end all my problems, nor will using weed solve any of my problems. In fact through experience I learned that weed only creates more problems. I don't like problems. Logic tells me that weed will not be part of the equation should I want to have fewer problems.

Lastly I knew that I was obsessed with weed and the obsession needed to change. I literally used mental redirecting techniques to turn my thoughts to something else whenever the topic of weed would come up internally. My mind was made up that I was quitting so why would I want to let my thoughts toil around weed when it was something I was leaving in the past? I stopped thinking about it, at least intentionally. The automatic thoughts of weed would come up, of course. Like after a hard days work, or when I thought I could use some to deal with physical pain, or if it was a rainy day and I just wanted to veg. Those were thoughts I had conditioned myself to think due to decades of routine. I accepted I would have those thoughts and that they *didn't mean anything* other than old patterns showing up.

With some effort, time and determination I did leave weed behind me, at the age of 41 after smoking daily for about 25 years. I'm a different person now because of it and without weed in the way I have the wherewithal to point myself in the direction of my choosing with a much higher level of confidence.

I had 2 kids and still kept smoking, even though I said that I would quit.

I have quit before, one time for 8 months straight. But I always went back to smoking.

I promised my wife that I would quit this year. I did quit for 3 months, fell off the wagon around my birthday, quit again for a few weeks... and then both my kids went to school. I had all this free time to myself and started smoking every day again. My wife caught me smoking and was absolutely furious with me. I wasn't too proud of myself either.

I want to quit, I do... but I keep going back to it. I don't really drink alcohol and I don't do any other drugs, so for the longest time weed was the only thing I wanted to do. It's the only thing that relaxed me.

I think my biggest worry is that I feel like I won't ever enjoy things as much if I am sober. I was one of those guys who likes getting high before everything (eating food, watching movies, listening to music, playing video games, etc) because it was more enjoyable if I did. I am afraid that no matter what, I will always have the longing to get stoned and I will always weaken eventually. It sucks.

I finally admitted to myself that I am an addict. I need to quit, but I still have that small voice in my head saying, ""Just smoke one more time. Just once more."" I quit for 3 days recently, smoked one night, and am now at 2 days without smoking. 

It's not easy, so any advice or support is very much appreciated.

I kept making excuses, like waiting until a certain stress trigger or other was over, but it was never going to be the right time, so last week I decided I was going to quit when I ran out of my current weed. Which I eventually did on Sunday night. Unfortunately, i seem to have injured my knee or hip (or both?) at some point either on Saturday on Sunday. The pain is intermittent, but has been excruciating for a few hours at a time, leaving me in tears and writhing around on the couch. My doctor can’t get to me until next week and is only doing phone appointments and the whole thing is really stressful. 

But I didn’t smoke. All I’ve wanted to do is smoke the pain away, but I feel like this time I have finally reached a mental place where the desire to quit smoking is stronger than the cravings. I’m really proud of myself, even though it’s still less than 48 hours since I quit it feels like this one might stick. The pain is making it harder, but it feels like my resolve is much stronger than it has been in the past.",6

After almost 1 ½ year of working for you I decided that my time has come. I was deeply in emotional debts when I first met you, you promised me the best in the world, a way to get out of it, a way to counter those problems as if they never existed, a way to be me again, the real me. You were an amazing person at first, I venerated you as a God, so thankful for this amazing opportunity. 

Unfortunately, this opportunity never came.

Working every day for you has been an error from myself and I deeply regret that we couldn't develop an healthier relationship together as I realized too late that you were only selling me an utopia, an impossible future. I should've read the contract way better and research your company, I only saw the good salary and quickly jumped in. But you stripped away all my privileges, I never talked to my coworkers, I never engaged in the workplace activites, it affected my mood and sometimes I was doing way too much overtime. I now have worsen ADHD, anxiety and depression out of it, killing me as who I am, a free man, not a slave. All your loyal employees aren't willingly working for you, you simply own them.

Mr.Alcohol, Mr.Cigarettes and Mrs.Vape all tried to contact me, fortunately I refused each one of them knowing you were all the same, working for the company Drug Inc., just different subsidiaries.

Working for Mrs.Sober has been the best thing i've done, it made me realize how abusive you were. At least she understands me, she helps me understand the long-lasting negative effects your company imposed me. No utopia, only the reality. See you in a very far future, or never.

&#x200B;

Today marks 30 days since I last smoked weed. At this point, it has been about 4 years since I've taken a break that lasted this long. Only breaks I've had over the past 4 years have been during small vacations lasting upwards of 2 weeks.

&#x200B;

I think most of us smoke for a number of reasons, I know for myself, I've had a plethora of them, ranging from stress from being a closeted man until I turned 25, living in the south, to dealing with rejection and relationships. I've always found comfort in weed, its allowed me to self reflect, and change my mind on things that I had tunnel vision on otherwise. Its allowed me to laugh and think introspectively. I now realize too that it had helped my body relax as I had postural issues from swimming competitively and being a computer gamer growing up. I feel the need to share this as I feel like its now being reflected on as I've been detoxing.

&#x200B;

I decided to quit smoking weed after having a physical confrontation with my long term boyfriend of 5 years (it involved pushing and screaming, no hitting). I knew at that point, in the fear of losing someone I love dearly, that the fight had been a result from me wanting to get home to smoke my bong. After an incredible night seeing a comedy show, we had gone to the bars afterwards to have a drink, my bf wanted to be spontaneous and 1 drink turned into 4, and I was getting more and more agitated the longer we stayed, because all i really wanted to do was to get home and smoke. I knew deep down that this was the root of my anger.

&#x200B;

In the fear of losing my relationship with my boyfriend to weed, I was left with only one choice, to take responsibility in my actions, not to blame it on weed, but rather on myself for allowing myself to abuse a substance that in truth had helped me greatly in the past.

&#x200B;

The past month has been a mixed of emotions and this detox has been really strange for me, it feels as though I was in a committed relationship with weed, and as I broke up with it, I truly mourned that loss. In the first week, I found myself crying every day. Small things would trigger these tears, and it would come out in an ugly crying way. This to me has been the most surprising outcome from quitting. I broke up with something that had supported me for so many years.

&#x200B;

I feel nervous at times, I sleep in full sweats to prevent me from soaking my bed as I am sweating quite a lot. Even on day 30 the sweating continues. I am genuinely curious how long its going to last this time around. 

&#x200B;

My appetite has luckily been strong, having been a long time smoker, I had developed a rather systematic way of smoking, smoking almost exclusively at night. In reality I did this because I enjoyed the feeling of blissful stonedness. I enjoyed feeling the maximum affects of the substance and I've smoked long enough to know that the first hit, hits the hardest, hence why I saved it for the nighttime. Because I had developed such a specific way of smoking, as I quit, the biggest side affect of not smoking being the loss of appetite, was escaped on me. I had quit daytime smoking many years ago, mostly to maintain my relationship but also to have a stronger appetite.

&#x200B;

Ironically, I care a lot about my wellness and over the past 8 months, I have developed a paranoia of the negative affects the substance was having on my body, from stomach issues, to chest tightness, to throat irritations. These fears helped contribute to my realization of needing to walk away for a while.

&#x200B;

Although I physically feel better, I still find myself missing weed, so much. I am still insecure in my relationship and I feel at times alone and a bit scared. Some days I'm happy and motivated, and other days I want to seek asylum at my parents place (who live far away). I think that I might have been hiding from my future by smoking, and now that I cannot smoke, I still wish to hide, and I am unsure what the future looks like.

&#x200B;

I appreciate that this space exists to allow myself to cope in a community. I do not expect any engagement, I just simply wanted to get some of these thoughts and feelings off my chest, as today is a day I am faced with profound sadness. I am generally a really nice and happy person. Someone who choses to smile when things are hard, because there is no reason to linger on negative thoughts. But today, like the first week, I feel the need to cry. I hope this unstable feeling passes, I am sure I'll find my way.

&#x200B;

So as we all know when you smoke and go to sleep you don't dream and since I've quit I've not dreamt until last night where everything was ramped up to 11. Firstly as I was slipping off into sleep I felt something tap me which kinda jolted me awake but sleep quickly took over again, I then heard my aunty & uncle call my name which led to me half mumbling, half clearly saying something to see if they were there. Then the dreams kicked in, I had 5 separate dreams but all of them involving the same activity of me and someone I knew (in one case a friend I haven't seen in ages) crossing snowy terrain. It was actually quite enjoyable besides the spooky tapping I felt also I'm still suffering from night sweats, just wondering if anyone else does.",1

With that in mind, today marks my 5th year without cannabis!

I also wanted to use this post to reassure anyone who might be struggling - stick with it, you are in the right place. Sometimes the road to recovery can feel long or even impossible, but this community provided me with a vital support system when I first tried to quit and I cannot thank u/subduction enough for setting it up. It has been, quite literally, a life changer.

Do I still have hard days? Sure. But all in all, I can honestly say that the urge to smoke rarely crosses my mind anymore. I may feel the occasional nostalgic twinge when I see an old friend, or catch a whiff of it on the street, but I have genuinely no desire to go back. If anyone reading this currently feels like it's taking all of their strength to simply get through the day without lighting up, I'm here to tell you that it WILL get better. Believe me, I've been there. It took a lot of work and persistence, but I'm thankful to be in a new phase of my life where my stoner days have begun to feel like an increasingly distant memory.

Sobriety (I am also 3 years clean from alcohol and 2 from nicotine) has given me the tools to truly work on myself and, although I still have my struggles with mental health, I no longer use weed as a crutch to avoid/ultimately compound these struggles. Although giving up wasn't the absolute solution to my problems, it was definitely the first step in identifying and engaging with some healthier coping strategies. Removing weed from my life afforded me the clarity to truly know and understand myself. Although I didn't always like what I saw, I was able to use it as a jumping off point to enact some other positive changes in my life, rather than hiding behind a veil of smoke. In short, I would say that the rewards of giving up are endless. The rewards of continuing to use are limited by how much is in your bag.

Much love to this community as always - you can do this!",17

When i was smoking i did not care and knowiñg this job was what i wanted i just kept being optimistic about my future. 

Now instead as i keep wondering about future i feel pike i had to choose something bettere in terms of stability to study instead of what i thought would be a job i loved.

This also makes me compare to many people that have stable jobs. Before i felt i was lucky. Now i am suffering because i shiuld have go to that road maybe even if i do not like it.
 
I am sure that not smoking has changed this a little. As if since i was high all the time i simply lived doing ehat j love as jobs and not worrying about future, or knowing i will handle it.

Now it is just a depressing thought full of anxiety and uncertainity.

I surely do not want to go back to smoke weed, but same time i feel like shit.

Everybody adored her, thought she was chill and amazing, because she was witty, knew how to sing, was successful in school, really friendly and beautiful.

I was watching videos on youtube similar to those of Wiz Khalifa in a jacuzzi teaching you how to roll, so I became obssessed with the idea of smoking weed. It just happened that Mary had connections and I asked her to get me some. She said it was not a problem and arranged everything.

After that I smoked so much, that my memory started to become bad, my grades started to drop and I was just a shadow of the nice, funny, smart self, so at the middle of the 9th grade I decided to stop and the results were fantastic.

 I got into the best highschool in the city where I unfortunatelly met people similar to me, so I thought we had a connection, because we can smoke weed together.

I spent my entire first year blazed, we went to smoke inbetween the big pause from 10.15 - 11.10 and we were high while in school. I love knowledge, but my weed memory couldnt satisfy this need , but before I realised this I was already in college in 3rd year.

After seeing an old friend after a long time - who stopped smoking after the first year -  and not being able to hold a conversation with him, because I had nothing to talk about, I decided to stop smoking weed and make myself someone I can be proud of.

I havent been smoking for 3 weeks now and I have read 2 books, been enjoying my degree and started to have actual fun in my life.

My username ""dehajbat"" is sleng in my dialect for ""smoke weed"". This is also something that made me realise that I have made weed my character.

I am done.

2021-11-09 05:33:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qq0wlz/day_1_dealing_with_the_detox/,Day 1: Dealing with the detox,"I read a post last week that said something along the lines of: You've quit already, you just need to deal with the detox. This was a turning point for me as it led me to realize that I had indeed mentally quit years ago. The only thing holding me back from actually not smoking weed was the fear of the detox. Reading this post was a real gamechanger for me, one of those moments where all the puzzle pieces fall into place. 

I had been building up to 8th of November as my quit date for weeks by cutting down use to 3 joints a day, then 2, then 1 over the course of weeks. Unfortunately the last 2 weeks some personal events happened that I used as an excuse to smoke a bit more and regress into other unproductive habits. I felt like I had to do another week of 1 joint a day, only in the evening after I've accomplished all my goals for the day. Did not always follow my rules but even setting them helped me smoke less and be more productive throughout my day.

Cutting back is hard for addicts and I know many addicts prefer quitting cold turkey because they do not trust themselves to cut back. Cutting back is basically spreading the withdrawal symptoms over weeks/months instead of taking them all on from the moment you quit. I've had succesfull 90+ days periods of sobriety from doing both. Do whichever works for you. 

Tried cold turkey but the sleeplessness/nightsweats/anger was too heavy? Might want to try cutting back. Tried cutting back but kept on breaking your promises and using more? You might have to deal with heavy withdrawal. Pick which one is best for you. And remember that even if you decide to cut back and fail, this can still be a part of your recovery process. I can't tell you how many times I've tried to quit before I had my first successful 90+ days. And even on all of those I eventually relapsed. This time I hope to be here for the long run though. 

I gave myself a full week off from all responsibilities. Eating clean? If I want to. Working out? If I want to. Playing video games literally all day? If I want to. Eating take-out? You got it. I can do all those things for a full week as long as I just don't pick up the devils lettuce. Besides, every dollar I spend on getting sober I will make back a hundred times at least. Wanna know the fun part? My natural state of living sober is way healthier and more productive than when smoking. I do not crave as much takeout and videogames when I'm sober. I don't have to push myself to go work out when I'm sober because my body practically BEGS ME TO GO. 

I did not allow myself to think about the weed and romanticize it. No hesitation was allowed, just a big NO. I have weed, tobaccy, papers and roaches in my trashbin still, but I did not touch them yesterday. The only reminder I will keep from my smoking days is a grinder my sister once gifted me. And I guess the phlegm I'll be coughing up for at least the next few weeks. And hopefully, in some twisted way, overcoming this addiction will make me a wise person, aware of my needs and flaws, and not afraid to communicate those to my surroundings.

I'm ready to start building the life I want. For this next week the primary focus is on not using, the rest is bonus. From next week on I will slowly but actively start building.

This post really hit home and made me realize that I had mentally checked out of smoking weed years ago. I did not want to smoke anymore nor did I envision a future in which weed would play a part. I was barely going through the motions because (1) I thought I needed weed (2) I am addicted (3) I did not dare to face the detox. None of these are good reasons.

On the other hand there's plenty of good reasons not to smoke and all of you probably know them. My foremost reason is that I want to grow. Physically, mentally, and in plenty other ways. Weed used to be a tool for calming myself and self-reflection. However I can (learn to) handle my natural energy flows and I'm way better at self-reflecting when sober. Weed used to be a tool to escape my negative feelings and the world in general but I want to experience my negative feelings and can use other tools to escape the world. Tools that don't cost me money, mental, and physical health. Movies, games, gym, conversations, music. All from the safety of my room; I do not need weed to feel safe and escape from the world, not when I'm sober at least.

I used to feel anxiety when thinking of never smoking again. Now I feel hope, strength, calmness, and connection to the universe. I've been addicted for a long time and know it will take a long time to rewire my brain but I'm willing to accept that burden. That is the price I'll have to pay for living the life I want to live. Hopefully I can right some of my karmic debth by helping some of you through my posts.

I've proposed a trade to the universe: I will stop smoking weed and in return I want the possibility to work towards my goals and achieve things I work towards. So far I've held up my part of the trade. I'm sure the universe will hold up its part aswell. 

I do not believe that weed is necessarily a bad thing. Some people can use it ocasionally and without problems. I do believe that many people, perhaps more people, can not use it ocasionally and without problems. Chances are that if you're reading this you fall in the latter category. You can build a better life without weed.

Thank you for your time reading this and good luck!",6

but man it was just a fighting battle between me and myself today, ""ok maybe i can moderate this"" ""how many times have you said that?"" ""but i'm so uncomfortable just a little to help"" ""that's what you signed up for when you decided to quit"". all day back and worth but never gave in! 

yesterday was day 1-i was much more productive. but today i really only stayed in bed all day with the exception of picking up my car. 
I had strawberry yogurt for breakfast which was easy to get down and I've heard yogurt can coat your stomach which helped with my regular stomach pain that weed usually fixed. for lunch I had some chicken noodle soup and applesauce. honestly every time I had a craving to smoke I tell myself to eat or come on here, lol. maybe some advice for ppl struggling to get things down. I only used to smoke then eat so now I'm just taking out the smoking part (half the time the weed hadn't even hit my system enough for the munchies to kick in and my body would want to just eat.)

I even made a order on my local dispensary didn't even make it halfway down the street because the idea of starting day 1 over pains me. I drove home and called my boyfriend to distract myself from the craving. I know I should be super proud of that but honestly I just cried after, I can really tell how much I've been self-medicating for my depression and although I do see a psychiatrist I'm realizing how much talk therapy I need. 

i have work tomorrow and i am kind of looking forward to the distraction, i am hoping for a smooth shift. 

it's funny because I will definitely go through weird mood swings of being very motivated to quit and stay consistent and then small but heavy moments of wanting to give in and smoke. 

i've been posting quite a lot on the sub which i hope isn't a bother but the sub has really been getting me by when I can't break the mental cycle of ""fuck it"" ""wait no"". I am very appreciate of this community of people
and the leaves discord (just wish there was more time in the chat haha) 

i wish you all a safe and comforting night, i hope you can get at least a little bit of sleep haha. happy dreaming :)",3

Well not long after, I started throwing up, and didn’t stop throwing up until there was blood. I went to the ER at 3am, was released around 5am, and had to call 911 again at around 3pm because I was vomiting blood again. This was the worst experience of my life.
Doctors say it’s most likely cannabinoid hyperemesis, which sucks because they suggested that to me a year ago, but I ignored it and convinced myself I was just sick from the traumatic things I was going on at that time. Looking back, I wonder how different my life would be if I stopped smoking back then. It’s been a whole year of smoking daily, and nothing good came from it, and now I was rewarded with this horrible sickness.
But I’m actually glad I found this group so I can talk about this journey. No one in my family knows I smoke, and my friends all smoke care-free, so no one can really relate.",7

I started smoking weed at 15 years old and by my 16th birthday I was indulging in it multiple times on a daily basis. This habit continued throughout the rest of high school and only worsened over time. By mid junior year I was high all the time if I wasn’t in school or playing sports. Fast forward to the summer after I graduated and by this point I was smoking weed from the time I woke up to the time I went to bed. It would usually be on 1-2 hour intervals and totaled around 1-2 gs per day. This habit of smoking has stayed with me from then until around 6 weeks ago when I decided to quit. I’m now 24 years old

Around 6 weeks ago I decided it was time for me to quit. Weed wasn’t making me feel the way it used to. I became anxious every time I smoked. I began noticing just how bad my long term memory had become and wanted to do anything I could to improve it. I became much more aware of my cognitive abilities or lack there of. I did not feel as sharp as I knew I used to. I used to be able to learn and remember new information much easier. I knew that I couldn’t keep smoking weed if I ever wanted to feel like my old self again.

It’s now been 6 weeks and I’m extremely scared that I permanently changed my brain for the worse. I know it takes longer than 6 weeks for recovery after such a long time, but after reading into marijuana abuse on adolescents I’m afraid I’ll never be the same again. I’m afraid I ruined my ability to retain and learn new things. I think I smoked too heavily for too long during a crucial development period. Every day I’m pissed at myself for spending so much time prioritizing instant pleasure with no regard towards my future or brain. The thought is fueling my depression and anxiety. I’m really considering suicide. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to get over this and be okay living with the consequences of my actions. I want to stay sober and try to do everything I can to improve, but what’s the point if the damage is already done.

I’m sorry for the negative post. I want to continue on my journey towards independence from weed. I’m just really down right now and feel like it’s pointless. Do you think I’m damaged? If I am is there anything I can do to recover some or all of my cognitive abilities?",43

I am chemically addicted to cannabis and in the process of quitting. Over the past decade I developed GERD and thought any nausea that I experienced was because of it. Any time the nausea gets bad enough, I will throw up and it becomes cyclic, unable to subside till I can zone out, sleep, or smoke. I can’t eat or drink water during these spells and have wound up in the hospital on several occasions. All they do for me at the hospital is give me an IV of fluids and anti-nausea meds till I feel well enough to drink water, then they send me on my way. Throwing up so much over the years has given me a hiatal hernia that has gotten worse over the years. It is not as bad as it could be, I am grateful, but it still has affected my body and mental health drastically. My health has declined because of the nausea and hernia, preventing me from staying fit, going out, and enjoying any strenuous activity, progressing into motion sickness. Even sitting in the back seat of a car or taking public transit can cause terrible nausea. I used to be a dancer and performer and I can’t even stretch without pulling my hernia or perform full out without getting nauseated. I live in daily fear of becoming overwhelmingly nauseous and dedicated myself to cannabis to prevent it, not understanding it could be the cause. 

So I finally decided to do something about… Scheduled a surgery for the hiatal hernia that will not only allow me to work out and dance again, but will help with the side effects of the GERD. But after consultations with the surgeon, they decided I cannot receive surgery because I probably am addicted to cannabis. I will have to be on a liquid diet for 2 weeks and that would certainly make me nauseated. Any throwing up could damage my hernia recovery, so the surgeon canceled my surgery last minute. The surgeon wants the best outcome for me, I understand that. But my current primary doctor is on maternity leave till January, so the surgeon referred me to a different doctor. I waited 2 weeks after the surgery was canceled, to hear from the new doctor, to only be mailed another referral to an OP center. After contacting that OP center they told me it is not covered under my insurance, so they suggested one that was. I called them and found out that OP programs do not provide any medical intervention. So my only way past this could be hospitalization and/or an IOP program, but that is time away from work and possible months of recovery. I also heard that there are restrictions for medications related to cannabis addiction, and are now only used for cancer and aids patients. How am I supposed to find relief? 

All this has put me in a deep depression and feeling abandoned by the medical community… I am trying to seek help and am overwhelmed with the lack of knowledge by everyone I’ve talked to, seen or have been referred to. 

Currently dwindling my cannabis intake down as much as possible, only smoking when I absolutely feel it’s necessary for my nausea. So far I’ve gotten it down to about three times a day, which is pretty good as I used to do it much more often just to be high, as well as edibles to prevent nausea. I only smoke just enough to relieve my nausea, instead of indulging more like I would normally. I stopped using actual leaf over a year ago because I noticed it made me nauseated and only use a vape pen now. Maybe I knew then and just didn’t want to admit it. I feel guilty even having to smoke at all. I know I cannot quit cold turkey unless I have medical assistance so I try not to beat myself up about it. I’ve started going to Smart meetings and Recovery Dharma and exchanged a few contacts so it’s helping me feel not so alone. I have begun to cry while writing this… even getting overly emotional and upset can make me nauseated so I will wind it down for now. Been looking into my options with hospitalization and IOP but would have prefered my doctor to be hands on and supportive instead of having to seek out help through a recovery center. Every call and mislead causes great distress for me and it takes awhile for me to mentally recover. 

I’ve definitely turned into a negative nancy, constantly putting myself and my progress down. I hope that recovery and surgery can get me on a new and brighter path. I want to do the things that make me happy, be better mentally and physically, not rely on cannabis to fix either ailments. I have become a couch potato, living through the stories on my TV, alone most days, having little interaction with people. It would be nice to relate to others, learn and grow! 

Any advice or support from this lovely community would be greatly appreciated. I am new to reddit but my husband is a huge advocate and almost 4 years alcohol free, mostly due to the support you’ve all provided him. He has been a light in my dark and I want to be that for him too. It’s hard to feel positive right now while in limbo about my future.

Thank you for reading my long post. May you not feel the need to use cannabis today.

PS: I am not comfortable confiding in my parents about all this. I am an only child and have older ""boomer"" parents. My mother has  resentment towards cannabis because I was arrested for possession at the age of 16. Didn't actually have any cannabis on me, but a bowl was enough to charge me in fucking Florida.

A couple times; maybe even just once if you're unlucky, you feel it drop out of you. It's usually during the times when you're supposed to be the happiest; the times when your emotions and your environment couldn't be farther apart. You'll feel it drain you.

That moment; usually of shame or regret and accompanied with with a wave of sadness; may be the most powerful tool you'll ever be given. Embrace it.

&#x200B;

I was at a concert with my longtime best friends, my buddy and his girlfriend and was a gorgeous night; music inside; nice quiet picnic benches out back with a pop-up taco cart and some art for sale. I had a friend with me, someone new; someone observant. I was having a blast, coming down off a smoke session I had with the same friends on the journey down to Dallas, we were a group with parity, we were all family of the same kind;  a truly wonderful time. Until it wasn't.

&#x200B;

It dropped out of me; right in the middle of a song. My friends dancing around me in that sort of shameless way where you could not be bothered about how silly you look, joyful, uninhibited. And then there was me, and only me, and only my perspective; reassured that I was alone in what I was feeling, that I was fraudulent in it, that I was the imposter. Every small decision my happy friends made in the last 24 hours; last week; as far back as I could remember became the laundry list.

They had relationships; I didn't

They invested in their friends; I merely checked in with mine

They could be focused on tomorrow and perfectly at ease with today, I was suspended

They brought my observant friend along, the thought would have never crossed my mind

They had a couple bucks for some food and socializing after the show; I made enough money and it was sitting in a plastic bag at home. I couldn't afford a beer because It wasn't in the plan.

&#x200B;

Everything in that moment fell in and if there was bridge I would have lept off of it, palms to the sky. I was crying, holding my chest, the waves from the stage pounded more certainly than my own heart. Was I even here? 

And then... 

Instead of hitting bottom; checking out, passing the pen around and then trying to unpack that while stoned, I stayed in it for a second. It was important; something was important about this, I was a 31 yr old man tearing up in the middle of a conert. Where was my joy? who did I let take this from me? who's fucking fault is this I want to FUCKING KNOW. I got an answer. 

""Come with me""

I went outside with my observant friend, we grabbed a bench; she looked at me and said   
""what's wrong?""

I fucking lost it. 

I had never asked myself that question. I had never waited long enough for someone to ask that question of me. I could not remember the last time I had to answer that question to someone else. It felt invasive; it felt unfair. It was relief.

You don't need me to tell you what I left off my chest in that moment, it's the same signs scattered across the side of the road; they've been there forever, beated down and weathered; you see them every morning when you wake up; every bowl you pack, every smile you see on someone else's face. It's every moment of contentment you aren't able to grasp. It's all there and it always has been.

&#x200B;

But here's your hope. Here's how you know it'll be o.k.

When it drops, and it will. Ask those questions, even if the only answer you get is the your own angered voice, your own apathy.. At least now your know your enemy.. and you already have the upper hand.

Take care of yourselves,",13

I want to have the ability to smoke casually in a company - like a friendly ritual. But I would like to have control over this when I'm on my own.

Like any other person who never underwent a good course of therapy - I had a pile of other unresolved issues, so we went back and forth, starting working on the weed topic and then getting carried away by more urgent stuff. I was mentioning my marijuana self-medicating on the go while I was telling her the latest news. I knew she didn't approve of it, she suggested the coping strategies, and they were mostly futile because the cravings were stronger

Not long ago, during one session (where I was telling her how I rest after successfully finishing a very stressful project - I was smoking like crazy every day) she said: ""I see the changes in how you think and behave, I think we can call it an addiction and I don't think you'll be ever able to smoke joint or two in a circle of friends without a relapse danger, you should probably forget about this idea. It got rooted too deep into you and I think we should work seriously on your addiction"".

That made quite a change in how I was thinking. My therapist has a rather soft temper and she rarely says stuff like this. This ought to be serious.

I made a decision and after several days of fighting, I went to visit my family for the weekend without any stuff on me. When I returned, I still had 2 grams on my shelf, but I never touched it. A couple of days later I gave it to my friend, who used to ask me to buy some for him from time to time.

It's my 16th day and I don't really crave smoking, although I struggle with irritability, appetite swings, sometimes insomnia and I have problems with creating new habits. But man, I'm so proud!

I dont even know why I like smoking still, I just feel sick the next morning afterwards. It’s not even fun anymore. Also, I constantly throw out any weed and lighters I have whenever I want to get sober. But I’ll just end up buying another lighter and more weed at the dispensary whenever I decide to.

Now I’m struggling to stay sober past the one week mark. Whenever the weekend approaches, it’s almost a guaranteed way for me to start smoking again. I just get so bored sitting at home, alone, with nothing else to do during the weekend. It’s incredibly frustrating to struggle so much with weed of all substances.

- I'm sleeping better and don't feel so tired during the day. No more anxiety attacs or waking up in the middle of the night.

- after i come home from work, instead of smoking i have energy to do things around the house and have found inspiration for my own art projects. House is definitely cleaner which is nice!

- overall anxiety is getting easier to manage. I can self soothe and don't get stuck in negative thought cycles

- don't have relationship anxiety and I can be more present to my partner and since I feel more active we do more together. Since I quit it feels like my eyes opened to this wonderful person who I'm dating.



Cons 

- I eat A LOT! My appetite is huge for some reason and it grew after smoking. I'm worried about gaining weight. Need to start exersicing but somehow don't find inspiration for that.

- some feelings are more intence, like feeling of sadness. Since my beloved dog died I smoked more. Now I have to deal with those feelings.. I keep dreaming about my dog and other things I have suppressed with smoking. I cry more. Maybe things will get easier.

- still haven't been able to cut smoking cigarrettes and still feel like I want to/have to smoke something. Sometimes still have the idea that i should just roll a join and smoke and ""relax"". I know it will just give me anxiety.

- actually going to sleep is taking more time 

- feelings of loneliness and depression, but now I can maybe try to manage them in a healthy way

- I feel easily irritated and not patient at all! I have no patience to wait for food at restaurants or wait in line, some of my friends irritate me for some reason (I do keep it to myself though)

- got some weed from my friends as a presents. Some of them say i'll change my mind. Not so supportive. I didn't smoke what i got from them though.

I wrote this to keep track of my quitting journey and maybe help others or chat about these things. I don't miss weed. That's all for now!",7

Compared to my stoner friends I smoked a lot less, despite smoking every day. For example: I would only smoke half a 0.5g joint or smoke 1 bowl out of a pipe each night. 99% of the time I smoked alone and listened to music or watched a movie while in a deep introspective state. I believe that weed made me more introspective and showed me deeper meanings behind why I act / react / am the way that I am. 

I have started to think that I might be jumping to faulty conclusions about myself while high and therein lies one of my reasons to quit.  

I realized last night (not while high) that I have been fooling myself for the better part of a year by telling myself that I smoke but I dont smoke THAT MUCH. Over the past few weeks I started realizing how weed had started affecting who I have become. I have also realized that I have become very de-sensitized to my life. Over the past year I graduated university, got a kick-ass job, moved to a great apartment and spent a lot of time with friends. Despite these being objectively desirable and ""good"" things I barely got any excitement out of them (while sober or high).

She’s been going through chemo and is doing pretty well considering the circumstances. I don’t see her very often, but we have a lot in common and she’s always been a great person to hang out with. I rode over with her sister, who lives in the same town as me. 

Long story short, I took a hit with my cousins Friday night. And one Saturday night (but declined during the day). And one Sunday morning before we left. I noticed it was harder to stay focused on what I was saying in conversation. I was more likely to pull my phone out and browse reddit instead of being engaged. I noticed I was more prone to laziness. Didn’t want to brush my teeth Saturday night, and did a half-assed job. I don’t like any of that.

Got home Sunday afternoon, knowing I wouldn’t go back to being a stoner. I have concentrate in my room that I had never thrown away. I didn’t smoke any. Didn’t even consider it. I got on my bike and took it on a long trail ride and felt amazing. 

Saturday was three months from my sobriety date. I could restart my count today, but I’m not going to. I don’t feel like someone starting from zero. I don’t feel like the lost, hopeless person I used to be. I still know weed has the potential to ruin my life, and I’m not going to give it the chance. I guess I enjoyed it, but I was also reminded of all the bad things it does to me and why I can’t go back to living that way. August 6th was not just valuable because it was a day I stopped smoking. It was my rebirth. It was when I made a decision to change my life.

Many thoughts in my head as I'm entering my 3rd week since I decided to quit.

I don't really know how to spend time with people now - I used to be this ""person to go smoke joint with"" for many years (got some social anxiety, and also I haven't been drinking for more than 2,5 years now, so weed used to be a successful social lubricant).

Although weed used to be very, very harmful for my focus, my perception of self and world, memory, etc. - it used to be my ""safe place"". A place to go to whenever I feel weak. A place that (a usual paradox) made me weak in return.

As a non-drinking person, I know well how it feels to be a bit of an outcast - when the whole gang is getting wasted on alcohol, being stoned is just not the same energy. (even though I'm extroverted and well known in my social environment - I tend to leave parties early and don't usually feel comfortable in a big company). What about being not even stoned?? I get nervous just from thinking about it. What if I lose interest in them, what if they lose interest in me?

I know what the answers could be. That it's not a real friendship if such stuff matters so much. That I should probably find other people and other ways to spend time. And so on... I know, but it also feels like I don't really wanna know... because I'm afraid. Because it became a habit to use weed as a shortcut to get closer with people.

But now that I'm stronger and I've got some real soulmates, aims, and values by my side - I decided that I have to let this shortcut go.

So whenever I feel weak or lost - I'll just have to face it and overgrow it. To make tough decisions, to listen to my heart, to negotiate with my head.

Will I always have enough resources to do that? We'll see. One thing I know - I don't want to go back.

Feeling strong, feeling lost - and it's on and on, circulating in my head.

I have been smoking weed for a good 2 years now, started of smoking something like once in 2 weeks,  every now and then with friends. & today I smoke every day, sometimes even like 4/5 times a day and I hate it. I can't go longer than 3 days without smoking (and that is only when I am home and my parents do not know I smoke). My 5 flat mates smoke weed on a regular basis so when I think 'this is it today is the day I stop' - someone says 'wanna smoke?' and I say yes. This cycle happens all the time and I am just so sick of it, but unfortunately not sick enough to give it up.

I don't why I smoke? I am not enjoying it anymore, I don't enjoy how it makes me feel? I am gaining weight, turning lazy, turning to a slob not caring about anything. I have no motivation to do my uni work (and if I don't sort this addiction out I will start to fail) or to go out with my friends. I hate the gym, I hate everything that's good for me & I know it is because of weed.

When I do not smoke, I don't enjoy the taste of food so I eat a normal amount of food. But when I smoke..... I will eat my body amount x10! & As soon as I am not high anymore..  I feel like punching myself in disbelief of why I have just done this.. ):

I will be at the library and all I can think is, let me go home and smoke... and I do!! I would have 4 hours before work and instead of doing my uni work (which I am very behind on) I smoke?? Like what am I thinking??

We need to go upstream and find out why they're falling in.""","That quote is from Desmond Tutu\*. And while I'm pretty certain his comment did not pertain \*specifically\* to weed addiction, it really resonated with me.  


So many discussions, tips, ideas I read about are how / where / when to quit the Devil's Lettuce. About how to pull people out of the river of addiction. But the real work - the \*HARD\* work, harder than withdrawal symptoms or tossing paraphernalia -  is going upstream and figuring out why I fell in in the first place.  


After many attempts at quitting (since 2006), I've got the where / when and how to quit weed down pat. Insomnia, night sweats, nausea, how to ride it out, how to substitute new hobbies or even new friends to avoid boredom or temptation. Yup. Got that stuff nailed. Maybe you do too.  


But I realized that until I go upstream -- like, \*way\* upstream -- I won't find out why I fell in in the first place. And I'm doomed to eventually relapse.    


Going upstream for me means dealing with years / decades of repressed anger. Usually at those closest to me (my father / my spouse / my BF). Anger is not an emotion I was encouraged to express. And it certainly wasn't validated ('don't make waves' / 'don't be so opinionated' / 'nice girls' don't get angry and carpet bomb the premises with expletives, etc). So until I deal with my anger issues, for sure at some point, I will relapse. Because my unacknowledged, repressed anger had me reaching for a pipe and packing a bowl. Every. Single. Time.   


My anger is around things I can't control - which is very hard for me, as I am a control freak. My anger is feeling helpless to control my father's creeping ailments and decrepitude; my spouses workaholic behaviour; my BF's serious mental health issues and her refusal to get help. Every single one of these things made me red hot with anger over the years. And when I expressed my anger, it was dismissed, side lined or diminished on a regular basis. I didn't feel ""heard"". So I reached for the weed. Constantly.  


I'm trying to grasp that Serenity Prayer thing about understanding what I can / can't change, and being  \*wise enough to know the difference\*. No matter how hard I want to control situations, I have to realize I can't. I don't have control over other peoples actions, opinions, feelings or mistakes. I'm learning new communication skills to help me be heard by other people, so that they don't just get me in Full On Anger Mode.  And it doesn't matter how much weed I smoke it won't change what I have control over.  So I try do like that ""Frozen"" song kids seems to like so much -- ""Let it goooo ! Let it goooo!"" :P.   


And that in turn, will free me from falling into the river of weed. Again.   
Cause I'm bone tired of pulling myself out the river.

I love ouid, but I’ve also wanted to quit deep down for the last 2 years or so. Then multiple lockdowns happened, which if anything made my consumption worse. 

Once when I was 19, I quit for 2 months to impress a girl I was seeing. I often have flashbacks as to how truly difficult it was to quit back then every time I ever think about quitting now. My Mother said I looked like a hard addict going cold turkey due to how severe the physical symptoms were years ago.

Last week I fell really ill. Awful chest infection mixed with a flu and it left me bed bound for 4 days. During this time I obviously was too sick to smoke. So I saw it as an opportunity. It’s been reaaaalllyy easy to quit whilst ill. But now as time goes on and I start to feel better each day, the cravings are surfacing. Hard. 

I’m 6 days in and tomorrow will be the 1 week mark. I’m so excited to get there. But it’s getting harder and harder each day. Last night around 1am I was still wide awake and I ended up crying for no reason haha. I felt so fidgety and almost itchy, without actually itching. So I wound up having a hot bath at gone 2am and listened to some addiction meditation stuff on YouTube. It helped and relaxed me for sure, but I don’t know if it’ll work every time. 

I’m looking for help/encouragement/words of wisdom, all of the above really. I have supportive enough people around me sure, but nobody that gets it. Do your magic Reddit, I could really use it!",18

for anyone who is wondering how i made it through the first day and my small advice: 
-my usual coffee run to starbucks and  m even though i barely drank it, tricked my brain into just moving along with the days plan 
-bf was a great distraction, i encourage having someone (friend/family) around you can be open about how youre feeling. and if you dont-record yourself blabbing away. makes you less trapped mentally 
-wasnt home during the day. personally I am a homebody and don't have much to do out of the house outside of work but today I made sure to get out of the house, i went to the mall and window shopped. it really helped! 


tomorrow i plan to clean my car, get a grocery list of small foods that seems edible (lol) and again try to find an outside distraction-maybe a park with a book.

The first six months of sobriety felt as if I was drifting, neutrally buoyant, two kilometers deep in murky waters. The last six months have felt as if I was falling through opaque, somehow bright clouds. The entire year I've felt distant, disconnected from much of everything, increasingly closer to myself, but still a spectator of my own life. I rarely choose to do what I want, instead, I get to do things.

Before cannabis, I was dissatisfied with my existence. From a young age I often wished I could live in another reality, one not as boring as mine, not as hopeless, where I could feel not as defenseless. Cannabis made me feel just like that multiple times a day, every day, for two great years. I felt near, connected with much of everything, and although increasingly farther away from myself, still the commander of my own life. I chose to do nothing but smoke. I alone chose that feeling over everything else. It was my choice.

I know I alone decided to quit smoking, I know this. After a year, I still feel in my guts like I was pressured into giving up the one thing that made me feel at peace, though. See, after those two great years, my tolerance was quite high. Feeling properly stoned became a rare occurrence, but that was OK. In cannabis I found a pleasant way to live: Breathe in. breathe out. Blow. Everything was cool as long as I had a gram, fire and a pipe. I like other things as much as I like weed, and all of them became even better after I smoked, and it was easier to let go of the bad. I know quitting was the right thing to do, I know this. After a year, I still sometimes wish I didn't quit.

I still like many things, and I am making progress in life... slowly, but I am. I have started to appreciate sobriety. Projects to start, places to visit, things to try, I got them all. Yet, I want to smoke weed again, a shit ton of it. It scares me to miss it so much. The prospect of living the rest of my days without smoking is not as intimidating as it was just a year ago. It still saddens me, though. I want to start project, visit places and try things, all while being high. I still sometimes think nothing will ever be as good as it was with weed. I still feel like weed was the best part of every day.

My life has improved in unimaginable ways, From applying to and being accepted into grad school (so far getting good grades, too), improving my piano playing, and helping my relationships. I have PTSD from abuse, which I had been self-medicating with weed. Unfortunately it wasn’t working all that great; in reality, it was making it worse.
We’re not supposed to discuss specific treatments here but I want to encourage everyone who might be self-medicating a mental health condition to seek out mental health care. Treat the underlying condition and quitting weed will be much easier. While therapy and medication have helped me immensely, quitting weed has made all the difference for me. I used to be in a constant state of anxiety. Now I talk in class,    meet with professors, do interviews, all with almost no anxiety. 
I still have my own issues, and it’s true quitting will not solve all of your problems, but when I was still smoking, my life was in shambles and I frequently considered unaliving myself.

I am a senior in college who is a couple years behind (not super important but kind of relevant) and i’m graduating in spring. i’ve been a daily smoker for years, with minimal breaks. i began when i was in high school and have been a heavy smoker ever since. it has been associated with some of the best experiences in my life and i have preached its benefits to many people fervently for so long.

I have had mental health issues for a long time that I have not appropriately taken into consideration. I’ve tried meds in the past, intensive outpatient programs related to substance and depression even, but never followed through. I have some huge shame about this and being supported by my parents and behind in school, I have been feeling really horribly about myself and thinking horrible things about who i am and what Ive done with my life so far. I have been comparing myself to those around me and letting it torture my thoughts and fuel my crushing anxiety.

Recently, my anxiety and depression has been really, really, REALLY overwhelming and I decided to return to counseling last week (with a counselor that i met with earlier this year and then avoided  until recently, a pattern i have). During this conversation, we discussed how I have been smoking during the day constantly and using it to self medicate and avoid anxiety. I think it may be time for me to get fully sober and start to be comfortable in my own skin but I am very scared if i am being honest.

Earlier this year, I quit alcohol after realizing that my behavior while drunk was always negative and I had made many mistakes while drunk. I was self medicating with alcohol as well. I have been addicted to and quit nicotine a few years ago also. I am terrified of getting sober for some reason. It makes me more anxious even though I know it will make my anxiety better. 

*long story long….* 
I am mostly venting with this post but I wanted to share my experience and offer a conversation with anyone who is feeling similar. This shit is so hard and I am already nervous before I have even tried to quit. I know i am going to struggle and I thought this would be a good place to reach out for help.
I appreciate anyones response and i hope everyone here is having a good day and knows that there are others there feeling the same struggles.

Thought I’d give a random update of my journey here. 

Been smoking weed for 16 years but past 2 years have cut back substantially. But still smoked about an 1/8 a week or so. 

When I was younger in my teens, weed didn’t really affect me emotionally with anxiety, social anxiety, depression, and  or panic attacks. Ever since my mid 20’s I feel as I just can’t handle it any more and it’s just fucks up my entire life.  If I smoke a joint, I can’t go in public as I think everyone is looking at me and I just become extremely awkward and weird. Also I can’t even hold conversations with people. 

I’ve attempted to quit in the past, but have only lasted a few weeks. Then I end up in my mind “just gonna doing it this once with a friend then I’ll stop”. Then of course I get hooked again. 

Currently on day 13, and for some reason this time it seems a lot easier than the previous times. I’ve tried to keep myself busy with yard work and other activities and have found that has kept my mind off wanting the weed. 

Just a few concerns I have, I still feel

Extremely depressed, decreased motivation at work, irritable, bad brain fog also I have been dealing with short temper issues road rage lol. 

I’ve been trying to eat significantly more healthy I.e fruits, vegetables, fish, and work out on a stationary bike for 20 mins each morning with some basic weight lifting at home. 


Any tips on when this might subside? I really want to find another job and interview but I’m terrified that I’m not emotionally at that point to be engaging with new employers lol


Also what are some of everyone’s experiences with this?",1
2021-11-07 21:05:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qp3jzj/a_little_revelation_i_had/,A little Revelation I had,"TL;DR: Weed makes unhealthy habits extremely alluring (Junkfood, Porn, Social Media, Cheap ""dumb"" entertainment) and healthy, productive activities almost impossible or at least way harder to do consistently  (Sports, Studying, Hobbies that require good technique/concentration).

&#x200B;

Hey guys, I've noticed something that, at leat to me, seems very significant when you're thinking of turning your life around. We all know that weed intensifies certain experiences tremendously - tasty food becomes even tastier, watching porn is way more arousing, maybe funny jokes become funnier.

That's what I always thought of weed and it's also the thoughts that kept me using. While it did make these things more enjoyable, it lead to me overusing all of them, eating too much trashy junk food, jacking off way too much even though I wasn't horny and watching dumb ""funny"" entertainment to just pass the time I could have used to further my knowledge in something I care about. This overindulgence lead to me becoming even more depressed than I was in the first place. That in turn lead to me using more weed. It's a vicious cycle.

Now to the flipside, the ""Revelation"" one could say. Weed makes these things that are already bad for me much more rewarding and therefore more alluring, right ? It does the exact opposite for almost anything I would do to better myself. I wouldn't be physically active, as being couchlocked is a lot easier, especially if your lungs start burning after 20 minutes of actual activity due to the nice thick coating of burnt plantmatter I regularly inhaled. I can't really read anything thought provoking or study, as I'm in a constant state of perpetual confusion. I can't do stuff with nonsmoking friends to reduce my smoking, as I'm too anxious from all the weed. While it does sometimes help to get the creative juices flowing in certain activities, it's very much detrimental to my technique (Drawing, playing music etc.). All in all, that's a big fat loss for me personally.

So happy to be finally free, I wish for all the resilience in the world to you guys, I hope this post might help someone !",20

Sat on the sidelines and watched my life go by without really participating in it, day by day, year by year, and decade by decade. Negative thinking, bouts of depression, anxiety, unattainable goals, unrealistic dreams, elation, euphoria, cycles of unpredictable emotions. Guilt, remorse, weakening relationships and losing touch with who I really was at my core. That's a Cole's notes summary of some of the things weed did to me.

I tried to quit multiple times, sometimes I'd have success for a few days, weeks and a couple of times maybe a month or more. In the back of my mind, in each of those occasions I *knew* that I would be going back. I wasn't really prepared to let go. I wasn't ready to face a life of being sober. Leaving weed in the past, where I really wanted to leave it, was a scary thought. I didn't think I could survive and get through life without weed. It was ingrained in my life and lifestyle.

In order to quit I knew I needed a different approach. Simply stopping weed wasn't working. There was more I needed to do. It took time for me to realize that *I needed to change.* My entire view on life, my self and my relationship with weed (and booze) needed to end, completely, for good and forever. It took me finding a way to accept that before I could successfully stop.

With a lot of work, introspection, thinking and external and self-therapy I began the work to peal away the layers of addiction to have a closer look inside. Eventually I developed an understanding of where it was coming from and why. Not where the addiction came from or why I became addicted, but why I was afraid to stop. Extinguishing the identity I had built up over the years with weed was a major step. Being okay with becoming a sober person, preparing to face the challenges I knew that would arise from doing so, and working on the new person I was about to become were all keys to turning the corner.

I didn't need to be an addict. I didn't need weed to function. I was a human being born with all the tools and skills I needed to get through life on my own. It was time to dust them off and put them to use. Most people don't use weed, most people aren't addicted to any drugs (caffeine aside) and they do just fine. So could I, and so can you.",359

I sought out weed at 15 after experiencing severe depression for the first time and reading that it helped with that & anxiety. It was like I found a missing part of me. I soon became a daily smoker, my grades dropped, I lost friends. I went to college but, looking back, I spent most of my time high, depressed, and alone.

I will be 24 next month.

I have a job that I really love. A boyfriend I really love. An apartment and lovely doggo. Things aren’t terrible. But I know they could be 10x better. I could be excelling in my career and making good money instead of living paycheck to paycheck and struggling to pay rent. I could be fully present for my boyfriend. I could call my grandparents more often. I could keep my apartment (much) cleaner. I could be eating better. I could be facing my unresolved trauma & healing myself & loving life.

I told myself I would quit by my birthday next month. Most of me absolutely wants to be sober. But a part of me is so scared that I will still be sad, anxious, with nothing to look forward to or enjoy. Weed provides a feeling that all is okay. I’m afraid to be without that. I’m afraid to look back & see how much of my life I’ve wasted. 

I generally feel happier when I get myself not to smoke. But I always end up going back to it. 

I just needed to type this out and get it off my chest. I hope you all are having a beautiful day & are feeling strong and happy and loved. I’m proud of you for wherever you’re at in your journey.

&#x200B;

For a while I've been planning to take some weed with me. I was looking forward to it. Today I was looking at the black market (place where I used to buy weed) for some products. I was worried about getting bud as that might be challenging to stealth carry, although with smaller amounts (<0.5g) it wouldn't be a problem, I've done that before. I then looked at ejuices and carts which I've never tried before.

&#x200B;

After about two hours of choosing I went for a walk and decided not to do it. It's too many implications. First, I'd be worried about product arriving on time. Then I'd be worried about stealth packing it. Then I'd be worried about not smoking any before the actual flight. Then the customs check. I'd have to make sure I've taken enough with me to last the whole week. The ejucies and carts I never tried so no idea how they'd work.

&#x200B;

While it probably would give me certain pleasure from smoking over there, that would mean I'd be stuck in my apartment every evening, and wouldn't be able to go out. I'd be waking up tired every morning and the brain fog would return. I'd be thinking about going home and smoking instead of exploring. I would not remember the holiday so well. It's ridiculous how many things you need to stress about as a stoner.

&#x200B;

But more importantly I'd break a 3 months streak which is the longest I've ever had. It falls exactly on the day I'm flying. I've been off for long enough to switch my mindset. I can't remember how I was on weed. I'm afraid if I smoked again all the temptation would return. Not that I would get more weed on return but I don't want to go through the withdrawals once again. Last time I smoked feels like it was ages ago. It was a different time in summer. I've had stuff happened since then which pushed my conviction, and I've done work. I don't want to feel like that weak person again.

- can wake up in the morning with my alarm, not hit snooze ten times
- no brain fog in the morning
- lungs feel better, easier to do a workout.
- more motivation to exercise and just generally go outside and do stuff (don't sit around watching shows all the time)
- less social anxiety, less work anxiety, less anxiety generally
- save money
- freedom from smoking thoughts, not have my day revolve around weed, not thinking ""when am I gonna get high today?""
- eat less junk food, can actually take 20 min to cook a decent meal that isn't just instant everything factory food
- muscles less tense (I have a tense upper back/neck from stress)
- don't hang around shitty people just to have someone to smoke with.
- have way more time to do stuff I want (hobbies and exercise). Like fuck loads more time it's insane.
- been reading more of books I've been wanting to read
- I can actually sort of see my negative thoughts and habits for what they are, they don't feel overwhelming. I am regaining control of my life.",87

It was actually the first time in my life that I had real friends like that.

Anyways then I started smoking weed everyday. Slowly I started to see them less and less,missed days at uni, not replying to messages. 
Eventually after years they started to hang out with different people, create and new friends group. Now I look at their social media, they’re creating memories with other people, and they look like they’re having so much fun without me. 

This is honestly so painful. Not only do I feel like I have wasted the last 4 years of my life (prime youth years) but I missed out on so many memories and connections.
I miss them so much, and I would love nothing else but to just hang out with them one last time. But it’s been so many years I feel like we’re pretty much strangers now, and even re-connecting would be awkward.

I can’t hold back the tears as I’m writing this. I feel like I have hardly any friends, leaving university, where I was meant to make friends for life.  It hurts to watch your life go by, knowing how much better and more full it could have been.

We almost made it to a year last time, but personal circumstances drove us back to it. This is the excuse that I tell myself constantly.
""it's not our fault, it's their fault""

No. They are one of the reasons, but they didn't force us to buy it, they didn't force us to roll one, they didn't force us to smoke it and they didn't force us to get into extreme debt for tick. We did that. We have valid reasons (or so we thought at the time) but the blame lies solely with us. 

At the beginning of this year, our heating was switched off multiple times, meaning we froze in our own home, but it was okay, right? We had weed, there was food for the animals, a teeny bit of food for us so it didn't matter if we all got a little cold, right? 

Such a twisted way of thinking. 

I'm not going to sugarcoat it, the psychological withdrawals are bad - I smoked so much over the last 10 years that I developed drug-induced psychosis. 

If I presented to a doctor with these withdrawal symptoms, they'd question if I was on heavier drugs, but no, it's all just the weed. 

Periodic cold/clammy spells, irritation, lack of concentration, losing interest in activities because all I can think about is the withdrawals. I'm trying so hard to unfocus on it, but my addicted brain keeps dragging me back to that unhelpful thought process. 

I remember life before we picked it back up again. 
We could afford everything we needed; gas for the central heating, electric, food, little luxuries (like wax melts and candles for a small example); I remember doing a full shop at the supermarket, and then affording a £30 takeaway, because I was knackered and didn't want to be stood at the cooker all evening. 

I knew smoking weed was a bad choice. During that almost year we didn't smoke, I felt my mental health improve, my symptoms died down, I didn't want to kms, I wasn't losing it over the tiniest things, I felt myself get out of my head. I felt alive for the first time since 2011. 

This is all a distant memory right now, but I heard some advice somewhere that said:

""the reason people fail is because they give up what they want the most for what they want right now"".

I want my life back.
I want my dreams back.
I want to be healthy again.

I can't speak for my OH, he has his own reasons. 

I have decided to change for the better, as of Thursday 4th November, the anniversary of me finding out that my beloved Grandad had passed away.

Daily smoker of 3 years, I quit cold turkey since christmas last year. The first 2 months were very hard. Difficulty sleeping and my emotions were heightened and all over the place. 

I took it one day at a time.

Fast forward 10 months later. 

I got fired recently from a new job i started. I thought it was a good career move but the place turned out to be toxic. I worked for 3 weeks and communicated the status of my work on a daily basis to my manager. I got no indication that my work was not up to standard from my manager until the last day i got blind sighted with the bad news that im being let go. 

Not kind of place i want to work at but it was still heart breaking dealing with the rejection of my best effort. 

Im proud of myself that at no point did smoking a bowl come to my mind. I took a holiday after i got fired and now im ready to get back into the work force. I am excited for the next chapter in my career. Im thinking about what do i really want to do.i want to make sure my next move is right.

I’m lucky enough to have an incredibly supportive partner who would support me until I found something else however IM SO SCARED TO LEAVE. I feel like all my anxiety is stemming from having to go there, somewhere I’m just a number. I pride myself in my job and care probably more then I should about how I’m perceived in the place. Any advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation? Thanks for reading and best wishes to everyone dealing with similar situations",3

Non-stop since 12yrs.","So I had made the decision to quit and I also knew that going to a place with no access for a while would be the best.

So I packed my bags and came home to live with my parents for a month. I took my last Vape (XL Volcano vape bags) hit 1 day before boarding the plane and after 10hours of flying international, I'm back home. 

I've noticed that my head feels heavy sometimes, I loose energy quickly in normal day to day activities like going out and getting grocery, just coding on my laptop etc... However I'm still able to bench 100kg, and complete my morning workout. 

However, since the time I've gotten off the plane 6 days ago, it seems like my body is still on it, feels like I'm swinging back n forth slightly. Is this normal? Or should I see a doctor?

I'm not worried about it as I've never had a problem with it and can stop after one drink. With weed it seems as if the floodgates open if I use.

 Someone brought a tincture and said to help myself & that he had bud if I wanted to toke. ""No thanks"", I said, ""I have a bit addictive relationship with it."" He said ""it's all in your mind."" I think it's sad how in denial some people are. I said ""maybe so, but I'm not interested."" ""No, it's really in your mind"" like really dude? I don't understand how people still believe it's only ""psychologically"" addictive. Wtf does that even mean? Like your brain doesn't crave certain chemicals such as dopamine and anandamide to feel good?

I just find it irritating when people downplay weed as harmless. I've always known alcohol as to be something to be wary of when it comes to addiction and overconsumption. Weed on the other hand I never heard that about it growing up. I started so young, and had no idea the damage I was doing to my brain.

I picked up vaping which pretty much drained my wallet and killed my lungs. I quit weed 2 times before each time quitting for about 6 months. To put it plain and simple nostalgia pretty much brings me back. Rainy days especially coming on to 420 just really brings me back to the good times. The music sound so much better and the food tasted great. Been couple days since I quit and really changed my mind set this time. I read Allen cares book easy way to quit smoking which is for cigarettes but the same applies since it's still an addiction and I was vaping too so it's 2 birds with 1 stone and I guess you can throw masturbation in there too and let's not forget alcohol. This morning was rough since I had so many chances to buy weed and nic but forced my self not to walk out the house. Currently I'm laying down at night and listening to 70's music and boy does it sound so good. Maybe it wasn't the weed and nic after all, I was brainwashed to think things was better while high but in reality it wasn't . Living life to the fullest is greater than the highest of highs for me rn. Taking walks and just taking deep breaths while admiring nature reminds me of why I quit and why there's is so much for to live for instead of being high all the time.

Day two: started to feel a little run down. Body aches and clammy feeling.evening I started to have less appetite and my stomach gurgle a lot.

Day three: I actually went to a skating event today that was sponsored by a dispensery. People were smoking tons on weed and I didn't care. But I physically felt so bad. I was always a lil sweaty, my back aches, ear ache, I'm really tired (actually just woke from a nap) my throat is kinda sore. And my stomach is upset. Overall I feel lethargic.

You see, I was very confused because I got my first c0v1d sh0t Sunday and felt run down for two days. So I was thinking it was residual affects from that. But I just realized today it's likely withdrawl. Are these withdrawal symptoms or am I actually getting sick? Lol 🙃",3

My anxiety attacks have stopped completely. I was at the point where I needed meds almost. Scary for me.

Im a lot more soft spoken now and sweet and kind. Closer to the loveable person I was known for in the past. Lately while smoking weed, I was more angsty, more irriatable and angry. More arrogant and demanding. Now, more ""don't worry, be happy"". 

Adhd symptoms have gotten worse though, more spacey and more distracted by random things. Because of this, I'm more unsure now than ever. While smoking weed i was more sure of how I wanted to proceed with my life, I've lost that confidence and now I'm more ""🤷‍♂️"" as to what lies in my future.

On day 3, I went to the grocery store.  Saw an old friend in the parking lot and he tried to pass me a vape pen, I politely declined.  Day 4, I go to work and a co-worker offers to smoke a bowl, I resisted again.  It's not just a matter of not buying any, or avoiding those friends, but navigating daily life as well.  

I'm also quitting alcohol at the same time.  The vivid nightmares and interrupted sleep are unreal!  Still I'm feeling a huge energy boost already and my performance as a line cook is improving(as well as at video games). 

I think before I was too motivated by anger at the time/money I've wasted, and not enough motivated by compassion for myself and others.

Reasons I want to quit:

1. Far too much time and money spent zoning out, time I could be spending with my wife

2. I dread the feeling of relying on something external and unstable to treat mild depression and boredom.  Sick of feeling a huge void without it.  (just want to be clear I'm absolutely NOT  discouraging anyone who needs medicines to cope)

3. To enrich my Buddhist practice.

4. To increase my productivity: exercise, read more books, pick up my guitar again, establish a daily meditation habit, intermittent fasting.  

5. After 12 years of daily weed, and 4 or 5 of almost daily beer, my lungs hurt, I'm getting headaches, I am bloated, my energy is sapped and it feels like life on repeat(nothing but work then stay high until it's time to work again), and my eating habits are crap.

I am immensely thankful for this community, you all give me the inspiration I need to keep going!  

My friends were very supportive of me stopping booze, but when it comes to weed they flatly deny it is a drug, an addiction, try to say it's just demonizing propaganda to think that way, etc.  Not to judge anyone who uses it, but for ME it is a problem.  So it's been indispensable to find a group of like-minded people.

First of February 2021, I quit, after years of begging and negotiating with myself to do so.   

Every morning I read religiously all the new posts on r/leaves. And I can say without a doubt : without this sub, I would have never understood that I had an issue with weed. I was so perfectly convinced that “weed is not addictive !” “ weed has no downside !”.  Damn was I dumb bitch in denial.   

Classic story: daily smoker for years, big part of my social life, felt kinda numb, had no job, wanted my brain and IQ back, yadayada.   

The first weeks were tough, I think it took three months for my sleep to feel
Normal again. Constant nightmares, nocturnal Terrors, highly vivid dreams… I was afraid to go to bed at night, and woke up more tired than when I went to sleep. It felt like years of unresolved unconscious issues were treated all at once during the span of three months.  

I used weed to repress my emotions. I am An hyper sensitive, and for the first years smoking felt like taking a vacation from my dramatic mind. Until I realized I was burying myself into denial and could not recognize my numb self.  

Anyway, I remember the posts I loved reading, the ones where some guy would go “ it’s been x months, and since then, i got my life back, I found my dream job, bought a house, find the perfect gf and  won a nobel prize”. Even it that’s not the reality of everyone who quit, I wanted to dream a little, that quitting would help me get out of this rut and those feelings of worthlessness.  

Well, it’s been ten months. And since then, I have found my dream job ( Got it because I took a chance, and I was ready mentally, and most importantly,  intellectually to give my all. ), i am looking to buy a house ( because job), already had the perfect partner , but have been to regular non-smoking parties and been able to actually connect to the people there and made new friends. I have reconnected with my emotions and am starting to feel like myself again. (Maybe a Nobel prize on its way??).   

All I want to say is : thank you everyone on this sub. If you wrote a post between the 1st of February and the 1st of May 2021, there is a 99% chance I read your post and it helped me go through it.  

Never thought I could raw dog life like this, but being a sober and functioning adult human being is actually fire.  

This post is but a little contribution to your daily readings, while you think about quitting or while you are already in the battle. Good luck everyone you’ve got this, for real !",64

I found that if I just do something, anything that is ever so slightly productive, I can change my outlook. Time to empower myself to kick addiction in the ass and continue this long road to recovery. Its not going to be easy, but those things really worth it do not come easy.

I can't live without it more and more,I lose my freedom,because it locked me up. I started to become depressed and autistic, even low self-esteem, started to be indifferent to everything,  but I can't stop it. Every time I want to quit it, it feels really sucks.

I seem to have a different problem than most people on here, though. 

When I’m sober, I’m absolutely off the walls. I have such a massive over abundance of energy that I literally cannot handle it. I don’t know how else to describe it other than literally acting like a madman. Walking around the house yelling song lyrics, screaming at video games (either in excitement *or* anger) for literally 24+ hours, just being a loud and obnoxious person in general. I actually feel like a completely different person and it’s unsettling. 

It feels like I’ve been suppressing and hiding this personality for years and I don’t know what to do about it. I don’t know if this is my real personality or it’s just a burst of energy from being sober. Anyways, it just doesn’t feel like me and it’s a big adjustment.

I can focus on reading books again. I can think clearly. I was so scared that the fogginess from when I was using was permanent, but it’s gone!

After 24 years of using, it was time to move on. Woke up not long ago having a bad dream that made me realize the obvious. I am alone. Alone and friendless. If it was not for my wife I would be so fucked. 

The realization of becoming a hermit is eating at me alive. I thought to myself if going back would help and it would not. It’s up to me to make the difficult calls I need to. If weed helped me get to such a dark place in my life it sure as hell won’t help me get back to a place of light.

Just a reminder to us all that there are challenges even in sleep. The mind is always there to find your weakness and exploit you. Don’t fall victim to your weak ass mind. It’s the weakest thing on us sometimes and the realization of that helps one get through.

But I did it, I’m almost 6 months sober (quit cold turkey and haven’t looked back even though I live with a daily smoker) and I couldn’t be happier. I feel 10000% better, never have ANY stomach issues whatsoever, feel so clear minded and confident, have none of the intense anxiety I was constantly feeling and feel like the real version of myself now. I’m not sick all the time, gained about 15 pounds and realized a couple months in that weed was pretty much ruining my body. Can’t explain why bc it doesn’t do that to most people it seems, but man oh man was it ruining me.

I've definitely used it as an emotional crutch for most of that time, and have been smoking almost exclusively dabs for a 2+ years.

I've not liked my relationship with weed for some time now, and finally decided to take control and do something about it. I struggle with impulse control and so I know cutting back is not really an option. I decided to stop buying and just quit.

I've been out of dabs for 2 weeks now, and finishing off my last quarter of dry herb. I've been tapering down, and only smoking a little bit to ween off, even managing to go whole days without smoking, which is a big deal for me. Now before I go further, it's worth mentioning I was in a bad car accident a year and a half ago.

When I stopped smoking as much I started getting back spasms, which I hadn't gotten in 9 months since the accident. The doc gave me muscle relaxers that don't help much at all. Pain has been getting worse over the past 2 weeks, and I'm missing a lot of work at this point, and I'm a server so if I don't work I don't get paid.

I'm really struggling to keep up my resolve to try quitting when it seems like quitting is making my life spiral out of control. At least with weed life wasn't painful, emotionally or physically, even if I stopped being able to enjoy it all.

Getting healthy again after years of eating shit because of munchies

For people who are having a harder time, please believe in yourself and keep going, find something to do, and accept that you will have to change your lifestyle if you want to quit, and that's a necessity. I tried quitting before but I failed because I'd do the same things as I did when I was stoned. Don't sit there and think about weed because that will make you crave it. For me, distractions were a must. Go gym, go do something you wouldn't normally do. For me, that was reading a book and that book changed my life honestly. Use this as a chance to do that thing you always wanted to do. This is only from my personal experience and I can only share what helped me.

If you are quitting and struggling right now, please know that things do get better and I believe in you. Stay Strong!",6

A significant portion of my waking time has been spent either thinking about weed, preparing to smoke, planning my day around smoking, actually being high, or coming down from being high.

Marijuana has subtly and sneakily taken over my life in ways that I am increasing uncomfortable with. These are not new thoughts, I remember sitting at my desk at the Ellenington house and having similar thoughts, that was 11 years ago.

I hate my relationship with weed, I hate the push and pull, the constant thoughts of if I will smoke that day, which I will. I  hate how I inevitably end up smoking in the evening 99% of the time regardless of what I thought that morning. I hate the constant excuses, deals, bargains, and methods by which I can convince myself to smoke.

I dont even like being high half the time, if not more. I hate the munchies, how I will constantly look for some sort of drink or food to consume just to keep my taste buds alive. I dont like what that does to my body and I dont like not cuddling with Tricia because I'm eating cheese and crackers, yogurt and granola, or anything else I can find.

I dont like what being high all the time does to my relationship with Tricia, I become withdrawn, I loose focus, I am not really there in a significant way.

I am becoming increasingly aware of what weed does to my sex drive, sexuality, and interest in being sexual. Remember the way my body felt in Siesta Key with Tricia? I couldn't keep myself off of her. I miss that energy and I know she does too.

Being high all the time also makes me sad in the long term. I become mildly depressed, my good habits disappear, and my idea of a good time is staring into a computer screen to play a video game I've spent hundreds if not thousands of hours in route gameplay I know by heart.

I hate how much my daily activities are surrounded by the internal expectation and desire to smoke weed before and after them. The idea of going to yoga,  flying my rc plane, playing board games, watching football, doing laundry, working outside, walking the dogs, ALL of those things seem somehow incomplete, horrifying, and something to avoid if it does not first include myself getting high.

One of the most annoying consequences of being high all the time is the loss of energy, of being sleepy all the time or waiting for a reset like sleeping or starting a new day, I never seem to actually enjoy being in the moment of being high, its always the edges, the packing of the bowl or the come down that I think about.

Smoking weed everyday encourages me to be bored, to give up on my obligations, and to hate the idea of any sort of obligations whatsoever. If I am engaged in life, I dont want to smoke weed anyways. My best memories, most fond times in my life where I have been active, engaged, and really happy to be in the moment; weed has seemed so far away from what I want to do.

In a way, I am thankful, because since I was 15 I have known that smoking weed was a decent indicator of how happy or satisfied I am with my life. The more I smoke, the more I seem to be running away from my life, the less I smoke, the more content and happy I am with my present surroundings.

From the constant desire and pull to smoke weed, to how it takes over my schedule and creates an inability to commit to anything, I need to take a break and focus on my actual life.

I need to see and love Tricia through clear eyes, I need to be able to hug my dogs and know that I am giving them their best life, I need to see changes in my body, my mood, and my hunger for more in life. I dont want to be complaisant anymore.

I want to reach my potential and actually live. I dont want to waste my life in a haze of white smoke, unhealthy habits, and a constant yearning for more that I know I can achieve,.

I can do better.

And then I was out of more money and would be too lazy to be productive or do the things my old self would actually want to do. So quitting has actually been really easy for me so far, not to say that I haven’t been tempted but deep down I know it’s not worth it and I’ve been very excited ab my future without weed. I’ve been getting off work everyday and getting back into lifting weights and working out again. That has been a huge help in distracting myself from thinking ab it, but I honestly just do not even look at weed the same anymore. I would challenge yourself to be 100% completely honest with yourself about your relationship with weed and if it is truly helping you or not. Bc most of the ppl in my life who I hung out with who smoked are just abusing it and not using it right at all and we all had this narrative in our heads that we were “fine”and nothing was wrong with what we were doing but in reality I knew that wasn’t the case. Honestly I knew this person I became was not truly myself and I didn’t know how I got to this point. I’ll stop rambling on but my last piece of advice would be to really be careful with who you associate with and if you don’t wanna hang around certain ppl anymore you must cut them out of your life or at least distance yourself far from them for a while. I have a lot more I wanna say but I’m at work rn so I’ll end this here. Peace",2

Sick and tired of understanding the negative consequences on my physical health and mental health yet continuing to grab the bong. I often regret that very first hit, and as I sit there in regret I light up again thinking maybe this hit would be different, and if this one doesn't make me feel better the next one surely will.

Knowing that there are consequences, yet doing the same thing over and over has got to be the definition of addiction. I'm smarter than this, I'm stronger than a plant. 

I deserve to feel again, you deserve to feel again. 

I'm removing the crutch today, I don't want to live like this forever and I won't. 15 years of smoking and 7 years of smoking everyday ends today.",38

Unlike other people on this sub, I wasn't smoking for over a decade. I started at the age of 20 and have been smoking on and off for 5 years. From that first hit, it just clicked in my brain, like I finally found the missing puzzle piece in my life. My latest binge lasted 2 months. Within 1 week of smoking, I went from a couple of bowl hits a day to dabbing every hour and edibles reaching the 500mg mark. What makes this destructive is the weed enables my other addictions which I won't share due to the rules. 

Tip:

Currently on day 6 and yesterday had the biggest urge to light up a bowl since it was my day off. What has helped me get past it was I went out to chick fil and got the greasiest meals they got and then pounded a large soda. The sugar, fat, and carbs gave me some dopamine to last the rest of the day. I now have to figure out how to deal with the urges of being in a different state of mind. I feel like nothing could replace that.

I just got a new job. I really good job actually. I've been very stressed as I have to stay completely alert during this job and whenever I have off I just want to unwind.

Did great in school wrestled did martial arts graduated 2 years early got to college then got in with the wrong crowd got into legal trouble and dropped out after the 3rd semester at 18. 
I ended up doing a month in jail and then work release and 12.4K in debt total. Over 5 years I slowly paid it out because I started construction after the trouble made me drop out of college. Paid everything off but still was always borrowing money using credit cards and never could level up my life. 
Weed was amazing the first years but I didn’t notice how it slowly but surely started destroying my life. I’ve never had quit more than a few weeks at any time since 13. 

This time something changed. In just 25 days I have quit a negative job and completely quit construction, I just became a Semi truck driver I have sold a gas guzzling truck and now have every single debt paid off and over 10k in savings. 
My life has changed completely. I listen to 3 plus hours of podcasts a day I have went all organic diet back to lifting weights I have cut out a huge crowd of negative people and I have so many things I’m working on in the near future!

2021-11-04 22:28:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qn167u/life_without_weed/,Life without weed,"Between ages 16 and 40 I smoked or ate weed daily. That's about 24 years. Twenty-four years of my 40 year existence spent being a stoner. I'm now about one and half years sober. There were elements of excitement and weed had become a part of my life and lifestyle. There was a lot to lose, at least that's what my stoner self believed. 

Stopping was not easy, in fact it may have been one of the hardest things I had ever done. Weed has this weird way of being gentle enough you can use it a lot with minimal negative effects but not gentle enough that the accumulative effects didn't add up. Years and indeed decades of using weed took its toll on my mental health, my relationships and my life in general.

In the past year and a half of being sober life has certainly been vastly different than previous. In the time I spent preparing to stop I taught myself to say no. I'm in Canada and weed is everywhere and easily accessible. 

The old pathways of my brain that lead to me using in the past are slowly being eroded. Like an old river bed I believe those pathways will exist for many years and likely the rest of my life. If I were to allow water to flow through those again the flow would be the same as it had been in the past. One pin hole in this damn I've constructed would eventually lead to the torrent of yesteryear. 

Of course there are times when I'd love to just write off a night, drink beer and smoke weed, I have lots of time and I can spare one night. The problem is I know I cannot maintain that boundary once its penetrated. 

It's much easier for me to keep working on the damn and maintaining it than to deal with having to quit again. 

Life without weed is a balanced one. The lows aren't as low, the highs aren't as high and there is a lot more peace. Being a weed addict (or addict of any kind) means carrying around a lot of unnecessary baggage.",102

The three of us were instant friends who bonded over weed. That culture allows easy bonding, but stunts growth.   


We made it a habit of rolling a joint for each other, and we smoked day after day without fail. Who can't say they never had fun smoking weed- but the devastating thing is the stress that follows.   


Irritable, paranoid, fatigue and overly stimulated.  


To be honest my weed addiction was always attached to my porn addiction. I had to quit porn first to realize, its not enough - weed needs to go too.    


I was surprised how difficult it was quitting weed. I thought it'd be the easier of the two. But something about weed, and its supposed benign demeanor made it impossible to take it serious. I always patted myself on the back, and reasoned expertly on how weed is actually helping me out in life. How it destresses me, and a little won't kill ya. But one smoke becomes two, and two , three and so on. And I'm back to the bong - well, because it saves on costs right?   


What was really frustrating about weed for me , was sex. We all know weed makes sex amazing. But have you ever tried having sex without weed? All of a sudden you're so much less than- things are just gloomier, and bland. It wouldn't matter so much if it wasn't for the fact , weed sex becomes terrible too. You become tired, and everything becomes heighten in an exhaustive kind of way. Very clunky , and grimy. Foggy. Blech.   


So I quit about a month ago. I'm overall happier , but whenever I quit I seem to always go through a weird phase. I wonder if anyone goes through it too...   


Its like any thing I see or hear triggers something in my memory, and its always cringe, embarrassing, shameful etc. I keep getting flash backs of terribly embarrassing moments in my life, and It comes more and more frequently the farther I get from the withdrawals.   


Most of my physical cravings are gone, but my mental states seems to be very vulnerable. I guess this is why I reached out to you good folks. Just needed to know I'm not alone in this struggle to quit... shits rough.   


Anyway, good luck to all you good folks, and I hope to stay sober , and achieve greatness.

I've been smoking habitually since I was about 15. I'm 37 now. Back when I started getting getting into it, we smoked a lot of shitty diesel hash where I'm from, all that was available, all I know. Eventually I started selling it in school. As time went on, it just remained a part of my life to the extent where it was so prevalent that I never even questioned my daily usage. My tolerance was so high that it didn't *seem* to affect life. Pretty much every single day, bar any instance where I simply couldn't (hospital stays etc). Never crossed my mind not to. 

I came across this sub some time ago, not with any view to stop, but always interested to see the other sides. Much as I did with alcohol and the issues that arose from this. Recently I just simply...got fucking bored. It's not doing anything but appeasing my appetite really. I'm getting nothing more. Smoked less and less as a result over the last week or so. Then a few days ago, without making a truly conscious decision, I just...stopped. the fuck? My sleep has already improved greatly. I've still a ton of weed there. No urge to smoke it. Don't get me wrong, I've a rather addictive personality. But I already feel so different. Better. It became such a part of me that I didn't realise that the adverse affects were so adverse. 

Anyway I say it's weird because I would expect some form of withdrawal or, something keeping me connected but I feel my time just came. And I feel lucky in that regard. If only every addiction  was this simple. But no, I'm lucky. I'm pretty sure I can keep this up.
Anyway I felt I should share here of all places as I'm sure it had some subconscious influence. No one need be a prisoner to anything where its not necessary. Peace.",9

2021-11-04 18:41:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qmwrb8/6_years_smoking_18_days_since_the_start_of_my_new/,"6 years smoking, 18 days since the start of my new life.","I've been smoking for 6 years - and the way it started was very unhealthy. long story short, I ended up in a sporting accident and needed surgery which meant I couldn't move much for 8-10 months, or at least in ways I always knew how. so why not start smoking and drinking like everyone else my age? (19 at the time). for context, my friends would describe me as switched on, socially and fairly academically intelligent, and a sociable person. I worked out since 16, played football regularly, and even volunteered in my community. I was even against smoking (I found tweets from 2011 that literally insult people smoking weed, which is hilarious tbh). 

for the next 5 years, I smoked myself into a foggy abyss. I couldn't hold down most jobs, I became unreliable to all my friends (and a burden, if we're being honest); I lost all ability to be critical and constantly jumped from one good time to another, whilst ruining relationships and friendships in the process. Everyone around me who was wising up to life and becoming more serious could instinctively  tell that I wasn't - I was smoking in any and every situation I could. No one took me seriously, because I didn't take myself seriously - dropped out of Uni, working a dead-end job with no progression, and wouldn't even take heed when those closest to me and loved me the most would try to help with getting me job interviews, etc. I even went as far as to kinda fix up my act during a job my best friend got me, only to ghost them randomly after being there 5 months because it got hard; the CEO almost berated my best pal about my random leave. I've truly been unaware and unwilling to change my ways, because I was so consistently high from smoking 4/5 joints a day. 

Fast forward to last year, and I genuinely had some life changing positive situations happen to me. I don't wanna be specific but man...I lived out my wildest dreams. That in turn made me decide what I wanted to do with my life, and I spent 2020 and 2021 trying to perfect the skills needed whilst also trying to network within the industry. bear in mind, I was still smoking a lot, thinking that a newfound purpose would somehow get rid of my problems now that I've taken myself more seriously. The people I had left around me saw this, and wholeheartedly put finance, time, and energy into me during the pandemic, when people couldn't even give that to themselves. what they did for me, still makes me cry to this day. I thought my life had a different direction and aim, but how could it? I still wasn't all there. 

20 days ago, I was so high that I ended up losing hundreds and hundreds of pounds worth of equipment that had been bought for me, and my new career. I cried for 5 days straight. deep down, I knew exactly what the problem was. I was naive to think I could continue with habits that had so clearly stopped me from growing, and becoming switched on. I let down my friends and family so much, that it really broke me. I told myself I would never smoke again.

I haven't smoked since, and really don't plan to. I've been around countless situations where people have been smoking next to me, even offered - but nah. I can't stop thinking about the people I let down, and have done over the years. I decided to draw a line in the sand.

The saddest part of this whole journey, was those around me starting to see a massive difference in not only how I communicate, but how I organise my own time, interact with others in general, and how naturally aware I am of certain situations. Not only cant I believe that I'd been giving those who loved me a lesser, dumber version of myself; but they continued to love me and help me, regardless. 

I love weed, and I've had some great experiences with it; but it truly isn't for me. and deep down, I owe it to those around me to become the person they always knew I could be.

But I've spent the last 9 months getting high every single day, walking around in a total haze, neglecting my work, friendships, health and things that were once important to me as I just wanted to go home and get high to make my problems disappear. I have realized that I unfortunately have a hopelessly addiction-prone brain (I have watched many family members destroy their lives with drugs/alcohol so know its genetic) and moderation is just not possible for me, so now it's time for me to take off my training wheels and quit weed as well.

For me, the most effective tactic has been separating myself from what I call the ""addict brain"" voice and refusing to identify with it or feed it by negotiating with it. I picture it as an annoying high school-aged kid trying to peer pressure me into doing something I don't want to do, so I can just laugh at it and let it be. It's quite clever actually and its tactics are entertaining. You know the voice: the one that says: ""You can't do this, don't be stupid, you need drugs/alcohol to bear life."" When I feel depressed the voice says: ""Drugs are the only thing that could possibly make you feel better right now. You can't handle this on your own."" When I'm feeling good she says: ""Weed addiction isn't even a real thing, one j couldn't hurt, it'll make this night so much better."" When I can't sleep: ""Come on, one toke would end this torture and make you fall asleep immediately."" When I'm bored: ""The boredom of sitting in your room sober is unbearable; come on, one hit will make it disappear."" When I eat, watch a movie, do chores or work out: ""Come on, just today, you know this would be so much better/easier high."" When I'm with friends she says: ""Come on, you're really going to be the weirdo who turns down alcohol/weed and sits there totally sober? You're making people uncomfortable."" When I'm alone she says: ""Just one bowl, it will relax you and no one will know. Just one night, and you can start sobriety over tomorrow.""

When I don't give in, the addict brain will get increasingly angry and try new tactics. She tells me weed is the only thing that will take away my mood swings and depression and that life is unbearable without it; that I'm too anxious without it and that being sober will lose me all my friends; that not smoking is going to cause me to gain weight and become unattractive; that I've always been a weak person and don't have enough willpower to get sober; that its ridiculous to be addicted to weed anyway and I'm making the whole thing up; that if I don't drink/smoke I'll never have fun again in my life; that I'm going to give in soon anyway so I might as well just do it now. The voice is *almost* more intelligent than me - she is a master of persuasion and I've lived under her thrall for years - which is what makes it so satisfying to observe her tactics and to show her that I'm not falling for any of it.

Besides just ignoring and laughing at it, I have also been countering the voice by telling myself every day that I am so proud of myself, that I'm a really strong person for getting through these withdrawals despite the depression, heartbreak and anxiety that I was cutting myself off from feeling. It feels good to know I'm really taking care of myself for the first time in ages. When I am close to giving in I remind myself that I only need to get through *this day* and *this moment* sober. When I think about having to be sober for the next few weeks or months or years I get  overwhelmed, but when I think about just needing to sit with myself for one night it feels doable.

7 days may not seem like a long time, but I'm really proud of myself, and of all of you on this journey with me :)",144

I’ve been a hard smoker for the past 6-7 years, and I mean high 24/7.  I honestly can’t remember if this is “normal” me. I struggled with anxiety and depression in the past and that’s how I got hooked on weed in the first place. I got off pharmaceuticals, felt way better and then I got hooked on weed because at first it was fun, but then I started to use it to run away from any sort of negative emotion.

My current withdrawals are affecting my job, marriage, and overall life. I read weed withdrawal timeline stuff to pass time and to think this could last into months is terrifying. 

Work has been the hardest for me. I don’t think I can keep up this exaggerated anxiety for another week 😞. I called out today and my boss has been somewhat annoyed by my behavior. I don’t feel comfortable telling them my situation as I’m in a conservative area. And even if I did, my job has clientele that I’m booked with until December (eyelash extensions). 
I don’t want to quit, i need the money & I remember liking my job when I was smoking. Now, it took a 180 and I think nothing about hating it and wanting to quit. 

How do I know if this is exaggerated anxiety or if this is me?? I don’t remember being sober nor do I remember how bad my anxiety and depression was. I have no recollection of anything. I made a lot of mistakes in my past and knew it was time to get my act together, thus, go to trade school and start something with my life. I’m fortunate to have found a job but I feel like I could potentially ruin it due to my current attitude. 

I have no desire to go back to weed nor do I have any cravings. I’m just worried how persistent this anxiety is and or how long it will last…or if this even is withdrawals!!",3

I just hit day 70 after trying to stop smoking for the better part of a year and a half, and I wanted to share some things to look forward to and what to look out for because others' stories have helped me get here. So I guess it's me paying it forward.

Paying it forward is a good way to look at quitting: you might have a rough day today, but you're helping the you of tomorrow have an easier time. This attitude has helped me, especially because I would always feel so guilty after relapsing about what stupid thing yesterday me did. The small things started piling up for me (clean bed, clean clothes, etc.) and other tasks I thought were harder became more manageable.  


If you smoked a lot / often, then make sure to fill that time with other activities. Weed was a time sink for me and I always hated how I never had time (or was sober enough to do things). Replace getting high with things you enjoy doing, things you wanted to get back into, or things you always wanted to try. This was the most helpful thing for me (both for quitting and rediscovering who I was before being a stoner). I used to spend 8 hours a day on weed, but now I dedicate that time to things I know are good for me and that will get me to where I want to be.  


The cravings will come, they will be rough, BUT they will pass. I seriously loved weed for many reasons, but I know it isn't good for me and often my cravings are responses to stress. If you feel a craving, acknowledge it, let go of it, and if you can't, set a stopwatch for 30min and see if you still crave then. I usually forget all about it by then. I still have cravings, but you slowly learn to deal with them and they do become less frequent.  


Lastly, this process takes time and it won't magically change one day. It's a growing process and you get to grow more every day. Don't feel discouraged if it takes you a few tries or if the first few days are miserable; seeds spend some time under the earth before they grow, mature and then blossom. Lots of us are dealing with more than just quitting weed, and you should be proud of your effort and accomplishments every day. I know I am of all of you :)  


Stay strong, keep doing your best, and thank you all for your support and sharing your experiences. I hope something here helps somebody out.",24

Tried countless times to quit but was not able to quit for more than 3 days at any time. Life was obviously miserable, reached rock bottom, thrown out of jobs, wife almost left, tons of close friends to 0 friends, was mostly written off and given up all hope of any comeback, ceasing to exist was always a desirable option, added with depression life was a living hell.

It did turn around, managed to quit 1 final time and haven't looked back yet. Although life is not 100% what it used be(it might never be, have to get used to that) but lots of things are better, at least i am not in a brain fog and mood is much better with less or no cravings. Still feel the emptiness and can't imagine how will i continue without getting that kick from day to day tasks but hopeful it will be better once my base dopamine levels are back to normal. 

What helped me was doing some research on depression and addiction. Understanding how dopamine works and how THC affects the neuro-modulators of our body, in short understanding the biology and chemistry of how our body works and how depression and thc(read addiction) affects it. Also tried to understand how it all started in the first place (Few episodes of extreme stress was the cause, which is the cause in most of the cases), hence managing stress much better now. Most importantly understanding how important sleep is and how it helps in reseting these underlying systems in our body, how it helps in reseting levels of dopamine and serotonin , how it helps in overcoming stress, how it helps in forgetting and not living in the past, how it helps in facing the emotion(which were swept under the rug since last 7 years so feels like feeling emotions for the first time after 7 years) and why is it important to understand the mechanism of emotions and welcome it with open arms and use it to your advantage.

Living under addiction and depression kind of makes u comfortable and not care a shit about anything else and we tend to derive pleasure from our misery even though life around us is in a complete mess, whereas living a sober and productive life is tough like super difficult to the point that we fall back to our comfort zone. It all seems pointless to be sober and not worth the effort but its definitely worth trying to see and feel the other side as well and then to make a judgement on how to continue.

Not planning to smoke again till i right all the wrongs i have done with myself, my body and my loved ones.

I’ve been clean a little over six months. I noticed when I first quit that my REM sleep was off the charts and I was sleeping like ten hours a night (when I didn’t experience insomnia lol) and that’s been something that has stuck around after all these months. I’m still waking up super groggy mid-dream most mornings after nearly ten hours of rock hard sleep. 

Idk maybe it’s my depression which I definitely used weed to self medicate? For context I’m in therapy and have also mentioned this to my doctor who wasn’t super helpful… 

Just curious if anyone here has experienced the overcompensated REM sleep stuff this long out after quitting? Thanks in advance 😘",3

I am getting cravings and thoughts of going back to the country where i could smoke so freely. Thats really not an option right now tho.

I spent hours just looking up the availability of hallucinogens in the region and where i might be able to try them. I have no issues with sleep or appetite or any physical issues. Its just i want to feel different for a while. Right now wanting to be in different headspace is taking up majority of my thoughts, and i dont really know how to deal. This is usually where i would relapse but being in a country where weed is of shit quality and extremely expensive is sort a forcing me to be sober.

I have been googling and scrolling through reddit and somehow I have read a lot of articles and reddit comments stating that any withdrawal symptoms like raised anxiety, nausea, fogged brain, easy irritantions, mood swings and loss of appetite is fake or exxagerated.  And that people that are having trouble quitting are just used to a certain habit and thats it. 

I'm 41 hours into quitting and would just like to understand what is likely to come now that I have smoked daily from age 14 to 25. 

Is it really just a matter of having trouble with the change of a long lasting habit or are there actual facts to back up that its more than me just being a whiny bitch and that there is data that shows there actually is stuff happening with the body during quitting periods. 

**Question 1:** What can I based on facts, expect from the coming next weeks in terms of withdrawal symptoms ?

After 12+ years of almost daily smoking, bags of Money wasted and time gone down the shitter I’m proud to say I’ve just hit 6 months.

Was it an easy journey? Absolutely not! Especially the beginning fucking sucked.

Do I feel better about myself and my current life? My god yes! 100%

Do I still think about smoking every day like I used to when I was still puffing away? Nope, not at all. Crazy to think that it doesnt even take much at this point to not do it. 

Pro tip: my biggest and most important realisation was that I’m one of those persons who can’t smoke in moderation. I can never do that shit again and at first in my mind that was a hard pill to swallow. With time you get to the point where you realise There are so many great things in life i (still) can do. A lot of those things took a backseat because my addiction was a priority. And objectively, now the haze has cleared, I can safely say smoking on the daily wasn’t as fun as I Made it out to be. In fact it sucked big time. Stop romantisizing that shit people.

Anyways, I hope a couple of you can get some encouragement out of these words. Hang in there guys! It all gets a lot easier. Weed is for dummies :D Peace from Holland ✌🏻",50

Making it this far has not been an easy matter. It required a lot of focus on active recovery and abstinence, and maintaining my mental health. I battle many neurodivergences and mental illnesses, and have relapsed on my mental health many times in my battle with addiction. Fortunately, it has not resulted in relapse. I did a lot of work to establish resources and connections in the recovery community (attending support groups and online meetings, and acquiring a sponsor and sober living environment, all early in recovery), which fortunately kept me sober in the difficult times. In our recovery, we ride waves. It is all through learning how to ride waves and face fear and character defects that we begin the process of recovery. I couldn't navigate these hurdles without my higher power (community, connection to life, and structure, in balance). 

In my addiction, I faced problems within myself. I used substances to suspend myself in a haze. I believed that they kept me docile and amiable in the face of trauma, transphobia, queerphobia, life obstacles, anxiety, and my character defects. In reality, they kept me distracted. In the worst of it, I battled intense rumination (still do, yay bipolar disorder), paranoia, and cynicism. It kept me trapped. It kept me imprisoned. It kept me struggling to hold onto the will to live. Honestly, weed and alcohol might as well been another substance entirely when combined. I was inhaling up to two grams of wax a day, a quarter ounce, and/or a bottle of vodka, day and night. I've smoked an entire ounce in one night; I've smoked in my car and under bridges, and in my mother's house. I was itchy, restless, paranoid, depressed, and suicidal. Substances robbed me of the ability to live and see myself. 

In the worst of it, I've faced homelessness. I've dropped out of school. I've lived in a hall closet. I finally broke when my sister broke. She was about to kick me out of her hall closet. ""It's like you're a ghost, and you died, and I don't know what killed you or how to save you"". It woke me up from my self-loathing stupor. I couldn't lose her, not again. 

I started attending groups. When those failed to keep me sober, I attended rehab. I moved into sober living. I found a sponsor. Most importantly, I did my best to establish and hold onto a community of addicts, who understood exactly where I was coming from and where I was struggling.

I've made mistakes, and I've had victories. Fortunately, my new relationship thrived in my sobriety; though, if it had gone sour, it could have been the end of me. I completed my transition. I started work for the first time. I started mending the relationship I have with my mother. ""Easy does it,"" is the phrase, but sometimes life finds a way to be most challenging. 

"" This year is the hard year"". I say so to myself, to keep myself going. Just one more minute. Just one more hour, day, week, month, year. Just one more prayer, phone call, or crying session. Just one more time, I will face my demons instead of escaping them. I have the power to lean on my higher power one more time. I have the power to reach out. I have the power to act to save my life.

If you're lurking and wondering if you have the strength to do this... You do! 

Is it gonna suck at first? Yes! But it sucks less and less as time goes on. Especially as you notice how quickly your mind starts to clear. At 103 days in, I do still have some brain fog, but now it strengthens my resolve to stay weed-free instead of making me wanna grab my bong.

For the 1st few weeks I didn't have any drive to play guitar (my life's passion), and it scared me, but a bit later, I passed some invisible mental milestone and picked it back up. Several weeks later, my playing is more precise, and even though I thought I felt ""more creative"" with weed, I actually notice that now it's easier to think of a different mode to play on-the-fly, etc. I guess weed does sort of help to ""get in the zone,"" but I was *less able to do anything with it*, if that makes sense.

It’s taken me a long time to come to terms with the fact that I have an addiction issue. I’ve always been able to smoke and it not interfere with my work or school, even winning awards at my firm for my work. 

But recently I have started gaining more weight and I binge eat whenever I smoke, which is daily. I’ve come to realize that although I’ve been functional with work, weed has had a big impact on my ability to build relationships and be vulnerable with people. 

I quit smoking last year for almost a full semester, lost 20 lbs and felt really good about it. (I’m an MBA and was preparing for drug tests). I got disheartened around Christmas last year because I hadn’t landed my internship yet and decided to start smoking again. I immediately jumped full fledge back into addictive behavior and serious binge eating.

Now will be my first day going sober again, with the intent of completely quitting forever. I’ve realized I can’t just chill smoke, but I honestly feel like a loss is happening. It’s been such a big part of my life for so long, it’s like losing a friend. 

This post isn’t as much about my complaints quite yet as just admitting I have a problem and that I’m trying to get better. I’ve felt a lot of support from reading this group, and it feels good to know I’m not the only one.

It was bad after high school (2019 graduate) but now it’s just lonely since all my pothead friends won’t care too much to be around me.

I have spent the last two or three years in a weedy haze, and I only just found clarity. So excuse the incredibly long post, but I have a lot to reflect on and it just needs to be out there for someone to care about.

I used to smoke constantly with friends, or one in particular. We’d go roll a few spliffs somewhere scenic and play music and chat, have a walk, maybe get some food, it would be pretty nice! Then the pandemic happened, and I found out my older brother smoked a fair little bit of weed. Soon we’re smoking bongs every night together, I’m smoking way more and more aggressively than him as I was actively dealing with some terrible trauma - just smoking his money away, because although we went splits usually, I practically just smoked what was there. He definitely ended up paying for 70% of our weed at least. I feel so guilty about this still, and he told me multiple times he feels dreadfully guilty for fuelling/enabling it. I always gave this the ‘it’s no problem, duuuude, i can quit wheneverrr! sure we’ll cut down, no problem chill out’ attitude. Embarrassing and manipulative of me, looking back.

Anyway.. I continued smoking lots through college, which I started halfway through the pandemic. I think I struggle with ADHD and autism, but they have not been diagnosed; I also have pretty extreme anxiety and depression, diagnosed far before I began smoking. The weed weakened my trauma’s grip on me and it felt so good, to just dissolve into bed stoned, and not think. 
But with the world such a mess and my mind even messier I ended up in an incredibly sleep deprived, stressed out, anxious state. Smoking literally was all I liked or looked forward to or wanted to have in common with people.

One day I hadn’t slept, hadn’t had water in a good while, or eaten anything for over a day. I went to smoke with my brother, I was feeling a bit weird and shaky but assumed it was the cold and lit up; my first bong, the normal amount of tobacco and weed as I always used. It wasn’t anything special. I soon lit up another, and after that one, suddenly I couldn’t get my hand to let go of my phone and I was just knocking it on the table. I started talking and the words came out completely wrong, or not at all. I panicked, I dropped my phone, and I started seizing, sat in a chair. My brother was literally holding my face and saying my name asking if I could hear him or breathe. I could, I just had no control of the seizing and couldn’t speak. He really wanted us to quit smoking after that, and I didn’t quit. I honestly thought that seizure was going to kill me when I had it, and I went on to induce perhaps 10 more in the same way over time. I eventually quit college and after a couple months stopped having them totally. I think they were induced by the tobacco mainly and those exact no sleep no food circumstances more than anything, but it was the weed habit making me keep risking another one; I didn’t get them if I smoked a cigarette (sometimes I’d smoke one first just to not have a seizure.) I still don’t know fully why I had those, and why I STILL didn’t quit. Towards the end my vision would be pixelated black, I wouldn’t know if my eyes were open or shut, gasping for air with no sound and no control over my seizing limbs. It was scary but I’ll be honest, I think I hoped having another would off me one day.

I ended up moving house, with my mum. Still within the UK but a 10 hour drive away. Around the 10th of Oct. He’s living in his own flat now, and has barely smoked; I brought my glass bong and some weed (like 4grams left now) he helped me vacuum seal, and my grinder. Since we’ve been here I’ve only had a handful of sneaky bowls out the window, and one joint on a walk, and it’s been a stressful paranoid shitshow to cover up the smell every time. I need to get a job soon, and I can’t be the stoner who’s always late and high. I forgot how bad and STRONG it smells, too. And these very infrequent smokes ive had compared to my nonstop habit of the last two or more years.. they have made me realise I’m not happy when I smoke, I’m just distracted. It doesn’t *really* go away. 

So I want to give up and start treating my mind and body better than this. Registering to a doctor and a dentist soon with the help of my mum (still don’t know how to tell her about.. any of it), hopefully going to get a job nearby, eating mindfully and slowly getting my real appetite back. Picking up vaping instead of cigs, doing active happy creative things in my spare time instead of just.. zonking out. 

I want to get myself back and heal properly, and be there for my family. I do wonder what damage I’ve done to myself. If anyone knows about these seizures, by the way, ever had them or saw someone have one.. please tell me anything you know about them, and if I could’ve fucked up my brain. Thanks for reading, so much. Seriously. <3",4

I've set the goal to not consume any drugs beside caffeine and nicotine this year after indulging in alcohol, weed and occasionally hard drugs as well over the past 3 years. I haven't followed through, exactly, but I'm still on a great path. 

I drank about 10-14 days this year, and smoked weed about as much as well, mostly both in conjunction. Usually it's because of me not being able to tolerate my friend group consuming while I stay sober, so I gently cut them off on my birthday a few days ago. I will not go to the parties anymore, only meet with them on a person-to-person basis when they want to see me. 

It's very scary due to them having been almost all of my current friends and I ""only"" have 3 friends which don't tempt me with consuming weed/alcohol right now, but I trust that my newly found confidence and enjoyment in life will lead me to a tribe which feels safer and like the home I've been missing all my life. 

My first few relapses made me feel depressed, guilty and numb, but the more I fall down, the easier it gets to get back up, I think this is very important. 


My message:
Guilt and/or feeling ""on autopilot"" is fine after a relapse. Learning to face those feelings head on is one of the most important parts of getting sober. Growth is not linear.

Getting back to being sober after relapsing is like doing an extra hard incline push up, and dealing with your emotions and seeing if you can find triggers for the relapse are like using the proper form as well.. even harder, but more rewarding. 


I wish you guys the best of luck and I want you to know that you're loved, valued and safe even when you feel like you don't deserve any of those attributes. 💖✌🏻",2

Answer is probably no, but it's not slowing down my brain. I've often said if I give it an inch it'll take a mile. This time could be different though! Clearly this drug has no hold on me since I was disciplined for 6 months /s

If I do use and set a 2 week cool down, I'm sure I'll be staring at the clock and counting down the seconds every week. And set a rule that I can use only twice in a day. Well you be damn sure I'll be maximizing that in whatever way I can justify.

Why does it feel so hard right now? I've never really believed that I'll never get high again and I can't convince my brain that now isn't the time.

The very last week leading up to me quitting I went through about $300 dollars worth of Shatter, Live Resin and Dab Pens and Carts. (Which honestly now seems absolutely stupid.) The few things I feel grateful for over the last few days are definitely, having more time to be present with the people I love, less impulsivity, able to hold conversations with people, and just an overall realization that I was destroying myself but now I am healing myself.

Main reason for quitting is I’ve been really struggling to learn my trade. I would sit for hours studying and just wasn’t able to retain much information if any. This has been going on for years, on the job training and everything I’m sure my ADD is also a contributing factor but the weed was just keeping me in that much more of a fog. Night time has been very challenging for me, at times the urge to toke up has been unbearable. Kinda seems like I’m rambling but it’s a great feeling to just have a group of people to talk to who understand where I’m coming from. The vivid dreams are already coming back to me which has been pretty neat. In the morning I can tell I’m a lot more upbeat and energetic. I’m really hoping I can stick with this and not relapse.

2021-11-02 14:55:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qlbcu6/day_one_again/,Day One... Again,"Hey all. Long-time lurker, first-time poster here.

I'll be turning 22 in two weeks, and I've been smoking weed daily for nearly four years now. 

It started during my first year of university, as I lived in the dorms on campus and my three roommates were all stoners. At first, it was just a fun thing that I did on the weekends, but by the end of the school-year I was smoking at least every-other-day. Then when I finished the school-year I spent the summer smoking daily and have continued since.

I've tried quitting so many times that I've lost count now. My first attempt to quit was New Years 2020, and I'm really hoping I won't have to make ""no more weed"" my New Years resolution for a third consecutive year two months from now. 

I struggle a lot with anxiety, and tend to use weed as a coping mechanism. This is one of the main reasons I've failed every time so far. I just get so anxious and overwhelmed and I end up convincing myself that smoking up to ease the discomfort is better than being sober but miserable. But of course the problem is that smoking weed to cope with anxiety doesn't actually help solve anything, it just allows me to hide from the anxiety temporarily. So inevitably this just leads me to smoke more and more, and its gotten to the point that I hardly get baked anymore. I often smoke four back-to-back bowls of weed (about 1g) just to get a decent buzz. 

The other reason I always end up failing is productivity and motivation. Believe it or not, I find myself more productive and motivated when I'm smoking daily than when I'm trying to quit. When daily smoking, I at least have the discipline to wait until the evening to smoke up. So usually my routine is to get up in the morning and spend the day being productive, and then to smoke up later and spend the evening ""chilling"" (being baked and watching YouTube / playing videogames). If / when I get anxious during the day, the fact that I have my evening smoke session waiting for me is enough to motivate me to keep working. But when I try to quit, that end-of-the-day reward is gone, and I find it impossible to stay motivated. As usual, I get super anxious during the day, and then knowing that I can't use weed to escape at the end of the day just makes me even more anxious. 

In the end, I always end up convincing myself that being a productive stoner is better than being sober but anxious and unproductive. But I am so tired of living this life. It's such a routine. Sure, the weed helps me cope with anxiety and helps motivate me to get to the end of the day, but it also puts so many constraints on my life. I'm insanely inflexible as a result, and basically respond to anything that could threaten my evening smoke session as an existential threat. It also means I have very few healthy ways of coping with my anxiety, as I'm entirely reliant on weed to do that for me right now.

So anyways, that's my story so far. I'm posting here because I'm going to try to quitting again, starting today. I had originally planned to make November 1st my day one, but couldn't even make it through the one day. So I'm trying again today, and I'm hoping that by posting here I'll feel more accountable.

The craving is gone. Weeks go by and i don't even think about weed. For the people around me, i'm a different person. I don't even smoke cigarettes anymore.

On the inside, i'm calm and gentle. Focused. Determined. Diligent. I go to bed early and rise early, something i despised all my life has become my favourite thing. Now i grab the day by its balls and seize it, i bend it to my will.

On the outside, i've changed as well. After years of only managing a patchy stubble, i've grown a thick full beard. Maybe its healthy living, maybe enough sleep. 
One year of working out has turned my body into a temple of steel, i've gained about 15kg of mass, mostly muscles. I walk with my head held high, not slouched over, hoping nobody sees i'm high. My eyes and teeth are white, not red and brown. I'm attractive.

My relationship went from ""we're about to break up"" to ""we're marrying next summer and expect our 3rd child"". After 13 years together, we're as in love as when we first met. From hardly any sex we're back to every day.
She says she has the ""real"" me back, the one she got to know back then, before i started smoking every day. It moves me to tears thinking how i jeopardized my relationship for a drug, how much i hurt her with the things i said. I'll forever be grateful she gave our family a second chance.

And it all started here, more than a year ago. Joined this sub, read stories, decided i want to change my life.

Even before smoking I’d be in my room staring outside because that’s all there is to do. Im an outgoing and popular person but most of any old highschool friends are still out of state for college or because they’re living their life. 

I’m still finishing up my class albeit it’s the last one before my degree. But holy shit all my life has ever been is school, work, and boredom. My closest friend is wealthy (or his family I should say) into the multi million dollar range. Yet jethro never does anything except work in his dad’s business warehouse ever since finishing his college half a year ago. Like literally he’s only there so he’s not a disappointment to his parents for being a bum that watches anime and plays video games. So I can’t even have him help me by at least taking his kayaks and hanging out together or taking his boat out for a day in the sun. 

Ever since my other close friend moved to the other corner of the USA, no one’s been getting together how they used to. So I can’t just rally our drinking friends because they all went their own way. So basically I have no social group. The girls that want to hang with me are just looking to be fed a dinner and fucked and it’s so obvious that I’m not even making an effort at THAT social life. Been there done that and I’m bored of it. So no gf means no women at all because they’re all the same around here. 

The only time I’m not thinking of cannabis is when I’m distracted with a good project or job. Then it’s back to boredom at home. 

My little brother spends all his fucking time on his PC doing stocks even tho he sits there for hours and makes like $30 in one day. Like at least if you’re going to sit there and not hangout with me (continuing my abysmal boredom) then be good at stocks. I’m still building my pc so I can’t even play video games to distract myself. And unfortunately I work at 5 so day drinking can’t even happen. Quitting is so fucking lame. Yeah I’m SO ecstatic I did.

But I did it because I have had a couple of shitty weeks at work. TLDR would be: colleague used drugs at work, I tried to help him keep his job, he now blames me, I ended up with a disciplinary somehow. 

So that has made me angryyyyy as fuck. Played golf with my dad and mate and was angry/pissed all day. No fun at all. Hated myself for that. So I got some weed from a mate. And some more from another. Worked sat and sun but got high as hell afterwards. And today I am fighting the urge to pick up again. When I get brief glimpses into where the craving is coming from, it’s anger. I want to fucking smoke so much I can’t feeeel. I want to wake up tomorrow feeling like a sack of shit, and roll over and just bake up again. Smoking on the face of it is so chill, sad, slow. But my reasons are spectacularly catastrophic.

I quit weed around 6 weeks ago since it was just dragging me down. I would just sit at home all day and not do anything productive at all. Just playing games or watching youtube because it distracted me of what i should be doing. 

To me, I'm now 23 years old and finished school 5 years ago. Since then i havent done anything for my future besides occasionally working in order to have money to buy weed. Tried to go to college but depression and the anxiety of not being able to make it made me not commit fully into it but falling into old patterns. 

6 weeks ago my dealer stopped selling and at first I was frustrated because I would have to find another. Seeing myself stressing out because i wouldn't have anything to smoke made me think if it's really worth it or if I should take the opportunity and just stop. So I did because it gave me peace and freedom from pursuing weed and the financial burden it put on me. 

Now it's almost 6 weeks since i haven't smoked and I didn't really had a hard time quitting. Still have a tiny bit of weed but I dont have the urge at all to smoke. I feel more free not being dependant on it. Nevertheless I am still as depressed and hopeless as of before quitting. I am still doing pretty much nothing with the only difference being that I'm not high. The new semester at my college started a month ago and i thought quitting would give me some motivation to pursue my goals. But i still feel as lost as before.

So I am 25 and I have used weed regularly for almost four years, not always daily but almost every other weekend and sometimes daily. All my closest friends smoke. But I just can't ignore anymore how much it is hindering me to develop, to gain confidence, to connect with people. I just need weed as my comfort blanket to deal with life. And that's not how it is supposed to be. I have tried and failed to have a break or quit several times. The longest I've gone without during these four years must be one or two months.   
I feel constant guilt, because I know I am hindering myself from dealing with my depression and other issues and stopping myself from reaching my full potential because I smoke. Yesterday I decided to quit, waked and baked and then told myself, this is it. Contacted my doctor and want to get professional help. I also talked with my mom, who knows I smoke but came clean about reaching a point where I admit I have a problem and that I want to stop.  
Smoking weed recently fucked up a relationship, there were several problems but I realized that I'll never meet a good partner and be able to create a family if I don't have my shit together.  
I want to be more disciplined with exercise, routine and food, and as long as I smoke that is impossible.  


If I keep using weed as a comfort blanket I won't ever face my real problems and never grow. This time I am really committed to stopping. I'm really afraid though, can I deal with reality without weed? Can I do this? I know I can and I know that once I reach the one-month sober mark I will feel so good about myself and it will really help my self-esteem.

Rain is pouring,

Wind is blowing,

Weed’s made me numb,

Weed’s time devouring,

Trees decide to shed their leaves,

There is never a good time to leave,

I wish everyone the best of luck in their journey.

I seem to be at my wits end here.  In the past, I had psychosis that went untreated.  However over the course of a year or so I recovered.  Somehow.  I just ended up being okay one day as if it never happened.  However, after about half a year of being psychotic, I ended up continuing to use cannabis to help deal with disturbing thoughts.  The symptoms of psychosis eventually just faded away.

Fast forward 4 years, and I quit marijuana/nicotine going on 4 months now.   I got my anxiety under control for a few weeks, then over the last couple of months I've gotten progressively worse.  Recently I've had so many panic attacks, I've lost count.  My intrusive thoughts are running amok.  I can't concentrate on anything, only continue to worry and generate more ""what ifs"" and deal with a never ending amount of disturbingly negative thoughts, doubt, and lord knows what else.  Yes, I've consulted a doctor and am on medication...and I even reached out to a hypnotherapist and a psychiatrist today.  But holy shit fuck, I felt so much terror and confusion lately, that earlier today at a certain point, it just all seemed to slow down.  Like I became numb to everything, as if I'm just so lost, it doesn't matter anymore.  Still having bizarre thoughts related to my psychosis years ago, however I'm aware that something is wrong and I just can't seem to gain any ground.  My hope is that I can at least maintain this level of calm until I finally am able to see someone.

Anyone ever experience anything like that?  Am I losing it?  This is probably the hardest experience of my life, as I can't even imagine how I'm going to get back to normal one day.  I'm wondering if I'm already passed the point of help.

I really don't mean to be a Debbie downer, but I have to exhaust all my resources and reach out for help in any form.  It is SO hard to get mental counseling right now, and I have to continue to wait.  I used weed for 14 years (I'm 30 now).",2

I started smoking daily towards the end of high school. There was a year or two towards the end of college where I gave it up, only to start smoking daily again a few years ago. Earlier this year I stopped for four months... then slowly drifted back.

For the times that I have stopped and made it a significant amount of time, I've told myself that I'd be stopping for good.

After stopping for a month earlier this year, I came to the conclusion that what I'd really like would be to smoke occasionally. I tried that for two weeks, and it was terrible. Whenever I smoked, the urges to smoke in the following days became much stronger so I'd just spend the whole week waiting to smoke again.

I just found this subreddit today, and I'm so glad I did! I'm ready to give weed up for good, even if I relapse, I'm going to keep trying. I can't moderate my usage of weed, and I'm tired of the shame that comes along with smoking.

Oh also, if any of you like philosophy, I recommend Nicomachean Ethics by Aristotle, as I've been reading it lately and it's helping me evaluate myself as a person. In Aristotle's terminology, I'm 'incontinent' (lol) as I've deliberated that I should stop, but I've failed many times to stop due to my strong appetite to be high.

I've posted here a few times about how horrible I've been feeling while I was quitting and how I felt super alone because I was too ashamed to tell my closest support system, my family, what was going on with me. I smoked daily for a year and a half, partially while I was living under my parents roof, and they specifically had asked me not to smoke at home so I felt deep, deep, guilt about that. Another part of the guilt is that my mom is a recovering alcoholic who's talked to me about her struggles with addiction and how she really never wanted me to go through that. I felt like getting addicted to weed after she warned me was the most disappointing this I could do. I felt like a failure of a daughter.

Well, I went on a trip with my family the day after I quit (partially on purpose to remove my access to weed) with the full intention of continuing to hide my addiction until I was sober. I wanted to tell her after I quit so she would be proud of me, you know? However, on one night of this trip family tensions got high and we all got in a late night argument. My family is pretty healthy so we usually debrief after we fight, so my dad came into my room and sat down to talk to me about how I was feeling. I started talking about emotional intelligence, and he looked at me and said ""You don't realize how smart you are. I'm so proud of you, you know that?""

I burst into tears. I felt like such a disingenuous liar, that he was sitting there looking at me as a model daughter while I had been smoking under his roof and lying to his face. All I could keep thinking is ""I'm not smart, I'm a drug addict.""

I couldn't stop crying, and he kept hugging me and asking me what was wrong, and it just all came out at once. I told him everything. I braced myself for anger and disappointment... and nothing came.

He said it was alright. He said he still loved me, and he would never stop loving me, and he wasn't mad or disappointed at all. He said he was just so proud of me for trying to quit, and for being able to tell him. I couldn't believe it--for months I had been having nightmare scenarios in my head about telling them and having them cry, or be so sad for me, or be angry about things I did when I was in active addiction. He just kept saying he loved me, and that he wouldn't tell my mom but that I should talk to her, and she wouldn't be mad either.

I said maybe I would, but later that night I was laying in bed and just couldn't stop sobbing to myself. I felt like I had to tell her. So I got up, and she was actually still up as well, even though it was midnight, sitting in the library. I asked her to talk outside, and even though I couldn't get any words out for the first few minutes she waited patiently and let me get it all out.

And she wasn't mad or disappointed or sad either. She hugged me and comforted me and it felt like this huge guilt and shame I had been holding started to lift off my shoulders. She said she was so, so proud that I came and talked to her, and that she was going to help me through my withdrawals, and basically hugged me and told me she loved me. I told her how bad my withdrawals were and she immediately booked me a doctor's appointment. She started looking up meetings for me to go to, and said when we got home she would come help me clean my place out of any weed left there. Most importantly, she left it all up to me--she kept asking how she could help, what I was okay with, what I wanted to do. 

I've never felt more loved. I'm not saying this would happen in every scenarios, but if any of you guys are similarly terrified to tell people you love, just know that it could turn out this positively. Both my parents keep checking in and reminding me how much they love me. My mom even helped me clean my whole room when she saw the depression pit I was living in. They brought me my favorite drinks, and my mom brought me to an AA meeting (would recommend, or an NA one), and I just feel more hopeful than I have in years. I actually think things might get better, even though the cravings are kicking my ass and I'm throwing up everything I eat and I haven't felt such overwhelming depression since before I started smoking.

I quit for two months a couple of times in 2012 and 2013. Worst insomnia ever, which is usually my downfall. After four days of no weed and no sleep, I left work one day because I was delirious. I work in a machine shop, so delirious = danger for me and others.

I don't have much to add. There was a time when I would have had a long story about how bad it has been for me, but for me that is counterproductive. No more beating myself up. Just leads to more weed.

When I say I want to quit forever, I mean it. I have heard some say that if they had a time machine to go back and feel like it did back then...

I used to agree, but if I had a time machine now, I would go back and pass that pipe right along to the next guy, and never hit it.

Need help please,"I just need a bit of support here, I have quit before after 15 years and it didn't feel as difficult as this (not cravings, but sleepwise) I went back on it for around 3 months and I'm 9 days off it and fucked.

Iv had severe REM rebound for the last 5 days, like severe. Last night for example was day 5 of REM (any other time Iv had REM its been two days MAX, wtf?) and I litterally had about 20 nightmares last night, waking up every half an hour or less just to go back into a different fucked up dream, and repeat. No cold sweats at all this time, just really really fucked up dreams like, to the point I got out of bed at 5am this morning and went to work an hour before I was suppose to start just so I would stop dreaming, work seemed like the better nightmare to go to.

Theres no way at all I am in this much REM debt after three months?? 

I've spent around £60 on all sorts of supplements/vitamins which I am not going to name as its not allowed here, Just to try and help, I've been eating healthy, etc etc

Plus I cannot fucking shit again and I'm constipated to fuck.

The fuck is going on here? When I quit after 15 years for the first time it wasn't anywhere near as irritable as this was, I'm back on it few months and quit and its 10x worse? 

I'm confused and pissed off cause Iv had about 100 nightmares since Thursday night and its really really fuckin draining me and affecting work too, if I have another night like last night tonight I think I am going to crack.

2021-11-01 14:14:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qkk1fv/advice_that_ive_been_given_thats_helped_me_the/,Advice that I've been given that's helped me the most...," 

>I remember when I was trying to encourage myself to quit, I’d come on to this subreddit and feel overwhelmed with the amount of struggle that other people were facing with their quitting journey. I would say, “How can they deal with this pain?” But remember: this subreddit exists to relieve a lot of peoples’ most painful feelings so they can receive support from the community. And THAT, that support, is such a beautiful thing. We, as a community of soon-to-be-ex-stoners and ex-stoners, are in this together and we believe in you and support you.  
So here’s the advice and words of hope that have really helped me along they way... take what works for you, leave what doesn't. Best of luck along your journey.  
>  
>  
1.) Be prepared. Don’t quit out of self loathing and then provide yourself with NO resources. It’s OK to say one day I will quit, and until that day I will prepare myself with knowledge and resources. Have support groups info under your belt (comment here if you’re having trouble finding any and I’ll help you). Buy yourself some light snacks or bottled smoothies for when you’re having trouble eating. Treat yourself to bubble bath or a new pillow or heck a new pet!—something soothing and comfortable for when you’re tired and bummed out. Buy a book about recovery, and read it before you quit. Main point here, BE PREPARED!  
>  
>2.) Find the right motivation. Quit because you believe in something— like that you deserve a life full of energy. Because one day you want to have a family and you want to be the best version of yourself for them. Because you have dreams that deserve your whole heart and attention. Because you are a strong person deserving of love and meaning that you can create in the world. Anything that truly inspires you. Write these words down, post them on your wall, and when you are struggling remind yourself of who you are and what REALLY motivates you in life.   
>  
>3.) The type of thinking I would avoid: how come they can smoke and I can’t? What’s wrong with me? They say it’s ok… they say it’s medicinal… they say it’s just fun… so it should be that way for me too! I am sorry. It’s not fair. But it will be OK. That kind of thinking only strengthens the belief that you are weak, or that everyone else deserves fun and joy while you are broken. Ah… you see actually you are special. You have insight about the ways this substance doesn’t allow you to live the life you love and to be present for yourself in the ways you deserve. It may work for them, but that doesn’t mean the substance is infallible. Trust your intuition, your mind and body-- because we all have our individual experiences that are worthy of being believed.  
4.) Know that just because it may be sad and hard doesn’t mean you can’t do it and doesn’t mean it isn’t WORTH doing. I know this substance has been your ‘friend’ for a long time. A friend who you believed was supporting you and was there for you when you were down. This ‘friend’ cannot provide you with the attention, support and love that you can provide yourself. When I have a craving or when I am missing my ‘friend’ I say to myself, “the anxiety and pain that I feel now in recovery, is nothing compared to the years of anxiety and pain that marijuana has caused me.”  
>  
>5.) Relapsing doesn’t make you weak, a failure or any other horrible thing you might think. It means you are human— and as humans we cannot be perfect nor should we strive to be. Relapse means you are learning and have more to learn (and that’s life, baby). Relapse means next time you will be better prepared. Relapse can teach you the greatest gift of all: self forgiveness. You deserve every ounce of forgiveness and understanding. You are not broken— in fact, you are full of self love and motivation that is already a light inside of you and that will one day burn like the brightest star. Remind yourself that what you’re doing is charging that light with more and more power. You are already brilliant… from here that brilliance only has room to grow.   
>  
>  
And so, with all of the love and tenderness in my heart, with the absolute vulnerability of understanding this intensely emotional process... I want you to know that I see you... and while I may not know your individual pains and struggles, I do know you contain galaxies of possibilities within you.   
>  
>I never thought I could do it, but with preparation and right motivation and good support systems, here I am! And you have all of that potential as well. Ok, ok that's finally it! Good luck on your journey, dear reader.",39

I abused weed for 7 years (20+ joints a day) and I finally stopped for good 6 months ago.

It feels like I've lost my mind ever since.

It is very hard to memorize or recall things, to understand things (whether written or spoken), I find it hard to form coherent sentences (whether written or spoken), and I lost my internal monologue.

Is anyone of you dealing with this or have dealt with this and finally got their cognitive functions back? I feel useless day in day out..

I wanted to cave in last night during Halloween but read a post here by u/sarah420silva about questioning myself afterwards if I did give in. Asking yourself questions like “are you happy you did this?” And “what happens tomorrow?”. The realness of being your own gatekeeper kind of excites me in a new way. I was not asking myself the tough questions before. I think now with this new approach I can at least see myself from another angle and how I need help and damn, I’m starting to realize that I love myself more than I ever knew. I need to help this guy out. As flawed as I am, I know this is hard with the help of all you great people. Knowing we all struggle has been a light for me. Thank you for sharing and keep doing the little things that help you stay sober.

I’m 52F and Canadian so weed is legal here now and easy to get.  I’ve been smoking daily for almost 15 years, the last two years virtually 24x7 since WFH started.   I was smoking up to about 2-3 grams per day. I have a great job with a Fortune 500 company so you could say I’m a high performing addict, or at least I was until the pandemic hit.  Now I’m really struggling with attention span and an overall feeling of just not giving a sh*t about anything anymore so I know depression has set in too.   If I keep this up, I will lose my job and I know it. 

I have let weed cloud my judgement and mask things I did not want to face for too long, and it is time to get my life back.  Going to take this minute by minute, hour by hour, day by day and hopefully it will get easier.  

Thanks for reading.

EDIT: first day went well.  I kept busy last night and  the cravings didn’t seem to bother me much.  I am craving cigarettes though but I am not getting that monkey on my back again.   One day done ✅

Im 31, and have been smoking recreationally for 5 years, and then consistently for 5 years after that. There isn’t really a day that goes by that that I wouldn’t smoke. And I mean the strong stuff gorilla glue, cookies etc. just only when my day is winding down. 

I have never been a daytime smoker unless there was a good reason to do so. I like feeling sober during the day as much as I like to feel high at night. That was always my excuse to myself that I’m not a stoner. Stoners need weed all the time to function right? Well a combination of that and my need to sleep on que was feeding my addiction. 

I recent used a vacation to take some time and stop smoking. I need to tell you that the withdrawal is STRONG. I didn’t sleep for like 3 days. Strong headaches. Felt flat. Almost like zero emotions. 

I just feel like I turned the corner today on day 4. My willpower is strong still, Several friend have bought bud on the trip and offered it to me, and Im happy to say no. 

Any tips to keep the willpower strong? Mostly worried about when I go home and get back into the grind. 

I want to have more energy for my son, my wife and my family. I also want to take control of my free time more instead of just going with the flow.

When I finally drifted off around 4am, I got a call from my family asking if I was okay and if I was still coming home (I'm planning to fly home on 11/14). I remember my shock and confusion clear as day. Upon checking my phone and calling all my friends, I realized I was ""stuck"" 2 weeks behind the rest of the world. Every calendar I saw still told me it was 11/1. 

At first I found a few other people who seemed to have the same problem. Then, after getting more frantic trying to figure out what to do, suddenly I was the only one stuck like this. My friends all thought I was schizophrenic and a lot of people just didn't take me seriously. Somehow I was still able to interact with everyone, but they were all living 2 weeks ahead of me. I had missed tons of engagements and seemed destined to essentially miss the rest of my life.

I've never been more relieved to wake up at 5am. How intense can the human brain be for one hour?

There's a lot in this dream that felt like a metaphor for my weed addiction. Before my recent decision to quit ""for real"" I was stuck in a 24/7 haze. I was high all day, heavily medicating my depression and basically avoiding the world around me at all costs. As upsetting as this dream was, I'm glad I had it.

I read a good piece about insomnia from weed withdrawal, saying how smoking to fall asleep isn't really relief, it's just delaying the inevitable. At some point in the future you're going to try again to sleep while sober and it's going to be hard. If you cave then, it's just gonna happen again later. The only way out is to go through it.

You're not the only one feeling stuck in life. Sometimes the only way out is getting through it. Don't delay the inevitable. 

Praying for y'all to find strength today... even if you've had more than your fair share of Day 2's. You've got this.",4

Me being social before was smoking with my friends, now I want to find new friends that are running, but its hard where I live. It can be lonely at times.

Yesterday i realised that the only way i can make myself crazy is by thinking about smoking. It made me wonder why it held such control over me. I realised that the struggles/cravings arise when i either look back to my past, or try to envision a better future for myself. Both are untouchable and when i can't control them i get anxiety and feel hopeless, and those feelings are easily masked by smoking a bowl. The present though, this very moment, is something i have control over. Peace of mind is the key to succeeding in overcoming an addiction. With a peaceful mind i understand my behavior better. I decided to play some guitar instead of focusing on wanting to smoke, and it helped a lot. I did not think about wanting to smoke for an entire hour after i finished. And when the thoughts arose again i just did something else i felt like doing. Now i want to keep going down this track, just distracting myself from thinking about weed, not looking back.
