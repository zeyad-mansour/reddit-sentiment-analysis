After a while it just became habit and felt good to have alone time to myself and my joint. Where I‚Äôm living there is an 8pm curfew and I realised after this time I had no weed left. I was surprised to how bored I felt without smoking at night, time felt like it went forever and my evening just felt bland. I went to try sleep and it felt so shallow, I also woke up 4 times with the worst night sweats I‚Äôve ever had, plus if I wasn‚Äôt sweating I was dreaming about my ex (i haven‚Äôt dreamt in a year), I woke up at 7am and was nauseas and threw up.

All of this has thrown me a bit and makes me think that I should be quitting if this is the way my body is reacting to withdrawal . I think the biggest struggle will be mentally working my way through it when weed is so accessible and has created so much comfort for me during the pandemic.

I I felt nauseous so I ate a salad for lunch and then proceeded to aggressively vomit that up straight away accompanied by extreme nausea. I assumed it was the food and then had another cone. Then continued to vomit with ongoing nausea in between for about 8 hours. I got so dehydrated and the nausea was so awful I drove to the E.R. They told me it was gastro. So I went home and woke up feeling better. Next week after smoking one day again I got the same cyclic nausea and vomiting until I drove to the E.R again. After many hours of them trying every anti nausea medication they could they asked me questions about my cannabis usage and came to the conclusion I had Cannabinoid Hypermesis Syndrome and the only thing to stop it from happening again would be to quit. I gave up cold turkey.

I have university coming up in a couple of days and I once again need to quit, but I can picture myself going back to using after a couple months if I cannot find a new strategy to help.

It's been a week today since my last spliff and I feel mostly good but sometimes so sad and hopeless. My lungs hurt.

My whole, disjointed (hah) story, for those interested:

When my older sibling was caught hotboxing the neighbor's van at my 12th birthday party I promised myself that I would never use drugs. They had ruined my birthday, embarrassed me and my family, and I didn't want to be like my sibling. 

Cut to five years later and a boy I had a crush on peer pressured me into a few rips off his bubbler. I knew immediately that this had the potential to be trouble. But I rationalized it to myself: I could smoke weed and not be a pothead, right? Right??

I was doing okay-- smoking mostly at parties or socially with friends. There was definitely an uptick in use after I found a dealer but it was still within the realm of ""acceptable.""

Until my dad died.

I was 19, working two jobs, only planning for short term goals. At the time I didn't recognize the self medicating for what it was but with hindsight I can see that I was numbing myself. I started at the local university after a gap year and had a miserable experience-- probably because I was high ALL the time-- waking and baking, smoking between classes, rolling a spliff whenever I had to face anything difficult. It became a vicious cycle. I got high because I didn't want to sit with my discomfort, but the weed only amplified the panic and feelings of worthlessness. I started having anxiety attacks. 

I didn't return to college after my freshman year.

It got even worse when my job transferred me to Colorado. Now I didn't have to rely on anyone to get weed, I could literally pop down to the dispensary whenever I needed to re-up. My relationship with my long term boyfriend was falling apart, twisting and mutating into something truly toxic. I smoked to deal with him, to deal with the homesickness, because I had nothing better to do. I smoked a spliff in my car on my way to work. I drove home on my lunch to get high again. At night I'd get home, drop my purse, and immediately roll up. Some weekends I'd manage to go most of the day without smoking but then realize my boyfriend would be home soon and feel compelled to get high. 

When we broke up my weed intake reduced dramatically, but I replaced it by smoking cigarettes again. About a year after our break up I moved back home to Arizona where I convinced my mom to renew her medical marijuana card. 

I turned my mom into my dealer. I was embarrassed by how much I was smoking but even the shame of my mom asking, ‚ÄúYou smoked ALL that already??‚Äù wasn‚Äôt enough to dissuade me. 

Last summer I went to Europe for three months. I didn‚Äôt realize I was going through withdrawal until a few weeks into my adventure and when I made the connection I had the thought: I should kick this. The extreme night sweats, the absurdly vivid dreams, the near-constant tremors-- I didn‚Äôt want to go through all that again. And when I was offered weed by an Airbnb host I almost said no. But I didn‚Äôt. And I fell back into old habits immediately after returning to the States.

Cut to quarantine, working from home. Suddenly I was alone and sad and often unsupervised. I was finding it harder and harder to keep from indulging, lighting spliffs earlier and earlier in the day. I was sinking deeper into depression, withdrawing from my friends, disappointing myself and others. I hated myself. I hated how weak I was. I hated that I couldn‚Äôt keep a promise to myself, to my friends, that I was so foggy and unfocused and uninteresting. I tried to go a day without smoking and I couldn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt like who I was anymore. 

I haven‚Äôt liked me for a long time.

My best friend has been desperately trying to create with me. She wants my help writing a comic, wants me to RP with her, to make art collabs, to be creatively involved in any capacity. And I want that too. But not as much as I wanted to get high. And for a bit I was able to juggle both but being imaginative is hard. Getting high is easy.

I made the ethically ambiguous decision (given the pandemic) to fly up to Washington to spend a week with her. Recreational marijuana is legal in WA, but she doesn‚Äôt indulge and I didn‚Äôt want to bring it into her apartment, so I figured I‚Äôd use this week to start detoxing. 

And it‚Äôs been good! Hard, but good. I‚Äôve suffered cravings but they‚Äôve been more passing thoughts than an all-consuming need. I‚Äôve been emotional, but it‚Äôs a sadness I can sit with as opposed to the white-hot rage I feel at home. 

Only, I‚Äôm flying back tomorrow and I‚Äôm so worried I‚Äôm not strong enough. I know there‚Äôs weed in my house. My mom still smokes nightly and I don‚Äôt think she understands what‚Äôs happening to me, how important it is to me that I remain sober. I‚Äôm so scared that I‚Äôll relapse. That this week will be undone an hour after getting home. 

I don‚Äôt know how to end this so I‚Äôll just say: I don‚Äôt want to feel this way anymore. I don‚Äôt want to be in this perma-fog, dead to the world, focused only on instant gratification. I want my motivation back. I want to feel creative again. I want the strength to say no and to continue to say no.

all smoking weed tonight would have done is pressed the restart button on my withdrawals. 

in the truest true part of my heart and mind i know i want to quit. 

if i had smoked tonight, i would have spent most of the time thinking about ‚Äúquitting again tomorrow.‚Äù except i‚Äôd easily pick up again tomorrow, and then after a few days of heavy smoking id remember why i so desperately want to be free. so i would quit, but it would be harder because i‚Äôd have restarted the withdrawal process. 

it‚Äôs hard to quit, but i think it‚Äôs gonna be easier to stay quit than it is to quit again and again and again.

Fast forward to March of this year, and the Coronavirus was first starting to dig its ugly claws into the world. Needless to say, I was very scared, and figured if I ever got sick, my daily heavy smoking habits would make it all the more likely that I wouldn‚Äôt recover. So I quit. The first two weeks were absolute misery. I vomited almost nonstop, and keeping food down was a legitimate struggle.

As an adult I would smoke pretty much every day to blunt the negativity I feel in my subconscious. I always had to be on something. Running away from my emotions, my problems.

Theres been stretches of time where I did not smile, did not laugh, spoke very little and sang no songs outloud. I've made a mess of my life. And my refusal to do anything drastic to make it better made it worse. I'm 28 and had to move back in with my parents for the second time since my roommates were complete dipshits. Never cleaning, always slanging drugs, and always partying every day.
I always justified my addiction to cannabis by telling myself I need it because I'm depressed. 

But now I'm depressed because I havent done anything with my life. Friends my age are beginning their families and buying homes. Doing it the right way. Living their wonderful lives. While I just got high and played video games. The pain of regret became far greater then the pain of the past. How I just let all these years just pass me by. There are 2 types of pain. Pain that hurts. And pain that changes. And today I'm choosing to deal with my pain by changing. I want to land a good job to help my family. To have independence. To have my own place. To be able to live my life unafraid. To live responsibly. To be the clean cut squared away man I always wanted to be.

After some time I met a girl and went to my birthplace in South America to get married. Weed isn't legal there, most of my childhood friends still don't do weed, but I still had some friends and connections, so I was able to keep spliffing for a few months. I felt a little alienated. I also got defensive, preach on how good weed can be if used the right way, even I knew I wasn't.

Moved to USA in a state in the south where weed is not legal, but didn't take long to make connections. Two years go by, things didn't work with wifey, so moved far away for a new life in the west coast.

I went to Portland, OR, where weed is more than legal and dispensaries are everywhere, certainly part of the west coast weed culture: You can smoke anywhere and police would usually let you be, unless there are serious complaints; my landlord who doesn't consume is a grower; you can buy an 1/8 for only $6 taxes included. Easy, quick, cheap, legal, pain-numbing, no noticeable hangover. When an 1/8 is about the same price as a cheap McDonald's meal deal, it makes it super hard for anyone to stay away. A few months later and I'm doing so much weed that I don't enjoy drinking anymore. A can of beer felt endless. Eventually I kinda lost my appetite for alcohol, which I'm ultra amazed to this day. I also lost my interest for smoking cigarettes: they're quick, expensive, don't ""help"" with my anxiety anymore, don't get me high. So I quit drinking booze and smoking cigs, to switch to all day spliffs and becoming a caveman.

Since then I've been thanking weed for taking away my emotional pains and suffering, for helping me deal with years and years of depression, for letting time pass by, for feeling cool, chill, worryless. One big issue is that I just didn't realize or didn't care that all those treats started developing a huge counterpart. Yeah, I was chill, but I plenty more guilt to hide than stuff to talk about and feel proud for. Slowly developed a hard time finding vocabulary, threading words and keeping coherence, even in my native language. Often feeling sick, engaging in any meaningless time-consuming activities that I couldn't screw up like watching sports, series, playing the most stupid games on both my computer and phone. Convincing myself I can't sleep when I really didn't wanna sleep at all. The fear of under-performing in my personal life lead to fear of even trying: I could watch hours of youtube tutorials for doing this or that, but never take anything into practice. I learned, but I surely forgot as well. I think most activities felt more like a sucker for my anxiety than learning and progression.

A little more than 48 hours ago, around 6 AM on Thursday 8/27, I rolled and hit a mini spliff with the little weed I had left, and also told to myself ""NO MORE!!"" no more buying, no more smoking, no patching placebos, nor bad rewards like craving for a bottle of Coke. That day was hell. That day I call it day ZERO.

I tried to make that decision many, many, many times, so this time I had a phone call with my sister and sent a text to my sister and childhood friends saying I'm f\*cking done with it. And their words and support, have been incredibly important in keeping my stance.

So I started googling for ways to deal with the internal hell it is to quit this habit, reading a lot of posts in this reddit that made me go ""hey!, I should've wrote that song!!!"".

I was scared of day 1, but pfff!!!! What a difference!!! In just a day, the mental speed, the speech speed, the coherence, the clarity. HUUUUUUGE improvements. Still foggy, still crying every now and then, still procrastinating a little, but I know this is only the beginning. I can't pretend to gain it all back in a day or 2, I still cried as I wrote this, but as anxious and stressed I feel, I accept those feelings and try to put them to work. I'm doing very little in comparison to what I could do, I'm struggling a lot, but the minutes I'm dealing with it are now piling up. I'm still alone, lonely, still scared of doing things. I feel I still lack my own support to something really productive, alongside a bad relationship I have with money that I'm also trying to deal with. Although bad thoughts still come and stay very often, the little big progress I noticed on me is another key that helps me keep pushing forward with a new life.

I hope my experience helps you understand yours as well, and motivates you fix your own issues instead of feeling sorry and letting them take over like I did for so long.

8 days in and I made the choice to smoke last night. It wasn't even good stuff either, it was shake!!! Mostly leaves for that matter. At least I didn't start scraping resin, that fact is keeping my dignity intact.

The main question here. Was it worth it?

Absolutely not.

Its the same story it has always been. I felt great last night and slept really well. I stuffed my face with a box of golden grams and passed out watching netflix. This morning, I'm filled with regret. I'm trying to find reasons to rationalize my choice in the pros of weed when I've been so adamantly trying to quit for 8 days. Most of all, the shame is trying to rule me into smoking again right now. My addicted subconscious is now fueled up again. ""You don't have to feel the regret right now, you know how to take it away"" But I also know this is one slip on the 1,000 mile rocky path, and I'm trying to remind myself I can bounce back from this.

If I start smoking more today it's only intensifying the withdrawal next time I want to quit. I still want to quit, that fact still remains.

What caused my sudden loss of momentum?

A snapchat story. That simple. It wasn't a breakdown. I saw a bunch of old friend having a good time and thought to myself I can just have a good time. I started to internalize, I started living in the past, and before I knew it, I was high.

What I hope to remind everyone with?

No matter how hard we want to be normal again, no matter how hard we try, the end result is always the same for those of us who abuse weed.

Now knowing the definition of it tho, I dont think it is. I dont have a sense of euphoria or anything. Just a clear head for once. Dont have a million voices screaming at me no more. Since its a week ill give a brief summary of my progress up until today:

Day 1 - Actually went to sleep pretty good. Honestly felt okayish (but stoner okayish) and successfully went to bed that night. Avoided bud all day. 

Day 2 - Woke up with the dreaded brain fog. Thoughts in shambles. A little moody. Felt sluggish, stayed in bed for most of the day. Low appetite. Popped a melatonin before bed (5 mg, heard to NEVER take more than this) successfully went to bed after that.

Day 3 - Still brain fog, just a little less. Better appetite. Got my ass up and got some shit done. Other than that pretty much a slightly less shitty Day 2. Another 5mg melatonin before bed, successfully went to bed. 

Day 4 - First work day (had to wake up at 12:30ish A.M, work start time at 2:45 a.m) Went to work. Handled stress better than I thought. Motivation returning. Even better appetite Realized anxiety pretty much gone. Realized brain fog pretty much gone. Took a nap after with no melatonin assistance. Got shit done I needed too.

Day 5 - Not trying to keep repeating myself, but just keeps getting better day by day. Withdrawals pretty much gone. Still popping melatonin before bed (went down to 3 mg tho) because I just NEED to make sure i get some sleep before work. Noticed how im extremely less awkward in social situations. Finally able to keep a convo for once and not be awkward.

Day 6 - Initials withdrawals over. Just the mental games from here. Cravings and urges I still have but physically I feel like Im normal again (‚Äúnormal‚Äù meaning MY pre-smoking self, normal is subjective). 

Now for today, day 7: 

I feel like I can take over the damn world. But Not going too üòÖüò¨ . Not trying to trivialize anything but I can tell I personally had it easier than other. So dont think your experience will be like mine. Cant stress enough that everyones is different. Something I noticed is that I can actually laugh at stuff I find funny again. And not forced laughter. Genuine good hearted laughter. Something I didnt mention is 2 days ago I hung out with a friend and he smokes and smoked in front of me. Literally, arms length away. Im pretty stubborn person so MY thoughts kicked the weed thoughts fucking ass. He even offered knowing I stopped, hes NOT a dick he‚Äôs like that offers to shares everything hes a good friend like that just a friendly offer with no pressure if you say no. 

So theres a summary, might of left details out but I didnt want to sound like a broken record repeating the same stuff and ending up writing a whole novel. Ask me questions.

My usual routine was eating edibles in the evening after work and dinner about 5 to 6 hours before i went to sleep. I had decided to quit because my memory went to shit and it affected my speech and sometimes my work performance. It's been a week and i already started getting back the capability to use advanced terms in my speech without thinking. After 3 days my irritation and issues regarding falling asleep were gone. cravings, i had a bit longer but were pretty much gone after 5 days. This was the first time i quit weed and it seemed pretty easy. 

Now here is my problem: 

before i started using cannabis i would always get fatigue around midday. I felt exhausted mentally and physically and i'd always be demotivated and had less interest in social interactions also my eyes would get very dry. This was a daily occurrence and would happen around 2 o'clock sometimes and as late as 6 o'clock. I have had this issue since i was a teen and just kind of accepted it and didn't think much about it anymore no matter how long i slept it would always come to me. This didn't happen anymore when i started using cannabis before my sleep. This fatigue has a specific feel to it and coincidentally some memories i had of moments of bad fatigue in the past popped back up. This fatigue has been back for 4 days now but i have enough willpower to stay off cannabis. I can't really find info on why this happens and why cannabis prevented it. I did go to my doctor about 4 years ago. After doing multiple tests they concluded that nothing was wrong. I feel like I'm stuck with a dilemma.

- Started to feel physically yucky overall, but my mental state seemed okay.

1. Ever since quitting, I CONSTANTLY (on and off throughout each day) feel a strange, cold, numbing feeling in the left of my chest and upper left arm. I noticed this happened towards the end of my use of the drug, as well. Is this normal? I've been to a doctor but I'm not sure if it's worth mentioning, because I don't know if marijuana is actually capable of causing severe bodily damage (aside from lungs ).
2. Hives! Skin issues everywhere! Dermatologist appointment coming up. I had these bumps on my chest before I started smoking Senior Year, but it seems they're spreading and getting so much worse.

My first time posting something on here, I always liked to read stories of people trying to fight addictions. So the reason why I stopped weed (day 22) after 10 years of daily smoking (stated when I was 15, I'm 25 now) is beacuse I lost control, I wasn't enjoying it no more. Almost every night for the last 3 years, before going to sleep I was praying to find the will and the strength to quit, but first thing in the morning I was already high, sometimes without even realizing that I lighted a spliff. I did quit in the last years for some days but my wife really didn't help me by saying that she loves me more when I'm high like I'm more cute and stuff, so I ended up buying it and start all over again, beacuse that's the thing, I cannot just smoke before going to bed, as soon I do that next morning I'm addicted again. My main problem is that I have a 3 year old son and I wasn't spending quality time with him, like I was paranoic all the time, I couldn't take him to te he playground down the road beacuse I had this thoughts about people staring at me ecc. Now, at the beginig of the month I was really determined to quit, but maaate,the first day, I had a psicotic episode, I was laughing, crying for no reason, I had so many suicidal thoughts that it really fucked me up that day and made me realize what a massive psychological addiction I have to weed.
So in this 22 days I did more that in the last 3 years, took my son on the rides to Blackpool, visited enchanted forests, every day at least 1hr at the playground, is like I can t sit home no more, I just wanna go and do. Asweell I always thought that I have anger issues but was just weed..

I've been clean off heroin for a decade and clean off meth for 2 years. Weed helped me quit meth in major ways...I'm not sure I would have been able to stop without it. Meth caused me to lose a great job, my apartment, my gf and almost my life. I decided to quit while homeless and living in my car at a Walmart parking lot. The reasons to quit meth became obvious at a certain point...either quit or die. I chose to live...mos def the most difficult thing I've ever done.

Now I'm at a point where I need to reenter the workforce and the jobs I'm looking to get trained in dont allow THC use in any way. I've quit my wake and bake lifestyle and currently only use at night. I've been putting off entering trade school because I'm not confident I'll be able to stop permanently.

Both my younger brother older brother smokes, the older one smokes FAT. I am also close friends with multiple weed dealers..so as you can see, my supply was endless.

Fast forward and its almost fucking September, like holy shit I felt that since COVID started weed just helped me blur through everything, I was never present a moment of it. 

I could have spent my time wisely, learning new things, or becoming a better person. Instead, I opted for the easy way out, the less painful way of making time go by. Weed, Netflix, porn, video games.. anything that helped make the pain fade away. I kept thinking about quitting or taking a break, but before I could act, my homie was already pulled up with a joint. 

My inner addict kept saying ""It just a high, you'll feel nice and nothing will happen"", sure yeah. I can't even sleep anymore without getting high, and even when I sleep I wake up tired and yawning the whole day. It's so miserable being stuck in this loop of living on short stimulations for motivation, I can't bring myself to do actual work anymore, and I can't tell anyone about it cause they are all heavy ass smokers.

Read somewhere a guy felt less witty or something,  and I relate to that about 3 months in,  up till that point I felt like I was cruising on fumes.   Like weed had given me this edge I could use as a crutch in the void that was my personality.
If I didint have the high at least I could hold on to that feeling of blissful ignorance,  witty youth.

3 months later that was dead.  And I got scared,  who am I ?  I don't want to invest in cargo shorts and tight fitting polo shirts on my way to the weekly golf course just yet,  is it all down hill for me now going straight edge?  

Yes.  but actually no,  because once you go down in life as cheese as it sounds only place left is up.

So about a year in I can tell you if you want to be witty you learn from real witty people,  comedians etc and trust me if its you,  it'll stick.

I‚Äôve been working with my therapist and came to realize that being high around him was a coping mechanism because as a kid my parents were always fighting and also taking it out on us. Weed would help me seem more detached and didn‚Äôt make me brace myself even if they did fight.  I know it‚Äôs kinda seems like a joke, but childhood emotional trauma can still have a huge impact on our day to day life if we haven‚Äôt dealt with it properly. 

Well, they fought and argued yesterday, and being sober for about a week made it HARD to listen and be there experiencing it. Of course the thought came to drive to the dispensary (very easy in a legal state) and get faded. However, I sat with my emotions and figured out what I was feeling. I connected some dots and now I feel smarter and stronger knowing that I dealt with the emotions instead of blocking them out and pretend everything is okay.  Also my wife encouraged me to talk about my feelings because she knows this stuff can be tough for me - HUGE HELP!  Talking about stuff out loud is a life hack!

Today, I‚Äôm grateful for my actions because I would have been really disappointed if I had been high yesterday, and I‚Äôm sure I would have binged thru the weekend. I also appreciate myself for actually checking into myself and seeing how I‚Äôm feeling and nurturing myself. I also started doing yoga recently and the teacher talks about the power of compassion - I tried showing my parents compassion separately and also myself. I know I can‚Äôt control their behavior and they are two adults too, so that helps with the wisdom.

Those aspects didn't quite help in my job, so after 2,5 years of working next to smoking I tried to stop completely. But it didn't work very smooth as I tried it first. Why? I live together with four people that smoke thc like a forrest fire and don't feel any problems with it. Doesn't help if you wanna quit. I made it to three weeks, just like right now. I was really proud of myself and also felt negative side effects. Those effects were emotional ups and downs like I never exeprienced them before. I just wanted to go above that point to leave it behind. But then, the lockdown started and I started to smoke amounts I never smoked before. Bad idea. I wanted to stop, but I wanted it to be a ""good"" quitting. So, three weeks before work was starting again (lockdown and summerbreak flowed into each other), I spent holidays with my flatmates for five days in a beautifull, rural area. The day I got back home I stopped. That was three weeks ago. Work started again and I am back in the worst effects this drug can offer. I talked about a depression before. The thc did not kill it.

So, when I wanted to quit weed I thought it would be a battle but once I'd got to a point that'd be it, I'd be over it and would just have to deal with odd cravings as if I'd given up cigarettes. If only...


I came here to Leaves and saw posts about the quit process and saw terms I'd never seen before and things that could happen that I didn't even know were possible so if you're about to quit or are early on in your quit, this post MAY be helpful.


The following is my attempt to explain: PAWS, CHS, The Pink Cloud, Melatonin, CBT, DBT and some bonus deluxe CD content üòè


**What is PAWS? (Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome)**


""The term PAWS was created to describe the cluster of ongoing withdrawal symptoms, which are largely psychological and mood-related, that can continue after acute withdrawal symptoms have gone away. Although post-acute withdrawal rarely involves aches and pains, nausea, cramping, headaches, or other physical symptoms, it can be just as intense as acute withdrawal and still puts a person at risk of relapse, as they may return to drug use in an attempt to stop the discomfort"" (Source: American Addiction Centres)


So in other words, Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome can occur after a weed (or any other substance) user has quit their chemical of choice leading to a number of different issues even though the drug is no longer being used and so no chemical withdrawal is actually taking place. 


In terms of weed, common symptoms of PAWS are insomnia, depression, anhedonia, brain fog, and others. The good thing is, PAWS does pass, however it can take a while. 


As someone who suffers from PAWS I describe it as coming in waves, I'll be fine for days or weeks and then it'll return for a bit and then go again. I'm hoping it'll stop soon but I have prepared myself for potentially a long ride, so be it, that's still better than the alternative.


**What is CHS? (Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome)**


""Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a condition that leads to repeated and severe bouts of vomiting. It is rare and only occurs in daily long-term users of marijuana."" (Source: Cedars Sinai)


This appears to be a relatively new and fairly unknown side effect of using weed. Not all doctors seem to be aware of it and as it's a new thing not much is really known about it. What seems to help is hot showers. Yes really. Oh and you know, quitting the weed.


I'm pretty sure I had (or still have technically?) this. As an experienced smoker I hadn't vomited from smoking like rookies do for quite some time (we call it a whitey over here, your terms may vary) But then something changed. I'd go through spells of waking up and vomiting immediately. For days on end. Not that I couldn't stop (I'd stop when I got into the shower although I hadn't put 2 and 2 together back then...) but for maybe a week I'd wake up every day and vomit and then it'd stop for a while. Other people have it so bad they end up hospitalised. So for me, if this is happening to you, stop smoking. Seriously. 


When I quit I was going through a spell of it. It's even less pleasant when you've already eaten nothing from going through withdrawals. I lost a lot of weight too. Back then I didn't have any weight to spare either. The good news, I haven't vomited since. Vomit free since mid Feb 2020. It's no Ted Moseby record but I'm still happy with it.


**What is the ""Pink Cloud?""**


""Pink clouding, or pink cloud syndrome, describes a stage of early addiction recovery that involves feelings of euphoria and elation. When you‚Äôre in this phase, you feel confident and excited about recovery.


Think of it as a honeymoon phase, says Cyndi Turner, LCSW, LSATP, MAC, the co-founder and clinical director of Insight Into Action Therapy in Virginia.


The problem with pink cloud syndrome is that it doesn‚Äôt last forever, and coming out of this phase can sometimes have a negative impact on your recovery."" (Source: Healthline)


I definitely experienced this. Man I was so elated when I quit weed! Early on I was so excited and looking forward to my brand new life as a former user and felt like I was on top of the world. That came to an abrupt end. I think it was around the day 40-50 mark, I can't remember exactly. Then reality kind of set in. Or PAWS. Ah, our good friend PAWS...


To me, the ""Pink Cloud"" is like a manic high after the soul crushing low of the withdrawals in the first days and weeks. But it does end. The cloud, well, clears. And I think it catches a lot of people out as they think that new high, that ""the world is amazing"" feeling is permanent, a bonus of newfound sobriety and when it stops people are shocked and lost and fall back into use as they feel like life ain't that great, life WAS better with weed. It's a trap. That is your addiction tricking you. Don't fall for it.


Think about it, if life WAS always that amazing without weed or chemical highs we'd have never got addicted, cos life would've already been sweet enough. That feeling of euphoria cannot be sustained forever and so it isn't really natural. As much as there's a dip after the cloud clears it does level out and will settle down again to a more sustainable level, life will feel good again, so don't relapse cos things dip for a while. Not. Worth. It. Keep going.


**Melatonin. What is it and why should I avoid it?**


Well if you've read the rules of this sub reddit you'll have noticed that other substances or supplements aren't to be discussed here as per rule number 6 however this supplement is an exception currently. I will explain what this is and why I think you should avoid it and suggest a better way of helping with insomnia which does not involve chemicals. I mean, we've had enough of messing with them already right? 


""Melatonin is a hormone that occurs naturally in your body. It helps control your sleep patterns."" (Source: NHS UK)


Over here (UK) Melatonin is prescription only and so we have to speak to doctors before getting it, and so with this in mind thinking about it, is it really sensible to take a supplement just because it's available to buy where you are to fix a temporary problem that can be worked on in other ways? Is adding more chemicals into the mix sensible especially given it can interfere with other medications you may be on? Keep this in mind before reaching for a packet or suggesting it as a solution to others and if you are still struggling to sleep after a while? Speak to your doctor.


So now I've said why you should avoid it I should give you an alternative right? That WAS the deal...


Credit goes to u/PotIsntAddict-ohcrap here, who I forever see posting here on Leaves to help others who can't sleep with a collection of tips which are natural ways of drifting off. An unsung hero of here for sure üëë


Please read their comment and then the post they link to for these tips, fixed em right up apparently üòâ 


[Insomnia help](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/i9ijgv/the_insomnia_after_quitting_pot_is_the_absolute/g1fxy6m/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)


**Less chemically type stuffs** 


So a common complaint or discovery or trap that people come across in recovery is that time thing. Smoking weed eats up a lot of time. So what the eff do you do now? Now you've stopped? And how do you deal with the problems that have appeared now you're no longer numb, spaced out and uncaring?


Hobbies. Hobbies help. Get a few. I recommend reading and exercise but whatever works for you. I digress...


Beyond that there may be some issues to work on. They may be the reason you ended up addicted to weed in the first place. And you know there's all that time going spare now so...


**CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Theory) and how it may help** 


""Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of talking treatment which focuses on how your thoughts, beliefs and attitudes affect your feelings and behaviour, and teaches you coping skills for dealing with different problems.


It combines cognitive therapy (examining the things you think) and behaviour therapy (examining the things you do)."" (Source: Mind)


You may have used weed to numb or block things out. You may now have found that without weed all those problems you've been running away from are now suddenly right there in front of you. CBT allows people to gain skills and coping strategies to deal with this. Whether it be by speaking to a CBT practitioner or by working through it via workbooks or reading books on the subject it is possible to help yourself here.


Often recommended is ""Feeling Good"" by David Burns but I personally struggled with that book beyond chapter 4. I will get round to finishing it one day. The point is, where weed was the ""problem fixer"" there may be a need for a new one. Maybe worth working on a far more sensible one now there's all that time to fill...


**DBT (Dialectical Behaviour Therapy)**


""Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) is a type of talking therapy. It's based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), but it's specially adapted for people who feel emotions very intensely. 


What's the difference between DBT and CBT?


CBT focuses on helping you to change unhelpful ways of thinking and behaving. DBT does this too, but it differs from CBT in that it also focuses on accepting who you are at the same time. DBT also usually involves more group work than CBT. A DBT therapist will expect and encourage you to work hard to make positive changes."" (Source: Mind)


As with CBT there are various different resources for DBT and so if this seems like something that may be suitable for you research the subject and find what works for you.


There are other things than CBT and DBT out there too, I've heard great things about SMART for instance but really, find what works for you.. Research, try a few things, ask around... We're all different and so what works for me may not for you. That's the fun of us human types.


**Discord**


I will take this opportunity to link to the Leaves Discord server too. At the moment it's open twice a day, (2 one hour sessions, although I believe it will be open more once the boss has done some coding type bits and added more moderators (or something, I'm not tech savvy)) and it's full of lovely humans and a canine robot who know what you're going through so by all means have a look, get some support and celebrate your wins. Or complain. I do that mainly üò≥ Link for the server is [here](https://discord.com/invite/wXEa5B3)


**And finally... Meditation** 


Why should I meditate?


Well, why shouldn't you? I mean think about it, it's free, it's a small time commitment and if you don't like it? Then you've lost little attempting it.


There are loads of different resources for meditation, however as we're on Leaves I'm going to link to a post on here from the founder and moderator, it's been up voted 3.9k times, so it must be half decent right?

Right! That's me done, well done to anyone who got this far, thems some pile of words üòÜ

I decided I had enough of a shitty, mediocre life. I'm 37 now, started doing weed around 14, but alcohol and cigarettes were my thing back then. About 6 years ago I started smoking a lot more by rolling king size spliffs; and the chain-smoking habit developed pretty quick. For about 3 years I've been smoking dusk-to-dawn.

I wish I was one of those who can smoke and still do a lot, but I just procrastinate, and then get anxious and stressed for the things I didn't do. I wouldn't blame just weed for non-action, but it seems to be a common factor for many ex-users in this forum.

I didn't expect to keep crying back and forth today. Still I stood up, had a long phone call with my sister and told a few friends from my hometown in a chat group: I QUIT TODAY.

This is pretty hellish, dark thoughts all over, sadness, anxiety, tears falling as I'm typing... I guess I got myself in a hole and kept digging for so long that's super f\*cking hard to get out now, cuz I don't know what to do when out of it. I was the very best of the whole class with no effort, from kindergarten to high-school (went to university but didn't finish). I've always been a jack of all cards (or a great amateur, as I say), could do a lot of things, but have no direction. Well, now I find myself without a job, a career, asking my family for financial help to move (due to my visa expiring I gotta move anyhow). I am feeling ultra lonely now, in a foreign country with no family or friends close by to give me a fake 6-foot distance hug.

Something's gotta change, and quitting weed is just part of it. I guess now I gotta work on changing many thought processes and habits that my brain incorporated as part of my life; I hope I can see them.

I feel how frequently and suddenly these cravings take over, and don't want to end up buying placebos to put my mind at ease. So, in the meantime I'm assigning myself a few tasks for keeping my mind busy, such as journaling, finally updating my resume and applying to jobs, listening to an audiobook before bed, practicing any sport or keep learning parkour, music production, meditation attempts... I really don't want to keep letting myself down. I guess more ideas will come, but feel more than free to throw a few 'cuz dark feelings are taking over again and again.

I hope this helped you quit smoking or stay in the path you already began. I really appreciate how this sub-reddit is helping people like me feel understood, part of something, not all alone and supported.

My bank account for sure took a hit as well and with COVID it seemed like nothing else better to do but smoke all day.

I've been smoking for about two years now, with HEAVY usage for the last year or so. It's gotten to the point where I don't even actually enjoy getting high or feel much from it. It just makes me stupid and a little sluggish, and I hate it, yet I keep reaching for it again and again.

I'm undergoing treatment for a relapse of SIBO, which I'm pretty sure was caused at least in part by just absolutely housing edibles toward the beginning of the year. I can't eat wheat or dairy (I used to joke that cake and cheese were two of my four food groups, so this is devastating to me) or anything heavy in fermentable carbs; if I do, I get immediate debilitating brain fog followed by bloating, massive mood swings that leave me crying all night, all over restlessness, and... Let's just say I end up having to run to the bathroom a lot. After finding out that weed slows down gut motility, I have to assume that it's the main thing keeping me from healing.

The last time I smoked was last night, when my headache and stomachache were too severe for me to be able to sleep. Now that I've learned more about how weed affects digestion I'm resolved to quit for good - or, realistically, at least until this hellish SIBO nightmare is over with. I just wish I knew how long it might take until I can expect to feel better. I've tried to be patient but it feels like I'm running into setback after setback in a frustrating unending loop.

I was in the process of getting back together with my then ex she was very clear that she would not enter a relationship with me if I was smoking weed and that weed in any form was a deal breaker. Well about a year or so ago I relapsed I got a vape pain the general idea was to use it to manage pain (I have a bulging disc) but being an addict obviously I abused it. It took a solid year plus of vaping everyday until the guilt ate away at me and I confessed to my wife that I needed help and support and to try and quit again.

The first time around when I quit I had horrible withdrawals for what felt like forever but was probably only a little over a month. Constant headache, night sweats, not being able to sleep or just feeling constantly tired I just generally felt unwell. This time around I'm on day 4 and have experienced no withdrawals I'm not sure if perhaps it is the difference of having smoked over a decade versus just a year or maybe it just hasn't been long enough yet. Anyways I'm writing this post because yay me 4 days but also I just feel almost empty? I used to use before I ate, use as soon as I got home it was sort of my reward after work. Now it feels like I have nothing to look forward to. 

Obviously I am excited to go home and be with my wife and puppy. But it just feels like I don't enjoy anything. Everything just feels sort of fake. All i want is to be fucked up to the point I almost want to take other avenues. Which obviously giving up one addiction for another is stupid. I even got myself a vape rig and got some no nicotine or THC e-liquid just so I could get the feeling of filling my lungs but its just not the same. The thing is I've been here before but I just don't remember how i felt before, if i felt better being off of weed and how long it took for things to go back to normal. It's just making it harder all I want to do is go get some e-liquid with THC in it and my wife would be none the wiser which makes me feel like a horrible human being. 

My addiction makes me sneaky and shady and underhanded and I am just not that person. I don't plan on breaking down and relapsing my wife and my marriage mean more to me then some plant. I'm just having a real hard time and would like to fast forward a few months.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.999320387840271}"

Slightly unstructured ramble vent incoming. I don't have anyone to talk to about my addiction at the moment.

&#x200B;

When things first started it used to be that I'd fall into the habit for 5-8 months, realize what was happening, admonish myself and stop for 5-8 months, then this would keep repeating over and over again. This past year however, has been notably different. It's like, a week on, a month off, a month on, two months off, two weeks on, a month off etc. It's almost as if I'm oscillating between both states; my actual self and this other prisoner addict self, trying to really identify what I want, trying to really solidify on an internal level who I am, and what state of consciousness I really want for myself, comparing the two back to back.

&#x200B;

But the ups and downs are stopping me from moving forward. I had a really solid routine, even with everything happening with the pandemic, I was on top of exercise, eating, personal goals, journalling, meditating, etc... beginning of August I was presented an opportunity to indulge, and I slipped up just one time. That one time turned into 2, into 3, into the week, into nearly the whole month.

&#x200B;

I've been cleaning up the rubble of this short binge and my head finally feels a bit more clear, but I'm realizing that every time I do this it's like nuking my progress. I was doing well with exercise; during my binge, I barely lifted and lost a small amount of progress after months of grinding, which makes me feel like I not only wasted money on marijuana, but wasted the time I had spent. Time spent working out, time spent preparing good food, money spent on nutrients to rebuild my body.

&#x200B;

I'm hopping back in and catching up, but man. This has been a whole new level of challenge. Having this much free time, not having social support, the isolation, the uncertainty of the future, and living in a state where cannabis delivery services can reach you in an hour flat.

&#x200B;

It's frustrating. All of this is so frustrating. I feel like I've wasted opportunities. I feel like I've fallen behind. I feel like I have to fight harder than ever to catch up and then I go and relapse... but I'm doing my absolute best to be compassionate with myself. I know this part of myself that is so scared of reality has its reasons. So when I sense that part of myself is afraid, I try to talk to it and comfort it. I don't really know what to do anymore. I'm just trying to do right by myself I guess.

I only wish it didn‚Äôt take me 5 years to realize it. And, honestly, I might have remained in denial if it weren‚Äôt for this group and my psychiatrist.

This is my 3rd day of being cannabis-free! Its been probably about 6-7 years that I‚Äôve been smoking daily, multiple times. So far I haven‚Äôt had many bad withdrawal symptoms except having trouble sleeping at night after the second day so we‚Äôll see how it goes tonight. 

I have also been having trouble getting my appetite up. I‚Äôm a science major and have been researching and found that our body produces cannabinoids known as endogenous(Endo) cannabinoids. Since I have been smoking so regularly my body has not had to produce as many cannabinoids for the digestive tract, since my body had been plentiful in cannabinoids from smoking. 

Now that I have stopped, I believe my body now has to catch up and start producing these cannabinoids. These cannabinoids are crucial in the digestive tract, so now that it has been cut off I think this is why my stomach is feeling so unsettling-there aren‚Äôt enough cannabinoids to aid in the function of the digestive tract. 

I have been having a lack of appetite and I saw that this is common in withdrawal symptoms. I was wondering if anyone has any tips as to how to get my appetite up again or for how long this may go on. Any help and kind words would be great, as I feel good besides the fact that my stomach is just a little unsettling.

No one really tells you how this stuff really makes your life fly by. 

Can't believe its been 4 years since iv started smoking, always half present to everything reality is putting on my plate. Remember when I used to dream so big right before I started and even a bit into smoking, but the clocks ticking and I haven't done nearly enough like I said I would. Drastic changes take drastic measures, right? I just can't live in this ""tomorrow"" attitude that weed puts me into. I have talent and prospect but I swear if I continue I will feel more pain then what weed numbs in the present. I want to do music - even as someone who is traditionally a dancer and chef, I'm hoping quitting will be the thing that lets me achieve my dreams (along with diligent hard work and passion). Thank you for this community, it gives me hope that I can do better.

Stopped again, started again, got randomly drug tested at work back in December and BARELY passed. 
Stopped again for a few months, but the pandemic hit, ruined my year's plans (wedding, improvement plans, etc.)
It was very easy to start back up again at this point.

And now I'm here, looking back and wondering what benefit has the high brought me? Some good ideas, pleasant bodily feelings, but then what else?

My work ethic is in shambles, and I look around both of my groups of friends (the stoners and the academics) and both find ways to keep grafting, to keep pushing their creative bounds.

In a way I have nothing to show for my time spent, and it hurts.
I had my last smoke a couple of nights ago, didn't even finish it. 

I think what's different now is that I'm not being made to stop for external reasons. I'm looking at myself and all I can think is ""enough is enough, what good will it bring you.""

3-4 months ago I was ready to quit my studies because I jsut couldnt hack it anymore. Lots of support, discipline and not having my productivity stifled by weed later, I have completed all the assignments I needed to do to catch up on things I fell behind on in my Master degree.

I have never produced a piece of work I am more proud of; I estimate I put a couple of hundred hours of work and life force into it and it has payed off massively. I cannot remember the last time I felt this good; stone cold sober looking at over 100 pages of analyses I made and tonnes of excel sheets. 

I am now completely back on track and ready to tackle the final part of my degree, the Master thesis. I am certain that I would have never made it to this milestone if I did not make the decision to quit; no more nagging guilty feelings and pressure. 

This subreddit is in no small part to thank for this success story, thank you all for posting your stories. They have helped immensely: the people on their first day posting about the struggle to remind me why I cant go back to my old ways, the success stories of people turning their lives around to give me hope, the stories of relapse that served as a stark reminder and warning, the funny stories that contrast the serious nature of the subreddit and of course the posts offering fantastic advice of how to cope without weed.

That's it I guess, mission accomplished and off to work on the next milestone. I was worried that when I get to this point where I have some respite and time to relax that I'd wanna smoke but now that I'm here, I have 0 desire to do so. I just wanna sleep and play video games for 3 days straight before attacking my next project.

I'm 25 years old, started when I was 16, I smoked mostly pollon until around 20/21 then I switched to green and smoked fairly heavily more or less everyday since. On the 12th december last year I switched from tobacco to vaping and since then I've smoked only bongs and I'd say around 8-12 of them a day.

I stopped temporarily last year as well for a few weeks after a combination of allowing myself to be in a toxic relationship with a non-stop BE JEALOUS OF ME character and my grandmother dying.. after that I kinda had a bit of a mental breakdown and decided I needed to make a change.. but unfortunately all my friends who I used to smoke with just left me and didn't bother with me anymore which left me completely alone and I relapsed out of anger and depression on day 11.

Anyway, 9 days ago I decided to delete all of my dealers' numbers and told any other connections I had not to sell me any because unfortunately i've come to accept that I have an addictive personality and I can't seem to quit without cutting off all my connections. A few hours after I did that, my ""ex-partner"" sent me a text saying they'd cheated on me in less than a week of being with me with their ex and just stopped talking to me which was GREAT timing. So as you can imagine, I feel a bit fucked.

Day 1 was just cravings and insomnia, Day 2 was hell, couldn't sleep or eat, I was too hot in my bed, too cold outside of it, stomach discomfort and shortness of breath (all of this put my mind off my issues temporarily which was weirdly a comfort). Day 3 most of the physical stuff subsided and I felt a bit better. Day 4-5 I felt my mood was starting to spiral a bit, I started thinking about all the stuff I'd just explained but It wasn't crippling. Then we have Day 6 which was just fantastic! I felt great despite some chills, I was talking to family and felt like I was communicating more effectively and felt somewhat hopeful. The first half of Day 7 was good too but then I felt my mood worsening as the day went on and I went to bed knowing that yesterday was not going to be fun and I was right. I've felt so depressed, lonely and hopeless since then, I'm now on day 9 and I can't even enjoy anything at all and I just feel numb.. I'm thinking about all of the problems above and my past.. I guess I'm hoping for a bit of reassurance because I have nobody to talk to.

2020-08-25 22:07:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/igq6pc/day_23_not_a_single_craving/,Day 23 - not a single craving??,"I smoked weed for 27 years before quitting and the last two have been hitting it pretty hard, building up to 200mg of THC in edibles.

Since I quit a bit more that three weeks, had the usual withdrawal symptoms- difficulty sleeping and mental fatigue being the two top ones. 

It hasn‚Äôt been been easy but strangely I haven‚Äôt had a single craving this whole time. In a way, withdrawal helped me change my view of cannabis: I honestly saw it as a relatively mild and harmless substance, and I now see it‚Äôs anything but and never wish to go through this again.

Has anyone had this? 

I know it‚Äôs only been three weeks but I find it weird nonetheless. I guess I am in some sort of a honeymoon phase.

I know that the rest of my experience was also not typical. 

Kept myself busy and active which was helping and working on addressing the underlying issues. In a way quitting weed was a culmination of the reflection and work I already started about a year ago despite heavy consumption. 

Two years before I dug myself in so much stress. Way too many commitments, disregarded my health and family and was under constant stress until I burned out the last summer and started using even more weed than before. Then got hit by a chronic health issue that for sure was caused by the excessive stress. 

So for the last year I have been working hard on getting myself out of that mess. Managed to do three major things: deal with the health issue, simplify/ turn around my business, and sell an AirBnb apartment that was causing us unnecessary stress.

All the while escalating my use.

In fact because ai was so highly functional I believed that weed was helping me and was harmless beyond some brain fog in the first hours of the day. 

But it became clear over the last three weeks that it was simply ‚Äòhelping‚Äô me ignore a few major unresolved issues that were preventing me from really getting out of the mess I dug myself into and taking the full advantage of the changes I‚Äôve been working on. And of course with withdrawal it became clear it is anything but harmless - and that I could function much better without- despite the withdrawal. 

So when I quit, it was like the last straw but in a positive way. Like I could finally bring my hard work to fruition. Suddenly some of the issues that were blocking me and I was afraid to deal with (and used weed to mask and ignore and perpetuate) became clear and I just made a decision to deal with them and it just worked. My relationship with my son is better than it ever was and I made a few major moves in my business in the name of simplification that should help reduce the ongoing stress and overwhelm.

I still struggle sleeping. It‚Äôs 3:50AM as I am typing this after tossing and turning restless in my bed. 

I still need to address my overeating which was kind of how I partly replaced my weed crutch and is making my health issue flare up a bit. Made a commitment to star working on it tomorrow.

I still need to work on my relationship with my wife and figuring out how to help her. I see she is struggling with some of her own shit but doesn‚Äôt want to reach out for help / doesn‚Äôt know how - and I don‚Äôt know how I can help, and how I can connect to her on a deeper level. I think the first thing is to simply take more time to spend with her as now with work and my son and my recovery she may feel left out and left on her own. She has been struggling with harsh PMS symptoms that last approx half her cycle and then it‚Äôs all more difficult for her to deal with and our relationship and her relationship with our son is becoming more strained. I think me finding new ways to connect with our boy has left her feeling left out and feeling less needed and like she is contributing less (she is not working). 

Anyhow, writing things down helps me reflect and integrate my experiences. I guess I am also trying to reach out to others who might have had similar experiences to help me understand what is going on and for support. 

I‚Äôve always been an odd duck and it took me 44 years to realise this and accept it instead of trying to adapt to what I thought other people‚Äôs expectations of me were. It‚Äôs liberating - but can feel lonely too.

2020-08-25 20:10:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/igoc0j/over_a_month_into_this/,Over a month into this!,"Hey folks! 

Just wanted to follow up here. I last wrote here about [my experiences after 2 weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/i5h8fr/2_weeks_as_of_last_night/). 

And I've gone another 2 weeks and I think I'm just going to keep at this for as long as I can. 

Overall here's what I'm finding these days: 

1. Things just seem easier. I don't have another way of describing it. I don't psych myself out about stuff. 
2. I wake up and my mind is ready to go. At most, I might need to stare at my phone for 10 mins if I wake up earlier if I have an earlier meeting to attend. 
3. I'm starting to cough up a phlegm. Nasty but glad that I'm starting to get this junk out of my system.
4. Happiness comes easier. Or put another way, I'm not psychologically dependent on weed as my source of a lot of dopamine so it's easier to smile or laugh. 
5. If I'm stressed today, it was most likely because of a number of small things that had been piling up for a few days that wore my mind down. 
6. Meditation helps! I'm doing a combination of listening to rain sounds and reciting a mantra in my head. I'm trying to get to 30 mins, but if all I get to 10 mins before I need to open my eyes and do something, that's okay. I forgive myself and move on. 
7. I wish I can tell you that I'm journaling more, but I'm not. I have to make time for it, I'm not proud of the fact that I journaled once in 2 weeks, but so be it, I'm going to move on and try to journal. 
 

&#x200B;

Here's what I'd recommend to someone out there considering giving up weed: 

1. You need good sleep every night 
2. You need to get good food into your system every day 
3. You need to workout to get the stress out of your system 
4. Play video games and dance, get your dopamine some other way. 
5. Go walk through or hike in a forest. You'll feel great. 
6. If you feel like you need to check your phone a few times or more every hour. Stop. That's your mind telling you that you need dopamine. Stop, figure out what's stressing you, and work on that first. 
7. I highly highly recommend meditating!
8. Forgive yourself. Seriously, this shit is hard. If you mess up, then forgive yourself and try again. You're human, it's okay to make mistakes. Learn from them and move on :)

&#x200B;

I wish I can tell you that it's been all sunshine and rainbows for me over the past month. But it hasn't been. There was 1 experience last week where I came closest to smoking again. I'm not proud of it. I poured myself some whiskey on Friday night, bought myself some In-N-Out and played some FIFA. Again, not proud of my choices.

Here's what I learned about why I \*might\* have smoked weed again: 

1. I had been in a stressful situation at my 2 contract gigs. Both had made me a full time offer, 1 was a contract, the other was employment. It was a really hard decision that weighed on me for a week. 
2. I had had really bad sleep for 2 days prior to the day in question. 
3. I hadn't been drinking enough water for a few days. 
4. I didn't really have fun, I didn't regularly play video games during that week. I didn't really listen to my favorite music. 

Overall, it's obvious why I came so close to smoking again. I was mentally and physically stressed. My body and mind needed to tap out. I'll let you judge how smart it was to pour myself some whiskey that night, but I haven't drank again since. I think if you're considering doing this or if you're starting to look at why you have the urge or the need to smoke, you have to look at what happened in your life over the preceding week.

Upon studying the principle a bit, I thought about how it relates to life.  20% of what we do, has a great (80%) effect on our life, life situations, progress, relationships, etc.  The other 80% of what we do, carries an overall lesser effect.  In other words, most of what we do doesn't affect other parts of your life greatly. However, a small number of things, affect everything else.

The part to think about is what actions of mine fall in the 20% causes category.  My first thought was let's look at my habits. Some habits are mundane and they don't result in much effect on your life.  However other habits, positive and negative, affects many other areas.

An unhealthy weed habit is one of those for me.  Consuming cannabis falls in the 20% of stuff that affects 80% of everything!

Weed affects your mental health, physical body, career situation, relationships, self-discipline.  Weed can lead to other bad habits as well furthering it's effect -- never feeling content, not being able to live in the present moment, vicious cycles, self-doubt, being in a haze, never truly understanding my emotions, not being able to really work on my mental health issues, hurting my physical body, getting used to being unhealthy, keeping me stuck in my career situation, not growing emotionally, keeping me isolated from others, not making new connections in career and life, increasing social anxiety, building resentment as other's succeed/ pass you by ... the list goes on

The flip side is that becoming sober from weed can have such a great positive effect on so many other areas of life! 

I invite you to have a look at the 20% of things that affect everything else in your life.  These are the keys to creating a better life.  These are the areas to spend your time to yield the most result.

Before Covid became a thing I had been a year sober from weed. Literally in that 1 year of quitting I got a decent job with great benefits. Was able to get alot of work done on my teeth that I had put off due to financial issues in the past. I was also back on track with my martial arts (Muay thai & MMA). Then Covid hit, I was laid off thankfully and able to collect CERB at least. Martial arts gyms closed down and I figured it wont hurt to smoke a bit as long as I'm learning a new skill which in my case was investing.

2 months later and I finally decided to quit again. I started last night by giving everything to a friend, however when  I woke up this morning, I found enough to make a joint & smoked It. Now I'm sitting here realizing that i wont smoke for a while if not ever again which I'm fine with. But i truly hate the first few days of quitting. I feel so anxious, i feel scared, i feel nervous.

My habit started about 4 years ago when it became legal in my state. I never smoked/ingested before then, and as I don't like smoking, I went to edibles pretty quickly.

It's been 22 days. I took a urine test yesterday and it's still in my system (I'm a 44 y.o. female. 158 lbs. 5'6 so the THC is still metabolizing out of my fat tissue). 

THC was great at first, and it helped me get off alcohol, but eventually devolved to the point I was ingesting large amounts daily (cannabutter/edibles are high in THC- and in the end, I was dosing 3x a day, averaging 200mg a day in chocolate/cannabutter....seriously). I don't know how much of that I was actually absorbing as I've had gastric bypass, and I don't absorb fat like everyone else, but there was no doubt I was pretty relaxed/spaced out every day. I was spending at least $400.00 dollars a month.  A tub of 2000mg cannabutter is about 70 dollars here, and I was also getting other edibles with each trip to the shop. 

My first week of detox was full of insomnia, night sweats, and general fatigue. For the first week I slept every day from 1-3 during the afternoon in a depressive state. At day 22, I'm sleeping much better. My brain fog has lifted a lot. The incessant mind-chatter I experienced while constantly high has quieted (not sure if this mind-chatter is the same as many describe as ""anxiety"" and ""paranoia"" but while I was high all the time, my brain was constantly whirling...but I was doing the bare minimum to survive, and nothing was ever really getting done). 

I'm a bit more focused now, and I'm back to getting more work done towards long term goals in a more efficient manner. Depression still lingers, and there is some lingering malaise/lack of focus and drive.

On a side note, THC helped me get off alcohol at first, but what I found, was that when I tried to stop THC, I would switch back to alcohol and vice versa. Obviously I'm an addict when it comes to everything. Initially, I was addicted to food (I mean...seriously...I cut out my stomach to stop eating so much, but then I started using alcohol to replace the food...unfortunately there is no brain surgery that will cut out my craving brain). 

A lot of people that have gastric bypass become alcoholics as they switch addictions, and that's what I did. Then I replaced alcohol with pot, but never addressed my underlying issues (why do I want so badly to kill my brain and tune out?) 

Now, I'm trying to stay present in the discomfort of sobriety.  I'm trying to just quit everything and replace it with healthy habits (yoga, art, writing, reconnection with people, sober work). I haven't had a drink in 10 days, and I'm going to recovery meetings for the alcohol via zoom. I still have to eat...but at least I'm not letting the drugs and alcohol eat at me. 

Pot and alcohol just steal my time, it takes my memories and turns me into a zombie. Rather than let that continue, I'm trying to treat the underlying condition of my brain. And I don't think I can do that while my brain is medicated with pot and/or alcohol to the point of oblivion. 

I'm looking forward to the day my urine is clean of THC, and I can know for sure that it's out of my system. I'm starting to get curious about who I am totally stone-cold sober. I've tied my mind behind my back with alcohol for twenty years, and pot for the last four. 

At 44, I've lived over half my life already, Assuming I live to 81, which is the average life span of an American woman, I've only got about 13,587 days left here. I'm curious to see what I can do and create with those days.

I've smoked for about 8 years almost daily. tried to quit probably 10 times, longest period was a month or two i think. In retrospect i think i still liked the idea of being a stoner and thought it was cool. 
Now i'm 30 and i think its the lamest thing ever. I've got a good job, nice place, great family. I'm not in bad shape and I have hobbies. 
But everything feels meaningless. And what I dont have anymore are many friends, and I don't have a relationship like I used to. I think I probably used weed to try and escape feeling mildly socially anxious 10 years ago, and it worked pretty damn well I have to say. I'm not unhappy that I smoked weed, I had a lot of good times. 
But having said that, I can tell that its negatively affecting my mood, concentration, memory, sleep, ability/desire to make new friendships. I have a fairly stressful job, and I feel like when I'm smoking I don't emotionally process/deal with any of the stress, and it just builds up. 
I quit 12 days ago after seriously reducing the quantity i was smoking for about a month. 
Since i quit I'm feel stressed, wake up at 3am every morning, I'm irritable with everyone at work and even my own parents; but it still beats being high all the time. The guilt I felt from smoking was just killing me. I'm some fucking rich kid who's had everything handed to me, and all I have to do is sit tight and not fuck it up, not get stoned every single day of my life. 
I've done nothing to deserve my privilege its just luck, and to not appreciate it and waste my life choosing to be unhappy just so I can smoke weed isn't right. 
Some people can smoke and feel good about it, and not stress and not feel guilty. I can't. Hopefully I've finally learned to accept that. I thought i was a strong person but I'm not.. i feel like this habit has almost broken me. In a way I'm glad, because I honestly don't think I could have worked up the motivation to try and quit again if I didn't feel broken.

2020-08-25 10:31:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/igdac8/fragmented_sleep/,Fragmented sleep,"Hey everyone,

There's a TL;DR at the bottom, if you do not want to read a wall of text.

I stopped smoking weed about 2 months ago, after about 14 years of consistent smoking - my father has grown it all my life, so there was never an issue with access. I started when I was 16, with much heavier use into my 20s. I also stopped smoking cigarettes about 4 months ago (that was a habit of about 2 years) and alcohol (which was never an issue but I thought, what the hell) about the same time as weed, the reason that I mention this, is that it may be important and provide additional points to push off from.

Thankfully, running has been a wonderful and extremely helpful tool to transition out of these addictions, to the point where I now really have no desire to do either of these things and can say without a shadow of a doubt that I will not return to them. However, what running has not been able to help me with, is my sleep. Since I stopped smoking weed, there was a period of pure, horrible insomnia. However, it seemed to get better until I got stuck where I am now. I am able to fall asleep well, however I wake up every 45-75 minutes. I can fall asleep almost right away, however this consistent waking up leaves me spent. Considering that I work 40-50 hours per week, anxiety plays in as well, when I start looking at the clock and realizing that I will not be rested at all.

Now after all of my verbal diarrhea, comes the question - will this too get better? I was under the assumption that the insomnia disappears relatively shortly after cessation. On top of thay, my dreams have been less than desirable and quite vivid (but that too, is due to quitting from what I understand, at least the vivid part) This does not appear to be an issue of sleep apnea either, as none of the usual symptoms are present. All in all, if this continues for the next month, I will seek a sleep study. However,  I thought that somebody might have an insight. 

Thanks for listening to my life story ;)

I smoked weed everyday and I was proud of it I surrounded myself with people that did too or that were accepting. Fast forward to about 25 years of age? I get back into contact with my ex(32F) (whom I consider my first love).The flame had never died just the first time we dated we were younger, it was long distance. We had a messy break up and didn't speak for 4 years. 


Anyway before we got back together we had a talk and she told me the whole weed smoking thing was a deal breaker. I was 25 not a teenager anymore I was going to the gym and getting healthier and losing weight. The whole weed and munchies thing wasn't helping my progress. Smoking weed didn't make me feel super motivated in life as it can do which was also a negative thing. And the girl that got away was in my life again so I feel like I talked myself into quitting weed. It wasn't necessarily me wanting to but it was a good idea? I did quit and i had a month or two of horrible withdrawls but we did get together. 

Fast forward a year or two, working out resulted in a back injury i was in my mid twenties with a bulging disc. Also weed becomes legal in Canada. So i talk to my doctor and try the whole ""holistic"" route to manage pain from my back. So i try that and still no to little results so I look online and i see vape pens. I figure well I smoked weed before so this would be different and what if it helped my back? I was doing this to manage the pain not to get high right? But really in the back of my mind I knew it was probably a bad idea. 

At first I was good i wasnt getting high all the time I used it sparingly. But as you can guess as time went on I got worse and worse. My girlfriend was american and lived in the states while I lived in canada we saw each other on the weekends so it wasn't exactly anything she could have easily noticed. Fast forward  bit more time me and my girlfriend get married making it easier for her to move to Canada so we can be together. I am vaping every day not when I wake up or anything I'm always sober at work though there have been a few accidents. But my wife is very naive about weed so she doesnt really notice.

Fast forward to the pandemic like most couples it really tests your relationship. I had been an essential worker and she had been laid off. So there was a bit of tension already. The stress was really getting to me and weed had always been a coping mechanism so I was vaping very heavily at this point to the point that at work all I could think about was going home and getting high. Then my wife had started to make off handed remarks ""your eyes are red"" and ""you've been hitting the pen a lot does your back really hurt?"". Mind you my back did still hurt but it clearly was being abused.

The guilt got to me and I told my wife that I felt guilty and took advantage of the situation and that I needed help and her support and understanding. That I wanted to tapper off so I might not get as bad of withdrawls. She was a bit mad because she really almost  unrationally hates weed but she was also a bit understanding and agreed. But the addict in me tried to get her to compromise, weed was legal now right? But she didn't budge and it kind of pissed her off. Things escalated and I know I've been very detailed so far but I won't go into crazy detail but... basically we fought. I felt attacked and told her to get out but didn't mean it and didn't expect her to.

She left and went to stay with her family in Ohio for two weeks. And its been a horrible two weeks for me i felt abandoned. We fought and it got bad but we both fucked up. We were in divorce territory and I was falling apart. But at the same time I was so angry with her so at this point I'd bought a pipe and weed because there is a store like two blocks away (fml) and smoked heavily these two weeks. We finally talked the other day on the phone. We are both still angry but she is coming home tomorrow. We are going to talk face to face tomorrow and see how it goes. If it goes well we will go to marriage councelling and try and work it out, if it doesnt... we will probably separate. 

So tonight I am smoking the last of my weed and tomorrow will hopefully be my first day weed free. I figured I might as well start at the beginning of a week and maybe if I do get withdrawal symptoms they would kick in more towards the end of the week? But realistically it will all depend on how our conversation goes tomorrow. Obviously my wife means more to me then a drug and I hope we can work things out. I just have a lot of feelings and I hope I can ignore the addict in me. There's always this little voice in my head that worries she is trying to change me though? 

Or is that the addict? I don't WANT to quit but I'm willing to and should is that okay? Or am I setting myself up for failure? 

TLDR; I was a heavy smoker but quit smoking weed for my now wife. I relapsed and it caused a big fight where both parties fucked up but has almost lead to us divorcing.

its day 2 away from the bud for me, and this morning I felt like I found out some truth from what has been my relationship with weed. 

Have you ever wondered why we get that INSANE (psychological) need to smoke weed even after months since our last time? 

Well I am writing this as my perspective on the problem. 

In the past 6 years I have been a regular smoker, heavy daily pothead. I always chose hash over weed because I‚Äôm an active, energetic kind of person and the effect the weed has on my mood wasn‚Äôt really my game. Hash was wonderful for my needs. 

Anyway lets get to the juice here. 

If you are a casual smoker that can really manage the use and you don‚Äôt crave it when you are sober, then this is not for you.

I know regular smokers are very habit-minded over things. I noticed that smoking every day made me REALLY unmotivated to try new things, because what my brain wanted was just the chill that weed gets you, and little to nothing else. 

So, that being said, what happens when you kick the weed out of your door? What happens is your brain has to find new paths for it to be happy and peaceful again, without weed. 

...duh. 

Nothing new here...

But now I ask you: 

How many months does it take you to be 100% free from the substance? You would say maybe one, two or three at worst are needed for your body to completely get rid of the chemicals. 

But when that happens, I still feel cravings and I am sure many of us out there could say the same. SO WHY?!

Well, this is what I learned: our brain will tell us to smoke weed FOREVER. Not gonna lie, its a pain in the ass. But what can we do instead of suffering from the same temptation every day?

The answer is CHANGE. And with that I mean the everyday little changes, like reading a page of a never-seen-before book, changing toothbrush, trying new flavors and foods etc. 

CHANGE tickles the comfortable brain to be uncomfortable again. 
 

Furthermore, I can really say this: if you quit your habit, and still feel the cravings, I think it‚Äôs because your brain did not learn to produce feel-good chemicals without the weed. So what happens is you are the same person you were when you smoked, just without the weed. 

Thats very dangerous because you could really decide logically that you need weed to be good again, but you dont.",25,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9941945672035217}"

2020-08-25 04:24:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ig83w3/day_1_reasons_to_stop_smoking_weed/,Day 1 - Reasons to stop smoking weed,"So, today is my first day sober from weed. I‚Äôve written a list of reasons for quitting and I‚Äôm sure many of you will be able to relate to some of these things. I just don‚Äôt even recognise myself anymore. I‚Äôve changed physically and as a person, but not for the better. I‚Äôm only 20 and I‚Äôve been smoking near enough everyday for two years now. It‚Äôs messing me up and I can only imagine how bad things will be if I carry on. Not all of these issues are solely due to smoking weed, but it exacerbates them. 

- Constant anxiety and paranoia

I‚Äôm especially anxious and paranoid first thing when I wake up. I worry about the day before it‚Äôs even started. I wake up incredibly early, then can‚Äôt fall back asleep because I can‚Äôt relax because of the anxiety. I am anxious and paranoid about everything - going to work, my phone ringing, thinking my partner is planning on leaving me, college.

- Generally negative, down and unhappy

I feel sad all of the time and it‚Äôs hard for me to feel happy, even when I have good reason to be happy. I have a low self worth, low self esteem, I am not confident in myself, I have feelings of worthlessness. I am just negative and I‚Äôm not a positive, bubbly laughing girl I once was. I REALLY miss the feeling of feeling okay and not like I‚Äôm constantly on a rollercoaster of negative emotions and feelings.

- Concentration, memory, attention span, mental clarity

I am going to be starting the second year of my degree soon and I have so much trouble doing what I need to do. When I try to sit down and do my work, I‚Äôll pick up my phone every 2-5 minutes instinctively, even though I don‚Äôt even have social media! I can‚Äôt seem to retain any information and I get confused when I know I‚Äôd pick it up SO fast if I were learning this in school (before I started smoking). My mind is always so foggy and I feel like I‚Äôm drowning because I don‚Äôt even know where to start.

- I‚Äôm not as intelligent as I used to be

I‚Äôm not as intelligent, witty or articulate. I can‚Äôt have a conversation without feeling embarrassed because I just don‚Äôt even know what to say anymore. Anytime I try to remember something, I get it wrong or don‚Äôt know how it explain it. I used to be an amazing conversationalist, but now I‚Äôm like a zombie. I‚Äôm like a shell of a person compared to who I used to be.

- Motivation and procrastination

It feels like any task, no matter how small, takes a monumental amount of effort and I usually don‚Äôt even have the willpower to start doing anything. I‚Äôm also trying to start a small business and I think about it all of the time, but I don‚Äôt have to motivation to work on it and put the effort it. Instead of doing anything productive, I‚Äôll watch Netflix or YouTube in bed until it‚Äôs time to sleep. I‚Äôm wasting my days and I will waste my life if I carry this on.

- I don‚Äôt enjoy anything anymore

Doing things I used to enjoy feels like a chore now. I think it‚Äôs also due to constant overstimulation from watching screens constantly. It‚Äôs like my mind has become lazy and the smallest task feels like a huge challenge.

- I can‚Äôt be mindful and my mind races

Even if I‚Äôm not anxious, my mind is always racing and thinking of a million and one things and it‚Äôs hard for me to just be present. Even if I‚Äôm walking, I try to look around and observe everything, but I feel like I need to put on music or a podcast. I can‚Äôt enjoy the little things and it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs not enough, so I get bored. Probably due to the overstimulation.

- No energy

I feel weak and I never have energy and I‚Äôm just tired all of the time. I LOVE exercising, but I just can‚Äôt bring myself to do it anymore. I‚Äôll do yoga once in a while, but I choose easy videos to follow, so I don‚Äôt have to do much work. I just don‚Äôt have the physical energy to exercise, or even get out of bed sometimes. There are some days where I will spend over 3 hours on my phone before getting out of bed.

- Poor sleep

I always end up staying up late when I smoke. I‚Äôll end up eating late while watching something on the TV and both of these things keep me up later. I never feel rested, either. I used to look so fresh, but now, my eyes are always puffy, my eyes are purple/red by my eyelashes from the blood vessels, I have dark, puffy bags under my eyes and I look so aged. It‚Äôs hard to look at myself sometimes.

- Munchies and weight gain

I already have binge eating disorder, so when I get munchies, there‚Äôs no hope. Smoking weed didn‚Äôt cause this eating disorder, but it exacerbates it. Every time I smoke, I will eat junk food to the point of my belly feeling like it‚Äôs about to explode! I will wake up with a belly ache and diarrhoea. My digestion has become fucked up because of this and I can‚Äôt stick to a healthy diet for long enough to resolve my digestive issues. I‚Äôve also gained weight to a point where I feel self conscious and feel uncomfortable with my body. I‚Äôll also end up going to sleep without brushing my teeth sometimes because I‚Äôll go into a food coma and pass out.

- I physically feel ill

In addition to my previous point, I feel nausea, weak, lightheaded, dizzy and I get a headache every time I smoke. Once i smoke, I feel like I need to lay down and can‚Äôt get up sometimes, until I get the munchies... I don‚Äôt even like the feeling of being high anymore and it just makes me feel physically crap. It‚Äôs not the same as when I first started and I know this, but I feel like I‚Äôm going to be missing out on something if I don‚Äôt smoke.

- Lower libido

In general, I don‚Äôt want sex as much as I used to. I used to always want sex and now, it‚Äôs like it doesn‚Äôt even interest me. Sometimes when I am in the mood, I‚Äôve already eaten so much that it is painful to move, so I can‚Äôt have sex/enjoy it. Feeling self conscious about my body also doesn‚Äôt help. I‚Äôm sure a part of this is having anxiety, too.

- Relationship struggles

I am constantly feeling paranoid about my boyfriend leaving me. It‚Äôs nothing he‚Äôs doing, he‚Äôs honestly an angel and treats me better then I deserve sometimes. I‚Äôd feel like he was planning on leaving me, but logic could show me the reality and I could see that I was just worrying. Now, I can‚Äôt tell the difference between these delusions and reality. It‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt see the truth and I spin out of control. I get bad separation anxiety and I get really clingy. I‚Äôve become very codependent, probably because of all of these mental struggles. My sex drive improving would also be nice.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9967341423034668}"

The motivation for it is having read all of the positive success stories on this page which has filled me with the belief that I too can kick the habit of daily pot smoking.  I've come to accept that I can't beat this addiction of my own volition and need the support of a community of individuals fighting the same battle. 

Today I asked my housemate to hide the bong and the ounce bag we recently bought, and I told him that I don't have the restraint to simply not use it.  I would classify my use of pot as destructive. If I'm honest to myself, pot has been the catalyst for many of my destructive behaviours including smoking cigarettes. Potentially the worst thing I've become aware of in my use is the feeling of indifference about the things that should be important to me. It wasn't always like that though.

I found pot in Amsterdam, and slowly developed a love for it as I backpacked my way through Europe some years ago. I brought the habit back home with me to Australia and found myself using it almost every night with friends I studied with. Looking forward to the evening when I knew I could goof off with my pals and forget about the day was what got me through each day and the workload my engineering degree put on me. I worked almost full time on the side too. I've always been a motivated person. The whole university experience was fun for me and I never saw my daily use of pot as a problem. It was almost a source of power for me. I viewed my evening sessions as a meaningful part of my life, and it was because it was the social glue our friendship group used to become even tighter. 

This appeal wore off though, and pot's compounding negative effects became apparent to me when I lost two relationships as a result of my addiction and when I graduated and was faced with the reality of needing to carve my place in this world. That was almost two years ago, and in that time I've made countless failed attempts to stop and pretty much put my goals and core values on pause. I lost the passion I once had to pursue engineering as a career and any great ideas or goals I set myself rarely came to fruition past the planning stage. My relationships with my family and close friends, while still good, has suffered as a result of my smoking for 7 years now. I put this down to the fact that my forward-thinking struggles to look past an evening smoke toward a brighter future and my attention span and presence with people has dropped off from what it once was. 

So today's the day I take this shit seriously. I've spent some time now asking myself what I can do to maintain a calm and collected mind while I go through the potential withdrawals. The first week I plan to reduce to a minimum intellectual or strenuous tasks that might spike my anxiety and create strong cravings and focus instead on allowing my mind and body to rest well when it signals for it and to put good food into my body to modulate my blood sugar and energy levels. I'd love to hear how you all get through those crucial first few days to a week.   


I'm really grateful for having found this page for the accountability and understanding it offers. Simply having written this post now has filled me with immensely more hope!

He first expressed concerns about my weed addiction back in 2018, but I was ignorant and naive and never listened to him. I went from casually smoking to multiple times a day. It nearly tore us apart because I refused to quit. I am forever thankful for his selfless patience but also sternness. 

I admitted I had a problem last fall and tried to stop it. I‚Äôd be good for a few days then start smoking daily again. Long story short my partner told me that if I didn‚Äôt get my shit together (weed & my major mental health issues that I was neglecting) that it would never work out.

I immediately gathered all of my smoking shit and threw it in the garbage. I can‚Äôt even tell you how the burden of addiction left so suddenly. When not one spec of weed was in my possession, it was SO much easier. I lived in an illegal state so it was a hassle and a half to get more, but I committed. This was in April of this year. I smoked a handful of times through friends after that but didn‚Äôt have a stash of my own. 

Fast forward to today. My partner and I moved to a new state and started a brand new chapter together. My mental and physical health is phenomenal. My head is clear. I started running after neglecting exercise for 6 years. I‚Äôm super out of shape and my lungs are still recovering from getting torched but I feel so good. I‚Äôm eating healthy and try to be as productive as possible. Last time I smoked was with friends 2 months ago. I rarely crave it anymore. 

I remember the days when I thought weed would always be a part of my life. I was living each day looking forward to the next high, that sweet release from reality. But now, I actually enjoy my life. I appreciate the wonderful body I have, and I‚Äôm finally taking care of it.",57,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9957822561264038}"

Recent lurker, first time poster.

My history with cannabis goes back about 15 years to high school. For several years I smoked everyday until I got in trouble with the coast guard and had to submit to tests monthly for a year. Since then, it‚Äôs been almost daily usage of vapes and edibles for the past two years. I live in a Rec/medical state.

Again, tonight, my wife called me out for being high. I lied, the same lie every time. She uses the lightest amount possible very seldomly. I am not like that. Quite the opposite.

I had started reading here and thought I made up my mind a few days ago to stop after she‚Äôd caught me for the 40th time. I ate an edible tonight for no reason and regretted it immediately. 

I know the look she gives when she first gets suspicious. It hurts. This is my beautiful, wonderful wife that means the world to me and I can‚Äôt control my impulses or even be honest with her. It‚Äôs the only thing I‚Äôve ever snuck around behind her back or lied about. I always feel so ashamed when I get caught that it makes it really hard to admit it to her. Instead the same circle of lies repeats. I want to break that circle. 

Now she‚Äôs upset (more disappointed, and understandably so) that I have lied to her again. 

I want to stop cannabis because I can‚Äôt control my impulses with it. It‚Äôs hurting the trust and bond between me and the person I care most about. 

I don‚Äôt know what to expect or even ask for- this is the first time I feel like I‚Äôm admitting what people in my life have probably always known; that I have a problem. I hope tomorrow will be my first day getting clean. 

TLDR; lies to wife about getting high impulsively and wants to improve himself.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9975979924201965}"

Marijuana ... I maintained my life on it, but I wasn't progressing my life. And if you looked at me a year after I quit, it would have also looked like I wasn't progressing. And even a year after that, and a year after that. There were not immediate, tangible results. After I stopped hanging out with my smoking buddies, I was lonely and depressed. But the only way to make higher quality friends was to step away from that lifestyle and dig myself out of the hole I was in, regardless of how painful it was at times.

Fast forward to now, almost 6 years after quitting marijuana, and my life is significantly better. Here are just a few key, measurable points to back this up:

1. I have a quality girlfriend of 3 years

2. I've started developing relationships with the type of people I want to be around

3. I've developed marketable professional skills

4. I've doubled my income in the last year alone

5. I spend a lot more time exploring hobbies, revisiting old passions, and trying new things

And more than any of that I'm just happier now and I'm proud of who I am.

There were times in those first few years where it didn't feel like I was making the progress I wanted, but the most important thing to realize is that success doesn't come overnight. It comes through continually developing better habits today then you had yesterday. While it was frustrating to go so long without the results I wanted, the one thing I guarantee is that if I didn't stay strong and I went back to marijuana I wouldn't be where I am now. And if I went back to marijuana now, I won't be where I want to be 5 years from now.",145,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9791179895401001}"

i was having a read through last night, smoking my last joint. and the amount of inspiration this reddit gives is off the charts. i recently decided i wanted to sober up because i realised the effects it was having on my boyfriend, it was like putting a mirror up to myself.

i‚Äôve had a rough few years, i‚Äôll spare you the details because nobody really cares;) but i‚Äôve tried to stop smoking weed on many occasions. but this time is different, ive got the determination.

i‚Äôve been using this app called ‚ÄòI Am Sober‚Äô and that along with this reddit is what i really think is going to help. 

i‚Äôve smoked weed pretty much everyday for at least 2 years straight, it was my way of escaping the world. but now i need an escape from the mental health it has deteriorated over the years. 

today was day one, and i won‚Äôt lie, it was rough i woke up around 2:40pm and stuff went downhill from there. in my mind i knew i was sobering up, so my emotions were through the roof, i felt so angry, agitated, sad, depressed the whole works. but as i‚Äôm typing this it‚Äôs currently 10:49pm, and my emotions have calmed down a whole lot, i‚Äôm starting to come to peace with the idea of not smoking. 

my appetite is the worst thing about all of this. i can feel starving one second, have a bite or two of a sandwich and that‚Äôs it, i‚Äôm full. even though i know i can‚Äôt be. i‚Äôve heard eating soup helps, but i‚Äôve never been a massive lover of soup, even when i was ill i‚Äôd prefer something different. and i was just wondering, when it came to your guys appetites how did quitting weed affect it? how did you help gain your appetite back? i‚Äôve never eaten much really, i‚Äôm only a small person, but i used to eat a lot more than what i do, and it‚Äôs starting to worry my mum as she thinks i have an ED.

i know i don‚Äôt, but she wouldn‚Äôt understand. soooo that‚Äôs what this post is about:) any tips or tricks to building my appetite back up while sobering up from weed.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.986027717590332}"

The first night I slept 3 hours broken, the second night I probably slept 4-5 hours again broken and I kept waking up a bit hot and sweated a little bit. 

I still feel much fresher being very underslept and sober then smoking and have a great sleep. 


My stomach did feel a bit off yesterday a bit of pain I would say dull but still there I could eat normally though. 
I had a melatonin and some passionflower tea before bed last night it was relaxing but not sure if it helped me sleep.

tonight I think I'm going to put the phone down hours before bed and read or watch Netflix instead, I can tell my mood today might not be as happy but maybe that has to do with being tired also. 

I don't have anxiety much so far occasionally if I feel a little triggered to smoke which is usually around the habit e.g having a joint before a bath or smoking a cone before food.
Its like my mind think oh I need to do something before I can do whatever task. 

My dad is quitting smoking as well (we don't smoke together but both do both smoke at at the house) he smoked for 30 years and the book has helped him also. 
So hopefully it will be a weed free house not going to lie I got a lot of satisfaction from cleaning my bong and drying it to put away and all my papers and stuff, vaccumed the house and dusted also so there shouldn't be any weed flakes left around.

I increased my use through the pandemic and eventually had a panic attack that scared the shit out of me. I sought out a low dose strain and figured this would solve the problem. I was wrong. I had a 2nd panic attack and decided to give up Mary Jane for good. 
For the first 10 days I felt totally normal and was really happy with my decision to stop. After this period I went through 7 straight days of anxiety, depression, chills, sweats and confusion. I thought about going to the hospital daily and a few times considered calling an ambulance. During this time I did some research on thc withdrawal and figured that everything I was feeling fit the bill. This knowledge along with the support of my amazing wife kept me from checking into the hospital. My goal has always been to quit cold turkey without the assistance of any meds. Personally I don't want to have to rely on another substance and then potentially have to deal with eliminating that in the future. After the 7 day period of intense withdrawal, I began to feel better. I had a stretch of 4 good days then a few episodes of anxiety and sadness afterwards. This was difficult because I thought I was done. The last 6 days have been ok, feeling good but still have an episode here and there and a sense that I'm not 100%.
 I'm sharing my story in case others are struggling with thc withdrawal as well, I know I gained some strength reading other people's experiences, so thanks to everyone for sharing.

I'm still pretty joyless but I understand that this can take a while so I'm not concerned. 

My PTSD is a fraction of what it was. It was haunting me every day and I didn't realise the weed had anything to do with it until earlier in the year.

This thread has been so encouraging, I thank you all. I had just gone 30 days sober for the first time in 5 years and numerous tries. The changes I saw were encouraging, the insight I gained was inspiring and I saw nothing but better days ahead...so I decided to smoke one to celebrate my sobriety. 

Since that day I smoked, I have smoked regularly again. This experience was humbling. I taught I had built the mindset necessary to stop smoking, after only 30 days. But no my friends, I have instead learned that everyday will be a battle. But I'm convince more now than ever, that this is a battle that is worth fighting. The changes I saw, are worth fighting for!! 

A quote that helped me while fighting the good fight was : You gain the strengths of the temptation you resist.

On that, it's time to get back to building strength, one day at a time. Lesson learned.

2020-08-23 20:50:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/iff2vq/my_struggle/,My Struggle,"I decided to get sober a year and a half ago when I was 19. I was in college towards the end of my first year going through a rough time and smoking started making me super anxious. 

Since then, I‚Äôve learned so much about myself. I really feel like quitting was one of the best choices I‚Äôve made so far. I was living a really reckless life, abusing a lot of drugs, and not really present for any person, thing, or obstacle in my path leading up to then. I started smoking pot when I was 14. Previously, I was using alcohol for about a year and abusing it as well. When I switched to weed, it was a love at first hit relationship. I immediately started smoking whenever I could, before school, at lunch (we were able to leave school), after school for hours, and this continued through my first year at college and only increased with more free time. Almost every 30 minutes I was smoking, as soon as I came down from the ‚Äúreally high‚Äù moment. I was using a lot of other drugs like I said, and was just not in a good spot. 

When I got clean, it was hard. I realized I had an anxiety disorder and panic disorder and the first 3 months were awful. I stopped going to class, couldn‚Äôt hang out with anyone, just became really isolated. 

Through this, I ended up finding a job at a school which I now love and credit as being the only cure during that time. I‚Äôm now working full time as a teacher, at 20. I got into a relationship with an amazing partner, who supports me in so many ways, and has been there with me every step of this journey. 

Fast forward to now, I feel like a completely different person than who I was a year and a half ago. I have emotions and feelings again, some are bad some are good. I have built back relationships with family and friends that I thought were ruined. I have a stable job and am back in school to progress my job. 
But, the reason of this post isn‚Äôt just to glorify quitting. It‚Äôs hard. At 20, I feel alone a lot of the time. Not using substances is hard when it feels like everyone around me uses something in some way. My parents both are addicts, my friends are addicted, my friends from back home mostly all use. It‚Äôs hard to be confident some days because it‚Äôs almost like I feel embarrassed I don‚Äôt smoke. On top of that, that anxiety and panic disorder I mentioned don‚Äôt make it easier to find other friends, and also make me feel so alone because my social anxiety is awful in party settings. In the past, I relied on cannabis to be my connection to others, and I‚Äôm still struggling with grappling with that severed. I also live in a legal state in the US, which means that weed is usually everywhere you go. 

So my question to wise leaves-members, is how do you deal with the social setting after you quit? Is there anyone that quit around their early 20s and we‚Äôre able to navigate without feeling like their missing out on everything? I feel like not using substances sometimes means that I‚Äôm missing out on something, even though I know deep down I‚Äôm not. Thanks so much for even reading this far if you have.

I made it this far because I charged my attitude. Stopped being a stoner and just left that life behind. Mostly things are good. My mood has improved by a lot. I feel comfortable being sober again. Life is starting to make more sense to me. 

Getting high isn't constantly on my mind anymore. I think of it a few times a day but for the most part it's fleeting. The mind games that would happen when stoned just don't exist now. There is now confidence in decision making and less self doubt or seconds guessing. 

Being weed free was a great road to go down and it was long overdue but in the same breath the timing was perfect. To borrow from a quote by Gandolf: I quit at precisely the time I was supposed to quit. Life isn't all unicorns and rainbows now but I'm facing and dealing with it as it comes.

First fuckng day, first fcking time si≈Ñce 1 yeara as i was dealing and selling this shit to ppl I did it because at 25 years i was like impressed about druga live and all that shit in the tv.
I was muscular, fitness competitor looking like a bboy so why not ad then a bit of steeet cresibility and selling?
Started 2 years ago, today im done.
No more spprt as before I have family im a young dad.
I spent all my year at balcony smoking and sleeping while my daughter ia at kid garden.
I am based in poland came here 2yrs ago for work im french from Paris. 
I always also made rap and always stone with friends, wr have a studio and all that sht in hia home we invested from money we earned at work or selling.
And today, god gave me a hand.
No one as dealer had nothing today or they had but answered with 2 3 h delay between. 5 of them, everyone is like a sissy : "" now i cant, now im out, no not today"" shit guys wtf?
And then i realized wait why i nees this shit that make my life goinf worse?
I stoppes gym everything just thinking how i will pass my evening smoking on youtube and playing phone gameS.
Wr tried to register today a track and hell yeah it was good.
8 hours of working. From 4pm to 21
Wow.
We did not smoked at all.
I realised how i moss my family how i love my daughter and how im saad to not see then 8 hrs.
Ok i was making rap but even that i was missing them.
I feel a kind of sadness that i did nkt had my weed but also happy and finally thinking to stop selling weed and focus on our online shop to make real money and no few transactions per day and risks my life.
Even better ordering a expensive stuff from darkweb and enjoy or celebrate with my wife for real reasons and not because of habita or because I have 100g at house.
I finally feel what normal people feels, my energy ia decupled, I cant sleep but i will lut some sourates and ialam audio and think about all what I can achieve from tomorrow, all that I have and trying recuperate 1 year of laziness.
I really wish to everyone to make it or at least make a step to smoke much more and beinf dependent of what we want to do in real life and not in what want us to think durinf few hours and after sleep and being demotivated the next day.
Be strong guys, you can not sleep in the night? Go to the gym, work on your business, plan your next day till evening. If you cant sleep drink some hot tea with jasmine or so, trust me guys, this feeling you have while smoking and thinking its only today and you can stop whenever you want but just not now because i will be stronger after my last join, its false. It is not work ing.  Im almost 1 2 years like that. And hopefully gos gave me this chance today to understand how these people act these dealers and hopefully they are shitty persons because i dont want to sleep with my ego at 0 knowing that i gave some money to pieces of shit who even cant give you something normally. And hpefully it was like that.
It gave me the time to connect my brain again.
Now we decided to no more smoke for 3 weeks and after if so only ordering something from dw just to celebrate our accomplishements  in our life. 
Ens of month imstead of buying weed i will fox my car and give money for my pending cr√©dit.

I'm quitting to better my health, my relationships and my finances. The withdrawals are hard and I wish it was more accepted that I can have a problem with marijuana, that it is addictive for me.

&#x200B;

This is just a reminder for myself, hope that's ok.

I made it through day one, it isn't much but it's further than I usually get.

I'm 30 years old and have been smoking most of the day, every day, for 3-4 years. I struggle with severe anxiety and have been telling myself that I'm smoking to help calm that down, but all it's really doing is making it worse. 

**My reasons for quitting are:**

* Associating. I thought I was using weed to help me relax and be more social but really what it's done is pushed me to dissociate from my friends and family. My wife doesn't smoke and I constantly put weed before her. 
   * If we watch a movie, hold on- I need to smoke first. 
   * If she wants a kiss, I can't- I just smoked and I know she doesn't like the smell.
   * I criticize her spending too much on makeup, food, etc.- yet I spend $300+ a month on weed.
* Saving Money. 
   *  I make a decent enough living where I am fortunate to not have to choose between bills and pot, for now. But I'm not growing. I'm holding my family back from saving, paying off debt, buying a house. 
* Physical Health. I've gained weight since smoking and I never have the motivation to do anything about it.
   *  My weight is something I've always struggled with. When I don't smoke my appetite is normal, I can eat three normal meals a day and be good.
   * When I'm smoking I'm constantly hungry, especially at night. More nights than not I get lost in a deep binge going through all the junk food I can find. 
* Mental Health.
   * I've been seeing a therapist for a year now. It's helped with my anxiety but I'm not honest with my therapist. I haven't told him about my struggle with weed and I think it's holding me back from getting what I need out of therapy. I'm hoping to have the courage to bring it up at my next session on Wednesday. 

The list goes on. But these are my main things that I am keeping in mind.

 I'm lucky in that I always smoke alone. None of my friends smoke so I don't have pressure there. 

&#x200B;

I'm done with being irritated anytime I can't smoke or panicking when I know I'm running low. 

I'm scared to relapse. What happened yesterday is whenever I craved it I came to this subreddit. It really helped the cravings pass and to give me motivation. I'm hoping to keep doing that. Even though it means this page is pretty much always open, ha. 

I thought I smoked to gain control, to slow down time. I thought a lot of things about it. But, when you look at it through sober eyes, all of those things are just snake oil.

I'm losing control not gaining it.

I'm wasting time not slowing it.

**Things I'm doing to help combat relapse:**

* Unsubscribing to all drug related subreddits.
* Keeping busy. Cleaning my house, reading, running. 
* Baking Bread
* Using an app to track money saved and time sober
* Unsubscribing to podcasts that talk about weed a lot.
   * This ones kind of odd. But I listen to Joe Rogan's podcast and it seems to be a trigger for me. Every time I try to stop, I'll be listening to the podcast and they start talking about how beneficial weed has been for them and how it helps in all these facets of life. Before they finish their conversation I'll be smoking a bowl. Maybe it's beneficial for them, but I **can't** moderate my usage.

Anyways, I know this was longwinded. I just want to stop smoking pot and had a lot to vent. I spent the night curled up in bed feeling nauseous and exhausted yet wide awake, I wasn't able to eat all day and forced down some yogurt this morning. 

&#x200B;

I'm going to get through this. I hope you all have a safe and healthy day.",8,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9822477698326111}"

Absolute. Bullshit 

As you may be able to tell from the title, I‚Äôm on the road to sobriety again. I was able to quit when I turned 21 and could drink my problems away, but eventually I went broke and that ended. That‚Äôs when I relapsed, really really badly, 

For the last year or so I found myself habitually smoking everyday and, for the most part, saw very little issue with it. I loved how it helped me relax and just zone out my issues. I‚Äôd smoke before work, before class, before eating, before watching a movie, before going to the store, and essentially before everything. I just kept telling myself that I did it because it made everything ‚Äúmore fun‚Äù but deep down, I knew that wasn‚Äôt true. I was doing it because I wanted to feel numb and because it made me forget about the issues I encountered that day. Day in and day out I‚Äôd find myself stoned on a couch, incapable of holding a basic conversation, and eating McDonald‚Äôs like I was in the ‚ÄúSuper Size Me‚Äù documentary. 

My life was very quickly spiraling away from me, but it was too stoned to notice. I was too stoned to look myself in the mirror and see someone who has been stagnant in there life. I was too stoned to deal with my responsibilities. And most people importantly, I was too stoned to try to change my life and give a shit. But not anymore. Today marks a change. Today marks the day that I give a shit. I‚Äôve felt the benefits of being sober and I want to reap them again. I have to


Im incredibly grateful to have found this subreddit because it helps me see that I‚Äôm not the only one. I go through the hot/best post and think ‚Äúholy cow that‚Äôs exactly how I feel.‚Äù The depression, the spurs of random energy that quickly turn to anxiety, the cravings, all of it, I feel it all. But to see that other people have felt that and,  made it to ‚Äúthe other side,‚Äù just gives me all the motivation I need. Although I lay here at 1 am writing this to make myself tired, I feel like I‚Äôm on my way to feeling normal again.

My story is not that inspirational, but I hope some of are able to relate as I was able to relate to others. We‚Äôre all going through similar experiences and no matter if you‚Äôve been smoking your whole life or for a month, quitting cold turkey sucks. It comes with plenty of side effects, but in the end, is completely worth it. 

Don‚Äôt let that voice in your head trick you into going back. The pain and issues will only be temporarily lifted. Your life issues aren‚Äôt going away till you face them head on.

Weed is making your life so much harder. Everything is harder because you are high all the time. Without weed you‚Äôll likely feel anxious, exposed, bored, lost....but it will open up a whole new world of possibilities you‚Äôve been robbing yourself of. And also - those feelings won‚Äôt last forever. You‚Äôll actually learn to cope with them or maybe even figure out why you feel so crappy, and so something about it!

Something else I‚Äôve realized...even if I wanted to smoke right now, I wouldn‚Äôt get the effect I really seek. (1) I‚Äôd be totally blitzed because tolerance wains quickly, and i‚Äôd probably be too high to function, and that would defeat the purpose for me because I‚Äôm the type that loves doing things while high. (2) in order to get to the ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù I‚Äôd have to smoke somewhat regularly without letting it get out of hand, which simply isn‚Äôt possible for me.

Was my life really unmanageable because of weed? There were other factors to take into account, right? Maybe my increasing use of weed and the compulsion I had just happened to coincide with a weird time in my life. COVID19, graduating, etc... 

The 12 step program and this subreddit sure gave me a community, an openness I didn't have before, and I see the results of my sobriety clearly - I'm less irritable, less selfish and way more receptive, I've been given concrete tools to delve into my past and understand what angers me and what I'm afraid of. I'm able to realize my addictive tendencies and track them down all the way to my childhood- but hey, can't I work on myself while I smoke up? Why can't I just be a casual smoker? Why can't I give it a shot?  What's the harm? Day counting is meaningless anyway. I'll smoke up, and if I wake up the next day wanting to do it again... what the hell, I'll say no and seek help. I'll do anything for that high, for a break. Fuck the 12 step program - the only reason I'm obsessing over weed is because I'm going to meetings and am surrounded by addicts who are trying to quit. I'm being reminded of it every day - that's the problem and fuck the community for looking out for me and wanting what's best for me. What do they know?

Now 60 days sober after years of failed attempts. Here are my 3 keys to success. I hope it helps you:

1. Keep track of your streak and closely follow it. There are countless apps to help remind you when was your last smoke. The bigger the streak the harder it becomes to break. If you are a gamer think of it like a video game high score. Don't keep a mental note. Download an app and add a widget or notification so you're reminded every day the current streak. Streaks that are kept in your head are easier to break. 

2. Decide you are not just someone trying to quit but that you are no longer a smoker. Act like you are no longer a smoker. It makes it way easier to quit when you've made the mental decision that you are not a smoker. People who don't smoke don't ask for hits, call their dealer, engage in cannabis content, bring weed to every activity. It's simply not part of their life. Fake it til you make it. You are not quitting smoking. You are simply not a smoker. 

3. After you are on a streak, even a day, reflect back and ask yourself if you wished you smoked since the last time. Do you wish you spent money on the weed you didn't smoke? Is the high worth being in a worse cognitive state than you are now? 99.99% of the time the answer is no. After 30 days you will feel so much sharper and have hundreds of extra dollars in your pocket. It will be hard to look back and say you wish you spent this money and that the high was worth it.

 I think the reason I started up again was because I didn't have any set goals after my drug test. I should've came up with more achievements so that way I would have something else to work towards as I am a goal driven person. The reason I mainly quit is because I have been lonely for twenty two years; and weed helped me to numb the pain and be content with being unhappy as I like to put it. I have people in my life that would consider a relationship with me but in essence weed strips away my confidence as well as my motivation to form worthwhile connections. In fact, it makes me too lazy to do anything besides work, cook my meals, do the dishes, workout, and watch television.

But anyways ...

Now it's the weekend as well as day four of my sobriety. I made the mistake of going on my snapchat and seeing everybody out at the bars and stuff having a great time; including the woman i'm trying to get with. I told myself I can drink next weekend as I have a good relationship with alcohol. However, I know hanging around that scene especially with all my smoker friends could lead me to make decisions I don't want to make. I don't want to dull my wonderful personality.

I truly don't want to take the easy way out of feeling lonely as I would rather have a relationship with another individual rather than with cannabis. Yet all my emotions are real now. They aren't masked by the plant. I feel as if I just got dropped into this world alone and angry (even though I know in my heart i'm not alone and this is just a weekend I have to sit through.) At least during the week I work with kids and they help keep my mood in check and make me feel wanted.

I‚Äôve been dating my gf for 2 years. We bonded over partying and smoking while in college. Now that we‚Äôre graduated I thought it would slow down. I‚Äôm 1 month sober today, my gf still smokes a few times a day. She politely does it in the garage but when she comes up it lingers upstairs and I absolutely hate the smell of it. She comes and sits with me on the couch and everything is ‚Äúgood‚Äù I told her prior to quitting, I wanted to quit for years and I wish I never started but never had the motivation to (until I got marijuana hypermesis syndrome) she also has a drinking problem in my opinion (has a casual drink 3-5 days a week, always on the weekends) and rips her juul like crazy. I drink wine maybe once or twice a month but other than that never do I get drunk. I haven‚Äôt hit the juul for over 4 months now. And recently quit smokin bud. 

She acts as if it isn‚Äôt going to affect our relationship but I hate it when she smokes cause she forgets shit easily, noticeably less motivated to do things such as take the dog outside for longer then 2 minutes, and straight up, since I don‚Äôt ever drink and she does  I find it super unattractive but she says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do it to be attractive, I do it cause I wanna after a long day at work. Sometimes I just need one‚Äù I get that. I don‚Äôt want to force her to change but that‚Äôs not what I want.

Slowly starting to think we want different things. It‚Äôs super hard to bring this up to her because both of our parents drink and smoke daily so it‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù but I don‚Äôt want that. I want a healthy, clear, evolving relationship where we find new ways to entertain ourselves and learn new things to expand our minds. She‚Äôs been doing the same thing for the past few years and I just think she‚Äôs plateauing as a person and not better herself.

Here's the changes I've noticed so far.","I never thought I could go without weed. It's been essentially ingrained into my DNA since a teenager. Just woke up? Smoke. About to eat? Smoke. Going into town? Smoke. Time for bed? Smoke. 

There was not an activity in my life I thought wouldn't be enhanced by being high. And although weed definitely altered those experiences, it definitely didn't make them better. I've thought weed has been enhancing my life and easing my anxiety, but the truth I've realized is it's bringing my life down and is actually a massive source of my anxiety in the first place.

If anyone wants to hear some of the strategies I've used to finally kick this habit into the dirt after attempting to quit dozens of times I'd be happy to share but I mostly want to let those of you on the fence about quitting some of the positive things to look forward around a week into not getting baked. 

My personality is returning, finally turning back into my old happy self. I'm full of energy and enthusiasm, I'm much more coherent and involved in conversations. I'm not forgetting what I was doing every couple minutes. I'm remembering the paragraph I just read in my book. I'm starting to sleep like a normal human again. My appetite has basically returned to normal, I don't have to get blazed just to enjoy a sandwich. I'm much more motivated and focused on my goals. When something ticks me off I don't go into an anger spiral, my emotions are much easier to control and more balanced. I have extra spending money that I wasn't literally setting on fire. During this time I've focused more on rediscovering my hobbies and finding true, real joy in them. I'm remembering the plot and noticing more nuance in the movies I'm watching, and remembering more details about them. I'm waking up without feeling foggy. I'm not overeating a bunch of shitty food, in fact ""sweets"" are becoming almost intolerable. I feel more calm and less anxious, just a lot more in tune with what's going on. There's more I'm sure but these are just some off the top of my head. Hell, in just this short time two of my friends have already commented I seem a different ""in a good way.""

I just wanted to share my experience as someone who NEVER thought I could quit and thought my life would just suck and be boring without it. That's the addiction talking, it's the opposite of the truth and you CAN do this! I hope this helps someone out there that's on the fence about quitting or maybe just started their journey to be weed free. If you have any questions I would be more than happy to answer.

I have always known that smoking naturally increased my anxiety, by increasing my heart rate and paranoid thoughts. In addition, it always raised my anxiety by worrying if someone was going to know that I was high, or if I smelled like smoke, or if something bad happened","when I was high I wouldn't be able to respond normally. Despite this, I still have continued to smoke because I like being not sober, without a hangover and without such a drastic change in my personality, 

When the pandemic hit, I bought a bunch of edibles and joints and moved back home with my parents temporarily. Every day I waited for my parents to leave the house for their daily walk, ran to the window to make sure they are far enough down the road before I went into my backyard and blissfully smoked, at first finding humour in the fact that the pandemic reverted me back to my 16 year old life at home, and later just find it.... not who I want to be. 

At first getting high was fun. I would smoke and then come back into my old room, and watch tv, and look through old things. But the longer the smoking went on, the more it became smoking and then avoiding conversations with my parents, and just sitting and ruminating at how incredibly juvenile I felt. 

I ran out of weed and decided I wouldn't smoke again. This is a normal cycle for me, except this time it only lasted bc I am at my parents house, and far away from my dealer, so this is the first time i have quit for this long in a while. Almost 3 weeks out, I am so calm, my anxiety has virtually disappeared. When thoughts enter my mind... they just leave. As opposed to just sitting and analyzing the same dumb things over and over again. And mostly I enjoy, not chasing the high. I simultaneously decided to stop drinking too, and it has made me feel so.. just content. Not ever thinking about when I am going to smoke again, or waiting for the perfect time to pour a drink. It is at times boring, but for the most part I just feel so comfortable. 

The only downside is I still don't have an appetite, which is very annoying, and I have yet to do anything productive, but I feel like those things will both come with time, and I am fine now just enjoying the process, and slowly becoming the person I want to be, instead of feeling like I am regressing in life.",66,{'pandemic': 2},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.6896446943283081}"

The withdrawals were just insane, the anxiety was immeasurable, especially after having had such a terrifying experience and losing my crutch to deal with most things.

Well, in these last few months I relapsed and started to smoke THC again and I can see that it has mostly brought me negative things and made me much more lazy and unproductive. THC makes me complacent with doing nothing, but doing nothing isn't gonna get me to achieve my goals.

First, just want to say I‚Äôm grateful for r/leaves.  This was a really great community to lean on when I was first getting clean.

In 2015, I became a full-blown stoner after years of dabbling, but never feeling the total pull of addiction. I smoked daily until spring of 2017, when I got clean from weed for about 5 months. During that time, a lot of uncomfortable emotions came up, but it was nice to HAVE feelings again. PAWS was intense, particularly the insomnia in the first five weeks.

I started smoking casually again that fall, and when I moved back to the States (where I was living was hard to get weed), I started buying ganja again and fell back down into the rabbit hole of addiction. It‚Äôs interesting: I remember thinking ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I used to do this every day!‚Äù Soon enough, it was back to daily smoking, often in the morning to ‚Äústart the day out right.‚Äù

In 2018, I moved to NYC with a now former friend, who is a major stoner, and fell deep down into addiction. I smoked daily; if I ran out, I smoked resin and stems, or ash. I realized I wanted to quit, but felt powerless... even if I quit for more than a few days, I‚Äôd ‚Äúreward‚Äù myself and then be right back at it. In retrospect, I think I was trying to bargain with what was dawning on me... that I am an addict, and have no control over weed usage. 

2019 saw me quit for longer periods, sometimes as much as a month, but I‚Äôd then fall off the wagon and ‚Äúreward‚Äù myself by being high for weeks at a time. I‚Äôd moved to NYC to pursue my dreams of publishing my writings and playing music after finishing my doctorate in 2018, but instead I was high all the time, living in a fantasy world, working full-time at a waitressing job that was supposed to be my side hustle. 

In October, I finally hit bottom and‚Äî after realizing too that I began to booze more, and more desperately, when I was ‚Äúoff the ganja‚Äù ‚Äî got clean of all substances on 10/28/19. I started going to both AA and NA to get clean, which made all the difference for me. It made me feel accountable, and a room of people cheering about my sobriety and connecting with the awful shameful secrets I shared made me feel like I could actually do this.

Today, I work an ACA (adult children of alcoholics) program, and still keep in touch with the NA people; AA ended up not being for me, especially with the zoom meetings, but whatever. I‚Äôm still sober, and I‚Äôm so so grateful for it every day. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned so far:

* My relationships changed. I am not only not friends with the stoner I lived with; we had a vicious falling out (more from her, really, as I disengaged which only further set her off) and I ended up moving out. Best thing that I could have ever done for myself. Plus, once I realized I had no friends because I was high and didn‚Äôt feel a need to leave my house, I made some new, good ones that actually like me for me. I cherish these more now, and am learning to live outside myself. I feel connected to people again... like a member of the human race. Things with my family are better than ever, and as soon as I quit smoking weed to numb the pain of my life ‚Äî including my predilection to choose awful men ‚Äî I stopped looking for a relationship... only to end up with the most wonderful boyfriend. I couldn‚Äôt have made him up, he‚Äôs so perfect.
* My career has changed. Once I stopped using and boozing, my waitressing gig suddenly became intolerable, which made me realize that a) smoking weed numbed me from that, and b) that I had to make a change. I got a substitute teaching license and quickly got adopted by the first school that I was assigned, and I worked there full-time as a kindergarten teacher until the summer break (yes, I did remote teaching). I now freelance teaching Chinese and Japanese, and have saved up about 17k in the bank. Last summer, when I was starting to realize that I was a stoner with no direction, I had less than $100 at any given time in my bank account. No savings. No health insurance. Oh, and now I‚Äôm actually sending my book off to publishers, and after editing it, I see how some of what I wrote were the incoherent ramblings of someone dreaming of success, of a persona, but not willing to actually work for it. I was delusional, and now I‚Äôm not.
* I have mental clarity. I am in touch with my feelings, and I make better, healthy decisions. I have foresight. I save my money and spend it wisely. I have real conversations with people. I‚Äôm more calm. My emotions are integrating.
* I‚Äôm NOT DELUSIONAL. Seriously, when I was using all the time, I was SO in my head and was always trying to play God, or to create narratives or assign special meaning to things happening in my life. I couldn‚Äôt stay in the moment; everything had to have some kind of special meaning. And that ended up driving me to think that toxic people were my ‚Äúsoul mates‚Äù ‚Äî a concept I don‚Äôt even believe in anymore, and guess what, I have an amazing partnership! ‚Äî that I was constantly getting ‚Äúsigns from the universe,‚Äù and that I was special or superior somehow. In retrospect, I was bolstering myself up because I was scared and empty inside.
* I have work ethic again. I practice my musical instruments; I get up early; I do all of my work seriously, and well. I am trusting myself again in the process. It‚Äôs a wonderful feeling to know that I can handle what life throws at me, that I‚Äôm not a victim of life‚Äôs whims, and that I‚Äôm in control of myself. Life is turning into a beautiful ride that it never was when I was high, analyzing everything happening moment by moment, desperately trying to escape the pain. 

I feel now that I am actually prepared to live life. I‚Äôm still learning, and I‚Äôm still seeing old thought-based or emotional compulsions come to the fore, but I have the awareness now to recognize them. And once we recognize it, it‚Äôs often healed.

I feel like myself again, and I‚Äôm so, SO grateful for my sobriety. I recommend meetings, and I recommend getting off of all substances. DM me if you have any questions. I‚Äôm so grateful for this group, and wish everyone the best of luck. You deserve it!",14,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9349364638328552}"

Hello everybody, first off I just want to say I hope that everyone and their loved ones have been safe during everything that‚Äôs going on, my heart goes out to anyone impacted by all that is going on in the world.  

As the title suggests, I‚Äôve tried to quit using cannabis more times than I can count really, and I have been aware of it‚Äôs negative effects on my life for well over the past 3 years.  I‚Äôve even posted on this subreddit and the r/petioles subreddit several times during this process, but would always delete my posts when I failed.  As many of you can probably relate to, every time I‚Äôve tried to quit, there has always been SOME situation, or occurrence in my life that I‚Äôm able to exploit and use as justification to continue feeding my addiction.  I also don‚Äôt use that term lightly, I may not have physical dependency, but I am absolutely psychologically addicted.  

For some background, I‚Äôm a 23 year old University student (Microbiology and Genetics), I‚Äôve been smoking daily for close to 5 years now, and I live a relatively healthy lifestyle (work out almost daily, cardio and weights, diet isn‚Äôt awful, sleep could use some work). 

So, why have I decided to try quitting again?  Well this time the motivation feels quite a bit different than any of my past attempts.  Without getting too personal, I am graduating at the beginning of next summer and I already have a really promising job lined up in my field.  I also started a relationship with an absolutely incredible woman at the beginning of this year, and she left today to go to school for 2 semesters and will be returning right around the time I graduate next year.  Essentially my life has just gotten very real right before my eyes, and I‚Äôve realized that who I am now is not the man who can finish school strong, become the best I can be in my career, and cultivate and maintain my relationship over this long distance.  

Funnily enough, I came to this realization the other night after getting quite high, and feeling as though I underwent ego dissolution, allowing me to judge every aspect of my life objectively.  I saw the man who I am now, and the man who I have the potential to become, and the only logical next step is to grow up and give up the weed.  There are other factors too, like the fact that I tend to find myself in a constant victim mindset, which leads me to feel far too sorry for myself and has essentially eroded all confidence that I used to have. This confidence and really my true self has been able to shine through over very brief periods throughout the last 2 years; namely when I would go on week long vacations where I couldn‚Äôt smoke weed.  By the 3rd or 4th day of those trips I would begin to feel the cognitive abilities, confidence, and perspective that I really have.  But by the time I got home, I would find some reason to talk myself back into smoking, and those qualities would just fade back into the background.  

Alright, this post has gotten long enough.  I really only posted here to give myself a level of accountability, but also to reach out and see if any of the people going through something similar want to talk, and maybe make friends.  I should also mention, I‚Äôm not looking for advice on my relationship, career, or anything like that, I‚Äôm just here to speak my truth and interact with the community.  I can‚Äôt say for sure if I‚Äôll actually commit and post updates, but if I go through with this like I‚Äôm intending to, then there will be updates in the future.  

If you made it all the way through, thanks for listening.

*TL;DR* 
I‚Äôve tried to quit many, many times to no avail.  But this time feels less like ‚ÄúI should quit‚Äù and more like ‚ÄúI will quit‚Äù.  Life just got very real, and I recognized that the cannabis I smoke just makes me into someone not worthy of the family, career, or relationship that I have, so I need to stop, and finally become the best version of myself.",2,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9783889651298523}"

I have been wanting to quit smoking (specifically, THC cartridges) since January 2020, but hadn't been able to commit to it-- the immediate onset of depressed feelings when I stopped smoking was too much to handle. 

I recently moved to upstate NY, where recreational cannabis is an hour and fifteen minutes away in Massachusetts.  Something about making this drive made me feel like an addict. That posh, excited feeling when I bought the goods started to feel dirty. With wait times, it became a 3 hour round trip.

I finished my last cartridge on Tuesday, and I decided not to refresh my stash. I'd been very slightly tapering, so it's not quite as uncomfortable as I thought it would be.  (It's still uncomfortable).

I am so grateful for this community, as I've been privately reading these forums for months.  I feel strongly that, having read your stories over the past few months, I am more empowered to do this.

2020-08-21 06:36:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/idudby/what_you_gain_every_time_you_say_no/,"What you gain every time you say ""no""","After a lot of years of smoking, it can be difficult to avoid pot and reject any occasions to smoke. Cravings come back instantly and it's very easy to give up, because our brain is flooded with stupid thoughts like ""It's only one puff"", ""I deserve this after x days free"" and my favorite: ""I can manage this one, I'm not going back to the old habits"".

These are obviously dumb excuses that we give ourself to justify our lack of discipline. So here's my list of all the benefits that you get every time you decide not to smoke:

* **You become a better person**. Not because smoking is evil or weed is the devil's plant, but because you accomplished a goal that you set yourself. You successfully managed to resist the big urge to take a hit, and even if this could not mean a lot immediately, in the long term it means a build up of discipline and motivation, energy that you can spend in other, more productive, stuff.
* **You build momentum**. And trust me, when you say ""no"" for a good amount of time (that could mean 10, 100 or even 1000 times), staying sober becomes a drug itself. Not because being high is not a good feeling, I would be lying if I would say that, but because the more you say ""no"" the more it becomes hard to fall in the old habits again. You don't want to break the streak, you know you'll feel awful when you'll do that. And the more you go on, the easier it gets, trust me.
* **You'll be proud of yourself**. I highly suggest to share this journey that you're taking with someone you trust, like your best friend or you significant other. Don't make a big deal out of it, but share your goals, like 1 week free, or 1 month free; people that loves you and know what you're dealing with will give you the best motivation to go on, because remember that you're doing this for yourself and for all people around you. And even if you have no one to share with, give yourself some non-cannabinoid treats once in a while. That thing you really wanted to do but never had the money (or will) to do? Now it's the best time to do it. And this bring me to the next point:
* **You save money**. This is strictly pragmatic, but every time you avoid an occasion to smoke, put away some cash. Not too much, but you'll be amazed of the amount after a while.
* **You gain 1-2 hours every time**. So maybe you come home from work/University and you want to smoke but remember you decided not to. If you manage to resist, you gain 2 hours of time that you would have spent in the couch watching Netflix. When you sum all of that, you end up with a lot of time that you can spend doing some more productive stuff.
* Lastly, but this is the most important to me and it's something that you can see only after a while that you're doing that: **you will be truly happy**. After weeks, months or even years, after all the times you struggled, after all the difficulties that you've been through, you will really appreciate all the work that you've done and you will see that it wasn't all for nothing. You'll appreciate your strength that time that you were really close to fall again, and you won't even realise that, at some point in this journey, you became free. That you don't think of it anymore, and that seeing someone smoking a joint really doesn't do a thing to you, no cravings, nothing. And when you look at your past self, you realise that this was the right thing to do.

I didn't intend to sound dramatic, but I think that maybe this list could help people that are struggling right now. I'm not someone who figured out life, I'm just 22 years old and when I decided 233 days ago to stop smoking after 5 years of heavy use, this list would have helped me. Now I spend the extra time in web-development, soon I'll be graduating and with the money that I saved I'll buy myself a new PC.

Second longest I've gone weedfree. Longest (in 10 years) was 3months but that was because an ex threatened to break up with me, which as many of you know is about the worst reason to quit as without wanting to quit relapse is super likely. 


This time I quit because I was just sick of the brain crushing anxiety. I use to chase the anxiety cause I saw it as a way to be a good person as I was heavily traumatized as a child so for most of my life I've had very unhealthy personality traits, about 2 years ago this massively changed when I had a mental breakdown after researching manipulations and realizing how many I use, I was disgusted with myself and began doing everything in my power to become a healthy , non manipulative person and to stop chasing happiness and rather chase contentment. With weed I often thought it was helping me be more considerate but it just lead me to borderline psychotic episodes alot of the time. I would spend hours sitting and staring at a wall ruminating over every akward comment, or word unsaid. As well as playing through ideas that everyone wanted me gone. Or how people at work were out to get me (while in my defence I was actually targeted at work by a girl who refused to accept my rejection of her incredibly aggressive advances)


I can say a month later I am much more clear-headed. My deep issues will never fully go away, but weed was never gonna fix them. That's my job. And now I can spend the time that would have been spent in stoned hazes freaking out , instead I can spend advancing myself. 


Here's hoping this turns into a lifelong habit of sobriety. I still need to quit nicotine on the form of vaping (I went from 2 packs a day, to smoking .3 juice) but every success is a success. I don't need to fix everything to fix anything.

I have been a heavy toker since I was 14 (now 21). I felt like it was an integral part of my life and my identity. I was a stoner. I would do almost everything stoned including work, school, and gym. I remember in high school I would sit around all day at school and home baked out of my mind and then it transitioned to college. And now I‚Äôm starting to realize that all those times I spent high playing video games and watching TV and skipping class is coming to bite me in the ass. It was all a fat waste of time! I‚Äôm a senior in college now and I realize I‚Äôm super immature. I feel like a loser constantly and I‚Äôm unhappy with my life in general. I don‚Äôt know how to handle my depression. I don‚Äôt know how to hang out with people sober. I don‚Äôt know how to have meaningful relationships with girls, all the problems I had in life I‚Äôve smoked away, except the problems are all still with me.

This thread and the people in it really gave me some new viewpoints and ideas. It‚Äôs like Randy Marshes‚Äô quote in South Park, weed isn‚Äôt inherently bad but it can make you satisfied with being bored, and boredom is when people should be looking to better themselves and learn new skills. I took a step back and started thinking about it.... I started realizing that a lot of the mental problems I have like anxiety and depression came from my upbringing (parents were not emotionally available at all. I still think they act like children) but I personally as a person haven‚Äôt been able to grow out of it because of how apathetic weed made me. One big bong rip and I could feel the tension being alleviated. I was just living comfortably numb. And the worst part about it all is that I LIKED LIVING COMFORTABLY. I would spend money on weed before food because at the end of the day nothing was better than a big old bowl. And I regret it all. I could‚Äôve been out making new friends meeting new people getting over my social anxiety fears, but I was too busy being comfortable.

Reading this thread has really made me realize that smoking weed isn‚Äôt a personality trait or something that I wanna pursue in life. It‚Äôs a crutch that has been stealing my time, money, esteem, attention, and a plethora of other things. I realize now I‚Äôm going to have to come up with real plans instead of just hitting up my friends to smoke, but it will be a great learning experience. Thank you to everyone that shared their experiences I will probably be here everyday when the boredom hits. I can‚Äôt wait to start anew. P.S having cravings and it hasn‚Äôt even been 24 hours so here is my post. Here is me putting in words what I want and will do. I will be resolute I will be steadfast. I‚Äôm tired of being apathetic and blaming my problems on everyone other than myself. I‚Äôm gonna go out and achieve the things I want to achieve. Root for me cuz I‚Äôm rooting for you!

I know I haven‚Äôt been smoking for 10 or 20 plus years but it‚Äôs been a hell of a journey so far. I remember smoking off of pen caps, apples, water bottle, cans, etc. I remember getting caught in high school durning senior year twice actually. That‚Äôs when my parents found out I was smoking. I almost didn‚Äôt walk the stage because of that. At that time, weed had just became recreational and I had a friend who was old enough to enter shops. So I was smoking some good stuff since the start. We would ditch lunch to hit the shop and smoke.  It was getting out of hand.Anyways, it‚Äôs funny because everyone who smokes weed thinks you can‚Äôt be addicted but you can ! or at least making it a habit. During my time smoking, I‚Äôve had real urges to stop among weed. I ripped up my REC throw away my piece and weed but I still found myself back in the same spot. When I‚Äôd stop smoking, strong aromas like coffee or mint would remind me of kush and would give me urges to smoke. When I would smoke a lot, I would find myself smoking just to smoke and because I was bored. I think what I liked about smoking at the time was the thrill, the thill  of not being caught. And the rush that gave me. I even found myself paranoid as hell sometimes. Even that didn‚Äôt make me want to stop. Fast forward time and I found myself just being careless and smoking where ever when ever. I know we all have great potential when we‚Äôre sober. I know we can be greater/ stronger/ smarter people if we stop smoking. Thinking like that motivates me to stop. But when your so used smoking before you do anything cool. It‚Äôs hard. You want to be high when your going to watch a dope movie, or you want to be high when you go to the beach or pool. Or even before you do a task that you don‚Äôt want to do. My sister says and thinks it‚Äôs all about moderating and self control. In part that‚Äôs true. But for some people like myself. Their is no in between. I‚Äôd call it gluttony, because weed is good ! But too much of this good can do you harm. As side from all that I‚Äôve always had a problem controlling my appetite when I was high, I‚Äôd gotten used to stuffing my face it‚Äôll my belly couldn‚Äôt possibly take another bite. I‚Äôd also realize that weed vapes were provoking weird chest pains. I‚Äôm a pretty active guy and I like to go on hikes but the other day I went on a hike, I was gasping for air.

I started smoking when I was 16 and have been smoking pretty consistently for the past 15 years. I absolutely loved it and it has brought some beautiful experiences into my life. My biggest issue with it is that when I run out or cant smoke, I get really bummed out and depressed for several days. Other than that, my usage was not all consuming but it was definitely creating some imbalances in my life and causing me to be more reclusive. I had tried stopping countless times but I would usually only make it a few days, maybe a week or two at most. 

This changed when I met and started dating my current partner. She enjoys smoking but only on very rare occasions, like once every 4 to 6 months. At first, it wasn't a big deal but when we moved in together she made it very clear that she did not want to be with someone who smokes weed everyday due to various personal reasons. Since then I've been able to quit for a few months at a time but it always seems to creep back into being an everyday thing. Only now, it has an extra layer of sneaking around and sometimes even lying about it. This has been happening on and off and has created issues in my relationship for the past 6 years. 

 Since the lock down started due to Covid in mid March, I got furloughed from work for two weeks which led to me smoking nearly every single day. I was doing this all behind my partner's back when she was under the impression that I had quit. I knew it was wrong and hurtful to my partner but the habit energy behind it was so strong and I truly enjoyed smoking so much that I continued up until 3 days ago when I decided enough was enough and I stopped. I  had the urge to come clean about it to my partner because I couldn't keep looking her in the face knowing I had been being untruthful. She got very upset and now she is saying she is done with the relationship. Keep in mind, there is more to the story but lying about the cannabis was the last straw. I want to make it work but I have to show her with my actions that I mean it for real this time that I can change my ways and be a better partner and quit smoking for good. Just need some support or advice. Thanks if you read this far. 

tl/dr: Lied to my partner about smoking for a long time, came clean and now she wants to break up. Need some support.",1,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9804465174674988}"

I also have a background in child and youth, mainly to not depend on the lack of mental health care. I‚Äôm 24 and I live in Canada, so I‚Äôm legal to as a please. Although I work two jobs, they allow me to have a lot of free tome still, and my sleep isn‚Äôt an issue. I‚Äôm also like Ellon musk, in terms of being able to sleep 4 hrs here and there and work 12 hrs on top. I‚Äôm a morning and night person, but I have noticed that I don‚Äôt dream anymore. I‚Äôm like a computer, I go dark and then poof I‚Äôm up, and although I‚Äôm good at getting up, I miss dreaming. 

I started cannabis in small mount when I was 21. It was just when the dispensaries were opening up, and the cops could have gave a fuck. I‚Äôm from the east coast so idk if that‚Äôs why lol. Anyways, at that time I only did it on the weekends. Mainly cuz my mom was my boss, as I worked 10 hrs 5 days a week at a family restaurant. It was hard emotionally and mentally, due to the rocky emotional relationship that o had with my mom, on top of a challenging relationship, and the aftermath of everything else that I went through as a child. Plus dealing with the toxic side of the lgbtq ( I‚Äôm trans and all communities have a toxic side)  

I‚Äôm not huge into drinking and I can go months and years without it. I usually drink for pride, and Maine my birthday. As for weed, over the years it has been increasing. I know that I‚Äôm at the amount that I‚Äôm good with. However I‚Äôm not financially leved atm to do what I‚Äôm doing. 

Although everything is being paid.... I know that I could be doing better, as I am an actual nerd with finance, and I‚Äôve only been in situations due to a toxic person or my mental health. Now that I‚Äôm on a better path, a better relationship with my family, and currently seeking help, I want to also stop. However here‚Äôs the issue 

Idk what my purpose is. For so long, I‚Äôve wanted to great things for others and for myself. Although I have a rare drive, I‚Äôve come so far intellectually, and there‚Äôs so much I want to do. However I‚Äôm afraid that if I do stop weed, that I won‚Äôt be my create self again. I‚Äôm afraid that the things I used to do like working out and eating better won‚Äôt work, but will cause me to burn out like last time. Because before I was dealing with work, gf, trauma, gym, meal prep, volunteering. And now that I‚Äôm gaining more energy, idk what to do with myself. 

I‚Äôm throwing myself into drumming lessons that will start soon ( due to covid) and I‚Äôm looking into either going back to the gym, or getting something to do while I‚Äôm in between breaks from my two jobs.

Also, how has everyone‚Äôs cognitive behaviour been? I find myself more angrier now that I want to stop cannabis. It‚Äôs also due the combination of my still on going mental health and my be still not taking it easy. But wondering when people start to notice a mind set shift.

I stopped smoking everything for close to a year after a very intense bad trip. The withdrawals were just insane, the anxiety was immeasurable, especially after having had such a terrifying experience and losing my crutch to deal with most things.

3. Things take time to change. I‚Äôve quit other substances before, and it took lots of time. Cannabis is the most deeply ingrained into my life and even identity, with 10 years in the making. You need to give yourself lots of time to adapt and create a new life. Be patient, take it day by day.

4. Overall, things are better with a clear head. You‚Äôre more patient and empathetic with your family and friends when you‚Äôre more ‚Äòon their level‚Äô of dopamine. You also communicate better, and your thoughts are clearer. You‚Äôre less introverted and more likely to connect with other humans, which gives more meaningful joy to this existence than a drug hit.

5. I‚Äôve been given second and third chances in life. I was on a success path, messed up a little bit along the way and started to go deeper and deeper into my head and escapism. I put myself and my family through debt, depression and years of selfish behavior. Through a combination of hard work and a lot of luck, I‚Äôve become a fairly functional user and things are on track - academically, career wise and financially. But, I‚Äôm ready to move past this and see what more is waiting for me on the other side. A lot of people don‚Äôt get so many chances in life - count your blessings and make the most of this life.",3,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9916529059410095}"

I‚Äôve been wanting to quit, but have always been too afraid.

I haven‚Äôt had a regular dealer the past year or so, because my buddy would normally just let me know when he‚Äôs picking up in bulk and we would split to save some cash. We would chill at his place every Tuesday to smoke up & play video games, so I would never run out.

Since the pandemic started however, this tradition quickly dissolved. He lives with his elderly parents, and I just didn‚Äôt want to risk anything (I‚Äôve pretty much been locked up at home since March, and avoiding all friends/family). I think he took this very personally, though he hasn‚Äôt said it outright. Our interactions changed to him letting me know once a month that he was restocking, and I would just stop by for a quick pick up. He changed from my friend to basically just my dealer. I think he got fed up & realized that he wasn‚Äôt gaining anything from our friendship anymore and stopped hitting me up. I was really annoyed at first that he wasn‚Äôt responding, but I am now seeing this as a perfect opportunity to move on with my life.

These past few months or so, I also realized how mundane my job is, and how none of my colleagues really appreciate my work efforts. When I‚Äôm doing things perfectly, no one notices, but when I make a mistake, I get called out relentlessly by my work-obsessed VP. She clearly doesn‚Äôt respect me or care for my mental wellbeing. I‚Äôve been wanting to quit for a while, but bud was always holding me back, I was always afraid to apply to new jobs because of any necessary testing. I‚Äôve been updating my resume, and also now realize how much bud has been holding me back, how my skill set seems stunted because I never wanted to put any effort into learning anything new.

This morning, I was making my coffee & remembering how I would normally be packing a bowl simultaneously.. and thinking about how much I missed it. I was tempted to try to reach out to my old friend, and just as I was about to, I heard the lyrics of the song I was listening to at that exact moment:

‚ÄúWell it started as a game
Using pleasure, using pain
We got higher and higher that way
But it didn't work today

Even though it felt so right
Nothing's permanent in life
So it's useless to hold on so tight

Well you gotta
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up
Ooh oh oh....

You lost control
'Cause nothing stays around too long‚Äù

Those last 2 lines.. I pretty much burst into tears. I know the song is more about a controlling/toxic relationship, but thinking about it from a drug/addiction standpoint, it just hit me so hard, harder than any bong hit I‚Äôve ever done.

I‚Äôve been clean for 2 weeks. I‚Äôm thankful my friend stopped texting me, that can be his parting gift to me. I‚Äôm so tired of feeling anxious when I run out, I‚Äôm tired of feeling stress from hiding this addiction from my partner, and my family. I want to be free, & stay free.

Thanks for reading. I hope to post/share more here. You all seem really genuine.

Smoked for the lat 27 years, daily during the last two and over the last year did daily edibles growing to about 200mg THC. 

Last night slept till 6AM without waking! Amazing as I couldn‚Äôt string together more than half an hour without waking during the first week. Sleep, which for me was the main withdrawal symptom, was getting better bit by bit. After reading many accounts here of people struggling for months, I was expecting a similar struggle, especially since I didn‚Äôt sleep without at least 50 mg of THC in edibles in more than a year

No weird dreams. 

Also today almost no mental fatigue, which was another big one for me.

Other than that, had sore and stiff neck (could also be from lots of heavy lifting around the house), and being somewhat more irritable. Had two bouts of unusual anger that wouldn‚Äôt go away

Concentration is also slowly improving, and I seem to have more moments feeling spontaneous moments of high spirits and good mood

What I did so far:
- planned to quit during a vacation 
- reached out to a therapist who helped me prepare and gave me something to help with sleep during the worst days (no aid during the last 7 days)
- stayed extremely active, almost non stop kept myself busy with work in the house, walking, swimming
- did a kind of a daily diary - mainly checkins with the therapist
- spoke a lot to my wife
- read two self help books and lurked around here, posted a few times too mainly as a comment
- as a part of my preparation, thought a lot about the issues in my life that caused extra stress and managed to remove some of it

I am still withdrawing but I am so happy that it got to a point where it‚Äôs not so disruptive that I cannot function, as I have a very demanding lifestyle

I am in my mid forties, have been diagnosed and treated for ADHD, run my own business and am married with a small child

Have to say that despite heavy weed consumption, I managed to get my life back on track over the last year. Struggled with a chronic health issue during a good part of the last year, managed to get it under control, improve my eating and exercise, and simplified or got rid off some of my many (much too many) commitments to a level normal for people in my situation 

I honestly thought thc was helping me deal, but now I see it was just helping me ignore the issues that I needed to deal with.

I've tried moderating, weeks off, reducing consumption, changing my outlook on it, switching to flower vapes.

It just doesn't work anymore, and that's okay. Last night I took two small hits from my bong and was thrown into an instantaneous bout of anxiety, fear and regret. I'm a hypochondriac, and got these pains all over my body which I interpret as impending death. 

I'm glad I'm finally listening to myself, but it's going to be a challenge to completely rid the herb of my life.

I'm going to condense this down as much as I can, but I need to get these words written down or I'm going to fully lose my damn mind.

Little backstory: So I'm in the process of quitting weed/reclaiming my life back, and this is probably like my 100th attempt. It's probably more but my stoned brain has the advantage of sweeping things under the rug. The longest I've ever gone sober was 100 days in the last 7 years (moderate to heavy marijuana use) with a bunch of times of going 50+ days. So this is far from my first rodeo. I'm 26 and have gone through my fair share of stuff in life, but who hasn't so I'm not going to unravel some lame ass sob story, because frankly I'd rather die than whine/seek validation/waste time of whoever is reading this. I just could use some help and perspective. I feel beyond lost. I am diagnosed bipolar, severe OCD, ADHD, and MDD and have been hospitalized before. I have been on just about every fucking medication in existence. I see a psychiatrist once a month, and I am very compliant with my medication/treatment. I rarely go even hypomanic and lean much more towards being a sad hopeless POS.

I am currently 9 days sober and I don't know what to make of it... This is the first time I've experienced what I am about to explain and just don't know if I'm going crazy or something else underlying is going on, or if I'm just being a giant fucking baby. Typically when I muster the courage to stop smoking weed I go through the ""honeymoon"" phase first. I start being productive, exercising, eating a lot less (I'm a fatass when I smoke weed typically but otherwise in shape and played competitive hockey for 15 years). My favorite part in the beginning of sobriety is that the fog lifts and my brain starts to work well again, and I feel hopeful. I live for hope! This usually lasts for a month before it fades. But by the time it fades I've built enough traction to keep my shit together and continually improve despite starting to get some of the delayed withdrawals.

This time has been very different. I've been stupid depressed, beyond fatigued, everything is a challenge (you've never seen someone struggle so hard to stick a damn toothbrush in their mouth once a day), and have ZERO motivation. The only thing really positive so far is that I started going to the gym 5 days a week and eating less sugar/binging. I feel discouraged and just don't know what to do. Has this happened to anyone before who typically experiences myriad positives when quitting? I'm losing hope and just been contemplating in the back of my head if this struggle is even worth it if I'm feeling/doing so shitty. I know it's more than worth it but those are just my subconscious thoughts. What can I be doing differently to maybe turn this ship around?

P.S. I kept this as short as I could without delving too much into detail. I appreciate anyone who reads this and I would greatly appreciate any help/advice. I want to change for good and finally overcome this mountain of shit.I need help from the experts who have conquered this.

I've just signed up to Reddit (I've had an account a few years back) to join this subreddit because I share the same problem as most others here.

I'm 22 years old, quit university and have an e-fulfilment company in the Netherlands and for the past 1,5 years I've been trying to quit smoking pot. I started smoking when I was 18 and it got completely out of hand while I was studying in Amsterdam (of course) and I stopped going to school and was way into the shits financially.

After that episode that lasted about 6-7 months, I found entrepreneurship and started doing my own thing and stopped smoking weed/hash cold turkey. But as the months went bye I started smoking again, not that much but 1-2 a week. But now I face my biggest challenge, because my current company is the one that will actually become something sustainable and I am nowhere near my full potential because I smoke weed/hash. I will tell myself to quit every week and sometimes I last one month, sometimes I last 3 weeks, and only after I've had to worst time. I will have episodes of 1-3 weeks of smoking everyday after work followed by me quitting for 2-3 weeks and then I relapse and start over again. My brain will tell itself that moderation is fine, you've had a long week, today was way too stressful, alot more succesfull people smoke etc. Especially the 'you've had a long week' thing is a problem, because I'll make it through monday to thursday pretty easy and then as soon as friday to sunday comes, all my willpower completely falls apart. I've also found that if I beat my meat, the same day of the next day those negative thoughts will pop in my head.

What do you guys suggest I do? Is there something I can follow or guide to read? I'm in a spot where I think about smoking and stop smoking pretty much everyday and I believe it could be very destructive to me and my whole company if I can't figure out how to stop this.

We concluded that if we had gotten stoned we would have been sitting there in silence, listening to the same song on repeat, half falling asleep/exhausted, and we would have left hours before because we were too hungry/thirsty/tired to stay and visit. 

Instead, we actually spent the time catching up and talking and it was amazing. It was so funny to look back at EVERY OTHER TIME WE EVER HUNG-OUT and be like WTF were we thinking.

I hope all of you have a moment like this in your sobriety ‚ù§Ô∏è it was so funny.

The crazy dreams just stopped a few days ago and I‚Äôm sort of bummed, but I‚Äôm actually sleeping through the night now! Update on withdrawals and how long-severity-etc they‚Äôve lasted so far:

Couldn‚Äôt eat: about 3-4 days, then at about a week off I got natural munchies. Healthy food tastes good? I guess so. 

Puking: lasted the first week, every night before bed I‚Äôd have to boke once laying down or randomly through the day‚Äî‚Äî stopped at day 6 or 7

SWEAT: excessive sweating lasted 2-3 weeks. At 3 weeks, it stopped smelling like weed. Similar sweating to withdrawing from alcohol In my opinion. HOT/COLD flashes: still going on but less frequent, I have covid so that could be it. 

Anxiety: most severe first 2 weeks. Crippling anxiety first week, so bad I‚Äôd collapse in the shower and just sit. Definitely still having general anxiety now, and definitely worse than when smoking, but it‚Äôs at a normal already diagnosed with anxiety disorder level. At about week 3 I learned to deal. 

Existential dread: Worse first week, still wake up or at night get random feeling of this, but I recognize it‚Äôs a symptom. 

Brain Fog: still very much real. I couldn‚Äôt remember 5 minutes in the past for the first 3 weeks, seems like my brain is coming around. 

Mood swings/ Depression: much better at 4 weeks. Most severe week 1-2. 

Forget the Tremors/ Shakes: I felt like I was on speed for 2 weeks. My hands, legs would just shake and vibrate. This might have been the worst. Stopped at week 2. 

No cravings anymore, but I‚Äôve messed this up so many times before that wanting to go back was kind of out the window this time. I‚Äôve had so much self improvement it‚Äôs actually unreal.

I was a daily smoker for around 4 years, smoking about 1g a day at the end (not crazy amounts I know). I know my time smoking weed is over now, but I've had a worrying lack of withdrawals. Other times when i've quit even for a day my night time is usually filled with insomnia, night sweats and nightmares (nightmares usually took a little longer to start than the sweaty sleepless nights though)

Since quitting this time I haven't had any night sweats and have fallen to sleep easily, with no nightmares. I've even had a fairly decent appetite! It may sound strange but those symptoms were somewhat reassuring as it showed my body was reacting to quitting weed. I'm not sure if I'm just going to bypass them completely or they're going to show up with a vengeance at some point. 

Has anyone else experienced this? How long does it usually take for dreams to come back? (I really miss them!) 

The only withdrawal I've had was on the 2nd day where I was highly emotional, and a little anxiety throughout but I think that might be my baseline rather than a reaction to quitting.

To just be able to be in the present and be happy. If it was helping my dad, who I know has mental illnesses, then it could help me and mine? No, not in the slightest bit. It made my depression, anxiety and ptsd way worse than before I started smoking. I was the biggest supporter of smoking weed, and I thought everyone should enjoy smoking because when I was growing up there wasn‚Äôt any horror stories or any talk about the possibility of a thc addiction. But after my experience, I wish I could tell everyone my horror story so maybe the next person who thinks about smoking will take consideration and make sure it is the right decision for them.

I ended up having to move back home because of Covid so imagine having to withdrawal when you move back home to your entire family. The withdrawal symptoms were so bad, I woke up for weeks nauseous, throwing up, the shakes, the sweats during the day and the cold sweats at night. I felt like I was dying. I had the worst mental breakdowns, which I haven‚Äôt had in years. My anxiety was THREW THE ROOF. Every little thing would make me cry, I had no appetite at all, eating food made me feel even worse. I don‚Äôt wish that time in my life upon my worst enemy. My relationships with my family went to shit because I had to tell them to hold myself accountable and I really needed the help and support.

Sorry for any bad writing or misspelling since English is not my first language.

The first time I smoked was at 12, but the time I actually started smoking was when I was 15. back then it was a big thing and I only smoked in school with my friends or some weekends. The only time I smoked at home was when I called my best friend, who I talked to pretty much 24/7 on the phone since he lived in another city. We knew each other since I was 8 and were friends with each other but until we turned 14/15 we really just played games together and talked about random shit. We started talking more and more to the point where we would just call each other and talk while driving in gta online for like 5 hours or some other stuff. We also started visiting each other and of course we smoked when we did. 

Like I said, smoking was special and something to look forward to. Now skipping all the bullshit one morning I get a call from his father telling me that he was hit by a train and that he‚Äôs dead. Literally 2 days after he last visited me on the weekend which was always hard to do since we had to spend ‚Äûa lot‚Äú of money for the train and it took a while to get here. We always said we had all the time in the world since we‚Äôre so young and we wanted to move into a place together later anyway, which resulted in me seeing my best friend that I knew for half of my life maybe about 6-7 times in real life, probably a little less than a month if you‚Äòd count the days we spent on our visits. 

The first few weeks after the news feel like when you‚Äôre trying to remember a dream but only remember fractions of it. I smoked until I passed out and ‚Äûwatched‚Äú Netflix, which was more like white noise to fill the silence since I couldn‚Äôt call or text him which would‚Äôve been the thing that I‚Äôd have immediately done once I felt fucked up before his passing.

The following months weren‚Äôt much less of a haze, although I adapted and started doing way more with the friends I have over here I also started smoking way more and started drinking while partying with friends a whole lot. Never to be sober again was the only thing I could think of.

Fast forward to now. For the first time since he has passed I‚Äôve finished my pot and did not go and get more. My 18th birthday is in 2 weeks and I stopped drinking because I got hospitalized a few months ago after literally vomiting blood after drinking one bottle of pure vodka everyday for about a month with friends, apparently something that my body is not made for, and also of course the damage that came from all the drinking on the weekends before that month. 

My best friend has been dead for 11 months and I feel like it‚Äôs time to stop numbing myself and to actually live. Currently I can‚Äôt think of anything other than smoking that could bring me joy, which I realized about a month ago is something that shouldn‚Äôt feel normal to me. I have strong hope in myself that I‚Äôll feel actual happiness once again, but I believe it has to start with me getting rid of the fake, numbing ‚Äûhappiness‚Äú that I get from being high and finding things in life that are actually worth to live for. 


I don‚Äôt really use Reddit so I‚Äôm sorry if my writing was shit and like I said I don‚Äôt really speak much English aside from talking on the internet so I can‚Äôt really judge if it‚Äôs comprehensive enough for the average English speaking native to read. 
If anyone actually reads this story then I am very thankful for reading since this is the first time that I actually talked about this with anyone in such detail. I posted this more just to motivate myself in getting better and I gotta say that after having written this story twice I feel like it‚Äôs actually helped me put some perspective on my own life and realize all the stupid shit I did the last 11 months, maybe if you‚Äôre in the same struggle as I am this is a great idea for you too, that is if I‚Äôm not just talking to myself on here hahaha 

I believe all is said, so again if anyones reading this thanks a lot and if you‚Äôre also in the process of quitting I wish you best of luck and nothing but happiness, goodbye!",8,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9988627433776855}"

Tomorrow marks one year of not smoking, and I‚Äôd like to take this time, these two days, to think about what that means in my life.



I stopped smoking weed because it had for far too long crippled my life and destroyed my mind. I smoked before doing most chores, which meant the chores didn‚Äôt get done. I smoked every night and most mornings if I didn‚Äôt have work. I smoked with friends at parks, but most often by myself at home. I smoked to go to sleep, which always meant I‚Äôd be up for several extra hours waiting for the ‚Äúexhaustion‚Äù phase of marijuana use. I smoked before literally every activity, which meant I was filled with anxiety and dread instead of enjoyment. I always longed for the comfort of my bed or the couch if I smoked somewhere outside the house. I was pathetic and I hated myself for my inability to accomplish anything and for my continued use of this substance that for years I knew was keeping me back. And yet day after day weed was my first thought upon waking up. 




I honestly do not understand how people function and enjoy their lives while smoking regularly. I understand that it works for some people, but I cannot relate at all. I wish the past years were filled with successes and growth, but they were spent on a couch. I smoked through the best relationship of my life. I smoked when my friends were going to grad school and moving forward. I smoked and sat and withered. The most bizarre part of reflecting on these wasted years is that every single person who I think of, people who moved forward, enabled my addiction through their own use of this drug that somehow did not have a hold over their lives as it did mine. I watched the world go by, held back by a plant that seemed to be an integral part of those I saw pulling away from me. That increased my feelings of failure and isolation. 



It took about six months after quitting before I felt like my brain had recovered to a point that allowed for productivity and focus. Those months were filled with typical withdrawal symptoms. Initially I had night sweats and trouble sleeping. I would wake up as wet as if I had just stepped out of a swimming pool. I felt the anger and the anxiety.  I had extremely vivid dreams. Once those initial symptoms subsided after about six weeks, I fell into a routine that I thought of as ‚Äúletting my brain heal.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt have too much energy and I felt unmotivated, though sharper than when I was smoking weed, and I was noticing slow improvements in myself. When I think about that part of last year, though, I mostly think about aspects of my life outside of weed. I left a job with a hostile work environment after an incident of harassment by management. I immediately landed in a new job that had a similarly hostile environment, where I regularly heard racial slurs, and occasionally heard homophobic slurs. I felt unable to leave that job as quickly as I would have because the service industry is usually not looking to hire and train during the holiday season. I stuck it out for a few months. Perhaps the stress of all of that impeded my healing from the my marijuana use. I don‚Äôt know. I just know that it took a damn long time before I felt an awakening from the weed-induced mental fog, and that awakening coincided with the end of my tenure with the second hostile job. 



Six months from August is February. That is when I felt the strength and the motivation to really begin creating a new daily structure to my life. In mid-March, COVID shutdowns straight cancelled everything I was doing. I lost a new job that seemed challenging and like a great focal point for a structured daily life. I lost my new workout routine and the almost-finished boot camp that I hoped would turn into a better, less pained body. I lost my new attempts at dating. I lost my social life and the sprouts of new friendships that withered immediately without the wellspring of queer nightlife. I lost my housing because my shitty housemates asked me to leave, transferring parts of the labor and stress of achieving their desired new life onto me. I lost the possibility of growth into a new industry when the organizations I had applied to stopped processing applications. Every part of my life that I was moving forward was instantly impeded. It was so frustrating, so completely out of my control, and so without a near-term solution. My entire societal framework for creating a healthier life was stripped away and replaced with a quarantine that lacked human contact, a functioning economy, and any external experience from which to learn and draw inspiration.



Instead of growing along these paths I had just begun to lay down, many of which had their foundation in years of hard work building a small community around me, I found myself stuck inside with no job, no prospects, no routine, and hardly any friends. I was suddenly juggling nothing. Still, given the circumstances, I was lucky in many ways. My unemployment application was processed relatively quickly and I had funds within weeks, while friends of mine waited months or longer with nothing. I have my health. I found new housing that in many ways is better, though more socially challenging, than my last setup. My family has not been directly impacted by loss of life due to COVID. While my life has become listless, I live comfortably. 



At first I filled my time by waiting. My biggest success of this period was continuing with my cessation. There were a few days scattered throughout the first months of our new COVID life when I was tempted to smoke, but honestly those were few and far between. I‚Äôve been focused on reaching a year (and beyond) and I remember too well the feeling of my brain just‚Ä¶not existing. I don‚Äôt want to return to that. So, I waited with video games, attempts at maintaining friendships, and TV. So. Much. TV. 



So much TV, that I feel I have one more addiction to address. When I smoked weed, I would fill the high time with screen time. The two were married. Smoking and video games. Smoking and Netflix. Smoking and scrolling through reddit. Last August, I cut weed from my life, but I made the very conscious decision to not address the amount of screen time in my daily life. I did this strategically; my thinking was that forcing myself into completely new routines would sabotage my efforts to remove a drug from my life. I stand by this decision, largely because the lethargy that followed in the first six months of my weed sobriety would have made maintaining new habits extremely difficult and a relapse more likely. In February, I began a journal to collect my thoughts and catalogue my attempts to decrease my screen time. Unlike weed, this is not something that I can completely cut because the 21st century demands that I have a computer and a phone. In March, I stopped writing in that journal. I was so shocked by the sudden changes brought on by SIP. With that shock and my lack of income, and I slipped into habits that weren‚Äôt even bygone yet because they had never truly left my life. 



And there I remain. I am very proud of reaching a year. It‚Äôs one of the best decisions I have ever made, and it‚Äôs been a daily effort for 365 days. I‚Äôve learned things about myself and I‚Äôve begun to repair the damage that I inflicted on myself for years. I did it with friends constantly smoking around me and offering  me drags, with weed available in my home at any hour of any day, and now that I‚Äôve moved, with a weed store on the same block as my house. I am the only person I know who does not smoke weed.  I am confident in my ability to continue to abstain and I have a deep pride at this accomplishment. I also am frustrated at the impossible situation I, along with everyone else, have been thrust into with a global pandemic and an incompetent government response in my country. Instead of happily reporting on my new workout routine and better workplace performance, I look to the future with confusion and acknowledgment of all the work that remains for me to build a better life that continues to elude me.",36,"{'covid': 3, 'quarantine': 1, 'pandemic': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9965320825576782}"

It was my first addiction I had and the first I overcame. I am 19. And realized I was addicted at 17. I had more relapses than I can count. I was severely depressed and my life was falling apart. I‚Äôd steal and lie to get some bud and then smoke the bud, and sit there for the hour and a half I thought I‚Äôd be enjoying but instead I‚Äôd just hate myself. I hated myself more and more after every time. It got to the point where I was kicked out of my parents, then my girlfriend‚Äôs apartment, then my friend‚Äôs. 

All I wanted to do was quit and life was getting darker and I was losing my self every day that went on. I couldnt remember what happened 20 minutes ago at the climax of my addiction. I tried cold showers which helped. I tried meditation and exercise and eating right. My appearance was ghoulish and sad. I thought my life was over and I just started it! The things I did that helped did help, but they were never enough. Then I learned about nofap, I learned about dopamine, I learned about the addiction cycle. I started nofap and noticed I had less of an urge to smoke if I hadn‚Äôt fapped that day. 

Still. I didn‚Äôt quit smoking weed and spending all of my money on it. It was my biggest hate but the only thing I looked forward to. Again, everyday was hell. And I am sure some of you out there are reading this going through exactly that, hell. What stopped my addiction was psychosis, marijuana induced psychosis. I put myself into the ER a couple of times based off of delusions and realized if I didn‚Äôt push through hell and get to heaven I was going to die under a bridge and stay there for eternity, Metaphorically speaking but somewhat literally. Today I am functioning better than before i ever touched weed because you overcoming something like this gives you a certain self confidence, a power, it gives you energy to keep pushing. I used to dream of the headspace I am in right now and thought it was nearly impossible/ I‚Äôll do it tomorrow. Don‚Äôt wait for tomorrow. Don‚Äôt let it go to the extent I let it go to. 

Its a shame that people can be so ignorant about our problem and not understand what you‚Äôre going though. But some guy on the Internet does, and I know you can come back from hell and enter the heaven you‚Äôve been chasing bowl after bowl. I love you all and that is my story.

Ok so I‚Äôve (27F) been smoking since I could remember. I tried it at 13 and have enjoyed smoking over drinking ever since. Everyone knows me as the very functional high person. I completed masters recently, and when covid hit I was pretty much permastoned. Wake up, smoke, do what I have to do (doing the bare minimum of course) and smoke again. I‚Äôm a high school teacher, very active and the majority of people think I‚Äôm that girl who has it all together. Smoking always made me feel relaxed and less ‚Äútogether‚Äù (less pressure from the outside). 
In February I got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and though my social worker told me smoking wasn‚Äôt always the best option when feeling anxious, I chose to ignore her. March rolled along and since then I‚Äôve smoked daily, multiple times. My self conscious issues have started again, body shaming constantly yet I have 0 motivation to workout as much as I used to. My relationship fizzled because multiple reasons during covid, but I constantly felt I had 0 control over my emotions. I‚Äôm always in my head and try to convince myself bad things will happen without being able to keep an open mind. 
I went to a bbq the other day and someone asked me when was the last time I went a day without smoking. I seriously couldn‚Äôt answer. And that‚Äôs when it hit me. The girl everyone thinks I am, active, motivated, energetic... she‚Äôs been numb for quite some time. I don‚Äôt know my hobbies or interests. I don‚Äôt know what makes me happy as a sober person anymore. I don‚Äôt even know how to relax and watch a movie without being even a little stoned. 
Yesterday I didn‚Äôt smoke all day until before bed. It was tough, but I managed. I thought about it often, but I tried to redirect my thoughts. Today I‚Äôm trying to follow through with the same vibe. I don‚Äôt want to cut cold turkey but I think saving it for bedtime for now is better than what I‚Äôve been doing for 6 months. 
Work starts again next week, I love my job, love my class, love my students, love my colleagues... I want to feel good about starting work.

I just wanted to share my story in case it helps anyone else out. I respect everyone here for your efforts and if you have a different quitting method than myself please dont feel called out, im just spouting some thoughts during the hour id usually be filling my lungs. 

I started smoking weed and cigarettes about 5 years ago. Roughly 9 months ago i learned that my girlfriend and i would be having a baby, and id always told myself that i would clean up my act when we got closer to the babies due date. Im happy to say that baby is here now!  And while i have so far succeeded in quitting, im incredibly frustrated with myself for waiting so long to even try. 

While setting a definite quit date did end up helping me, i cant help but think about how much money i spent on the herb leading up to that. I reasoned with myself that it was part of the process, that i was going to ween myself off of it as the day got closer, but what ended up happening is i started smoking WAY more than before as i got closer to my quit date. I wanted to really relish in what it was like to smoke and enjoy it while i could, but ultimately i wasted a lot of money, and ended up quitting cold turkey (Edit: i do still vape nicotine) on my quit date, going from smoking multiple grams in a day to smoking NOTHING in an incredibly short span. 

Everyone is going to have a different experience based on how long theyve smoked and, i wager, genetic factors such as a predisposition to addiction, however i do believe that had i done this a lot sooner i would PROBABLY have had a much easier time with the withdrawal symptoms, not to mention the amount of money id have saved and been able to spend on other things.

Im on day 11 now, i haven't had a cigarette or toke since my quit date, and i guess what im getting at and hoping is that reading this gives you the push you need to stop today , or reminds you why you quit in the first place! Stay strong everyone!

Ive been smoking weed/polly for 2 and a half years. It started because i was drinking too much and was hating the negatives of alcahol. So i decided to switch to weed, figured i was only gonna affect myself this way, hangovers don't exist (to the same degree as binge drinking), cheaper, and it gives the same effects as alcahol from the comfort of my own home/bed/sofa. I drank to deal with depression and anxiety, but that made it worse. Weed helped.

It started great, like most people would think, but after a year or so it became a crutch. All day everyday if i wasnt doing anything, straight after work if i was working, sometimes id even go to work stoned. It got to the point where all id think about was smoking, and if i ran out of money id borrow off family to pick up.

Then it got worse. It started to cause my anxiety and make my depression worse. Id cry a lot when high, sometimes at tv shows (supernaturals 300th had me balling), sometimes because of my anxiety, sometimes from legitimate stress, and all weird to me cause im not an overly emotional person. It takes a lot to get me worked up (2 years of being bullied in high school before i snapped and beat the crap outta my high school bully for example). 

So i recently went home, and although i think my mum knows (mums know everything) shes never mentioned it, but when im there i stay away from the weed. Im 8 days grounded so far and i miss it of course, probably always will, but i feel better. It gets hard now however cause im on my way back to Liverpool (Uk 30yo), and thats gonna be the tough part. A housemate smokes, as do some friends. I gave all my stuff away before i went and im committed to staying clean this time.

I figured id write my story for someone elses benefit, as well as to just let myself become a part of this community and actively join in, as thats the thing i havent done for so long. I feel like i wanna do so much with my life and weed doesnt help with that. I dont have a house or a car, stayed far away from women, never go out to socialise, my weight is the smallest its ever been (10 stone 11, approx 68 kilos, and im 6ft so im defo underweight), and i Know there are people who have been through this as well.

Been smoking for 12 years, daily unless I'm on vacation or some special circumstance. My mental health was ok until the last couple of years. But I would smoke to forget my problems, and to make myself feel good without having to accomplish any of my goals, and to daydream that one day (just around the corner) I'd be some big-shot who everybody loved.

Well after trying to quit and lasting 3 weeks, I realize that I do indeed have low self-esteem. Basically I am full of self-doubts, I am constantly judging myself against others negatively (like judging myself against geniuses and olympians... jeezuz...), and I talk down to myself saying I am just lacking something. Just the regular 'I'm not good enough' thoughts. And I have discovered the roots in my childhood and upbringing (never being complimented, never being praised when I did well, etc).

(textbook relapse too.... buying a little bit of weed everyday and smoking it all as ""this is my last time!!""... then doing it all again the next day)

So I am getting therapy because I need it for sure.... but yea, I suspect a lot of people on here also are suffering from low self esteem and smoke to forget, because that's what I did. Well I hope you can get past it. I hope I can get past it, with regular work on my part I know I can. I don't care if it takes 10 years, I will be a better me.

Stopping smoking has had all these negative thoughts flood back into my mind. And it's long overdue. So I guess I gotta pay my dues and put in my work on myself. All the time I spend smoking, years of my life, was spent to forget myself. Well now I must look clearly and work on myself, so I can improve what I don't like.

Now a thought has crossed my mind because I went to the dentist recently and he told me I had to stop smoking for 4 days after the surgery  (I didn't smoke for about 8 hours, then I managed to strongly reduce for the first 48 hours). He kept ""joking"" about the fact that it was a good opportunity to quit completely. And so I thought.. maybe I could quit weed and tobacco at the same time?

I don't want to minimize the withdrawal symptoms I will have, but as I do have a tobacco addiction as well, so why not do both eh ? I know that I will be hard to cope with for the first few weeks probably but I will be on holiday at my mum's place in a beautiful remote area, and I do wish to quit smoking tobacco as well.

Have you ever wondered if the so-called creativity weed gives you is just an ILLUSION? What if your brain is associating being high with giving you some rewards, to get you even more addicted? It happens with the other organs, why wouldn't it happen with the thoughts organ?

Brain: ""he's got some ideas, but i'm gonna withhold them until he's high, so he gets used to giving me what I crave if he wants it again"". I'm willing to bet it is something like this.

I have ptsd because of the things that have happened in my past. When I was a teen, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which I later found out was a faulty diagnosis. I was on psychiatric medications from the age 13-19. When I was 19 I used marijuana to help myself ween off of my psych meds. Since then, I have been able to do more with my life and even look at the traumas which led to my ptsd. For a long time I was feeling better than I ever had, I was able to go to college and work, and when I came home I would smoke pot to help me sleep at night without nightmares.

However, over this last year, I went through some events that have left me in a state in which my ptsd has been acting up worse than it has for  5 years. I am not currently working and I am living at home with my father. I have been using marijuana extra heavily for the past 6 months.

I have recently realized that the marijuana, which used to help me, has now been preventing me from feeling safe and accepted in the outside world and prevented me from being able to feel confident interacting with other people professionally and holding a job, I have begun to ween off. I am currently only vaping between the hours of 10pm-5am to help myself sleep. 

However during the day, I feel completely drained, I experience sharp headaches, I am dealing with major depression, and my ptsd comes and strikes me without warning causing me to feel completely overwhelmed with basic everyday things. Currently, I honestly don‚Äôt see too much of a point in continuing living. I‚Äôve been on medications/drugs/pot so long I‚Äôm not sure I will ever feel okay inside my own body. I‚Äôve tried studying spirituality as a way to help, but honestly I only feel more ready to die now.

But I am trying to put my best foot forward and stay positive. I don‚Äôt want to hurt the people I love by hurting myself. So I am trying to take care of myself. I know I will need to get a job to do this, and I can‚Äôt do that if I‚Äôm always stoned. 
I know many of you have been through these pains before. And I felt it was time I finally reached out to someone so I don‚Äôt burden my loved one with these fatalistic thoughts.

Has anyone on here ever had to deal with withdrawls and ptsd at the same time before? How did you get through it?

Do you think it would be better to continue weening off? Or would it shorten the pain of the withdrawls to quit cold turkey?

Thank you to whoever reads this.

I just feel completely on edge and like life just sucks. But weed helps.

I know it's not healthy to have any substance that you rely on to go about your daily life- especially one thats illegal (in some states) and is potentially making the problem worse. A couple years ago, when I began my freshman year of college and basically quit cold turkey cause you couldn't smoke in the dorms (there was no windows and my roommate was pretty sketchy) I went through the worst withdrawals. I felt like a shell of a human for 2 weeks. There was obviously the emotional symptoms of anxiety and all that, but anyone who says there's no physical withdrawal symptoms from weed is full of shit or at least wasn't smoking at the frequency that I was. I had the worst stomach aches for 2 weeks. I lost 10 pounds in two weeks because I could not stomach any food. I would take one bite and would feel instantly nauseous. Every morning that I woke up I would feel like I was gonna puke for the first 1 hr of my day. But eventually I started smoking again (dabs in the dorm lol). I'm wanting to quit again, and I guess I just wanna know what peoples symptoms were when they quit. Also if you felt similar feelings of anxiety and depression when you were smoking did quitting help with that? Thanks!!! Anything would be appreciated.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9966241121292114}"

Today‚Äôs better. 

Cravings are fading to almost none. 

I also quit cigarettes on day 2. 

I don‚Äôt even think about smoking today and that feels great.  I don‚Äôt even remember liking being high. 

Day 2 was the hardest. I had no idea the physical symptoms would be so horrid. Especially because I‚Äôve quit a few times in the past with no withdrawals. 

I already have chronic illness and it‚Äôs scary to see my health get worst during this time . I‚Äôm hoping this isn‚Äôt actual exacerbating my illness. 

Still haven‚Äôt eating in about 5 days. 
I literally forced myself to eat a yogurt and 5 cashews. 
Flu like body aches since yesterday. 
Tummy ache 
Tummy bubbling
Reflux
Sweats
Nausea 
Burps 
Slight headaches 

Crying over anything emotional like music. Not in a sad way Though.  My feelings have always been intense. Now I remember why I started using to numb them....but it‚Äôs okay.  I‚Äôm okay with letting all these feelings surface.  My life was very tumultuous when I started smoking so heavy and needing it everyday. Some of those bad memories keep popping up. I‚Äôve had a lot of people treat me badly in the past and I guess I was trying to numb that part. As some of these old feelings resurface I plan on journaling them and finally releasing them. I didn‚Äôt even know I had some of these old situations sitting atop my subconscious just waiting to come out. 

I don‚Äôt regret it because I‚Äôm sure it saved my life. I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to go through the things I did in the past years with out. I still have hard life at time but nothing like back when I started using heavy. I was complete heartbroken and self medicating. Now I‚Äôve been doing the inner work to heal myself and it made me realize that I don‚Äôt enjoy ganja. it started out as self medication for the things I couldn‚Äôt control but now I‚Äôve accepted that there are things I can‚Äôt control and things I can and I will focus on the latter. I‚Äôm so much more emotionally healthy than I was when I started using heavy. 

I‚Äôve not even had much anger or irritability which is super surprising. I‚Äôve been really angry on days when I ran out and couldn‚Äôt get more and I thought I would feel similar but I‚Äôm eerily calm. 

I‚Äôm  still struggling with doing much of anything. My children must be able to sense something because they been talking to me and hanging out with me all day even though I usually have to pull them off of video game and out of their room.  They also washed dishes and cooked dinner. I didn‚Äôt ask them. They just volunteered. Unfortunately I can‚Äôt eat it. They also put my tv on music I enjoy. They are so sweet. I didn‚Äôt have the energy to do it myself 

I really dislike that I‚Äôm entirely alone of other adults right now. I have no one I can turn to in my life for support. Its not because I pushed everyone away. I‚Äôve just been a single parent of  multiple children. Some with special needs and it has been all consuming for the last 15 years of my life. 

I hope now that I‚Äôm seeing more clearly.... I can actually build meaningful relations eventually. 

I don‚Äôt even care about smoking at all which is a complete 180 from 2 days ago. I was going crazy with cravings Day 1.... which brought me to find this forum. Right now, I just wish I didn‚Äôt feel so sick physically. If I have to feel like this when I quit I probably will never smoke again.  It‚Äôs leaving a bad taste in my mouth.

I want to get out and do something, but I had to kind of cut off a lot of my friends, because the only reason we'd hang out was to smoke. I feel really bad hanging out with my girlfriend, as she has a really good job, and a car.

So today is my 95th day sober. I have been here before. I quit last year July 4th and went through rehab. I was 104 days sober and it was a slippery slope from there. Now am back and I have done my best to extricate myself from weed. 
However, some things happened in the last 2 weeks. 
1. I have been doing really well. I dropped out of college for the third time in April and after a long wait (till mid July) I got an online writing job
2. Last week my aunt came along. She has a son who dropped out of college too but coz of alcohol. She decided to give me a lecture about how I was no longer a child but was behaving like one. She ended up discrediting all I had done so far. By that time I had started waking up earlier consistently for a month and had been sober for 2 months. Her son went to rehab before me and isnt sober now. (alcohol not weed) I know we have different journeys but I felt like it was unfair to be grouped with him since I have had a handle on my drug use, have a job and have been actively working to improve my life
3. Since the incidence mentioned in number 2 I have sort of stared drinking. Not a lot but since Thursday last week I have drunk 1 and 3/8 litres of whiskey by myself. 
I have a problem with taking people's opinions too seriously and I was really hurt that the progress I had started making by myself was just trumped under someone's feet like it was nothing. It also hurt that my mum didn't have my back (I've been raised as an only child). I just feel like I am really trying to get my s$#t together and it's not fair when people just dismiss your efforts. 

Okay the point of this rant is to seek advice and validation. I know that I shouldn't but I feel like 95 days is a lot but for someone who used for 5 years and who has stopped on my own I feel like it's worth something. It's also for advice on how to not take other people's opinions seriously especially when they don't notice how much effort goes into beating an addiction. 

Tldr. 
I had someone invalidate my sobriety efforts and started drinking as a result. I am 95 days sober of weed and have been drinking alcohol in the last 2 weeks. Need advice/encouragement.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9976174235343933}"

This eventually led me down a destructive path and caused me anxiety/depression when I wasn't high which would inevitably make me worse in the long run and then the anxiety started creeping in, whilst I was high too. My wallet also definitely took a toll. From then on, I decided enough was enough.

My problems are a lion. I am a human. Cannabis takes me away in a UFO of youtube videos. The Cannabis UFO brings me back to the lion when the high is over. The lion is still there, and grew because of biology. My UFO trip did not allow me to grow, because biology does not exist in UFOs for now i think.

This is an analogy i found on r/leaves.

I am now facing my problems head on        ^(Apply directly to the forehead).

I don't want to give up on my youth to pursue something artificial and eventually runs out. It was fun, and its fun everytime, but this getting high, fun stuff is getting way too fun where I can't seem to get out of it.

This is my day one. I threw away my pen at 7:00 am yesterday, smoked my last joint 10:00 pm last night to go to sleep easier.

I woke up thinking of buying weed. A delivery service in my area can come with a pen in 30 minutes at 8:30 AM. These people are making a living doing this, so they don't care about my usage. They have families too. I have unemployment money.

But i did not buy it. I stood strong.

Wake up -> bathroom -> cereal -> meditate -> straight to studying 25 min block -> reddit post.

I will finish my day without extra THC from weed. Please help me through the way, because I have tried to quit so many times before with this mentality, and everytime I keep failing.

First of all thank you for creating this amazing sub! I was always used to ""pro-weed"" content on the internet and it's good to see a community to support us quitting without any moral judgement!

I've been having depression for as long as I remember and weed helped me so much with it. I started smoking daily 4 years ago as soon as I wake up but I've been unemployed for the last year and I became a really heavy smoker.

I started using weed basically as a substitute for cigarettes (even though I put both tobacco and weed in my joints). This helped me a lot to get in shape and start to exercice regularly and that was great for me.

Thing is, it also fucked me up when preparing for a lot of exams which I failed, as well as a lot of interviews for jobs that I would have loved to get before this pandemic.

It also fucked up really bad my love life and my social relations in general, it numbs my feelings so much that I just started smoking to cope with everything and anything. A lot of people left my life because of it and I kinda regret that even though I'm just passive as hell because of pot.

I'm feeling that it's lowkey contributing to my depression because I can't sleep no more even though I'm usually high 24/7.

I tried to stay sober for a few hours each day but even then all I feel is just emptiness and the need to roll a joint. 

It's not a recreative chill use anymore, I know that I have a serious addiction that I need to deal with to feel better about myself and my life. I just feel trapped in the addiction.

I'm gathering my force to quit for good these next days but I would love any possible tip to start this journey.

I did try to quit a few times before but could never manage to go over 2 weeks. Withdrawal signs became just too much and I had to deal with a lot of emotional pain at the same time. I'm sure it was more the addiction than the pain though..

Did anyone experience this ? 

Thanks to everyone for their replies! Stay strong everybody! 

PS : Please don't hesitate to delete my post if it goes against this sub rules.

Edit : I started sobering up a bit at least during the day times and I already feel better. I'm gonna se my therapist and ask her about the most effective way to quit this addiction! Thanks everybody for your comments and support !

Each time I decide to stop, I have to get in one last mega high, like a closing ceremony or sth. Problem is every next morning I wake up so groggy, I just wanna sleep in, I spend my day going through this sub and others, I psych myself up that I really can stop. Problem is, at the end of the day I feel as if my day was wasted, so I think, why not get some weed, smoke tonight and start my weed free journey tomorrow? So I get the joints, get high and soon enough it's morning and I'm feeling fucked. And so the cycle continues.

I made it 3 days till yesterday, when I felt as if I should have a GRAND closing ceremony, so I got some weed and here I am, I got a headache, I've been on my phone almost all day looking for quiting inspiration. Now it's almost 1600h and I feel like my day is wasted, so maybe I should go get some weed before it gets dark and close it up one last time. I realize this mentality is self defeating but I can't seem to break away. Any help would be appreciated.

I started smoking when i came to college and ever since i smoked almost everyday starting from sophomore year up until this past March once all this covid stuff started. It was about 3 years or so that i was smoking every day multiple times a day and one day I decided to stop and thankfully ive been able to stop ever since March. I did experience withdrawal mostly in the form of anxiety/anxiety attacks which have lessened alot in the past couple weeks. My question is, will I ever be able to smoke casually without getting anxious the days following? Like if a friend stops by and brings weed would I be able to smoke that one day and be ok the following days? 

Im really scared to even start smoking again simply because of the effects weed had on me when i was smoking alot and randomly went cold turkey. I was just wondering if any of you have had a similar situation and ended up being ok or if it was just not worth it... anyway thank you for all your help and best of luck to anybody that is trying to quit! It is possible and I know you can do it!

The last time I had THC was on December 15, 2019. I had just moved home a month earlier from college for winter break. Due to my dependence on weed I had dropped out before the semester was over, causing me to lose all of my credits. I was smoking pretty much every single day, skipping classes, not caring at all. My memory was complete garbage and I still can't remember the names of most of my professors. On top of all of this I was severely depressed, anxious and depersonalized. It was the scariest and most confusing point in my life and I am lucky to have made it out of it.

Even though I wasted a thousands of dollars of my parents money on my failed attempt of going to college. I enrolled in a local community college and did really well there. I took 15 credits and got a 4.0! I had quit smoking weed and the future was looking a little better (I am still depersonalized). 

I was at work yesterday and a friend who I used to smoke with was working a shift with me. I haven't seen this guy in a while and made a deliberate choice to avoid because I knew that he always carried a dab pen. I tried to act normal, but I soon gave into the temptation. I asked to see his dab pen and that was the end of it. I took it back the break room and started taking a few pulls. The moment I started getting high, it reminded myself of why I quit smoking weed and taking dabs in the first place. I began to get very uncomfortable and anxious. My visual snow and depersonalization were going crazy. THC isn't all that great. I enjoyed it in the beginning, but now it just isn't the same, it will never be the same.

I don't feel the urge to smoke anymore after the experience though. I think going through this taught me that there is still much more healing to be had.

My gf is also quitting with me, which does make it slightly easier, but she hadn't smoked for as long as me and so isn't having the same experience as me. We have a 9 month old daughter together and she is the ultimate source of inspiration. And not just because the \~¬£400 a month we'd drop on grass would be better spent on her.

However I am personally running in to a few issues. I knew I'd have some difficulty eating, as I have cyclic vomiting syndrome and weed was what would settle my stomach. But I'm 6'4"" and only weigh 69kgs, so only being able to eat two slices of a pizza a day isn't really doing me any favours. I ate four vegetable samosas earlier, and maybe an hour later was throwing them back up. Obviously it was always going to be this bad, but I'm just wondering at what point some of you started to get your appetite/ability to eat back again? Does anyone have any recommendations for someone with such a weak stomach?

My second issue is just how depressed I am. I cried for a whole hour last night because life is futile and, even now I have a child, still feels meaningless. Doesn't help that I'm still furloughed from work so am very much trapped in my house, and all my friends were smokers (I say were, because apparently they're not my friends anymore). The last time I went to therapy they told me I probably have borderline personality disorder, so I never really had the best of control over my emotions originally, and I've been arguing with the gf over stupid shit which obviously only makes me feel worse. And then there's the intrusive thoughts of suicide that, while I'm too scared of death to go through with, aren't exactly ideal at the moment. 

I've seen people on here saying that the weed just made them okay with not being okay, and that truly is the most perfect description of it. But now I'm just not okay. I can take the route of trying to constantly keep myself busy, but when the podcast/video/music ends and I'm back in the silence, I'm straight back to where I don't want to be. And again, I'm aware this is going to be a thing for a while (same with the sleepless nights (but there's nothing new there really)), but again if anyone has any advice on what kept them going through all this I would really love to hear it. It's not even a desire to relapse; I dont want to smoke. I just want to be happy. Any tips or tricks would be greatly appreciated.

2020-08-17 16:00:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/iblmmv/its_been_3_months_and_im_not_doing_well/,It's been 3 months and I'm not doing well,"Title. I've been clean for three months. When the quarantine started I was working part-time, finishing my bachelor's, and smoking a lot of weed. I felt that I was going overboard with my weed usage so I decided to give it a break. I had set myself a goal of stopping til I turn 25 (which would be about 14 months from when I quit). So I finished my bachelor's, started working full-time at my job (remote), and quit weed all around the same time in May.

The first couple weeks I felt great because I was ""lifting"" the fog that heavy weed smoking had created in my brain. I started making some positive strides. I wanted to work on losing weight. I wanted to try to get a better job. I wanted to work on being creative and on furthering my skillset. I wanted to work on my mental health and increasing my overall productivity. It didn't last long.

Now it's been three months since I quit and, although I'm proud of myself for sticking with it, I feel like *shit*. I haven't accomplished any of the things I felt like accomplishing, or even made any progress at all really. My anxiety and depression is through the roof, even more so than when I was smoking. I work the 40 hours a week that I have to but I feel like a husk while doing it and afterwards. My productivity is all but non-existent. I tried to get mental health care, but my insurance won't cover any of it, and I don't make nearly enough money to pay for it out of pocket. 

I have tools that I can use to try to improve my mental health and I use them. I journal. I go on walks. I don't drink alcohol (which was never really a problem for me in the first place). I try my best to keep my sleep schedule consistent and even occasionally see friends (masked up and socially distantly, of course). I'm working on spending less time on my phone. But despite it all, it's like I'm stuck in this negative mindset. And this pandemic definitely isn't helping. I don't feel suicidal or sad, but I feel drained, and when I have free time I'm not interested in any of hobbies or goals or even things I do for fun. I just want to not do anything. 

So now, for the first time in three months, I'm considering smoking weed again. I've been thinking about it for over a week now but I wanted to ask what people from this community thought. For me the problem with weed was never what happened during before or after smoking, but more just overusing it. Personally, I feel as if I am much better equipped to handle that aspect of it now.  Is it realistic to think that I could smoke once every few months or to use it in moderation? Or am I just deluding myself?",5,"{'quarantine': 1, 'mask': 1, 'pandemic': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9985376596450806}"

Okay, so I've been a daily smoker for 10 years, and for me personally, I need a change from the hazy cloud I've been floating on. I started to notice the negative effects of marijuana in the past year or so after experiencing my first panic attack caused by weed. I still have a love for the herb but I know that my body is telling me it's not for me anymore.  I've done successful tolerance breaks in the past but always had the intention of returning to the herb and these were pretty grim, nightmares, night sweats, anxiety, unable to sleep or eat etc but I got through it. 

Anyway, this time seems to be a lot easier (up to now) I'm not saying I'm having 0 withdrawal symptoms as I'm still craving and not sleeping as much but for some reason, I have still been eating as normal (maybe not as much) but I'm getting my 2/3 meals a day whereas before I could barely stomach one small meal.

Proud moment last night: I was with some friends that were all smoking and I didn't really get any temptations at all which was strange but kinda liberating.  Excited to see how clear my mind will be after the 30-day mark. Experiencing a lot less stress/anxiety already and I noticed my wallet is smiling at me and I'm as sober as a judge - maybe these hallucinations are withdrawal symptons? ;) lol.

I've been a heavy smoker/vaper for good part of 3-4yrs now. Average 0.5-1g a day, probably about 45 weeks out of the year. Having a break as I was getting sick and felt it moving onto my chest, figured it was a good time to put it to rest.

I'm experiencing a range of symptoms, some I'm sure are related to weed, some i'm not as certain - which are causing a bit of anxiety. I'm looking for some clarity, reassurance or what have you on the following symptoms. All comments appreciated.

1.) Black phlegm, we all know this one i'm sure. Coughing this shit up for a good week or two now.

Gosh the days are so long. I'm now in the very healthy habit of sleeping between 10pm and 7am. It feels good, but I'm also spending hours staring at my phone and watching TV. Hoping to rectify that this week, and find some more productive things to do with my time (unemployment sucks!) I completely forgot I am the Queen of Procrastination, doesn't matter if I'm sober or high.

I still really hate leaving the house, especially if I have to do it on my own. It's odd, because I'm more than happy to have visitors, so I don't think it's a social anxiety thing. I just dislike the unpredictability of the outside world. Gonna force myself to walk to the shops further away and pick up my prescriptions later. I know the best cure for this sort of thing is to face the fear. Perhaps I'll just force myself to leave the house alone on a regular basis until my brain learns it's okay.

I keep getting constant background headaches. I think these are withdrawal ones, and also my jaw being constantly tense from anxiety is putting extra pressure on my little head. I remember them from my sober teenage years, so I wonder if it's a subconscious coping mechanism? So weird. 

My appetite is fluctuating massively. Yesterday I ate half a chicken! And yet some days I totally forget to eat. Hoping this will even out soon, I may have to set alarms on my phone to remind me to eat regularly so I stop see sawing from one day to the next.

All that said, it's been a whole month sober, after 7 and a half years stoned to the bone. I can now see I was searching for answers in the wrong place, and just that simple thought stops my cravings in their tracks. Onwards and upwards to finding healthy coping mechanisms!

I felt like the universe was testing me though because I had two different situations occur where I could have smoked. But I didnt. The first time was saturday (august 15) at a birthday party. At one point, half of the people in attendance went on a walk to go smoke more than once. I decided not to run up and join. Later on that same evening, an attendee whom I bought for before notified me of the ""really good"" bud that they had. I was tempted, but notified them that I was in the process of quitting. 

The next occurrence happened yesterday (august 16). I decided to hang out with my best friend who is also a smoker. I knew that at any moment I could have asked her if I could smoke and that she would have handed me her bowl without giving it a second thought. Except I didnt. And for that I'm proud.

What's strange though, is that I cant remember what it even feels like to be stoned and this will be day 4 for me. What I can recall though, is how I felt a few months ago when I tried to quit and relapsed.

I've been smoking weed since i was 16, regular daily use started at 20 and i'm now 32. I had my first joint at the age of 15 that was handed to me by my dad and at the age of between 7-10 i was standing in my dad's attack surrounded by skunk plants. Considering that i'd say i never had a chance of not smoking it but as an adult i can't blame my parents for the continued use. It's been in my life and system for half of my life and that makes me really uncomfortable with myself.


Since lockdown i noticed how much of it i smoked and actually was ashamed of the money i'd spent on it. Half ounces to go along with all the games i was buying just for something to do as i was between jobs when lockdown came. I will say that while i was on it i became a pro chef and have been since 18 and got qualified too. Doing a long shift then coming home to smoke and play games was my life for so long and i struggle with confidence which i feel the weed only magnified.¬†


I'm now on day 8 and the headaches and night sweats are here. Feels like my brain is in a vice and so many thoughts just rushing around as my brain gets back to normal functionality and i wake up absolutely drenched in sweat and when it dries it stinks of weed. My dreams are really vivid and rather unpleasant as through smoking weed i never used to dream as while you are high you don't get rem (rapid eye movement) sleep and weed inhibits the part of your brain that allows you to dream but i wake up feeling exhausted and like i haven't slept. I guess thats because my body is flushing the toxins out and my brain sorting itself out meaning i'm not actually getting rest as the body and mind have more to process as i sleep


When people say ""oh it's just a joint"" and ""it's not addictive"" i can tell you thats is pure bullshit. Anything you enjoy doing can become addictive and as far as coming off it it's by far the hardest drug to come off. I've read so many reddit posts and personal accounts online from people who use and were addicted to multiple drugs and they all say the same thing. Weed is the hardest one to come off. Naturally it stays in the system for a month but prolonged use can take up to 3 months to fully clear out of the system. Considering that i can honestly say i don't know what it's like to not have it in my system and i am under no illusions that i have a long and hard road ahead of me.


Handling my emotions and learning to cope without it will be the battle of my lifetime. I grew up without a mother as she was raped by her own brother at the age of 13, kept it to herself then at the age of 17 went into an abusive and toxic relationship with my dad. After having her 3rd child at the age of 24 my mum had a massive mental breakdown leading her to be sectioned and taken away from me at the age of 4. Didn't properly connect with her till i was 28 and due to the years in a psychiatric ward with all the medication she is a shade of her former self but i'm so proud of her for even getting well enough to be able to live independently as alot of people don't make it out of those places and are just gone


My dad was abusive to me as a kid. A slap to the face was a regular thing as a kid. For normal things that kids do like draw on walls. He had broken my nose twice before the age of 17 just through laying his fists into me when he was drunk, coked up or in a bad mood through not having his addictive substances. I was 26 before i stood up to him and hit him back and 28 when i stood up to him verbally.¬†


Point being is i'm worried and scared about how i will process all this emotionally and mentally once i start to get back to normal fuctionality. Certainly going to be sitting there in floods of tears as weed has been a coping mechanism for as long as i can remember


I'm already starting to see some upsides after only 8 days though. Speed of thought and my mind is becoming clearer by the day. I may even start to find some confidence and self esteem somewhere along the way.


Any support would be much appreciated. I know i can do this, i know what to expect and i know it will certainly be worth it

Blistering white tile and matching countertops reflected the double overhead light. A handsome shower stood casually in the background. I looked closely at myself in the gold-trimmed mirror: an attractive face, marred by a slightly bulbous nose, with the last remnants of acne beginning to fade. Blocky, powerful muscles resting atop a touch too much waist. A plain blue t-shirt and athletic shorts adorning my body. For now, this was my world.

It wasn‚Äôt the sight that held my attention with rapture; I looked at myself every day, after all. It was the nervous anticipation of what was to come. I was going to smoke. To get high. To get the sweet rush of endorphins, the euphoria, the release from all the anxiety, stress, and worries of my life. I had many problems to escape from, I told myself. Sure, I had a girlfriend I loved. A caring, well-off family. Acceptance to one of the top graduate schools in the world. Great friends across each city I‚Äôd lived in. But none of it mattered. I was willing to throw it all away as long as I could plunge into sweet bliss. 

I told myself getting high would ease the inescapable depression that always struck when I was at my best. Getting high and staying high would make life better. I‚Äôd struggled with marijuana use in the past, but this time was different. This time I could regulate it. Besides, I still had a couple months before school started. Even if I did overindulge, I could always stop after a few weeks of use. Any resistance, any alarm bells, any past experiences, were rendered irrelevant. This time would be different.

Six weeks later, I stood in front of the same mirror. It was 9am. The excitement of getting high, and enjoying the high, had almost entirely dissipated. I was smoking now just to avoid the pain of reality and the inevitable physical and mental side effects of ceasing use. I hadn‚Äôt talked to my friends in weeks; the inflow of messages had slowed to a trickle then stopped as they went unanswered. My girlfriend resented my distance and lack of attention and left me. Implicitly lying to my family for weeks had strained our relationship. I didn‚Äôt care. Orientation for grad school was 12 days away, but I was no longer excited about studying. That would mean work. Effort. Interactions with other humans. I had my escape, right there in the bathroom. This time would be different.

I first started smoking when I was 20. For me, weed was the perfect antidote to the loneliness and self-hatred I experienced as a nerdy young woman desperate for love and affection. Dating was incredibly hard for me, and after discovering weed at various college parties, it became my daily habit, when I could get it. My nightly regimen was smoking up and listening to music while I fell asleep, which was a handy distraction from how sad and lonely I felt most of the time. My love of weed became famous among my friends. Other college stoners would look at me and justify their own use, saying, ""Well, if she can keep getting awesome grades while smoking that much pot, then I can too!"" 

After college, I got better at my love problems, and weed use became more sporadic. I'd go through heavy periods of use followed by long periods (sometimes years) of not using at all. Reading David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest caused me to quit for six months straight, as he described the shitty aspects of weed so incredibly accurately, that I simply couldn't do it for a while. But I always came back to it. I'm an anxious person, and weed felt like the perfect antidote to the insomnia, self-judgment, and busy thoughts that are my usual state of being. Weed felt like true rest, a break from worrying about things. 

And I justified it to myself for years because a) I never smoked before work and b) I hadn't lost any relationships or gotten into any law trouble over weed. That meant I was ok, right? Maybe so, if it hadn't been for what happened in 2017.

On April 14, 2017, my best childhood friend was raped and murdered. The grief I experienced from this was profound. I took to heavy daily homemade edible use and smoking, too, to try and escape the grief and unbelievable rage I felt. (Thankfully, her killer was found, tried, and is now on death row.) That's when things really started to go downhill. I had fewer and fewer sober breaks after that. I saw various therapists to help, but nothing really stuck. One therapist even (unwittingly) enabled me by suggesting she write me a letter so I could get a medical marijuana card (I live in PA, and about two years ago, anxiety was finally added to the list of ""acceptable"" symptoms). That made things worse, honestly, as there's a dispensary within walking distance of my house. I used more and more, different strains every time. This is when I started experiencing panic attacks when I ate my edibles, which had never happened to me before. That slowed me down a bit.

But then COVID happened. I'm a massage therapist, and overnight my career was ruined. I've had to close my business, something that I worked very hard to grow for the past two years. With that, the general shitty state of our country, and everything else going on over the past few months, I was so depressed this past April that I could barely get off the couch, unless it was to make more edibles. I was lucky in that my husband makes enough to cover all of our expenses, so I didn't need to work...which meant I had plenty of time to get high all day, every day. I quit for a month in late April-May, which actually was an amazing experience. By the end of that month, I felt great! I wondered why I ever even enjoyed weed in the first place, as it had become such a guilt-inducing, and even panic-inducing, experience. I loved having more energy, feeling clear-headed, and being more engaged with the regular everyday aspects of life, even during lockdown. 

But by Memorial Day, I wanted to try smoking again. I thought I could handle it, just having a little toke once a week or something, which worked at first since my tolerance was so ridiculously low after abstaining that that first toke nearly made me pass out. But it all came back after a few weeks. I went back to edibles, and because I was tired of the foggy brain induced by indicas, I switched to incredibly high THC percentage sativas, thinking that this was a better choice. 

NOPE. I quit three days ago, and this is by far the WORST withdrawal I've ever gone through: sweating like a pig, insomnia, crying at every little thing, shakes, no appetite, nausea. These miserable symptoms were a real wake up call this time. After so many years of thinking ""Oh it's just weed, it won't hurt you,"" this scared me into seeing the truth. Weed can be good for some, but it's just not good for me anymore. I've spent so much time crying the last few days, partly because I feel betrayed and abandoned. Weed was my friend when I was sad, my lover when I was lonely, my bedtime story when I couldn't sleep, my relief from difficult feelings. But now I feel the truth of it: the only way out of difficult feelings is through them. All the anxiety, sadness, and anger I've been trying to medicate for the last 20 years feels like it's coming out now. I'm here for it. I'm exhausted, but I'm fucking here for it.",10,"{'covid': 1, 'lockdown': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.6447828412055969}"

TL;DR: I want to quit weed because it causes me issues in my life in gen, couple. My flatmate is a smoker. I feel like I have zero self-commitment.  


I am currently in a not cool situation, I'm in my 20's and since the outbreak started, I started to smoke on a daily basis and a lot. (+-10J/day).I don't really know why I started but I've never been like this before and always enjoyed that on an occasional basis and said I would never smoke on a daily basis while working etc, but I did it.   
I spent almost all my salary in weed, even more. And when I'm high, I'm not me and I do stupid things like ordering food 5 times a day while playing and buying games. 

I used to be an active guy that would do a workout, take care of him, cook nice food and stuff. But now I cannot. And I see myself going down and my bank account getting really low every week.   


I tried to quit last week and after one day I couldn't resist, I had to smoke. My flatmate is a smoker and he has no intention of quitting at all, which I respect, his life, not mine. But the thing is he smoked inside his room as it always have been and the smell just makes me want to smoke a joint, and he just gave me a joint while I was waiting to buy weed.  


I really feel like I have zero self-commitment and that I'm really weak. Everyone keeps laughing when I say no I don't want to smoke cause they know I'll be smoking the day after. My GF just left for 2 weeks on holidays and I told her, I will quit weed and I won't be smoking when she comes back, she laughed.  I want this to change and I want to stop. Prove to myself I can become the guy I was before, prove to my GF as well that she was wrong (it causes a lot of issue in our couple). Well, I want to quit.

&#x200B;

It's been now a bit more than 14 hours I haven't smoked a joint. I'm alone at home and I don't know what to do to not think about smoking. I tried to play with my Xbox but I stopped after 3 minutes, cause I usually play when I'm high. So I'm writing here instead.   


Thank you for reading, thank you in advance for all your advice. I need to write and talk a bit about it, hope it's ok.

Can‚Äôt believe how quickly the time has passed.

I am so much more optimistic about my life in general. When I would get high every day I felt like I was in such a rut.

In short, stoned me = hopeless me.

Knowing I have the strength to kick a 15 year habit has given me the strength to change so much more in my life.

I have lost 50 pounds and look better than ever, started new hobbies, improved relationships with family and friends and in general have a way more positive/healthy outlook on life.

I also have been going through therapy for a few months, something I never would have done while getting high all the time.

Thanks to everyone who has given advice and shown support over these months, it really helps :)

Yes, it makes us high  but can we control it? Is it good for our health? Are we living our  lives to the fullest? From my experience you cannot live live to it  fullest with drugs.

One day I was  driving with my friend home and he asked me - do you wanna get high? To  my surprise I started to think about but I had not felt any urge. I had  not felt any craving at all. I was considering it but found out that I  just do not need it anymore.

It  always open a question to me how is this possible. I stopped a few  times, once also for a half year but to be honest I always had cravings.  When I stopped for a half year it was just a pure luck that I had not  have many chances to smoke weed at all.

This  time it was different. I visited many parties and to be honest weed was  widely available everywhere. I saw people smoking it in front of me,  offering it to me and I had no issues to tell them no. I rejected weed  even several times a week without any issues.

I  do not want it. I found a cause. This time is different I am not  solving my addiction I am solving a root cause. The root cause is  difficult emotions. It has never been different but I have always been  so blind to it. I always used weed to mask my difficult emotions I had  troubles with. I had not wanted to feel negative emotions so I used a  weed to prevent them and it just did not work.

The  pure secret was meditation. Yes, everyone meditate nowadays, you hear  it so often but who meditates daily? I spoke with people from meditation  groups, a lot of people going to meditation retreats but practically no  one do it daily.

I am kinda  exception. I am definitely not some kind of monk, I just relax for 20  minutes daily. If you think you do not have time for it think again how  much time you spend with weed.

I didn't even know it existed. In the last 30 minutes or so I've come across so many great stories, suggestions and shared dilemmas regarding giving up the green for good. I'd love to share some of my story:

I'm in my mid-40's and started smoking just over 25 years ago, just as I transitioned to college. Like most here, I've struggled to get weed out of my life after realizing it led to prolonged bouts of depression, inertia, introverted/antisocial behaviour and a bottomless pit of emotional/reflexive eating. It also led to some of my best friendships, funniest stories and memories, which, despite being well in the past now, continue to act as some kind of positive emotional trigger for me to continue to smoke (or vape, or eat, etc.). 

When I am in possession of any MJ or MJ product I have to have it all. I cannot ration it, cannot tell myself to wait until a certain time of day to smoke. I will smoke when the mood strikes me, and that is often. 6am? Sure. (Note I don't drive or do anything that would put my family at risk when I smoke). I've always been a big guy and struggled to get my weight down. For a long time I refused to acknowledge the correlation between my puffing on MJ and ""puffing up"". It was always something I told myself I'd get under control ""tomorrow""... sound familiar? I had great success earlier this year - from about December through mid-March I managed to safely lose about 30 pounds and stay off MJ. Every day that passed I felt was another layer in the barrier between me and returning to smoke. Then COVID hit, I started working from home, family stresses increased as we were all trapped together and I've put back most of that weight as I looked for an escape from our current reality. My family does not know, as I use products like vaporizers and others that eliminate the smell or leave no tell-tale signs.

So, even though I know cannot succeed with bettering my health while I continue to sometimes the cravings are SO POWERFUL that I will do away with the positive progress  in favour of feeling good very temporarily. Even though I know from experience that I will feel worse after smoking (and eating) I do it anyway because that's ""what I know"". The contempt I have for myself afterwards (and often during) robs any of the perceived ""joy"" of getting high. I have young kids (who know nothing of this) and my mind often goes to thoughts of how I'm acting selfishly by smoking and wondering if I will be around to see my kids grow up if I continue down this path. Thoughts of death and disappointment often consume me, yet I continue to use...

I'm in a city that has legalized MJ in various forms, so now it's as easy as walking to the corner (literally) and having my choice between buds, concentrates, pills, food, drink, etc. I'd be curious to see how those in the same circumstances are adapting to try and stay away or minimize their consumption?

I'm sorry for the long post, but it's also my very first on Reddit. I just want to say that I'm glad to have found this group and I hope that looking through some of the discussions will help me remember I'm not alone in this and that this is a real struggle for many.",4,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9848761558532715}"

I need it to play my guitar, to play pc games, to have deep conversations with myself and others. But nowadays I just dont feel good when I smoke because of anxiety. Its so scary to quit because I dont know what I would do without it but I cant live like this anymore.

It used to be a crutch for me and ultimately I think it is what stopped me from figuring out how to be my best self. Its weird because only when I am high will I have these toughts. Getting home from work sober I wont even think twice about not smoking.

The sober me wants to smoke for relief. High me wants to quit for relief. I cannot ever get it and it is really scary. I'll pick up my guitar sober and it sounds so bad.  I'll boot up a game and quit after 5 minutes. And worst, when I toke up I am so antisocial I will not even respond to text from my friends. I have lost good friends this way. I have lost the ability to have casual conversations since all I did for the last 10 years is get home and smoke.

I do enjoy going out to drink. strangely. But at my age (and during the pandemic) there is not much of an opportunity to do so anymore.

When I was still smoking weed I'd usually spent my free time playing video games, watching movies and TV shows (the usual). I still do that, but I find myself getting bored of it fast. I'm pretty much forcing myself to do something, anything so that time doesn't drag on.

I do realize that I need new hobbies, but right now there's just nothing that interests me. Everything seems pointless. I used to love running, but my feed a fucked, so I am literally unable to do that. I was always interested in game development, but programming alone isn't enough to do that.

I think I'm slowly falling into depression. There are no suicidal thoughts, but everything feels so hopeless. I'm a bit of a nihilist anyways, which doesn't exactly help. Neither does the fact. that I frequently browse social media, which is all kinds of depressing nowadays.

   I‚Äôm 24 years old, 25 in November 2020. I‚Äôve been smoking everyday for 3 years now, at least 1-2 grams a day. 
   
   I think I got this nasty habit once I learned how to roll spliffs on my own. I couldn‚Äôt control my intake after that. I just wanted to be high around the clock. These 3 years went by in a flash, and I have barely anything to show for it. Anything good that has happened to me in those 3 years is probably because fell into my lap.

   A year into those 3 years of smoking, I realized what the everyday use of weed was doing to me. I was less focused on my passions (Art, School, Money, basketball, Fashion, Girls) and more interested in the least productive things (Video games, eating, napping, masturbation, Social media). 

   Ive noticed some terrible traits I was starting to pick up. I would hide from people when im high. I didnt really wanna socialize with anyone other than people that lived in my household. If anyone came to visit while I was high, i‚Äôd literally camp out in my room until they were gone. 

   If there was a night where I had no weed, id be calling/texting every last person in my contacts trying to get some. If no one would answer, id be up until dawn when my early-morning dealer wakes up so I can smoke something before I sleep. 

   My relationships with people got so weak. For a while I thought everyone was against me, but I noticed it was me being socially awkward, always flaking on plans, and never answering my phone when someone calls me. I felt/ still feel like total crap for doing this to my friends and past girlfriends.

   Speaking of girlfriends (THIS IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST REASON I WANT TO QUIT) I‚Äôm a tall, handsome, Slim, well-dressed guy from NYC. It was never hard for me to get a pretty girl. Since I began prioritizing smoking weed, I haven‚Äôt cared much about the way I look or dress. I dont even go out anymore because Id much rather be smoking a joint and playing call of duty. 
   
   When I do manage to pull a pretty girl, I dont keep her long because she realizes how much of a slack I am and I dont really do much more than just smoke weed and play video games. Its pretty depressing. This caused me to masturbate much more and I just sleep after I masturbate, which wastes alot of time in my day and I am just overall less productive.
  
   Its a total waste of money!!! I can remember multiple times spending my last on weed and i‚Äôd probably do it again if I keep smoking. I spend around $250-300 on weed a month. Thats close to $4000 a year. 

   Its just been pretty depressing lately thinking about all this stuff. Watching my friends take vacations and buy expensive clothes and rent fast cars. They‚Äôre living the life! Some still smokes weed because it just works well for some I guess üôÜüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Most of them that lives the life I want to live does NOT smoke weed. I haven‚Äôt taken a vacation since July 2018.. 

   Ok sorry to just cut my story so abruptly, but its getting pretty lengthy haha. I hope this will help someone. Im only 13 hours clean at the moment. I plan to go on for at least 2 birthdays. I wont even consider weed until i‚Äôm 27.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9986380934715271}"

You hear stories and arguments that it must be because of some traumatic event in your childhood or some other trigger. I'm not sure that was true for me exactly. Ever since I was young I had a fascination and obsession about drugs. I remember reading all I could find in encyclopedias about different drugs in the 80s. The first opportunity I had to get my hands on weed in grade 7 I took it. By age 14 I was growing my own in the woods behind my parents house. The rest is history and here I am, 40 and only now dissociating myself from that life. That initial fascination turned into obsession and ultimately addiction. Whatever the reason for that I do not know but I know now that I'm ready to leave that in the past. There is no point regretting those decisions, they are carved into the stone of my past (no pun intended). It was simply the way I lived my life for better or worse. It set the course of my life and made me who I am today, I'm pretty happy with that person actually. I've become a person who finally realises their faults and does things to try to improve. Perfection can never be reached and I won't even try for that but I know I can make things better. It's never too late.",16,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9004453420639038}"

2. I know weed causes munchies but I‚Äôve been overweight my whole life even before smoking. But I also started smoking at 15, and I think part of my bad eating before smoking was to cope with my stressful home life. So I haven‚Äôt technically experienced what my eating habits would be like now as an adult living on my own- and sober, since I‚Äôve smoked the whole time. Ive lived alone. I‚Äôve tried to lose weight since living on my own but could never stick to it.. but I was also smoking. But I just assumed I was a food addict with no self control and since have always loved food. Now I‚Äôm getting full really easily and don‚Äôt have any strong cravings. I still get hungry. But it‚Äôs not a ‚ÄúI need something really fattening and tasty right now!‚Äù hunger. Which describes the way I was about food even before smoking (but again living at home with stressful parents). Now after quitting weed I‚Äôm fine eating whatever, so I have been choosing healthy stuff and get full fast. 
I see people saying they have no appetite. I don‚Äôt know if this is what they meant. Because I still get hungry just fine. But I just don‚Äôt feel like a bottomless pit anymore. I got healthy groceries last night, which I usually do. My problem was moreso fast food. But before I‚Äôd eat all the healthy stuff pretty fast and now I haven‚Äôt even touched any of it yet. 
Anyways, I guess the point is now I‚Äôm thinking ... wow, was weed seriously the only reason I couldn‚Äôt control my eating before and not because I just don‚Äôt have self control?? Could this have been my natural way of eating all along?? I‚Äôm not just a fat slob??",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9484140872955322}"

Of course that would not be true or fair to another but my circumstances are a little different in terms of lifestyle, responsibility and access. 

I started smoking weed more than 15 years ago, I never thought it wold become such a problem and hinder my success in life.     I started of smoking natural weed as that was what was available in my region yet as time progressed weed got more potent and addictive and finally legalised.   To my knowledge, I don't know another addict like myself, I have barely worked  for a company for the last 12 years at the age of 33.  

This had given me the freedom to smoke when I please wit no regards for consequences. I smoke every 40 minutes, I will light a joint and jab it and smoke the same joint 4 times in 3 hours making for a constant high everyday from morning to night. I would through 4-5 joints a day. Each time I need more and more o make me feel better for longer.  

When it gets past a certain tine I am so drained and less of life I have to start drinking to feel better.  Since I have a business, money is rarely  issue, weed and alcohol are my priorities and everything comes after, my clothes look worn, my speech is not as sharp and the constant high has degraded my features.   Being in business you are required to sell and that does not go well with weed because you have to constantly make eye contact in order to gain trust. 

I was once a breath of fresh air, when I walked into a room people would turn and look as if I had a Halo over my head. My communication skills were precise and my facial expressions and reactions relevant. It was something about me that attracted people.  10 years  of constant weed use diminishes this and creates an opposite effect, the red eyes and yellow teeth  you don't smile that much and you avoid eye contact, avoid functions and outings because I would rather be alone high with my guitar and beers.     This has resulted in the creation of an anti social and hateful human being. 

  My business which was never successful is still not successful with many contributing factors other than my addictions is always struggling yet I produce and satisfy with the little clients I have.  Prior to me smoking in the morning I have no motivation, yet after i get high I get super powers for about 30 mins and even though I run around like a headless chicken some stuff still gets done.  Problem is when that high wears of then I slow down, and have to smoke again in order to be productive.

  My addictions are many like crack and porn, cocaine, alcohol and food but the weed is the worst and has altered my personality and the others dont bother me because I am take crack and cocaine a few times a year.  I drink often as possible but mostly in an an effort to make me feel better from all the weed I smoke during the day.  

I'm rather agreeable when high on weed and make rash decisions with money resulting me in being getting the short end of the stick, example I would put off buying or doing something and at the last moment which causes me to either choose wrongly or pay more than needed.  My motivation and zest for life have gone unless I'm drunk or high.  I have no limits, I will source the best possible weed and I will drink till my money is finished and until I am in a tight predicament  screaming inside my head, why me ! What did I do to deserve this.    This is unfair.  I deserve better. 

&#x200B;

I left school rather early and went to a technical college where I was introduced to weed and being a child of 15 learning  with adults  made it difficult to grow normally. I never fostered any school or college relationships or never had any true friends because I moved cities to live with my aunt, then came back home, then went back to my aunt to try and complete my studies.

 I never fitted in anywhere and my only solace and a place no one could take from me nor did I need anyone was when I was high.  It then became okay that I did'nt go to school, that I did'nt do the same things kids my age did.  My father had an affair for over 10 years wreaking havoc on my family and this really enraged me that my close knit loving family was being torn apart but when I was high that did not matter.  Being high made life bearable.

 When I was 10 I used to frequent gambling machines in game shops, I was not like other kids who used  used the machines for amusement only, I  would steal and lie in order to fund my gambling addiction at a tender age of  10.  I was only satisfied with maximum bets and would walk miles i order to find machines   so I could gamble.   A little is not good enough for me, I need to be constantly high, each one more intense than the last. 

I drink and cook and play guitar, then I eat and pass out and wake up and do the same thing again, when I drank too much in my younger years I would reach for crack but that faded and I reached for cocaine when drunk.  Sometimes I get drunk and drive around for prostitutes.   Ecstacy is also on my list of vices but as I get older my body cannot tolerate harder drugs and I have found a comfort in getting high on weed and drinking.  

I dont drink during the day but my inability to communicate effectively  on weed has hindered my life, business and chances of having a relationship.  I am now 72 hours clean and to be honest I am not sure how but it's manageable. Yes I have been reading this page prior to me deciding to quit and that has given me some solace knowing that there are people  with similar issues that have overcame. 

In 15 years or so I have decided to quit over 1000 times, many times successful for short periods but never in the last 5 years for more than  9 days.  

I know my solutions are a change of circumstance like getting a job but I fancy myself who with no education believes in creating jobs and training people .

 A relationship will also set me straight but it's difficult for me to find someone or the quality of the person I would attract in my current state will unlikely be someone who can make me better.

It was easier than I thought, especially since I've outed my drug use to everyone in my environment and my friends have stopped smoking when we hang out. My family is also supportive of me and surprisingly not judgemental at all. It does feel like I've woken out of a haze tbh, my memory is quite bad and I don't think the weed made it better. Sleeping and eating is also hard now, I really relied on weed for everything. But it's doing my bank account good so I'm sticking with it!

I also have Borderline Personality Disorder which means I can have quite the rapid mood changes and meltdowns. This is the only thing I don't miss coming back, I wish a cig would calm me down the same way weed always did. But it feels incredibly fulfilling if I can manage to stop a meltdown or rationalize through a mood swing now. That's progress baby!! 

I still get tempted bc there's a lot of coffeeshops in this city, but it keeps getting easier to withstand the cravings. My friend wanted to have my pretty grinder but I know I'd get super petty about it everytime I see it with them and I'm trying to avoid that kind of drama. 

I'm still sad about having to throw out all my shit but the guilt is slowly fading. Soon I won't feel anything for weed at all anymore and I don't wanna touch it ever again. Being sober is sooo sucky but fuck, it feels so good at the same time!

I became a little quiet here these days as I‚Äòm trying to help my friend during these hard times. I‚Äòm going to tell his story shorted here.

He‚Äòs been an alcoholic for about 10-15 years I can‚Äôt tell for sure. He lives in the city I was born in and we stay in contact by messengers and skype and when I‚Äòm back in town we always met. We were chatting and gaming all these times and I always tried to be a good friend by telling him to stop drinking but my advice didn‚Äôt work because he felt okay as it was. Of course it wasn‚Äôt ok already then but you cannot help somebody if this person doesn‚Äôt want to change. So in the years I‚Äòve met him a few times and already saw where he was going. A hard addicted alcoholic with a negative mindset. 

Things started getting worse when his landlord wanted to check his flat. I knew his flat was a mess but  I didn‚Äôt know how bad it really was.
His landlord came into his flat and his first words were ‚ÄûWhat a mess!!!‚Äú
At this point I think he started waking up a little. 
A few days later his landlord sent him a termination for the flat. My friend broke down and cleaned the flat as much as it was possible for him and started seeking help.
He got a therapy that lasted 4 months and I think he stayed sober there. Actually I‚Äòm not 100% sure, he may had one or two beers during this time.
He gave up his flat to get a new start and moved into a flat share project where it was forbidden to have a single drink. If you don‚Äôt follow this rule they kick you out.
And this actually happened two days ago.

So now he‚Äòs officially homeless. For now he can stay with his younger brother but he started drinking again. So it‚Äôs just a matter of time when he will fall back into his old habits of heavy drinking and doing nothing else.

At this point I feel helpless and all I want is him to be sober and happy again and that he will start a new life. I‚Äòm scared that he will come into my city, ring my bell and I have to tell him ‚Äûno I‚Äòm not gonna let you sleep here‚Äú.
Actually I think he had all the chances he could and he did not use them. 

I sent him an e-mail telling him how I feel and gave him some more advice. He told me yesterday he did not read it completely because he‚Äôs afraid what‚Äôs gonna be in there.

I don‚Äôt know what else I can do at this point, all I know is that he has to stop drinking alcohol to get into life again.

By the way this is my 24th day without weed and I don‚Äôt even want to be high. Not now, maybe some day in the future but definitely NOT now.

Irritability is my biggest downfall with quitting!! Shaking it off, though.. here we go!  :) 

Long story short, y‚Äôall are my people. I was a daily heavy user for nearly 20 years. I realized my brain had never been an adult brain without weed. That shit got to me. 

I‚Äôm on week 3, and although the list below was written 6 months before I finally quit, I re-read it last night, and was pretty happy with where I‚Äôm headed... (with the exception of a couple, I was just like, ‚Äúlol, that‚Äôs a personal problem, you can‚Äôt blame weed for everything!‚Äù)

Here‚Äôs the deal! We‚Äôre all TRYING. We‚Äôre all GROWING. We‚Äôre taking that self-inventory! Hell yes, let‚Äôs live our lives without the overthinking and fogged down thoughts. 

I can‚Äôt imagine the life I would have had, had I been a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person and quit after college like most people I know. Although I don‚Äôt have regrets for what I‚Äôve done (what‚Äôs the point?), I‚Äôm prepared to control my future!

I kinda realized recently that I had become super isolated, and on the fast track to life as a ‚Äúhermit‚Äù.

I want to find a soulmate. I want to be a mom. I want to have love in my life. I‚Äôm 33, and although I have already found dating sites are not for me (ewww! What is wrong with people?! Lol) I am so ready to try something different. I already see myself coming out of my shell little by little, and trusting that other people ... well just trusting other people! 

So here it is... like I said, I just woke up one day and was finally done; so this wasn‚Äôt a mantra or anything. But, going back and reading It was powerful. Figured I‚Äôd throw it out there. :) 

Peaceful thoughts and loving feelings to you all! üíñ

I mainly did it because I want to find a new job, and it took joining this sub to be able to start. All the posts were even inspiring me to go beyond getting the job and to quit for good. 

Last night, I felt a strong urge to give in. I was googling how long it would take to get it out of my system if I just smoked it once. I didn‚Äôt cave fortunately, but it wasn‚Äôt sheer willpower. I found another diversion ‚ùÑÔ∏è. 

It‚Äôs hard for me to separate myself from weed. I‚Äôve been smoking for over 10 years, through my entire 20s, and over time really embraced my identity as a pothead. I‚Äôve been proud that I‚Äôve been able to accomplish things and live a pretty successful life, that it hasn‚Äôt been a detriment, at least obviously. At first I was very quiet about it, but it was something I was learning to be unapologetic about, ‚Äúthis is who I am.‚Äù My therapist knows I‚Äôm a smoker, and he doesn‚Äôt object at all, kind of agreeing that it has helped me maintain my anxiety. I spend a lot of time alone, and weed helps me not feel lonely. And any time I feel an overwhelming emotion, I smoke, and it‚Äôs no longer a big deal. It‚Äôs been a kind of companion. All of my friends have accepted me as their pothead friend. They‚Äôre hard drinkers, and weed is my way out of being pressured to join in. If I was just plain sober, they would probably riot. I‚Äôm perceived as such a chill person because it always levels me out. How do I redefine myself when I didn‚Äôt really hate all those aspects of it? 

My issue has been that it sucks my time. I know that. I don‚Äôt have accountability when I‚Äôm home so I can end up doing hardly anything. And I want to believe I‚Äôll do it in moderation, but I don‚Äôt think my history proves that to be possible.

Sure I‚Äôve thought about it, but the thoughts have been nothing like they usually were when I was trying to quit. This time just feels more decided for some reason, not sure why. 

I will say a couple things that I think have lent to it being easier this time is 1. the last night I smoked, I did so with my dealer and told him I was quitting. So maybe I‚Äôm just too prideful to hit him up and look dumb for giving up. Of course he wouldn‚Äôt care, but I‚Äôd feel embarrassed about all the ranting and raving I did about quitting if I bought some again. And 2.

last Thursday I didn't smoke for the first time in approx. 5 years (with a 2 month break). And somehow I ended up here, which - without even thinking about it too much - gave me the urge to stop completely. And I just wanna thank you all for that. It's been your stories that motivated me.

So today's day 7 and I didn't experience strong cravings until now, which is really weird to me. I always used it to unwind in the evening. However, from my 2 months break (I moved and somehow stopped) I know they'll probably come sooner than expected and I'd like to go through this all with you guys together.

The biggest reason for me is my lack of memory, concentration, energy and motivation. Im going through a rather tough postgraduate education right now and I just need and want to be in my best shape to get the most out of it. Really struggle with the thought of how I wasted my studies, I don't seem to remember a lot from it.. I used to be a very motivated, eager person, resilient, good with words and, I think, also a clever and focused thinker. Right now, my minds all over the place and I just do the bare minimum to get through the day; I get stressed out over the smallest of tasks... I started doing it regularly when I was around 17, now im 23. And I just want to finally get into dancing as much as I'd like and be really good at my job, because I think I actually had (have??) the ability to do so..Also, I noticed that I started to always feel anxious when smoking. It didn't do anything good for me anymore. I just become paranoid and socially awkward. Always looking forward to getting home to smoke and be by myself, missing out on many things because of that..

Since stopping, I have a lot of troubles sleeping, I'm still feeling very low, especially unconcentrated (worse than before?) and unmotivated. Todays the first day I slept more than 5 hours though, and I think I noticed getting a bit clearer when talking to others and being able to understand :)

I'm eager to hear all of your stories, whether they'd be about small and big wins or small and big struggles. I planned on being a lurker at first (like Ive always been on any social media platform :P), but this just seems to be such a positive community which I wanna be part of, which I wanna support and get supported by :).

Looking forward to this journey with you.You'll find me here posting about all the changes I notice, but also trying to be helpful wherever I can for others leavers :)

I felt that was some of the happiest times of my life! I was for once, confident, and just walked with my head high. One day while being sober I lied to myself and said I can smoke a couple hits and that will be it. Well I tried, and it came back full force! Now I've been trying to quit for the last couple years and every time it's one more sack, one more hit, this will be the last one I swear. I can only go a few hours without taking a rip...
I feel sad and pathetic that I can't give it up, even knowing that one time being sober was the best feeling. I want that back but it's just hard.... I read your stories and it gives me hope that one day I could be free again.

2020-08-13 13:55:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/i94pot/day_33/,Day 33,"I abused heroin from 2009-2012, somehow made it out alive. It's bittersweet leaving weed behind, because it helped me so much whenever I had cravings. Honestly, if it wasn't for marijuana, I'm sure I would've relapsed. I literally smoked everyday from Jan '12 - June '20. In the beginning I was broke, smoking skinny $10 blunts. Once I got a job it grew to $20/day, then 1/8th/week, then a 1/4 every 2 weeks, which is where I would stay for years. I was getting it cheap and I always preferred smoking over drinking. There was no reason to stop, I was doing better, I had a stable job, the people at work liked me, I went back to school and got my Associate's.

A job opportunity came up recently that required a drug test. A job that I've been studying and going to school for. I always knew in the back of my mind the day would come where I would have to stop smoking to pass the DT. The past two years, weed just got boring, like heroin did. Sure I'd still get high because I was always getting different strains but it got to the point where the only thing it was doing was holding me back from my fullest potential. I was purposely staying at this low paying job because I got comfortable there, taking 1 or 2 classes a semester instead of 3 or 4 to get this degree in the slowest way possible so I could continue smoking. I love my friends but I was looking around one day and realized they were doing the same thing. They, like me, are functional smokers; we all have jobs but we've created this ceiling on our own progress and blockades for our own goals because, again, we all got comfortable at where we are. We weren't degrading but we weren't growing either. Some are still there, which is fine; they have higher salaries than I do, homes, some have kids and they're great parents but I myself was stuck. What would I do without it? What would I use to relax, sleep, socialize, etc.? 

A little over a month ago I got high as fuck and while I was smoking what I knew would be my last blunt I looked at it while it was smoking and said a personal thank you to it. Anyone who might've seen me would definitely think I was crazy or just high as fuck (which I was) but it made sense to me. I thanked this little herb for saving my life and allowing me to use it as a tool to get better, that I wasn't judging or condemning it by letting it go but that it was time for me to evolve as a person, I'm stuck in a hole I've dug for myself and it's time to climb out, I can't just keep smoking every day expecting different results or things to get ""better"". I put out the roach and haven't smoked in 33 days.

The only withdrawal I've noticed is the waking up in the middle of the night. Other than that, I can actually remember my dreams now, it's been years since I could do that. I'm exercising again, getting that dopamine rush after small 10 minute workouts in the morning that strangely make me feel just as good as when I was done smoking (I've always hated working out). My memory is slowly coming back and my speech is improving, I would stutter/mumble sometimes or I would forget where I was going with something in a conversation and not have the words to finish the sentence. The bags under my eyes are slowly disappearing. My clothes/fingers don't smell like an ashtray anymore. When I tell friends it's been 10 or 20 or 30 days since my last smoke, you can hear the pride in their voices and see the encouragement in their eyes, it's refreshing, I haven't seen or felt that since I kicked dope 8 years ago.

I hardly think about smoking anymore but when the desire comes up (and it does) I notice the thought, I don't ignore it, I take it for what it is (a desire) and I let it pass. I did this with heroin and now I'm doing it with weed and it's working. The Buddha said something like desire will never leave us but neither will the choice to not act on it or be a slave to it. We always have a choice. It feels like we're confined to our thoughts because it's our brain but we truly can learn to control these bastards and with time and self-discipline, it gets easier, and these desires get less and less powerful as the days go by; for every 24 hours I don't smoke, I feel that 1% more stronger and fortified than I did yesterday. 

What keeps me going is the need to better myself, I'm ready to grow up, maybe I'll smoke again one day but as for now I need to work on the next best version I have of myself, and that's starting this new job, making more money, and just becoming a more responsible person in general. In my teens and 20s I used the excuse that I was young, what's the problem? But when that 30th birthday hits, it hits hard, and you find yourself not too far from where you were 10 years ago, it was a huge wake up call for me. A motivational speaker said something that stuck with me recently: progress is not comfortable. Don't get comfortable. You really have to want it, you have to see where you want to be in the future and learn what you can and can't do to get there and go get that shit!

I need to hear some success stories,"I don‚Äôt know yet if complete abstinence from weed is necessarily what I want, but I do know that if moderation is at all possible, I need some time away from this substance. 

I quit drinking almost 3 months ago, but I‚Äôve continued to use weed as a crutch. I typically go to weed to cut off or shift my emotional state. Sometimes I consume it ‚Äújust for fun.‚Äù But even when it‚Äôs just for fun, I over-imbibe. I take myself to extremely clouded states of confusion and depersonalization. I can‚Äôt think or communicate clearly. I binge eat and then get terrible sleep. I hate it. And I hate that I do this to myself. I‚Äôd be lying if I said it didn‚Äôt feel good in the moment.

Was smoking or taking edibles daily for the last 6 years. I am/was completely addicted to the psychological effects of weed. I felt like nothing else could make me that happy or just turn my mind completely off. But the problem was that it tuned me out of reality. I was in my own world most of the time...completely oblivious to what was happening around me. I was using weed as a coping mechanism for things I didn't wanna deal with in my life; stressful days at work, family issues, and dealing with the world and all of the shitty things happening around us. Not saying it isn't a great way to unwind and destress, but if used irresponsibly, it definitely has some adverse effects especially if you have addictive tendencies. Not being able to retain information or even just complete a thought was killing me, but I just couldn't wait until the next time I could get high. I'd see friends (who weren't smokers) and just count the minutes on my watch until I could leave and smoke again. It definitely ruined a lot of friendships because I became the shitty friend who was flaky or just too stoned to get off of the couch. My quality of work started to suffer and my coworkers were getting frustrated because I would ask the same questions over and over because my short term memory was shit.  

My wife also became a daily smoker because of me and I think we developed some nasty co-dependency in our relationship because of it. We're both high-performing professionals and felt like we could just slot weed into our lives and be ""productive stoners"". We ended up just going through the motions of life and not really caring about the future or having hobbies, building strong friendships, and checking in on family. Work just became something to get through so we could get stoned and forget about it all. 

About 2 weeks ago, we found out that we're having our first child. At that point, I knew I was at a crossroads. Thinking about the life I wanted for my child caused so much cognitive dissonance with my habits. I thought about what kind of parent I wanted to be. Someone who is present and not just thinking that my kid was a distraction from what I truly loved: just getting blitzed and not caring about anyone else other than myself. With a baby on the way, I felt a new sense of purpose and really want to get back on track...to become my old self again before I was using weed as a coping mechanism. 

Decided to quit 8 days ago, and man has it been a rollercoaster. The Insomnia and irritability is real.

I wanted to write down a list of some accomplishments that I‚Äôve achieved in these last 7 months so I have a worded representation of what has happened since I‚Äôve quit smoking weed . 
Some of these things may not seem like much but with me it was damn near impossible to do anything productive when I was smoking to the extent that I was. 

I‚Äôve run 3 half marathons 

I did my first 100km bike ride 

I got a new job 

My relationship with my girlfriend has improved ten fold . 

I‚Äôve saved up a small fortune . 

My mother felt like I was trustworthy enough now to give me an inheritance sum that my late father left for me. 

I‚Äôve re-learned how to do a round off into a backflip 

I‚Äôve learned how to do an aerial flip . 

I‚Äôm in absolutely ridiculous shape as I attend the gym 4 times a week 

I joined a gymnastics club . 

I cycle to work and average 112k a week on my bike. 

I moved into a new household with some lovely people . 

I‚Äôve cut out two very toxic people from my life . 

I‚Äôve started cooking for myself . 

I brush my teeth twice a day . 

I got the nasal steroids prescription I needed from my GP to be able to breath through my nose . 

I cook for myself now . 

I‚Äôm building an outdoor SOFA for my garden 

I relearned how to do the splits again. 

I‚Äôve started reading again . 

I haven‚Äôt masturbated in 5 months . 

I‚Äôve even been willing on occasion to do overtime at work and was voted employee of the day a few weeks ago . 

I‚Äôve completely cut out sugary snacks and general bad eating from my diet and only treat myself on occasion now. 

I‚Äôve started meditating . 

I do the wim hof breathing technique 

I end my showers every time with a cold shower . 


I‚Äôm sure there are other things but I can‚Äôt think of anything else right now. 

One thing that I‚Äôve come to realise in the last few months that although smoking weed was a big problem for me in my life . It was more of a symptom of an even bigger problem in my life , which is a lack of purpose . 
I have no purpose in my life , I‚Äôm not a career person. And I struggle in my attempt to figure out what it is that I want to do with my life . Smoking weed just made it so that I just didn‚Äôt care . But without weed in my life I find myself dwelling on this lack of purpose in my life quite a lot . 

It‚Äôs not something that can be fixed overnight and it may take many attempts at trying things out until I figure out what it is I want to do .  But I know without weed in my life it‚Äôs just one less obstacle I have to overcome in my journey on attempting to figure out what my purpose in life is. 

Maybe I have no purpose , perhaps some of us are just not made to be anything great or amazing . Perhaps some of us are just doomed to living a life of mediocrity . If that‚Äôs the case then my purpose would be to have a simple life , and to find a true sense of happiness in my life . But would that be fulfilling enough for me ? I don‚Äôt know . 


I think I‚Äôve fallen into  this trap of attempting to achieve greatness. Of being someone amazing , that others strive to be like . 
Why attempt anything at all if you‚Äôre not going to be the best at it ? I‚Äôve definitely fallen prey to this way of thinking . Its made it so that I find it very difficult to begin anything at all because I see the mountain ahead of me that I need to climb. 

I dunno perhaps I need to speak to a life coach or something . Or get some therapy .

My name is Yash I am from India as you'll all ex - potheads might know that India is a land of really good weed but in my  university days I started and soon abusing the drug, the main reason for using it would be to gain social life and just in general an cure for my anxiety at that time I didn't even know what anxiety was and as I quit I l am having a clear picture now, the withdrawal was the worst for me as I quit in peak time of this pandemic in just 15 days or so I started having panic attacks and my anxiety sky rocketed after a month the panic attack are gone but the fear of them and anxiety is still there, the last 3 monts have been really tough in general I also experienced depersonalisation for few days worst feeling ever but the now that's also gone.

Anyways my other question was that what kind of music are you guys listening to become all my previous music was totally hip-hop gangster and drugs related and listening to that makes me depressed and gives me anxiety. 

Writing this was tough for me but seeing more people like me gives me more confidence.

Oh and another thing, I wrote two songs yesterday one taking inspiration from this subreddit. I like playing guitar and writing songs but while stoned they just weren‚Äôt that good. Yesterday I was very happy with myself. I think a lie I was telling myself was that I was more creative on weed. I thought so until yesterday when I finally picked up the guitar again since stopping.

About 3 years ago I began flying to Denver and Seattle to buy legal weed, then ship it home.  I didn't care about the danger...in my view, it was better to spend all the money to fly and buy than run out.

When medical weed became legal here in PA, I got my card...and things really got fucked up.  I would look at the menus of the weed bars (I still do this) several times a day. I was spending hundreds upon hundreds of dollars a week on different types of pot.  

When COVID hit, I lost my job. I spent March, April and May in my backyard smoking weed.  I was spending 3-5 hundred a week on vape, wax, weed.  I couldn't stop buying.  I smoked all of it.

I've known for years that I would need to stop, and a couple of weeks ago I decided to just do it.  I packed my weed away and I've been weed free for 10 days.  The first thing I've noted is I'm not spending a ton of money.

I don't know how someone who has spent 30 years smoking daily can stop.  So far, it hasn't been easy.  I'm irritable and all I want to do is sleep.  I've also developed a cough (not COVID) and I have lost my appetite...which at the end of the day isn't that horrible.

It's hard.  I'm getting up every morning to walk my dogs.  I do this 3 times a day.  I've been listening to audio books, reading about Marijuana withdrawal.  I'm just TRYING.

I used to be so smart.  I had an amazing memory.  What finally made me realize how screwed I was is when I took that cognitive test Donald Trump took a few weeks ago...and I couldn't remember the five things.  That made me feel like complete shit.

I've managed to have a very successful career up until COVID.  I own a home, I travel for work.  From the outside I appear to have it all, but inside, I feel like a numb husk.  

When smoking a 27%THC blunt wouldn't even give me a buzz?  You know you're smoked out.

I see a lot of people have months and years behind then...and I'm so jealous.  I've spent my entire adult life smoking weed and I have missed out on so much.

I'm usually a lurker on Reddit. Earlier today, my friend asked me why I once said weed ruined my life, and he recently started smoking, so I thought I'd post that here. It made me realize I think want to quit, and I need help.

Weed has taken so much from me. I got kicked out of my dream school for smoking, fucked up my relationship with my family, and lost their trust. It's taken my money, it's taken my time, it's taken my happiness, taken my memory, and taken my will. My will to make change in my life has been totally squashed. And I know I should quit, but every damn day I end up high. I think my life would be very different if I had never smoked, for better and for worse in some aspects, but the problem is I have an addictive personality. First, it was video games when I was a kid, and now I've been addicted to weed, my phone, alcohol, nicotine, a significant other, and that troubles me. I've always craved those dopamine rushes. And weed is a great dopamine rush, and it solves my problems. I know weed is a bad way to solve problems, but it works for a short time. And there are other bad consequences that come from doing that, like what I said at the beginning. 

But if you asked me if I would go back to the day I first smoked, and stopped myself, knowing everything I know now, I wouldn't do it. Because it made me a better person. I've also had some great times while smoking, and I don't want to lose that. But every great time makes real life a little more boring. Just that much worse. It makes life less worth fighting for, putting effort into, and improving. And the type of person I am, I've always wanted to make my life better, become smarter, and be a better person in all the ways I can. But weed is taking that drive from me. 

One day I'm going to wake up and stop wanting to improve myself, and that will be the day I resign to just smoke weed forever. The fact that I still haven't given up wanting to have a good future means I can still quit and have my will. But one day there won't be that good voice in my head that tells me not to smoke and to think about what I'm doing, and that day I'll lose everything

The worst part is, when I read all of this, I still don't want to quit. There's still addiction controlling my mind, making me want to smoke, or drink, or play video games for seven hours straight. I know I should stop, I just wish I wanted to. Because whenever someone asks me if I'm gonna quit smoking, I say no, because I love smoking weed. Smoking weed is awesome! But, eventually, it takes away more than it gives. And I think I will reach that point soon if I don't control myself.

So, r/leaves, how do I overcome this want to smoke? How do I make myself want to quit?

Sorry if this all sounds scattered, but I hope the idea gets across.

TLDR; I've been smoking for two years, I want to quit, and I know it's bad for me, but there's still that addiction drawing me back to smoke weed over and over again. So what do I do?",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9977747797966003}"

I (20F) have been a long-time lurker of this sub, and I‚Äôm thrilled to finally be in the position to write my own post. 

My first time ever smoking was 12 years old - (my older brother was a smoker and preferred to take me under his wing vs. doing it with friends.) 
Although I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan at the time, I began smoking more frequently beginning at the age of 14 - but still only using in social situations. 

My senior year of high school, however, I was finally old enough to go to a local smoke shop and cop my first pipe. From that moment forward, I have smoked every single day up until 6 days ago. I have generalized anxiety disorder, and once I realized it relieved my anxious tendencies, I was in love. 

It began first with normal bud, but quickly turned into a chase for a better high which led me to wax use in college - which was exactly what I felt I needed. You could use less of it to achieve a bigger high - something I thought would help me save money. 

I found out quickly however, that that wasn‚Äôt the case. I live in an illegal state, so getting your hands on premium wax will cost you an average of about $40 a g if you have a generous dealer. 
If that weren‚Äôt tough enough - since I switched from bud to ONLY wax, my tolerance skyrocketed - and I got to the point that even the wax itself wasn‚Äôt giving me that big of a high. 
But, sadly to admit, that still wasn‚Äôt enough to make me stop. I saw it as a fun outlet, a way to escape and bond with others, and it even became a sort of hobby for me, admittedly. 

Fast forward to a major breakthrough I had recently (because of this sub). Yes I may have been using wax to ease symptoms of anxiety - but the money going into it, the running around and setting up deals, the thought of being pulled over and searched nagging at my brain, were all things that were INCREASING my anxiety. I was putting myself through anxious situations just to get wax and relieve all of that anxiety. I began to recognize my usage as a crutch, and realized not only was I making my anxiety worse - but I was running away from it. 

I acknowledged the fact that I wanted to smoke for everything. Boring lecture to attend? Better take a few hits. Laundry? Some weed will make that more fun. Socializing? Only if you‚Äôre willing to smoke with me, because I WILL be smoking around you. 

I saw that even though I was still leading what I thought was a productive life, it was only adding a hindrance to myself and what I was able to do without being under the influence. I‚Äôm not sure if anybody will read this far - but if any of you are using weed for their anxiety as I was, it WILL help you - help you with never being able to cope with your anxiety on your own. Even if you DO live in a legal state where the anxiety around purchasing weed is eliminated- think about how sad it would be to have to rely on a substance the rest of your life. Especially for long-time smokers, I think we can all agree that we tend to lose ourselves in the weed. 

Fast forward even further to now - I‚Äôm on day 6 of no wax use. I‚Äôm overjoyed to not have experienced much discomfort other than extremely long and vivid dreams as well as the loss of appetite. (however,  if I have any other unexpected ‚Äúsurprises‚Äù coming my way, please give me a heads-up below!) 

Other than that, though, I can see my old self coming back. Sure I‚Äôm anxious -  but I see it as self care that I am proving to myself that I can handle my thoughts without the aid of any drugs - much less one that could end my entire college career and what I‚Äôm planning to do with my life. If my anxiety becomes too much, at least I gave sobriety a try and I‚Äôll know that (legal and supervised) prescription drugs are available for me.

Well anyway, I really wanted to smoke. Smoking has always been my way of pushing out or at least numbing myself to the emotions and problems of others (Mainly issues where there‚Äôs nothing I can really do to help, so the feeling of guilt and powerlessness is just so intense)

Instead of smoking, I let myself cry a little, and decided to go to the Y and run on the track.

It really helped me process the angst and the craving went away. 

So this is just to say... exercise or even sports is a great way to deal with raw emotions that would otherwise trigger you to medicate. Hopefully I can get to a point where I can just use my mind to transmute that negative energy but until then, at least I can physically process it through exercise. I have some boxing gloves and light even get one of those foam dummies to punch when I‚Äôm really feeling the feels.

I stayed sober for more than seven years, through my 21st birthday, until I was 26. I went to AA meetings, had a sponsor, sponsees, fellowship. Then I moved, started a new career, stopped going to meetings and thought, ""I wasn't an addict or alcoholic, I was simply a troubled teenager."" Well, I proved once again to myself that I can't handle any drugs or alcohol of any kind or any amount. And this simply will never change for me. I believe that.

I just celebrated four years sober from alcohol again. But at the start of Covid, in or around April, I walked into the freshly opened local dispensary, and bought legal weed in my home state for the first time ever. It's now August, and there HAS NOT been a single day that I haven't gotten high. Now it's turned into vaping more than a half gram everyday, with edibles.

Normal people do not do this.

This all coincided with me making the most money I've ever made. I shudder to think about how much money I've burned through in this short 3-4 months. I'm sick of the guilt and shame that burdens me everyday I get out of bed. How is it that I can throw away $400 a week on weed and not think twice about it, but I won't pay a couple extra dollars to get something nice for myself that I want or need?

I wanted to share my thoughts on why i see myself as a ‚Äùweed-junkie‚Äù. The term ‚Äùjunkie‚Äù isn‚Äôt typically used when it comes to the average pot smoker. 

However, addiction is all one and the same thing. You can be addicted to a lot of things. But in the end run, it‚Äôs all addiction, and addiction itself doesn‚Äôt have any preferences.

I am a bit ashamed of this but still wanted to share. It was quite a while ago when I once realized that I am addicted to weed and that I have a problem.

It usually turns out when I am broke, out of weed, and no friends who smoke that i can join and scavenge some puffs from.

It started with reusing ashes from an ash tray I knew I have used when smoking weed. Trying to get the tinyest bit of THC, scraping roaches, and I even spent countless of hours scanning the appartment floor with a flashlight, just in case I might find a small crumb of pot that can be smoked. Almost never found anything in the end run because I already searched many times before.

Even when I have been out of cigarettes, and no money to buy new cigarettes, I would go out on the street, looking for reasonable half-smoked cigarettes so I can use the tobacco for rolling a joint back at home.

Like seriously WTF?? It scares me a lot to think about that because it isn‚Äôt normal, it‚Äôs disgusting and to me it is really a clear sign of marijuana-addiction gone too far.

I am currently going through day 1 of not smoking weed. I have already been looking for left-overs i know don‚Äôt exist anywhere at home, and I kinda gave up by writing a post instead.

But, I haven‚Äôt been sober in at least a year and I think it‚Äôs affecting my mental health. I was seeing a therapist and he didn‚Äôt really help, and even said weed wasn‚Äôt a big deal.

Not my proudest moments- wasted a lot of opportunities.

After several relapses- I‚Äôm finally done. Fuck it feels good. I cut off weed dealers and every, single, person who smoked weed . That was key. It was a lonely path but I did it. They say it takes around 60 days to form a new habit. Hah damn I feel proud of myself. Nothing can stop me now.

And best of all- I‚Äôve gotten much closer to my parents and made amends with my past. It feels great.

I am currently 32 years old and started smoking when I was around 16 or 17. It quickly became a habit that, before I realized it, turned into a full blown dependency. I dated a grower and a dealer for almost 7 years which obviously didn't help matters. I always knew it was out of control, but I was so far gone I had no idea where to even begin. I tried to quit multiple times, literally not being able to make it through a single day without caving and somehow always finding some, no matter how stressful the hunt. I spent basically an entire decade high all the time. Morning until night most days. I took three breaks in those 10 years when I traveled out of the country, the longest being 4 months. That's it. 

I managed to graduate from college, get a teaching credential...""function"" as they say.  But I knew what weed did to me. It made me entirely comfortable doing the absolute bare minimum in life. Completely kept me from evolving emotionally, intellectually, socially, etc. etc. etc. 

LORD KNOWS WHERE I'D BE BECAUSE SURPRISE, about 5 years ago I found out I  was pregnant. And just like that I stopped. I stopped for nearly 4 years. All throughout my pregnancy, 2 and half years of breastfeeding, and then some. I'd love to say it was great and I had all this newfound clarity and yadda yadda yadda, but honestly I was dealing with postpartum depression and mostly just trying to survive. It did feel good to be free of it though, and mostly I didn't miss it or even think about it much. 

Then I went back to work. California legalized recreational weed. My best friend started smoking again after she had quit for some time. I discovered that vaping had evolved from the effing Volcano to this new, super easy, super convenient, super INCONSPICUOUS way to smoke anytime, anywhere and....you can probably guess how things progressed from there. 

And here I am now, two years after starting up again and it has me completely and totally in its grasp. Quarantine has not helped at all, and I'm just over it. It's awesome coming on here and seeing so many of you who I just relate to on so many many levels. 

I'm happy to say something clicked this week. I realized I cannot and will not do this anymore. It is eating up my brain, my productivity, my emotional stability. Funny enough although I've been smoking more than ever during all the Covid craziness, I've also been on this crazy journey of self love like never before. It sound so cheesy, I know, but it is so real! I don't think I could do this without realizing my worth and believing that I deserve to be free from this.

I‚Äôm essentially fearing lung damage and with a newborn on the way I want to be as healthy as can be. There are a few tough parts about this decision:

- I‚Äôm very fit and can run for a long time without getting tired(I usually jog casuAlly 5 miles in under 36 minutes), play soccer 5x a week lift weights 3x. In my best physical shape ever and play semi professional soccer while also working full time at a great tech company in California... I‚Äôm happy and haven‚Äôt run into health issues despite my smoking mainly for chronic insomnia & anxiety. So the thought is if I feel great and I‚Äôm happy and fit now why quit when there is no issue? I‚Äôm essentially fearing future issues but over 8 years have had none... any thoughts?

- is this doable without rehab?

- has anyone NEVER I mean NEVER skipped a day in at least 8 years and quit on their own successfully? Tips?

I feel like I have amazing skin compared to what it used to be.. granted it‚Äôs not as good as someone who never smokes and I even know some stoners who have amazing skin regardless.. but I guess I may have somewhat of a sensitivity to weed, idk. 

Just wanted to share cause I‚Äôve had skin problems my entire smoking life. I never thought it was one of the main culprits. 
I had an inkling the last couple years when I had to stop for drug tests, etc and would notice it getting a bit ‚Äútamer‚Äù so to speak. 

I know that may seem like a vanity thing to some. But it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs affected my confidence for a long time and even kept me from feeling comfortable/desirable in relationships. 

That‚Äôs just one of the benefits I‚Äôve noticed so far. Other benefits are less anxiety/overthinking and more of an ability to control/choose my thoughts. 

I‚Äôm adjusting to going from not working at all to working two jobs (roughly full time combined) so I am still pretty tired most of the time but I feel my body adjusting.

Also, as a woman, I‚Äôve noticed less hormonal issues. A naturopathic doctor in one of her videos said that THC increases testosterone/androgens in women especially when smoked.. I guess that could explain the skin thing too!

Anyway, I feel pretty great. I‚Äôve been eating good tasty foods (even gained some healthy weight) whenever I feel a craving start come on (they are rare now, however :) ) and I feel like I‚Äôve fallen in love with food again!

Life is great compared to two weeks ago. I feel hopeful, capable and confident about my future.

This will be my last post here for awhile.

Here's my quick recap. Used weed for about 3 months. I had a large dose on my birthday, and quit cold turkey. 3 days later I had a panic attack were I felt really sick and ill. Following that I had an avalanche of symptoms over many months. Here's what I've endured. Panic attacks, dizzyness, headaches, headpressure, tinnitus, mild auditory hallucinations, mild smell hallucinations, nausea, Brain fog, anhedonia, brain zaps, parathesia, moderate to extreme dissociation, random electrical feelings, burning feelings, and general relentless anxiety. There's probably more I am forgetting.

Also my general health history. I am a 37 year old male. I was in peak health before all this having run marathons, having a yoga cert, and also lifting heavy things.

I have not had any booze or caffieine fo about 10 months. I eat a strong paleo diet with about 100-150g of carbs a day.

Also I have taken no drugs or anti anxiety meds this whole time. I believe my body and brain needs to sort this out on it's own.

So I have no idea to this day how weed induced all these problems. Lots of theories, but none that will ever be confirmed. My suspicion is a high weed dose is to blame. But let's get on with the story.

Probably in month 1-4 I felt like a 2 or 3 out of 10. Seriously, I had some real dark thoughts about everything that was happening.

Now in almost month 12- I feel like I float between a 7 or 8 out of 10.

Mostly what I have left is head pressure, and anxiety. I also still have nerve tingles around my body. They seem to continue to improve.

Don't worry, I see my Doctor every 3 months, I see him this week too. He says if things are improving, just keep being healthy. Brain problems can take 2 years or more to resolve. I'll be asking him the many important questions, to hopefully keep my health on track.

Anyways, I'm optimistic, however I'm taking to heart the idea that anxiety in general from all of the symptoms is a barrier to getting better, and perhaps even causing some of them, so I'm going to take that seriously. I will be departing the forum for awhile. Likely 3-6 months. I need to move on with life. And writing about my problems doesn't help my own anxiety. 

I want to say thanks to everyone who has helped me get this far. PAWS (or whatever the hell is wrong with me), truly has been the hardest thing I've ever gone through, but there are many bright sides. I now meditate and give gratitude daily. I'm more humble, and more compassionate. Also while I still exercise, I don't push it to the max, and have focused on other avenues, like redoing my home.

If anyone here has a PAWS anxiety concern, I'm here for a day or so, and then I'll be gone.

If you are having.a hellish time withdrawing from weed, please know it will indeed get better. Just give it lots of time and be gentle with yourself.

I would not wish the year I had on my worst enemy. I still to this day feel resentful no one warned me of this. But maybe I'm just unlucky. Still, I'll be optimistic. If I can go from a 3 out of 10 to an 8 out of 10 in one year, hopefully I can hit that magical 10/10 in one more year.

It's better to be weed free.

Lots of love for you all.",14,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9975645542144775}"

5.	‚Å†Really change the rest of our lives.
6.	‚Å†Terapy for many of us, etc etc.

This unfortunatly doesn‚Äôt happen over night, but from continued work, development and patiency.

Weed-abuse changes brain chemistry and mess up our normal balance and production of all the feelgood/feelnormal chemicals, anxiety/depression-symptoms etc. Weed simply mess up our brains, and it really takes time before, chemicals like dopamin and serotonin production starts up again.. this might be where our biggest issues is comming from!?

For me personally, i thought i would have been fully recovered after a month sober,, lol, maybe peop‚Äôs that only smoked a couple of years away, Can relay on that thought.. it‚Äôs very diff from peop to peop.

I originally started smoking 8 years ago to help me sleep - it works great, if I am stuck in an anxious thought loop, it gives me a magical exit door and I am no longer stuck thinking about the same series of anxious thoughts

I have tried to quit many times and what ALWAYS gets me smoking again is I have a few nights where I really need to get a good sleep for work- and then I relapse

&#x200B;

I now reaaaaalllly would like to quit as I am so tired of being dependent on it just to sleep, so much so that whenever I go to a new city I must buy some weed just to be able to sleep- no fun being hostage to my own habit like this :(  


&#x200B;

What other routines or natural sleep aids do people recommend? Any tips would be infinitely appreciated

I have been dabbing every single day (except 2 weeks when I got my wisdom teeth taken out a few years back) for the past 6 years. It started to be a problem when I was a junior in high school and now I recently graduated college. I am a functioning stoner for the most part, however I need to smoke to enjoy doing pretty much anything. I smoke right when I get home from work, before I cook, before I eat, before I clean, before I go to bed, before I go on a bike ride, before I have sex. Before everything. The main problem I have is with my appetite. Before I started smoking, I was underweight and I never had a big appetite and would never finish everything on my plate. The main thing I noticed when I first started smoking in HS was that I could now eat and enjoy a meal and finish my food. Before weed, I would basically have to force food down. I still have this problem as I have a hard time eating my lunch at work (I don‚Äôt smoke before or during work). I also have a problem with my long term relationship due to the amount of weed we smoke. My boyfriend actually just quit smoking a few weeks ago so he can get a new job, and him quitting is making me realize how much I need to as well. Unfortunately, It has also made me realize that smoking weed was the biggest thing we had in common with each other. I want to see how our relationship will be with us both sober as we have been discussing marriage recently. Him getting sober has made me realize he is a different person than I thought he was and his anger issues have been 1000x worse. I‚Äôm not sure if this is because he is still getting used to not smoking. ( He smoked for 12 years, more than half his life) 

Basically I just need some advice and it‚Äôs nice to find this community. Advice on how to keep my appetite without getting high, relationship advice when both partners are quitting, etc.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9853442311286926}"

So a little backstory. I didn't start smoking until my late 20's. Even then it was just one weekend here and there . Gradually though as I got into my 30's and life started really happening it bacame more and more. It was as an easy way to just escape everything. The last 2 - 3 years I've smoked pretty much every day around 1g a day.  

Last week I was batteling another issue and my body and mind just felt tired of weed. I was stoned and feeling horrible so I just said fuck it and decided to quit. I had my last toke 7 days ago. I just wanted to share my experience especially with the witdrawls in case it helps someone else knowing that I'm going through the same thing. 

First day no major issues. Day 2 the cravings began, Thankfully I've only had a handfull of moments where it was bad and only one dream where I smoked. For me the craving bit has been super manageble.  Day 2 I aslo saw  the big jumps in anxiety. I've been lucky that I don't suffer from anxiety or depression. I've just always been a naturally happy person. Well day 2 that changed. Suddenly I was super anxious, edgy, and hated everything. 

I also just didn't want to eat. It wasn't that food tasted bad its just when I ate I would only eat a super small portions and a lot of times I was just nausuas. Also, days 2-4 I was also super fatigued throughout the day. Even though I was forcing myself to eat fruits and veggies etc... the energy just wasn't there.

Day 2-3 the sweating began. Dear god the sweating! The first few days it felt more like a cold sweat. I would be sitting out in the middle of a hot day in the sun and wouldn't feel hot. Around day 4 or 5 it turned into more hot sweats or a heat flash. It's still going on day 7. It hits at random times during the day and sweat just comes pouring out of me. For fun I've been taking my temprature during this period and you can see my body just can't get it's thermostat right. It also doesn't help it's in the middle of a heatwave right now.

Day 4 the couging and throat stuff started. I'm still coughing up dark yellow flgm. I also weirdly lost my voice day 4 and 5 and had a mild sore throat. Yesterday and today it's been better but now I have a light dry cough that's a bit annoying. 

Day 5 seemed to be a bit of a breakthrough for me. A lot of the edgyness wore off and some of the ‚Äúsober‚Äù euphoria would kick in. 

So on to today, about once per day  now I get the holy trinity of sorts. Anxious, sweating my ass off, fatigued and nasuas (holy quanity?) This seems to hit in the afternoon. Mornings and afternoons have by far been the worse for me. Which is a litte strange because I only would wake and bake on weekends or holidays. I mainly kept my smoking routine to late afternoon evening. 

So what am I still struggling with? Anxiousness, but at least it‚Äôs feeling a bit more managable as I tend to get smaller and smaller bad bouts. Mood swings, fatigue and sweating are the big ones. 

One thing that's been happening with me is this cycle of feeling great, feeling like shit, and then feeling good again. One bit I've noticed is when I'm feeling like shit I don't eat anything. My girlfriend suggessted I just have a popcicle when this happens. For some reason this helps, maybe it's the sugar or whatever but it def helps break me out of it a bit. The good thing is since day 4 these cycles tend to be less and more spread out through the day. Yesterday I had a bad bout for about an hour. Vs. all day (day 2-3). 

Walks also help. Time goes by so slowly when you feel sick so for me taking a walk forced time to go faster. I get all these crazy racing thoughts that I'm actually sick  with something else...but give myself an hour and I know it'll pass. As others have said in weid ways the withdrawls kind of mirror being high. When I was too high I always just passed the time cause I knew it would eventually die down. Same thing here. Find something to pass the time. 

My dreams have been vivid like others but I haven't had terrible night sweats thankfully. My sweating seems to mainly be during the day. Especially getting into early evening. It's like some switch just gets turned on. Feet, chest, head, and hands just turn super clamy and sweaty. 

One more side note, when I was going through withdrawls everyone says to eat super healthy which is a good tip for helping your body eliminate the toxins. However I went from having carbs like breads and pastas to just frutis and veggies. In hindsight this probably made the first few days worse as my body also started going through some withdrawls from that. Don't make things harder on yourself than they need to be. Let your body adjust to losing one thing at a time. I've now been keeping some ""bad"" snacks around too, like potato chips to snack on when I start to feel low. 

I feel super confident I won't relapse in the immediate future. So here's to another 100 days! Hopefully, if you're like me and you're at your worse and you think this has to be more than withdrawls you know you're not alone and it slowly gets better after those first few days. Speaking o I've been lucky I can discuss this with my work colleagues and friends. Find someone you can talk to about this. Doing it alone just sucks too much.

And the next day I bought another pre-roll. And the next... and finally the weed store was closed on sunday early, so I called up my buddy and smoked with him.

Well today I am back on the wagon. I see what a waste of time it is, and how it snowballs. I just haven't dealt with my underlying mental health issues in all the years.

The end of this august will mark three years since the beginning of the semester I completely blew it. I‚Äôm a college student starting my 6th year of undergrad, set to graduate in December. From my arrival into college I quickly became a very frequent stoner, by the end of my first semester I was every day, by the end of my second year I was dabbing multiple times a day, hitting the pen before class, sleeping through classes and and so, on. The usual. I was always a pretty bright kid, majored in Engineering, good test scores, never really needed to try *that* hard to get decent enough grades 
Three years ago this fall was when my shit hit the fan. When grades came out that December I was floored. Not surprised, but ruined. Straight F‚Äôs. I mean complete failure across the board. It was then that I knew I needed a change. 
By that point I had already been experiencing the same things you always read in this sub: smoking alone, sad, no plans, high at work, every time I smoked alone at night I‚Äôd just sit there and think about how I really didn‚Äôt need to take that dab, tell myself how badly I needed to quit. So I did. After that report card came out I decided I was done. I put it all away, repurposed the stoner pack I had (I called it the Trap Bag), gave the bong to a room mate and started my journey of leaving trees behind me. 

Since then: I‚Äôve fallen back a couple times, taken a few trips here and there and partied with friends, but in the many (maybe 2 dozen) times I‚Äôve gotten high in the past three years, I can say I only ever really enjoyed about 3. In general they‚Äôve just been heavy, anxious, sad, quiet, or otherwise not good. 

Since then: I got my grades together, changed my major (still stayed engineering, just a different kind), I left my struggling relationship, got two solid internships in my field (both with potential for full-time employment), traveled, fell in love with my best friend and favorite study partner and am set to graduate alongside her this December. I don‚Äôt think I would be anywhere near where I am today if it wasn‚Äôt for the failure I had in 2017 and the courage it gave me to get my shit together. 

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs been perfect. I still struggle with depression, I still struggle with myself, and I still struggle with the fact that I had to cut a fair few of my friends out because weed was the only thing we had in common in the first place. I just wanted to share this because I‚Äôm proud of myself. And I‚Äôm proud of the people in this sub who are just starting out, and I‚Äôm thankful for the people in this sub who were posting on here three years ago. 

I didn‚Äôt know what my path would be when I first quit, but I do now. You may not know what your path will look like for you, but know that you‚Äôll find it by putting one foot in front of the other. Take the opportunities as they come to you. Be confident in your ability to support yourself. Be kind to yourself when you can‚Äôt. Reach out to the people you love, even if you feel weird about it because it‚Äôs been a while. You can do it.

I've found writing down whatever junk is on my mind really helps clear it up and stops me from dwelling as much as I used to.

I haven't been using any particular lucid dreaming techniques other than journaling. In my past couple of dreams I would notice things which were incongruent with reality and usually this wakes me up. Last night when this happened I was able to stay asleep, realize I was dreaming and manipulate my dream.

I've been interested in, and half-heartedly attempting to, lucid dream for a number of years but smoking usually made that a non-starter. Occasionally I would recall dreams when I didn't smoke more than 1-2 bowls in a day but nothing close to lucid dreaming. So this is an exciting development for me!

Anyways, I just wanted to share that benefit from quitting. Hope everyone is doing okay on their journeys. Hang in there! You're worth it!",23,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.8320243954658508}"

With a small 2 week break years ago (not by choice) and that's it. I have wanted to quit on multiple occasions but my willpower was just shot and I always had an excuse or a 'reason' as to why I couldn't quit just yet. On multiple occasions I would get rid of the weed, bong and scales but I'd be getting back on the following day and ordering a new pipe. I was smoking an oz to myself sometimes over a week other times over 2 weeks. Amongst this I suffer from PCOS (Poly cycstic ovarian syndrome) and used smoking as an excuse to keep weight off. One of many of the side effects to PCOS. This also causes me major fertility issues but is not completely ruled out that I can't have kids. My husband & I recently got married and we now have everything you could dream of in life except for a family of our own. For the first time in 10 years I have successfully quit cold turkey with the intentions on begining our journey into parenthood. The thing that makes me the most proudest is the fact I still have a 3fa in the cupboard and my bong. I feel like I have succeeded because this is my own choice and on my own terms & I genuinely really want to do it this time. 2 weeks today & each day the withdrawals are getting easier & easier. The hardest time for me is when I get home from work and bordom kicks in. I think about smoking to wind down but tell myself if I do I will be straight back in square one and have to start all over again. So I do what I can to distract myself until the next temptation comes around. But I genuinely feel like I've got it in the bag this time. I've never been proud of myself for anything but boy am I dam PROUD!!! I've done it and there's no turning back. Here's to a healthy future & hopefully in time a family we can call our own. 

Not sure what the point of this post is. I have never been one to put it on show that I am a smoker and most people didn't even know so I guess I'm just looking for somewhere to vent how bloody proud I am!! If I can quit , anyone can!!

The highest I was able to make since then is 28 days abstinent. I want to beat that record, and have a drug-free life.

Today is day 6 and the fog is already getting much better. I'm doing 200-300 jumping jacks a day, lots of walking, shadow kick boxing for an hour to metal, lots of reading, drumming, and keeping myself engaged and busy.

I could say that this summer has been a waste, so much time spent in a haze, zoning out, overeating, being by myself. But after all the consequences, it taught me something. A clear mind, energy, and sobriety are the best thing. My dad has always told me that life is to be enjoyed, and that is what I'm doing.

Trying to solve the root causes instead of mask them in a fog. I was using 1.5 grams every morning of strong weed all at once, and spending the rest of the day in a fog. Now I want something better.

For me it was sobriety------->boredom. But now it's more like sobriety----->boredom----->motivation to action.

The idea is the motivate myself by giving myself a reward (not using) at 30 days. Maybe doing something I've never done before. Shoutout to everyone in the same boat. Covid-19 and legalization really did a number on my sobriety, but I am happy with my progress. 

I choose to accept myself as flawed and human and make changes based on my past behavior. I'm lucky that I don't hang out with anyone who smokes, and haven't for 2.5 years. I can quit for myself with no pressure, only support. I've never been more motivated to change. Thanks for reading.",5,"{'mask': 1, 'covid': 1}","{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9839609861373901}"

I am happy that I have taken the time to quit but it is seriously one of the hardest things I've had to do and I do not like expressing myself to people around me because all they have to say is ""why would you ever quit weed""   
I had the chance to read a book called ""the complete guide to quitting weed"" which at first I thought would be really silly but I am so so happy I stuck with it because it was AMAZING. Anyways, its my fourth day of not smoking and I am a bit sad because I never expected my breathing to get worse or for my brain to be all over the place. I am happy that my appetite has been decent but all of my other withdrawal symptoms are really bringing me down. I woke up this morning an had a meltdown for about two hours which I think is because I am embarrassed and feeling things that I don't even know how to explain. My sleep has been a lot better than I thought but that's also because I went to a health store and bought a herbal drink that is for sleep and it has been wonderful.

My concentration is bunk, I used to play chess a ton to pass the time in this covid era, I could sit down and bust out ten games easy and be laser focused for all of them. Now I can't fully engage on one...

I moved to NOLA from Washington, this was why I quit, cause its not as available here and I believed that would help my temptation. Cut to me googling how to get weed in New Orleans yesterday. I found a dealers number and proceeded, but after I paid via paypal they demanded a massive delivery fee and I became incredibly sketched out.

 I had a bit of a shit year in 2019, I was abusing substances left, right, and center. Every day, after work or school, i would get high or drunk. Alcohol was the first to kick it, with my body rejecting it outright after having too much. That was easier to kick; I didnt like how long it took or how I felt on it. Weed was trickier. It wasnt until week four of a six week binge that I found brown specks in my phlegm. I became a mucus factory every time I took a hit. My body is allergic to aspergillus, a type of fungus that grows on rotting plants and soil. My body wanted me to stop, it took me two weeks before I finally caved. 
I am now almost two weeks sober. The first few days of withdrawals went as smoothly as could be expected, i busied myself with things to avoid craving leading to caving. 
The last time i bought any was when i let my emotions control me, I was just looking for an excuse to buy and lose a week to a mindless buzz. I had bought and had driven home but I called a counselling hotline, just to talk about my problem at the time, my excuse for buying in the first place. After the hour long conversation, I felt better. Better than what I would've felt high. I lit up feeling guilty. I knew it was going to be the last time in (hopefully) a long time. 
So i smoked the rest with vigor, I cleaned my bong and put it away. I have thought about it, wanting to curl up in the bathroom, watch dumb shit on YouTube, and zone out with whatever abstract idea I had brewing in my half baked head. The thing that stopped me was thinking my way out of it, not to use it as a coping mechanism or as an excuse for whatever upset me. Ive begun reading a lot more and spending time with friends. I can remember things clearly now, I dont gorge myself on whatever double serving of carbs i feel, and im smoking less cigarettes (trying to quit by weening myself off). 
I'm feeling better. Yes, i still think about it but no, i will not be going back. I owe my body a debt of gratitude for making the change for me, even when my heels are dug in.

2020-08-09 00:27:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/i6dcpb/day_77/,Day #77,"Hey guys,  


Here in Melbourne where we are in Stage 4 lock-down which includes an 8pm - 5am curfew and a shutdown of non-essential services such as retail, etc. I'm at work, which is a bar that has transitioned into selling takeaway liquor, classed as an essential service (imagine the rioting that would ensue if it weren't), but given that there is almost zero foot traffic I am afforded the time to write this post.

I don't have anything in particular that I want to write about, I just thought I'd check in. In attending daily narcotics anonymous meetings (on zoom) for around two months now I've learned the value of just sharing where you're at and not indulging the sense of feeling that you need to dress up what you want to say or impart some great and profound nugget of wisdom. Just being as open and honest as you can about where you are on a day to day basis is what in large measure has paved the way for me to finding genuine connection with other people, and also connection with myself.

I've been pretty up and down emotionally in my recovery so far, which I think is completely natural and inevitable after prolonged daily use (abuse) of cannabis and other substances. I've been lurking on this sub for over two years now, but have never fully committed to recovery and all that that entails, and I can see now that any attempt to be free of active addiction to weed was a fool's errand without doing so. I had this fantasy in my mind for a long time that I was going to get clean entirely on my own, without needing to admit to anyone the reality of my addiction. I now realise that this was simply an impossibility. I stood absolutely no shot at getting clean without being open and honest with people in my orbit, and the level of accountability that results from doing so.  


My life is so much better when I'm not owned by weed, despite the challenges of early recovery. Everyone's experience is unique and there is surely a wide spectrum as far as how challenging or easy each person finds getting/staying clean. I can't be sure where my level of difficulty ranks but I do know that it's both extremely testing in moments but also worth it. The gifts of being clean are immense, and I'm confident that if I stick the path that there are many more to come. The biggest gift thus far is that I'm so much more present in my moment to moment experience of life, and in my interactions with other people. So much more of me is available in my relationships, and I already feel so much closer to the people most important in my life. This alone has made getting clean worth it.

&#x200B;

I would encourage anyone and everyone that is trying to get clean and struggling to get a support network around them. NA has done that for me, though I understand that it isn't for everyone and acknowledge that there are so many more avenues through which to get a sense of community and accountability. As I stated in a previous post, /leaves has been a great resource to myself and countless others, but in saying that there is a level of accountability and connection that doing NA meetings gives me that this sub never could. Communicating with people in real time, even if it is just digital, text based conversation such as the /leaves discord chat is a very valuable thing.  


Hang in there guys, be kind to yourself and get as much support as you can. Weed is an incredibly insidious drug and has impacted my life in a myriad of immensely negative ways, many of which I can only even recognise now in  the clarity of sobriety. I don't know what the future holds and I don't need to. My inability to stay clean in the past doesn't have any bearing on what I do today and I'm incredibly grateful to be clean.

My self worth has been trampled on for years, mostly my self doing. I could never shake the ‚Äúloser stoner‚Äù label I attached to myself.

Health related- (especially with COVID knocking at the door)
In fact, I had to illegally purchase breathing inhalers to get by. I‚Äôm in my mid-fifties and don‚Äôt believe I can (or want to) maintain this addiction into my 60s, 70s and 80s. 

My work-
I‚Äôm self employed and have been losing productivity. I am forced to spend more time in my office when I‚Äôm stoned. It‚Äôs frustrating to spend 10 hrs ‚Äúworking‚Äù and only get 3 hrs of actual work completed. 

Mobility-
Once I‚Äôm stoned for the day, which typically begins at 5:30 am, I‚Äôm a bit house bound. I always need to know what the schedule is for the next day so I can figure  out when and how much I can smoke. I love to visit with my friends, but most of them are not MJ smokers. So afternoon or evening get togethers we‚Äôre fun but really difficult to navigate and control my smoking during the day before the event. So sad. 

Monetary-
My travel business has taken a major hit from COVID related shut-downs and restrictions. I‚Äôll be fine, but I do need clarity of mind at this time to fully engage in other ways to build my business back up. 

Challenge-
I love a good project. There is nothing more important than ones self. I‚Äôm up to this challenge!

Sometimes it can bring you a great burst of creativity... other times you're locked in your room, shaking under your sheets. I started smoking socially, and at first, what a world!! Weed made everything... *better*. It was something to do with my friends when we went hiking, or to the beach, or to watch a movie. Weed was a welcome accompaniment to any and all activities, hell, sometimes that *was* the only activity- we would just sit around, smoke, and shoot the shit. It was a great conversation starter, as just about everyone smokes nowadays. Smoking weed was a way to escape from my thoughts and enjoy everything around me.

But at some point over the last 2 years, that changed. My first semester of college is where things took a nose-dive. I was 18, a fresh lil baby who had never been away from home for more than a month, and I fell into the wrong crowd almost immediately. At first, we would take all sorts of precautions, like using a Smoke Buddy, blowing out the window, etc, until we were smoking big ass blunts in the bathroom without covering the vents. All we would do was toke, and I would go to class reeking to high heaven, not retaining a single thing. Eventually it got to the point that we all stopped going to class because it interfered with us getting high. The apartment that we all lived at (some rent-free) became sticky, like the ground was covered in tar. Leaving wasn't exactly terrifying, but it was *really* unpleasant. Anytime I did leave, all I could think about was getting back as soon as possible to smoke with my ""friends"". I didn't want to, no, I couldn't leave, because what if I missed out on something? What if T did something hilarious or a great conversation happened and I wasn't there to add my brainless contribution? Even worse, what if they were talking shit about me? And where was I, at the dining halls or in class? Nothing was more important than being there, every minute, everyday- not personal time to recenter myself, not class, certainly not food. I may be one of the few folks who got the reverse Freshman 15.

After... further *bad* experiences winter break that I won't go into, I finally went home and realized that I was too immature for it all. Being on your own required a level of strength that I didn't yet have, even if the university is holding your hand on the journey to independence.  I pulled out of the main campus, and enrolled in the regional campuses- commuting from home, I was going to classes and doing well for myself, safe back in the nest. But I was still smoking.

I had to smoke to do anything. Cleaning my cat's litter box? Better spark up first. Going to work? Just a little hit. What a day, I just want to smoke and pass out in front of How I Met Your Mother, or Love After Lock-Up, or any other mindless sitcom that would allow me to consume, consume, consume, no thoughts required. I binged so much reality television that my speech patterns would mimic whatever stupid show I was watching at the time. My social skills went down the toilet because I was always high- I started stuttering, my brain would ""hitch"" (my term for not being able to think properly), my anxiety sky-rocketed as my depression spiraled. Instead of getting out of my head, weed forced me in deeper, at gun-point. I would be nearly comatose on my bed with a head that felt like it was full of wasps. I am an incredibly visual person, and weed would bring me 4K HD visions, crystal fucking clear, of past humiliations, of future possibilities that would always veer towards negativity, of my present pimply, yellow-toothed self (because of all of the shit food I would eat and how my skin and teeth reacts to smoke). But despite every negative effect it gave me, despite how it cemented me and made me stagnate, I couldn't stop. Something about the brain buzz that I both loved and feared.

But one day, high as usual, I went into the bathroom to look at myself. The familiar rush of self-loathing filled me but there was something else this time. It was the strongest desire to change everything about me, including the environment surrounding me. More than anything, I wanted to be the best version of myself living far, far away. Away from my childhood room and the rut I stuck myself in: being independent, living my best life, and most importantly, not dependent on a substance to get me through the day, a substance that was inexplicably tied to the trauma I had endured 2 years ago and was reliving every time I picked up the bong. I wish I could say that then was when I stopped smoking (I continued to use for weeks after this epiphany), but I made a goal- I would move out by the beginning of August, and no matter what, I would never smoke weed at my new place. 

It's been a week since I moved in, and I kept my word, and the change was instantaneous. My brain fog cleared up, I no longer stutter, or struggle as hard finding the right words, my anxiety is considerably lower, I'm very social with my roommates- and though I still feel sad, it's not the intense waves of depression that almost drowned me. My teeth have even lightened a few shades and my acne is calming down. With this change of habit, some new habits have formed as well. I'm cooking instead of eating fast food, keeping up with my hygiene, I make it a point to be more neat and organized. The only change that I still need to make is implementing a work-out routine and being less sedentary, but despite it all, I'm working everyday to be the best version of myself.

In the past 3 years I‚Äôve smoked nearly everyday with the exception of the 3 occasions. I want to detail these as relevant to the question - Why do I want to smoke?

1. Went on holiday to the Carribbean for a week and had no access. Zero withdrawal symptoms - change of scenery was good. Thought I would use this opportunity to quit. Missed connecting flight back to London from New York having flew 4/5 hours to JFK. Spent nearly 14 hours awake at JFK + 8/9 hours flight and a couple of hours after landing until I got home. I was exhausted and been awake for 36 hours at this point. First thing I did when I got home was smoke. 

I live with family members who do not know I smoke, I‚Äôm a secret smoker. It was 11pm at this point made some excuses as to why I had to leave home after the exhausting journey gone just to smoke. I felt no withdrawal at all - Why did I want to smoke?

2. This was prior to the above but I went 2/3 days without smoking because my plug was dry. I had bad anxiety, restlessness, insomnia and appetite issues. Felt I had to smoke to relieve the withdrawal.

3. I‚Äôm now a week without smoking as plug has gone awol. I‚Äôve felt little to no withdrawal symptoms. Only the third I struggled a bit with sleep but nothing major. Actually had some amazing dreams, one of which I really did not want to end and felt a buzz when waking up and recalling it. I generally feel a lot better, less tired and groggy and more mental clarity. My mood is better and generally feel my personality coming back. Weed depersonalised next but I enjoyed that element as well.

Despite the above I‚Äôve been texting/calling my plug every day looking to pick up some weed. I‚Äôd smoke right now if I could. Why do I want to smoke? 

I‚Äôve got no real withdrawal, I feel better and can see the benefits of being weed free. But I still want to smoke and I do not why? 

I guess I‚Äôm asking if anyone else has felt this way? I can understand as per point 2 to relieve the withdrawal why some one would still want to smoke.

In a way it seems the time passed by kind of quickly and I'm surprised I made it this far. I smoked weed for several years, and smoked fairly heavily to heavily daily the last five years. I wanted to seriously quit for over a year but just couldn't bring myself to do it.. but this year I turn 33, and the world ""falling apart"" felt like a good time to go for it. Who knows what's coming in the future?! Whatever happens, I have so many goals I'd like to chip away at.. including fostering once I'm stabilized. 

Some of the little victories: 

Last night I slept like a rock with no aids of any kind. 

I'm starting to regain a little of my energy and motivation. I was a very functioning ""stoner"" and used weed as motivation for all the boring shit I had to do in life, not to mention as a cover to calm me in times of anger, or to dull times of sadness. I hate crying, but there was an incident last week that made me really sad, and triggered a lot of past trauma. I cried it out and prayed about it (aka told God how pissed off I was lol) and weirdly it actually cleared and I feel lighter, not like I just buried it. 

I've been able to cook again (something I enjoy) and made the best (Americanized) Shepherd's Pie I've ever made earlier this week. 

I've had enough energy to take my son for a few walks, and to go for a few on my own. Even ran back home half way through once and it put a huge smile on my face to feel that adrenaline again and to feel that I'm still FAST even if a bit out of shape. This led to a desire to do that more often and put it back into my routine, and for my 30 day reward I bought myself some new ""walking/running"" shoes.. probably wouldn't have had the extra money before to just go out and get them when I was smoking. 

We've done a little rearranging in our house and on Day 24 I was able to pull out my books ‚ô•Ô∏è that have been in boxes the last four years and went unread the last six or seven. It felt so.. amazing.. and I had so much fun pulling them out and categorizing and putting them on my shelves. Reading was something weed stole from me.. it stole my ability to really focus.. whereas before I ever smoked I'd read for hours and hours. It was strange and awesome pulling out books I'd started as a smoker but didn't get far and never finished. It felt like I was reclaiming old bits of myself.. it feels like I pressed the stop button on my own growth, but now I'm pressing play again even though it's going to hurt sometimes. I also was able to put together a nice big box of them to give away.. something I would never have done before even if I didn't love the book, because previously I couldn't let things go. I let go of some arts and crafts stuff as well. It's crazy how big of a deal it felt like.. to let precious and expensive stuff go.. but I'm learning to let go in every aspect. Even to let go of old pains. They're a part of me, but they didn't make me me. 

No more stinky sweats üòÇ! 

Actually cleaned the house a few times and have done some laundry. Lol. 

I am still struggling with feeling tired a lot.. but it's gotten much much better.

The first 2-3 days are the worst, already on the 3rd day I feel so much better and realize the benefits. I go to the gym 3-4 times per week, I organize my stuff / my room, I am engaged with my work, I am more social and make time for friends and family. There are waves of cravings, melancholia, feelings of loneliness, but these are always followed by feelings of bliss, joy, and gratefulness. I feel my emotions (the good and bad ones) and I see myself growing (both physically and mentally). These quitting periods are the best periods of my life and I feel it in my bones that this is 100000x better than living in a haze 24/7. 

But it's always a matter of time for me (usually 1-2 months), before my addiction catches me and I'm back in prison. Sometimes it's a slow attack, I take a few puffs at a party or smoke a joint afterwards after 1 month. Often I don't like it, because I feel instantly the fog and the motivation being drained out of me. But then after a week, the threshold to smoke a joint has lowered and before I realize, I'm back at smoking everyday. Other times it attacks out of nowhere, everything is going fine and I'm on track, but one moment of weakness makes me smoke a joint. I don't know where it come from, but I'm back to smoking everyday instantly.  I'm in this cycle for 5 year.

Here's the problem. Every time I relapse, I smoke more and hit a lower bottom. And the motivation and hope to quit gets less everytime, because I know it's only a matter of time, before I'm back. 

How can I still believe in it, when I've repeated this cycle so many times? The epiphanies, the motivational feelings, the feelings of hope, I've experienced them so many times, but here I am, still addicted and smoking everyday. How can I take my attempt seriously, when I get only dejavu feelings when hearing myself motivating myself and feelings of ""this is the attempt that will change my life"" but get smacked in my face everytime?

I kept telling myself that since i was a successful developer doing well financially, smoking was OK. However... I started to notice a few things. 

I would constantly find myself forgetting a task that I had just started a few seconds ago. I'd have to reopen old windows to remind myself of what I was doing. On calls, I would barely engage, and would have others repeat what they had just said.

I coughed so bad my neighbors probably thought I was getting hit with the virus. But no, this was the highest, most ripped I had ever been in my short life at only 26 years old. 

I almost instantly felt my heart beating uncontrollably fast, well over what anyone would consider safe. I felt anxiety and panic immediately sweep over me and needed to sit down or else I was going to faint. My friend looked at me and said ""haha damn, your eyes are so fucking red. Get some water dude."" Before she realized how uncomfortable I was. I drank some water, but still, this shit wasn't stopping, I started sweating, still coughing.

My friend, She came over to me and grabbed my hand, and in that moment, I felt that my whole existence lead up to this point... and what have I done with my life? Been getting stoned every day for 10 years..  never going more than maybe a few days without smoking. 

All I could think of was that I was about to die next to my friend on the couch from smoking too much weed and I didn't live up to my full potential. I thought I was about to be the first guy to overdose on marijuana (this was going through my head haha)

 I started crying as my friend gripped my hand tighter and told me ""everything is going to be ok, you're just super baked."" I  told her how thankful I was for her and that I loved her...  because I was afraid I was never going to see her again. I opened up about my abuse of marijuana. I spoke to her like it would be my last time speaking to someone.

She chilled with me while I was coming down before she had to leave, and I told her I am never smoking again and gave her all my weed stuff. I feel bad that I had this melt down on her.

Obviously I'm alive, I'm ok and this type of experience with smoking cannabis is rare, but damn if I didnt feel like I was walking on the edge... never again will I put this substance into my body, it's the only one I have. And I want it to work for as long as possible. I want to be here, alive, with my loved ones as the best man I can be while I'm here. I want to be present in this reality.

Literally was high all the damn time. I don‚Äôt even know how I graduated from UCLA and got a decent job (with terrible grades though üòÇ).  But yea I‚Äôve been smoking for like 8 years, all day errday type deal, and the past 2 or 3 years was mostly carts. 

Now I‚Äôm on Day 4 of quitting carts and weed! The reason why I quit was because of a number of things. For some reason, I had more motivation to do something more with my life. But yea, i just had this urge to spend more time with my family, take care of my girlfriend more, to chase after my dreams of entrepreneurship, and to help others in the world. I honestly believed God was speaking to me (if you believe in God). But i was still smoking constantly while trying to change up my life.

It all came to a boil when i had an anxiety attack while driving. i was thinking about some deep shit (student from my old high school passed away in a freak accident while hiking) and boom had a mini anxiety attack. then a week or two later i started showing symptoms for covid! shortness of breath, chest tightness, fatigue.. and i was still smoking carts while i was sick lol. this lasted about a couple weeks, but my health anxiety and anxiety overall definitely increased the last couple weeks. I was actually cutting down on carts sometime towards the end of showing covid symptoms, but when i smoked one night I had a sense of dread and anxiety come over me. heart was beating fast. that was when i finally said ‚Äúfuck it something is telling me to quit this shit.‚Äù 

now that i‚Äôve quit carts (on day 4 now), I‚Äôve been able to open up more emotionally, found myself crying for a couple days just thinking about my life. definitely felt like a relief. BUT wow shit, these withdrawals are terrible. i have mad anxiety that makes me feel like ima go crazy lol, feeling tired sometimes, loss of appetite (but i‚Äôm able to eat some food so that‚Äôs good!), nausea, etc.. it‚Äôs been very hard, especially today seemed so difficult mentally for some reason. 

Even though it‚Äôs super hard, I truly feel like a lot of signs in my life showed me that quitting weed was the right thing. i‚Äôve seen so many changes in my life already, with my family, my girlfriend.. I‚Äôm able to work on myself to become the older brother that I want to be to my younger brother and sister, to be the successful man i know i can be, to be the best boyfriend to my most supportive girlfriend, and to use my gifts to help others in this world of evil. 

thanks for reading, and if you have been addicted to carts, how long did it take for you to completely feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù again? i‚Äôm honestly struggling with these withdrawals but this subreddit has been helping me calm my anxiety A LOT, so THANK YOU EVERYONE AT R/LEAVES.

2020-08-07 12:44:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/i5h8fr/2_weeks_as_of_last_night/,2 weeks as of last night,"Hey Folks,

Just wanted to share my experience after having been 2 weeks off of weed. Just a little bit of context first: When I used to smoke weed, I used to smoke it nightly and had been smoking weed on nightly basis for practically the last 4 years. I generally smoke to fall asleep and when I smoke, I get the munchies and eat.

The last time I seriously quit weed, I did it for about a year and I lost about 60 lbs. When I quit last time, I did it because I wanted to start working out again and didn't want the munchies to hamper my progress.

How I used to smoke weed (right up to 2 weeks ago): I vape mostly, and tried to find the weed with the highest THC levels. I smoked a lot of Heavy Hitters vape cartridges and would take about 8-10 hits nightly and then pass out within half an hour.

Why I quit weed this time:I noticed that I was very anxious in the mornings because I was in a brain fog (or weed hangover as some have called it) and my mind functioned a lot slower than when I was sober. Here's how the anxiety worked: I'd be in a brain fog and have to attend a work meeting (from home these days) and have to present and answer questions. I noticed that my mind struggled to get the words out and to have the connection to my tongue. Because I couldn't communicate in an environment when I was supposed to be, I got anxious. I had a hunch that it was from the weed, but wasn't sure.

So I wanted to run a time-based experiment (keeping as many of the other factors in my life the same so that I was just testing the weed variable and what impact subtracting weed had).

I also noticed that because I got the munchies, I'd sometimes stuff my face at about 10pm at night before falling asleep (chips, ice cream, just gross combinations now that I look back on it). And what I noticed by checking out the data on my smartwatch was that I wasn't getting enough deep or REM sleep, just light sleep and I'd be exhausted the next day.... which made me want to smoke weed more as a result perpetuating the cycle. So I decided to stop smoking weed for as long as possible and see what the result were.

My results:

So I've been trying to find a good way to summarize this and I've been bouncing around the internet looking for similar effects. The best one that parallels my results have the been the NoFap people are experiencing in their first month or few months after quitting. I used be a NoFap person but now it's not that big of a deal for me and sometimes you just have to get it out haha. With that being said, here are my results:

* For the first 3 days - Really bad sleep. I finally threw in the towel and got some sleeping pills on day 4 and I've been taking 1 a night which is helping me get about 1.5 hours of deep sleep, 1.5 hours of rem sleep, and about 4 hours of light sleep.
* Reduced anxiety - No surprises, the anxiety from brain fog is gone.
* Less need for coffee - Because I'm not in a mental fog every morning, I've been able to cut my coffee intake down to 1 cup a day and at most 2 cups a day. I used to be a 3 cups a day person. The increased caffeine intake might have had a significant impact on my anxiety by increasing my heart rate.
* Reduced tongue tied speech - I used to get literally tongue tied. Doesn't happen as much anymore.
* Increased happiness - I think this comes the fact that I'm not artificially hitting my body with dopamine every night. I think my levels are starting to even out which is interestingly making it easier for me to feel happier. I also don't feel as gloomy as I used to.
* Less Stress - Interestingly, I don't get easily stressed anymore. ‚Äã‚ÄãI know some days will be tough, but I don't psych myself out about it. I just get on with it.
* More optimism - I used to stand in the shower, in a brain fog and think ""ugh, another fucking day on the grind, this sucks, I don't want to do this."" And recently it's shifted to thinking ""Haha, just gotta get these 3 things done for work, and then I'm golden baby, this aint that bad!"" Pretty cool.
* Less shopping, less need for sugar - This might be because I needed such a high level of dopamine before from having a lot of THC hitting my system daily that if I was feeling down, I'd hit my system with sugary foods and shopping. Since I quit smoking weed daily, there hasn't been as much of a need to eat sugary foods and shop. Will continuously keep an eye on it. As a result, my spending on shit I don't need from Amazon and ordering food has gone down considerably.
* My body is slimming down - People that I'm on video calls with have pointed out that my face is slimmer (we're on monthly calls). I'll take it as a win. I'm not weighing myself during this, and honestly, this isn't about the weight. I lift weights 5 days a week anyways so it doesn't mean that much to me now. But once I've kicked the habit of smoking weed for about 2 months (and it's no long 100 degrees Fahrenheit around here) I want to take up cardio again. I used to a be 7.5 miles a day guy between jogging and walking and I want to get that started again.
* More objectivity - This might be a result of just mood stabilization, but I think I'm looking at this more objectively. Like my relationship with my boss and other folks. I'm not in my head as much, and I don't invent narratives that aren't there. Instead I'm just communicating to them and the nuances of what and how they communicate is resonating with me more.
* I don't really feel the need to smoke weed- I lift weights every day which help with stress, I get a full night's sleep, I drink about 100oz of water a day, I garden, and occasionally I'll play FIFA. I have sex on average about 2-3x a week too so I think I'm getting enough dopamine from my life. I think I'll take up salsa dancing again, that used to be a big passion of mine and just practice when I can. I need to take up meditation again.
* I might dive deeper into dopamine detox stuff- I've been watching a few youtube creators (Captain Sinbad, Matt D'Avella, and Nathaniel Drew) that touch on the subject. I might go deeper here, I'm not sure yet. Also I haven't fully wrapped my head around the science of how THC interacts with my neurons and how dopamine does as well, because hey I failed Biology the first time in 9th grade, luckily got a B the second time so I just need to keep at it :)

What does this mean: First, I'm not saying you'll have the same results or anything like that. I'm just saying that these are my results. Should you quit weed as a result of my results? Hell no man, do your own thing, I'm probably an outlier.

Personally, I think I'll keep going with this for as long as possible. I already know that at some point in the future, I'm going to have a horrible day and I'll smoke weed then. The thing I'm trying to keep in mind is that if I do decide to smoke weed again is to smoke it once, and not make it a daily thing again. We'll see how long this goes on for.

Good luck to everyone who's considering giving up weed or who's just trying to live their best life, however they define it :D",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9991798996925354}"

This by far the longest sober streak I've had since I was 12 years old, and I am 54 now.  That's kind of shocking to write down.  

My like isn't paradise, it's largely the same.  The difference is that I am present for everything and I have been brave enough to face all of my challenges without intoxicating myself to cope.  

I credit therapy, a focus on radical acceptance, and mindfulness. I am learning to accept and appreciate all experiences, good and bad.  It's not easy, but it has given me so much self esteem that I've lacked.  I can do this and I don't need weed to feel good when I'm unhappy or to enhance experiences. I love the freedom of not needing to constantly think about my next high. 

 Other things I like- no brain fog, better memory and better energy, I wake up easier in the morning, I am more relaxed and less anxious, and I'm more in touch with my true feelings now.  Before I didn't know what I was feeling most of the time. I was so anxious until I got high again.  Then the anxiety cycle repeated time after time, day after day.  Yuck.

I like this new me so much better, I think I am on my way to a better life.  This sub has been a great help to me.   I will keep coming back to remind me what early sobriety is like and try and help others however I can. For those thinking about giving up weed, I can honestly say it is a great move and the short term withdrawal is very much worth it!  I also want to encourage those that try to stop and relapse, it's ok, it's taken me many many tries.  Don't get down on yourself, it's a process, just keep trying. Persistence is key- this drug is stubborn!

Sobriety after 12+ years of abuse.,"If you‚Äôre reading this, I want you to know that I love you. I hope my story gives you hope or inspires you. I do not believe anyone‚Äôs struggles greater than anyone else‚Äôs, and I believe that we all have a lot more in common than our minds tend to tell us. 

I grew up in a household where all of my family and immediate family smokes. It‚Äôs how I bonded with my parents, my friends, almost every relationship I developed over the past 12-13 years was on the premise of getting high together. Its almost like it gave me a sense of purpose. I started smoking daily in 2006, as a junior in high school.

In 2009, my 8 year old sister passed away in a freak accident. The day she passed, July 22, I swore that I would stop smoking weed and be the best version of myself. That promise didn‚Äôt even last 24 hours. 

Fast forward 11 years, I was smoking an eighth to a quarter a day, and budgeting approximately $15,000-20,000 per year for weed. I got to be pretty successful in my career, so I didn‚Äôt see it as something that held me back. I actually told people, and myself, things like ‚Äúit helps me stay relaxed‚Äù, ‚Äúit gives me perspective‚Äù, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt sleep without it‚Äù, ‚Äúit has so many health benefits for me personally‚Äù, on top of all the pro-marijuana research that was coming out, and legalization across the country, seemingly justifying my addiction, strengthening it. 

2020 was my year of reckoning. I broke off my engagement, I had two spinal surgeries that rendered me unable to walk for 6 months, and I was terminated from my job while on FMLA leave, 2 days after my second surgery. I felt that this momentous wave that I had ridden was a mirage, and it disappeared in a moments notice leaving me to fall and fall, wondering when I‚Äôll actually hit rock bottom.

On March 27th, 2020, a week after my first spinal surgery failed and made my condition worse, I fell into a deep deep depression, not wanting to live in the pain I was in anymore, and no medicine or remedy helping me to any degree. I wrote letters to all my family members, to all my friends, and was ready to end my life. I played out the situation of my death in my head so many times, and am in tears as I write this, thinking about how much I‚Äôve allowed myself to suffer. I held my Ruger .45 to my head and pulled the trigger, and screamed so loud, as if it was my last time breathing, or expelling any sort of emotion from my soul. The gun jammed, and I dropped it immediately, and dropped to the floor and sobbed for probably 12 hours straight. 

I needed help... badly... I wanted to live but I felt that I didn‚Äôt know what life means to me. I hired a therapist and began intense therapy weekly. I started journaling, dedicating myself to CBT therapy (highly recommend the book ‚ÄòMind Over Mood‚Äô), and within 2 weeks, I was scheduled for my 2nd surgery, which alleviated the nerve pain I had been dealing with for the prior 5 months. It didn‚Äôt take long for me and my therapist to find that I needed to quit smoking weed to help myself. To even have a chance to deal with life as it is. I didn‚Äôt think I could do it, so I continued to self medicate and merry it with therapy thinking I was helping myself.

While I thought I was getting better, I was only getting worse. That‚Äôs the thing about life, you either get better or worse every day. And while I thought I was ‚Äúgetting perspective‚Äù or ‚Äústaying relaxed‚Äù, I was masking my emotions more and more to the point where I was strengthening the paradigm of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know who I am anymore‚Äù, nonetheless how to deal with everything I was feeling. 

So July 2020 came around, and there I was again, with my gun, with my tears, with my unrelinquishing agony. I was ready to see my sister again. Only this time, I decided that when I see her, I want her to be proud of me, of who I am, of what she instilled in me and I carried on. I gave the gun back to my father (he gifted it to me years ago), and decided that I need space from certain toxic relationships. I admitted that I needed to take back control. I want to be proud of my life. 

I looked at rehab as an option, but unfortunately they do not consider marijuana to be a viable addiction so it would cost me approximately $15,000 for a 30 day detox. While that‚Äôs what I would spend on weed in a year, I unfortunately did not have the resources to make that happen. 

But what I did realize, in all of this, is that you need to be your greatest resource. No one and nothing is going to fill any void in your life, you have to make yourself whole. So I decided to make myself whole. On July 22, 2020, 11 years after my sisters passing, 11 years after my first failed promise to myself, I quit.

There‚Äôs no ‚Äúsecret‚Äù. There‚Äôs no one thing that will make dealing with life as it is easier. But if there‚Äôs one thing I can tell you that I found to be true for me and gives me hope every day, is that you deserve the life that you see for yourself. No one and nothing else is going to give that to you except for yourself. Some days I feel happy and hopeful, and some days I feel that I don‚Äôt want to do this, that I didn‚Äôt ask to be here. And overlooking those highs and lows sometimes makes me feel manic altogether. I know that although I have my ups and downs, my trajectory is up and up, and I‚Äôm no where near where I can reap the benefits of my pot-free journey. But I have hope. I have faith. And if I do die, I‚Äôm proud that I had it in me to follow through on this promise to myself and fight for the life I deserve.",20,{'mask': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9886003136634827}"

I weigh 135lbs and play football. This makes me very anxious because I‚Äôm close to being the skinniest on the team. I feel like I can‚Äôt eat anything right now. Even when I was smoking, I was having maybe one full meal a day. I‚Äôm scared I permanently messed up my brain‚Äôs appetite center or something. It‚Äôs very hard for me to force food down my throat and get calories. Yesterday I definitely had less that like 1000 calories. I‚Äôm so scared and anxious. 

Usually I can get to sleep with the help of a benzo or melatonin. I‚Äôm on day 2 right now and am suffering from extreme anxiety and loss of appetite and weight loss. This scares me so much. I want to seek professional help so bad, but who do I even go to? A physiologist, psychiatrist, rehab?? I told my parents and they don‚Äôt believe weed withdrawals are real. They won‚Äôt let me take a little bit of time off football until my body is right and I am eating enough to support myself. My mom and I looked for an available psychiatrist but no one was available within the next two weeks. I really believe I need urgent help. 

I‚Äôm battling with anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts right now. I know I can‚Äôt kill myself because that will just transfer the pain to everyone else. My dad is convinced the problem is gastrointestinal, and I even had an endoscopy and colonoscopy and everything came back normal. I feel so broken, unhealthy, and depressed. Nothing seems fun/normal.

The hardest was the first week but have slowly been getting better. I have still have the occasional angry outbursts but a) who doesnt and b) they are becoming more controllable.

I tried to shorten it, but it's a complex story that I haven't told many people. I never thought I'd make it to where I am today and wanted to share.

I started smoking in college to quell my anxiety/depression. It immediately turned into an everyday habit. Two years later I was buying a couple lbs of bud and a few ozs of wax at a time to sell and smoke. I also started growing/selling mushrooms and rarely left my house other than to go to class. I knew I wanted to quit selling after I graduated, but wasn't going to quit smoking. A year later I wasn't selling as much and I'd cut back on smoking, but I felt like I was stuck and would need to move to a new town to totally stop. I'd been looking for a new job and smoking even less, but my wakeup call was quickly approaching.

One day my apartment was broken into (nothing was taken...), cops responded while I was at work, they saw weed in the open, and I was immediately handcuffed when I got back. They got a warrant and found pounds of mushrooms, ozs of weed, edibles, RSO, wax, topicals, LSD, and more. I was charged with PWID Cannabis, THC, LSD, and mushrooms with a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison. Up to this point (on paper) I was a model citizen; clean record, graduated from an honors college with an engineering degree, had a few internships, and had a great full time job. I thought my life was over and contemplated suicide in jail that night.

Instead of giving up, I was determined to do everything I could to turn things around. I got a kick ass lawyer, threw away all the remaining drugs/paraphernalia, got a therapist, worked on my relationships with family/friends, and started focusing on my mental health. It wasnt easy and I was in a dark place for a while, but things started to improve.

It's been 10 months but feels like a lifetime. My lawyer negotiated with the cops/solicitor and I was able to do Pretrial Intervention, which felt like a miracle given the charges... I paid my fees, completed my community service, drug abuse sessions, etc and recently my charges were dismissed and expunged! Back to a clean record! I immersed myself in hobbies (backpacking, woodturning, baking/cooking) and I feel so much healthier and more productive with my life. I finally feel like I have a direction and don't need something to constantly numb my emotions. I still struggle with depression/anxiety, I'm still tempted to smoke, and I'll be paying back my lawyer fees for the next year and a half, but I know I'm so much better off and I'm proud of how far I've come.

Sometimes you need a little push. For me it took a big one. I try to remind myself every day of how lucky I am to have my freedom and that I'm not still stuck in a constant cycle of smoking myself numb and being on ""autopilot"" every day.",16,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9518992304801941}"

I‚Äôve done all the different ways of using weed. Joints were the worst for me. Became something I didn‚Äôt think it would. I justified it so much why I needed in my life.

All I can see now, is that about 4 years of my life I have just passed and I couldn‚Äôt say that I‚Äôve been happy about my progress. I‚Äôve delayed so many things because all I‚Äôve wanted to do is smoke weed and just let it help me forget about things.

I look back now when I‚Äôm sober, and my life has actually been going down hill and I choose to ignore it, but it‚Äôs not entirely weeds fault. I still make my own decisions.

I used to think that weed actually unlocked the ‚Äúgreat potential‚Äù of myself. But it‚Äôs all just a psychological thing, weed doesn‚Äôt make you a better person, it shouldn‚Äôt be the reason for your creativity, fun times, good vibes or the reason you catch up with friends or family to hang to have a good time. Don‚Äôt let a drug control you to think that you need it in your life to function. 

Break that addiction. Embrace being sober and enjoy it. Life isn‚Äôt about always having a ‚Äúgreat time‚Äù. We have some bad days and definitely good ones. Not everyday is going to be the best. You don‚Äôt need weed for those bad days to make them better.

And I love smoking some weed, but If I would choose between remembering the great times with people in my life, and excelling in my job and pushing to do better within myself or there‚Äôs just getting high and slowly forgetting it all happened. I would choose the first.

This isn‚Äôt about just weed, we also have many things in our lives that we need to fix. But sometimes weed doesn‚Äôt help you think when your brain is in a continuous foggy loop everyday.

And they‚Äôve advanced beyond me in a sense that they buy weed in bulk, keep pieces, and don‚Äôt mind others knowing they smoke, they wear the title of stoner proudly . I on the other have always smoked secretly. Ive always preferred it what way, maybe because my parents were drug addicts and alcoholics. And I never wanted to be ‚Äúlike them‚Äù. I was introduced to weed by a bf at 16. I used to never buy weed myself (butttt that‚Äôs changed since I moved out on my own Jan 2019) and I wouldn‚Äôt smoke alone or have my own pieces. (All changed now)

Since I moved out I realized I could smoke by myself (in my bathroom or car because I have a nonsmoking roommate that doesn‚Äôt know about my habit). I started buying weekly. I bought a small bowl. I actually prefer smoking alone because I can just veg. But that‚Äôs changed though and now It causes anxiety. I will legit drive to grocery and smoke on the way, and then I have to go back home bc I‚Äôm too scared to go inside. I always crave it and then I smoke and I‚Äôm so scared to be around people lol

The only people that would know are my two older friends, and my dealer.  My older friends don‚Äôt understand why I want to quit. And my newer friends have not idea what I‚Äôm going thru. 

I‚Äôve quit twice in years past for probation (18 and 21). And remember thinking I loved it and would never go back. And sure as shit my friend that smokes now made sure I smoked the day my probation ended ‚Äúas celebration‚Äù. I knew leading up to that moment that I didn‚Äôt want to smoke anymore. But then as soon as I did, even after 6mo-1yr sober, it was right back on the struggle bus. 

I think it‚Äôs hard because I‚Äôve actually accomplished a lot. College, grad school, a job working for myself( thank god because I‚Äôm not cut out to work on offices). But then I look at my new friend group, who doesn‚Äôt smoke, and I see how much better they live and how much faster they accomplish things. And I just know that that could be me. I don‚Äôt want to hide my habit anymore. It‚Äôs not even fun at this point. I get so much anxiety when I smoke. I also want to meet a guy who doesn‚Äôt smoke. I will legit drive to go get groceries, smoke on the way, and by the time I park I‚Äôm too freaked out, I go back home. Wtf?? I‚Äôve let my room become disgusting even though I want to date and be able to bring guys over. Weed made me not care. I actually lost a bunch of weight when I first moved because I felt like such a bad bitch for finally having my own place. But I‚Äôve gained it all back from smoking and avoiding my roommate and going to eat bullshit in my car alone. 

As I‚Äôm typing this it‚Äôs like wtf???? I guess I‚Äôm looking for some support and maybe someone who can relate. I threw my bowl out yesterday. I used all my weed the day before that. And then yesterday I tried to res-hit it until I felt sick. Probably from inhaling disgusting lifter fumes.  So today‚Äôs my full on day 1. I won‚Äôt smoke today, I know that based on it being maybe 3hrs until I go to bed. I‚Äôm about to go for a walk and then take some sleeping medicine. Just to force the day to end. It‚Äôs not my first time quitting. But it‚Äôs harder this time without probation and drug tests hanging over my head. But I know it‚Äôs something I need to do. I wanted to at 18. Here I am 9 years later. It‚Äôs just so crazy how half of you brain wants to and the other half is like it‚Äôs fine, just smoke ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I wanted to make this post because I felt so hopeless during the first 2 weeks, it was the strongest and most persistent stretch of anxiety I‚Äôve had in my life, and I have suffered through some seriously rough patches. The anxiety, depression, nausea, lack of appetite, insomnia, sweating, apathy, demotivation was so fierce and I never thought I‚Äôd feel better and pretty much forgot what feeling ‚Äònormal‚Äô is like.

My advice is just go with the flow. I just reminded myself everyday that these were common withdrawal symptoms of a substance I‚Äôd used for around 13 years (I‚Äôm 26 M UK), everyday for around 8 years (with a 2 month tolerance break). The first 2 weeks were super rough but it had to be done.

Now on day 31 and I‚Äôm starting to feel like myself again, expect I‚Äôm not high as fuck all the time. There are definitely some noticeable improvements; my memory has improved greatly aswell as my social skills, I don‚Äôt trip over words and overthink social situations so much now. I‚Äôm learning to live in the present. The past cannot be changed and I can‚Äôt predict the future so the guilt and shame from not doing my 100% best over the last x amount of years is lifting, almost like I‚Äôm forgiving myself. My motivation to get back in the gym is in full force, I‚Äôm reading a lot more and enjoying spending more time with my family. My anxiety is subsiding consistently, there are still some bad days, but they appear less and less compared to the good days :) I‚Äôm not out of the woods yet.

Anyway, during the darkest times of this journey I sought out so much reassurance from this sub and it really did help me out. Brighter days are coming my friends believe me, go through the motions, it‚Äôs rough but it‚Äôs so worth it when you reap the benefits.

My advice is spend as much time with your friends and family as you can, get outside, exercise, eat as well as you can, get busy, work hard, remind yourself of why you‚Äôre doing this and find a new crutch if that‚Äôs what cannabis has been to you.

But after reading about cannabis‚Äô effect on our sleep cycles, I realized that even my sleep app was lying about the quality. See in this [chart](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/7lA4Y8k) I have two nights from smoking on top, and on the bottom are nights after a month without smoking. I chose nights with comparable ‚ÄúQuality‚Äù but the proof is actually in the graphs.
Even though I was spending more time in ‚Äúdeep sleep‚Äù after smoking, I was actually robbing my body of the full range of sleep stages it needs to be well-rested. We are supposed to fluctuate and start the cycle over every 90 minutes or so.
My lived experience also includes starting to dream again. I quit cannabis two weeks before going cold turkey on cigarettes, and the second part is what triggered my REM Rebound, in other words, a period of vivid and sometimes scary dreams when I began dreaming again. The scary ones subsided after 21 days, and now I‚Äôm still having dreams that I can remember, as a result of getting all the normal stages in a night.

I fucked up recently and have been feeling really low so created a throwaway account to talk about it.

Around about 10 months ago I quit smoking cold turkey (smoked pretty much all day everyday for about 6 or so years before that point) and was doing well. I felt more clear headed and was good at avoiding situations where I would smoke and got to the point where I could hang with friends who were smoking and not be tempted.

recently ive been feeling like a failure. I cracked and smoked a joint with a friend and convinced myself I could try and build a better relationship with weed. This was a lie to myself. For the past couple weeks i've been smoking almost everyday again, hanging out with friends I think can be quite toxic cos i know they will have weed. Its been giving me anxiety and stress which feeds into the cycle of seeking escape.

I don't really know what i aim to achieve posting this. i guess im just scared that going down that route again and that Im gonna turn back into that old me. i have so little motivation and can barely get the energy to care about myself, or anything around me. I really want to get the drive to quit again but it feels so hard. I feel like shit and dont want to be me and getting high isnt helping cos I just stress more when on it, but I always feel the draw of escaping and melting into the sofa.

Been smoking in a regular basis since I was 17 (I'm 30 now). Weed has been around every activity, every weekend, every week evening, every song, every movie, almost every meal, every videogame, every vacation trip and every hangout with friends.

In my country, we've been put to quarantine since March and still counting. During this first 4 months my thoughts were ""Fuck yeah!!"" and got to smoke 15g per fortnight. Until a few weeks ago, when I think I hitted rock bottom. Here weed is illegal and the economy is shit. 

So this addiction included mining all my salary and trying different ways to evade quarantine controls to reach my dealer. The anxiety that this brought to my life was quite intense, I needed to stop because it was stuck in the loop.

During the past 3 years, when I come to reality that I was reaching my 30s, I started changin habits. I quitted smoking tabacco (after 8 years of addiction). Quitted binge eating and bad eating habits (lost 30kg in 1 year), quitted using nasal spray with corticoids (been abusing this since I was 14). All of this going cold turkey. And that seemed to work for me just fine. But I can't stand it with weed. By far, it's the most difficult habit to get rid off.

I'm having sleepless nights, mood changes, nothing really fulls me. I don't want to watch movies any more, hell I kinda feel like playing video games is a drag. I don't get excited for anything. And I feel that the context it's no quite favourable this time. I can't go outside for a run, I can't see my friends, I can barely see my family.

All for this stupid virus and the f\*\*\*\*\* quarantine that's been on for months.

I'm really struggling this right now. The only thing that keeps me going on, day by day, is that it's difficult to get the stuff and I don't have it anymore around me. But every crave I have, I hate myself. I start thinking WHY? Why I have to get rid off of every little thing in my life that brought me any kind of confort. I know is a stupid thought, and it's wrong. But my head just goes to that place and makes everything really hard.

And I don't want to sound cheesy. But this subreddit is the only thing that calms me down. Everytime I get this in my head, I start reading this posts. And whenever someone is feeling the same way I am, just calms me down. Don't know really why, but knowing how other copes with this problem gives me strength to keep going on. I needed to take this out off my chest, and in a way say Thank you, to all this community.",14,"{'covid': 1, 'quarantine': 4, 'virus': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9990092515945435}"

This accomplishment is very bittersweet because of what it took to get me to pick up the pieces and get my life together. The past couple of days were an exercise in mindfulness and realizing that while I can be sad about what I've lost over the past year, my past doesn't define me. I have made the first steps into being a better person and I can only hope to continue along that path.

I'm thankful that I made the decision to get better and continue to make that decision every day. Because I stopped smoking pot I finally have the motivation to finish my History BA and start an Education major. In addition, I've had the gumption to get out and participate in a number of protests for extremely worthy causes. Before I would have just stayed home and felt guilty that I had the option to demonstrate for the things I believe in, but chose not to. 

I'm also extremely thankful to the people who have supported me through this journey of self realization and positive change. I have been reintegrated into a friend group that has quickly become my chosen family. I appreciate you all so much for being there for me and keeping me accountable. I love y'all and will always be here for you guys in the same way. 

To all of those who I have hurt over the years through my inaction and not caring about the little things, I cannot put into words just how sorry I am for who I was and what I did to you. I know that apologies mean little without action behind them and I never proved that I was capable of taking those steps. I didn't realize at the time just how much my laziness could affect and harm another person, but there are no excuses for my behavior. I acted like a child instead of an adult and that is 100% on me. I think I've finally learned that lesson, after it bashed me over the head countless times, even if I can't prove it to any of you now.

I also want to thank everyone in the sub for being such an amazing community. Reading your stories, whether about success or failure, have really helped to keep me motivated over the past year. You are all wonderful people who are worthy of love. Together we can help everyone reach new heights, without having to get high.

Love y'all,

I considered myself a functional stoner because my habits never impeded on my academics or job even though I was high 24/7.  I'm currently working as CNA and would show up high every damn shift and use the pen during my break, I knew i couldn't carry this dirty habit this into nursing once I become an RN but for the time being, it helped stabilize my mood and keep me happy while I spend every weekend of my college career changing diapers also it takes a special level of patience to deal with the elderly sometimes, especially being a POC with some dementia patients thinking it's 1964, anyways I digress.  I felt that smoking was very therapeutic for me because it helped me emotionally and with my chronic back pain (i have pretty bad scoliosis). I'm quitting because I am at the point in my nursing program where I have to pass drug screenings. I quit about 3 days ago and I'm feeling the withdrawal symptoms getting more intense, its not my first time quitting for the sake of passing a piss test but I know this time I won't be able to go back.  I know I can't let myself relapse because I feel like I'm so close to becoming the person I've always wanted to be and ill be damned if the only thing that stops me from achieving that is my weed addiction, but holy shit I feel like SpongeBob in that episode where he's in sandy's tree dome saying ""I don't need it"".

Does anyone actually enjoy smoking anymore?

Do you find that it satisfies you?

Are you glad that you smoked? Are you ever pleased in the morning that you smoked yesterday?

Do you ever feel like it's ever enough, like you are high enough to feel good?

Does weed actually relax you, or does it just stop you from chasing your dreams that you'd actually like to accomplish? Does it take the pressure off from achieving things?

\------

\-For me, I seem to never be able to get high enough, or a ""good high"". It's always too little, and sometimes too much, depending on whether there are other people that I'm anxious about while high because I have to hide it etc--but it never *feels* good enough. Even when I have just smoked, I feel all the bodily sensations, pressure in my head... Why doesn't it feel enough? A voice in my head says: ""maybe just a little bit more, I might regret for not smoking enough"" ""I'm going to get super high this final time. I'll have a great finale with everything I want, and then I start the break"" and something along those lines. ""I need to be high to enjoy the X thing I'm about to do"". Do we though?

When I was sober from weed for months (apart from the rare toke, maybe 5 times during 4 months) I seemed to enjoy things just fine. I wasn't on top of the world euphoric about everything I did, but things were okay. It was smooth, I didn't wake up thinking about weed or feeling guilty for smoking, or anxious about urges to smoke. The thought of smoking weed crossed my mind once in a while ""Sure it would be nice"" the voice in my head said, when things seemed to go the wrong way in life. I knew it wouldn't be that nice though, the idea is always better than the actual experience. The actual experience of smoking included: anxiousness, feeling spaced out and not being able to communicate very well, and of course the urge to smoke more. Those urges/withdrawals always lingered for a little bit even though I had long breaks in between. It took usually 2-3 days to come back to ""normal"", but I might've had some thoughts during the next weeks as well, not intense urges except for the couple days sometimes but this is besides the point.

I feel like I'm chasing an old high, the high I had 4-5 years ago, which is when I first smoked at 18 years old. That felt good didn't it? Maybe it did, maybe it was different from everything else back then and it opened a door to another world for me at that point. All I know, is that those highs have long been gone. Now I smoke and I feel self-critical, anxious, paranoid, regretful. And maybe not at the start after a break, but insidiously things always start to go deeper, and deeper, sinking into some kind of weed-depression where I try to get relief in the substance that brought me into this despair. It's weird how I felt good, pretty okay, before I started to smoke, but suddenly I seem to need weed to even feel normal, to enjoy anything, sometimes to even cook myself food. I don't think this is good... How is this a way to live? I don't like feeling addicted, why does one part of me want this (addiction/drug), and another part blame me for doing it? I keep going in this cycle of escaping a feeling of emptiness, and then feeling bad for trying to fill it with weed, because I know it isn't good for me, and then trying to hide from the guilt of getting myself into this situation and avoiding responsibility by going into the familiar cycle of smoking again to feel good for a little while saying: ""I'll quit later, just not right now""

I think I'm ready to quit once again. I've had few longer quits ranging from 2 weeks to months during the year, but then I've always come back;either thinking I can handle it, or just displeased with how life is going. When I had the rule of never buy weed, it suited me well, because not that many people I know smoke weed or share it with me (it's rare that happens). But the urge grew even from the rare tokes from friends, so I should be more careful this time. A thing I've noticed, I get anxious as fuck when I'm given the choice to buy or smoke weed. I think it's like an alarm bell going off, and I mean I get a nasty feeling when I've been on a quit/break. Well no wonder, because nothing really ever happens in my life when I start to smoke. Social life gets weak, I hide from the world even from my friends online, I've little to no motivation to make some long-term plans happen, and instead I do things that give instant-gratification, and justify it with ""well I'm high right now, I don't want to waste this"" etc. It's just really boring. Everyday is pretty much the same thing over and over again, chasing highs, dodging the lows, avoiding the blows of life and escaping to the little weed headspace--only to feel pretty awful in the end.",2,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.8650293946266174}"

Succulent propagating, sculpture, yoga, all those good hippie dippie things that bring me a lot of joy haha. 

Anyway I‚Äôm here to mark my progress but also to say I‚Äôve been struggling not to be ‚Äúpreachy‚Äù to my friends who still smoke. I have a tendency to want to share any new self improvement I make in my life in the hopes others might see it and think it could work for them too! I always start my convos as ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think smoking is evil. I just know that I‚Äôm an addict, and can‚Äôt moderate it like most can!‚Äù but when I go on to extoll the many virtues I‚Äôve felt by not smoking I still see my friends get defensive. I know I would be if I was in their shoes and didn‚Äôt want to stop. So I think I need to dial it back. Anyone have any good advice on how to approach this? I guess I can just save my rants on how much I love not smoking for here haha.

2020-08-05 13:20:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/i49ikc/time_for_a_change/,Time for a change.,"This morning I found this sub, and I didn‚Äôt think that something like this existed! I have been smoking regularly for about 2 years now, and I just wanted to share my experience. :)

I have always struggled with my self-esteem. I‚Äôve never had the ‚Äúcool‚Äù personality that I‚Äôve seen in others, and I was never the most social. I also struggled with my self-image, and have always thought that I‚Äôm not attractive. I‚Äôve also always been anxious. This started to change for the better when I started to smoke regularly in my first year of college. While I was high, my insecurities were lowered, I could actually look in the mirror and not feel bad about myself, and I actually started to feel ‚Äúcool‚Äù. It felt like I was actually living in this world, instead of just existing, so I started smoking more often, and eventually started smoking every weekend, then every week, then every other day, and now I am at the point where I smoke everyday, sometimes all throughout the day, and I feel horrible. 

Something that once left me feeling light, happy, and care-free has now turned into something that I have to do to not feel anxious. Something that I thought made me feel more capable in my abilities has now made me feel held back, and less than my potential. This is a point that I never thought I would get to, and it hurts to think that I am dependent on a substance. Especially a substance that is rumored to be ‚Äúnon-addictive‚Äù. 

I best way to describe the feeling is hazy. It‚Äôs taking longer for me to make simple decisions, it‚Äôs getting harder for me to remember simple things, and my energy is at an all time low. I don‚Äôt feel in my own body, but dissociated, almost like I‚Äôm on the outside looking inside. Not to mention the damage being done to my lungs during a pandemic for a virus that affects your respiratory system. :/

I am now going into my junior year of college. I am finally going to therapy consistently, and am trying to work on my self-esteem and self-judgements. However I still am using weed to cope with those feelings of inadequacy, depression, and anxiety. It is an unhealthy coping mechanism, I know, but weed allows me to feel fine while feeling bad; allows me to forget about the umbrella of self-doubt and self-judgement that is looming over my head. 

I know that I have to quit, and I have been trying to for the past couple of months, but it is very hard. How do I quit something that has actually made me feel good during a time when I felt so bad about myself? Quit something that made me feel more comfortable in my own skin? Something that finally makes me feel less anxious and depressed? 

I guess the answer is to just do it, and I‚Äôm happy to say that this is Day 1. Even though I‚Äôve been counting Day 1 for months now, maybe this sub is the motivation that I need to keep going.

My first milestone goal is 90 days. I am breaking that up into 10 day chunks which feel more manageable to me than counting weeks.

Last weekend was full of cravings and lacked focus entirely. I still am having somewhat of a hard time focusing and still having vivid dreams that make me feel unrested in the morning but I know all of this will only pass if I keep on.

I have a 90 day goal because when I quit drinking it really took until week 9 or 10 for me to begin feeling any different (which was very surprising to me!) and then by day 90 I felt very different in all the best ways. I‚Äôm very much looking forward to that day fully sober. That‚Äôs so weird to say.

From day 90 of totally sober I‚Äôll decide where to go next, but my hope is that I‚Äôll still be ready to be down to remain fully sober for good. I hope to have some crazy productive weeks and some crystal clear memories under my belt that help me see what weed can steal, and I hope to still have the knowledge and confidence that I can‚Äôt moderate weed.

I love that I‚Äôm creating this little digital timeline to look back on when I want to smoke or drink to remind me of the path I‚Äôve committed to and the hardships I‚Äôll have to go through again if I pick up.

Day 10 feels very medium. It doesn‚Äôt feel hard, I‚Äôm not having cravings...in fact, the idea of smoking is repulsive to me right now. But it doesn‚Äôt necessarily feel easy, with the lack of focus and sleeplessness and irritability sometimes just bubbling under the surface.

It was in the last 2 years that I was starting to feel depressed, starting to see my friends that didn't smoke begin to surpass me in just about every aspect of life. I always thought I didn't have an issue, and wasn't a ""lazy stoner"" because I enjoyed doing activities stoned, and actually exercised a fair amount while high. But it had pretty much taken over my life, I couldn't wait to get home from work or a family gathering just to get home and get high. I was unmotivated to better myself and prepare for the future, I'd rather just be stoned and be disillusioned and feel temporary happiness.

I needed to stop... But the best part was, I actually WANTED to stop. I set myself a goal, on my 30th birthday I would quit smoking weed for 100 days. The idea of just giving it up permanently terrified me, and just seemed unachievable. 

The beginning was not as bad as I thought, but my partner definitely noticed my mood swings and irritability. But the worst part for me was sleeping. I didn't sleep through the night for the first week.

I smoked blunts, carts joints, ate edibles, oil pretty much anything. I had a couple friends I smoked with a lot. One of my close friends William was having trouble at home, so all he did was smoke. He was very depressed and eventually tried to commit suicide :( He ended up getting sent to boarding school for a year. I wouldnt say weed ruined his life but I think it definitely played a part in at least screwing up his life for a while. Anyways  I sometimes got high while In class and every time I wouldn‚Äôt learn anything the entire day. My grades suffered but I didn‚Äôt care. I would get high and go to my weight training class and have a blast but the rest of the day I would be a potato. I burned through around 12 carts smoked ounces and ounces. Probably spent around 1000$ on weed. 

Around 9 months ago I was at a cross country meet and was running a 3k. I ran as hard as I could and manage to get 2nd place with a 10 minute time. After I crossed the finish line I noticed I was having a lot of trouble breathing and my chest hurt like hell. It went away after a half hour and I figured it was normal. I had practice a couple days after that and I got the same chest pain again got so bad that I quit for the day. It kept happening so I stopped running entirely and I kept smoking. Throughout the rest of the year I kept getting chest pain quite frequently, couple times a week. Felt like tones of needles were poking my chest not fun but I kept smoking. I considered going to the doctor but I didn‚Äôt because I didn‚Äôt want my mom to know I smoked (i know great logic). 

Every time I hung out with friends we smoked, I smoked at lunch after I got home. Eventually I stopped buying weed  and any other products and just relied on people sharing their stuff with me. I tried to stop smoking or at least cut down a lot but every time I hung out with friends they pressured me into smoking. It was so weird it‚Äôs like they needed me to smoke. Somehow every time I hung out with them not wanting to smoke I would end up smoking. They offered to buy me fast food if I smoked they were very persistent with their need for me to smoke.

Eventually coronavirus worked its way to America and lockdown happened. I decided it wasn‚Äôt worth putting my family at risk just to go buy drugs and it certainly wouldn‚Äôt help my lungs if I continued to smoke and got the virus. After around a month I noticed that I felt more energetic, less foggy more alert. I am better at video games. I also noticed that my lungs hurt less and less frequently. However I do feel like I‚Äôm kind of stupid from the amount I‚Äôve smoked, for example I can‚Äôt write for shit, I have some trouble following directions and my memory is still kind of fucked but hopefully it will get better eventually. It‚Äôs been three or four months since the start of quarantine I think and I‚Äôve been clean the entire time I have virtually no chest pains (although I did crack my sternum a couple weeks ago so i can‚Äôt really tell which pain is which) but yeah I feel a lot better. I am curious if I can make it though senior year without any slip ups. Sometimes I miss weed and actually get pretty nostalgic about it.

4 days in and I am feeling pretty good. I have 'quit' smoking several times in the past, at the longest for 3 months, and have luckily never experienced any physical symptoms so I guess in that regard I am just that, lucky.

The problem for me are the mental/emotional symptoms. The main reason I smoked was because I was bored, other than that it was my go to for any sort of emotional or physical distress whether it be heartbreak or a rolled ankle. At some point after abstaining use I always get intrusive thoughts especially when I am extremely bored or experiencing distress, in addition to if I am around social triggers for smoking (girls, friends, etc)... one way or another I will make an excuse as to why it would be a good idea to smoke and break my sobriety. Even though immediately after I almost always feel like shit and as if I am on a lower vibration

I legitimately want to quit for good at this point, I know that it is beneficial to my overall wellbeing and that I will accomplish much more in life with a clear mind than a foggy one. So, my question to the others on this site traversing the same path as me is what can I tell myself to shut down those intrusive excuses when they present themselves?

Been lurking here for the past week and have found your stories inspiring.

I am 37, started smoking when I was 17. Since then, I‚Äôve taken a few breaks, with the longest about a year. I am a grad student and for the past two years, writing my thesis, I started drinking a lot of espressos (and caffeine pills) and using cannabis to curb the edginess. Finally, during lockdown my mind and body had had enough and I had some health-related panic attacks. It is now my 8th day having quit, not only weed, but also cigarettes.

To say that I feel dumb and triggered to smoke when I‚Äôve sat down to work on my thesis is an understatement. I have had to call a recovery hotline at least once a day just to keep myself in check.

I am glad there is a community here for people who want to get better, and allow their body and mind to heal. If you‚Äôre struggling today, take it one day, one hour, one minute at a time. I am rooting for you.

The craving wasn‚Äôt as hard as I thought it would be. Actually I don‚Äôt have any craving for now even though weed was my problem solver all the time. I‚Äòm more frustrated than before and things do hit me hard. 
For example my cousin visited me and I did not know she‚Äôs a conspiracy theorist which fucked my mind pretty much. 
Plus one of my best friends is an alcoholic who had just gotten out of rehab and thinks he can go on like before and is willing to lose his second home. Yeah these things fuck my mind pretty much but I didn‚Äôt even think about weed to forget that shit. It‚Äôs not my shit, it‚Äôs their shit. I got my own problems and yeah it hurts pretty much to see other people struggling with their lifes.
I started making music again. I mean I wanna end my unfinished tracks now and I just had this idea to use the vocals of this black guy that tells a woman to go to another (restaurant?) hotel because she called him a f‚Äòn n****r while he was on the phone. ‚ÄûIt‚Äôs above me now‚Äú. If you‚Äôre often on reddit you may know this video I‚Äòm talking about. Gonna work on that track until it‚Äôs finished. It‚Äôs the thing that was missing in this ‚Äûalmost finished track‚Äú. My plan is to get it done by the weekend.
Plus I updated my bandcamp page with new photos and finally uploaded a track that‚Äôs been in the waiting line for so long. Nope, i‚Äòm not famous and I will probably never be famous. I don‚Äôt have a single follower yet but I wanna be a music artist again and make someone happy with my music. 
My dreams are still weird sometimes but I like it.

Well.. I‚Äôm very much regretting doing that as the first thread I see is about someone experiencing PAWS (I‚Äôd never heard of it before) 3 months after quitting. The comments were full of people experiencing the same, some up to years later. I then found other threads saying the same thing. What the actual fuck!? How bloody common is this? I have to say this is freaking me out big time, I‚Äôm genuinely scared of feeling like I am now for months or years to come. No doubt my current mental state is contributing to my reaction, but still this is heavy. 

Part of the reason I‚Äôm so scared of this PAWS thing is that I work as a construction contractor and have an incredibly huge project coming up in 2 and a half months time. It was a big reason for my quitting, and I thought I‚Äôd given myself plenty of time to be well and truly withdrawn from MJ in order to be functioning 100 percent by then.

These three months have been, I guess, the happiest time of my life. At the time I decided to quit weed my life was in ruins, and I'm still in the process of building something new on top of them, but now I have a direction in life. I'm going to brag a bit - I don't usually do this, but I think could be motivating to those who think life will never get better after weed abuse.

I'm smarter than ever. It's objective - I've picked up coding, I'm attending a selection stage to get into a prestigious coding school, and currently I'm in conditions that require extremely fast and logical thinking and learning. It has been so for almost a month. And hell, I'm enjoying it so much. My head works at a 1000% of what it was like when I smoked weed daily. I'm spending up to 15 hours a day at school and barely get tired, I've learned so much in a month and finally know what to do for the rest of my life.

I'm more open than ever. I've always been pretty reserved, but now the feeling of shame of myself and desire to stay in the comfort zone turned into... uh, coolness I guess? I mean I'm just chill now, energetic when needed and always happy to maintain a conversation I find interesting. It's super easy to talk to people now - feels like social awkwardness cured itself. I do still cringe at myself sometimes, but to a much healthier extent. And I've got so many new friendships now.

I'm more energetic than ever before. I mean, it's easy to be energetic when your whole 24-hour cycle is occupied with something you love (or transportation), but I've got so much mental and physical resources now that I can't even compare my current self to the lazy and slow stoner I used to be.

I've got so much more healthy habits. And I got rid of so many unhealthy ones. I take showers a lot more often, I brush my teeth everyday. For some reason I got rid of a nasty habit of thinking ""I wanna die"" in every situation I find uncomfortable. I mean, it wasn't a habit as much as an unhealthy compulsion, but still, somehow it almost vanished.

I'm so much happier. If I start my day right, in the morning I get this warm fuzzy mdma-like feeling that lasts almost the whole day and gives me strength to power through anything. I'm free, I know what to do with myself, I'm not alone, I'm strong and young enough to try new things in life.

All this would be unimaginable if I kept on smoking weed every day. I'm proud of myself for dropping this detrimental habit. As I've said before, one day I'm going to smoke again, but it's not before I'm content with what I've achieved, and that's not going to be the case for the next years.",14,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9920737743377686}"

I started smoking when I was 14. I was partying, drinking and doing all other kinds of substances and I started to develop bad habits in my life, but nothing as big as weed 'routine'. 

Through out the time, I stopped with the drugs, alcohol and other substances but man can say, I became a functional stoner. I smoked in the morning, at noon, afternoon, before work / after work, evenings etc... I was getting stuff done, and I was very good at it. 

I was 21 when I met her, the love of my life - you can say. We moved together to another country, where she continued her school and I found a really great and responsible job (even learned a language and finished an education for that position). Just to add, the bad thing with weed is it drains you a day at the time and never enough to make you do a sudden change. I earned a good money and I thought, fuck it, I can do whatever I want because I am responsible and don't do much mistakes. So, I kept on going, but almost every night when she went to sleep I would smoke myself retarded and play video games, sometimes until the morning. It lasted for years, five more to be exact. I was ok with being bored to the point I became boring myself. I got fat, stopped working out and became barely a shadow of energetic young man I used to be. I was smoking more than 15 times a day. She even gave me subliminal hints that I should change, and she never gave up on me... Years passed.. Until one day... She had enough and she left me.

I sat all alone on a couch, and I smoked a bowl. A fat, lazy, paranoid f*ck as I was, and than it hit me - it was all my fault! I wrote a note ""I messed my entire life because I got high, sorry love ' and I was very aware it was my last bowl. I just kept reading that note over and over. 

I started to train hard, as soon as I cleared my head I placed my priorities straight. In 27 days I lost 15 kg of fat and gained good amount of muscle. I was eating 2-3 kg of turkey breasts a day and training as a lunatic, while crying out of an anger and dissapointment towards myself. 
The best part is - after 20 days my GF came back, we spoke honestly, and for the first time in 14 years I see clear and I can tell you that I needed that slap from life, or universe, or God... Whatever you want to call it, I got my second chance and I don't plan to blow it. 

I am today on the 27th day and I don't plan to smoke ever again.

However, in the end, they are only in my way most of the time and I don't really need them??.

I was racking my brain, because I had never experienced these terrible symptoms when taking a break before.  The difference?  I recently started using oil cartridges heavily for about a month.  Never has my body developed a physical dependence this fast.  I'm done with them.  I told my girlfriend to throw out my pen and remaining cartridges while I detox at my parent's place (so they can watch me while she's at work, that's how sick I felt).  I was waking up freezing every morning until I smoked.  Luckily, I'm just a little cold now and hopefully this continues to get better.  

Oil can RUIN your body's ability to regulate internal temperature.  Marijuana is known inhibit thermoregulation (internal body temperature control).  Now imagine that, but way more concentrated.  I'm done with it.  Never again.  My girlfriend hit the carts only a few times and even SHE had difficulty breathing, coughing, shortness of breath, etc. that ALL went away after she stopped smoking.  Humans can find a way to make something ""safe"" extremely unsafe.  

I'm not going to tell anyone what to do, but I highly recommend avoiding oil carts.  The way they work, you are not inhaling pure vapor.  You are getting that terrible oil as well which can BURN YOUR LUNGS.  You don't know what chemicals those companies put in there, and there are stories coming out all the time about hospitalizations due to oil carts being laced with chemicals (companies do this to make them more addictive).  It's the same thing the cigarette industry did and you better believe even LEGAL marijuana dispensaries will follow suit if it means more money and reduced costs. 

I tried to avoid breaking rules with this post.  I just wanted to bring my experience and what I learned from research so hopefully others decide to quit.  Boy, am I starting to feel good from being clean.  Yea, oil carts are highly dangerous and I'm never going back.",5,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9979573488235474}"

I just finished college and was actually able to land a job despite my shitty habit and current times, but I have aspirations that I think of when I‚Äôm sober at work but I never act on them because of my smoking habit at home. I don‚Äôt know if it was early onset CHS or a bad strain that caused the sick feeling, but either way I am going to use it as a catalyst to quit. I smashed my bong last night out of overall frustration, tossed all of my remaining weed and paraphernalia, and watched it get taken away this morning, a bit sad but content with my decision.

Everyone on here, if you‚Äôve been clean for 1 year, 1 day, or even 1 hour, each and every one of you are an inspiration to all of us who have begun our journeys to quit. Just reading through this sub makes me motivated more than you can even believe. I read somewhere that abstinence isn‚Äôt one huge decision, but a continuous string of small decisions, each one farther apart from the last. And I really resonate with that. This first month will probably be difficult, but it only gets easier from here. If you read this I hope you have a great weed-free day!",2,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.8171600699424744}"

I had a new friend die skydiving (this is surprisingly extremely rare). When he died I had so many emotions running through me and all I wanted to do was just ""turn off"". No sport or activity could do that for me and I needed a break from life. After quitting on Jan 7, 2020 I had occasional flareups, but never went through with it.

Once I did, I knew I needed to throw it away because I was enjoying it too much - so I did. But, I kept going back to the same garbage can and picking it up like I was a zombie. The whole time telling myself that this is a bad idea, but not stopping. I thought that that 1/8 would be my last and didn't intend on picking up more, but walking down the street someone was selling. He was smoking a joint and offered it at the crosswalk while I waited for the light. I ended up smoking the whole thing and then buying another 1/8. 

Over the weekend, my dog had to go to the vet at 3am and I couldn't pay for 100% of the things she needed. Had I had that extra money I had spent on the 1/8th and joint, I would have had enough to pay for her medical bill. It was so embarrassing that I had to pay the last $2.50 on my bill in loose car change...

Because I've done this. Smoked heavily for very long times then quit for decent amount of time , multiple times.

The first time I did it I didn't even know weed withdrawel was a thing and was convinced I was insane. Ended up at the doctors and had a breakdown Infront of him.

Second time I had the same stuff happened but realis d it was the weed withdrawel. 100 % would have caved in if I could get weed but during this quit attempt I couldn't get any so all good.

Third time I quit , I was prepared that I might feel weird when I stopped. I felt just as grim as the second time , but knowing what it was and feeling like ""you've done this before bro"" made it easier.

Fourth time I quit , I knew I'd feel weird. Planned in advance . Quit when I had a couple weeks off work. Remembered what helped me the other times of quitting such as dont eat huge meals , don't eat too healthy thus often low calorie. Just eat things like steak mash potato and vegetables. Good holesome food (as much of it when you can , apetitie is always hard ) maybe make that meal and just pick at it throughout the day.
But definately wasn't as hard.

So now I'm on my 5th attempt. Hour like 20 . Feel exhausted and sweaty and diarrhea but does feel like it's.not so hard. If I have a negative thought , I don't really pay it any attention. It may be a real thought I'm having but it's most likely weed withdraw so I'm just ignoring them. But over all , don't feel too bad.

If first time I quit was 9/10 bad , this feels like a 6.

Hi, my name is Steven im a USN veteran(not that im proud of that) im 23 and from Puerto Rico. I‚Äôve tried to quit about 5 times and i always go back. The longest i‚Äôve went without smoking was about 2 months and the only reason i was able to do so was because i needed a job desperately (i was moving in wt my girl back in my hometown in Puerto Rico). Anxiety always becomes too unbearable and i start having ‚Äúromanticizing‚Äù memories about weed meaning i forget about the bad stuff and only remember how good it felt to smoke. Having to feel like absolutely diarrhea for so long for little to no change really disgruntles the crap out of me and makes me start smoking again. life without weed just feels extremely boring man. Also, I suffer from anxiety and have previously been diagnosed with depression so my mental health really isn‚Äôt that great which obviously doesn‚Äôt help at all. I also have a problem with porn, cellphone use and basically anything that gives me a dopamine boost. I‚Äôm always looking for a way out of reality because i cant handle my anxiety and life challenges.

I'm 24, I used to smoke heavily from when I was 16 to 23. 

I managed to quit in December 2018. I wanted to quit and was about to go on holiday for a month so it felt like a good time to do it. Here I am going to quote a bit of text I have in my journal from when I quit :

>*When I quit, it activated my feelings again, my fears and anger, all of it. I had dreadful nightmares for about a month, the first two weeks were the worst as the bad dreams occurred every night and would sometimes woke me up. I would sweat a lot too.*

I was really irritable, difficult to cope with. In February 2019 I contacted a therapist to work on social anxiety (this anxiety appeared after I quit smoking). It was really hard for me to go out and I felt like everyone was looking at me, it wasn't nice. I went to therapy during the whole year. 

**Now to the most recent things.** I was sober for 15 months and in February a friend asked me to take care of her houseplants while she was going to India for a month and a half. she was meant to me back at the end of March and I would stay at her place most of the time as she has a thirsty hibiscus that needs water pretty much everyday. At the end of March her flight was cancelled due to Covid, and she asked me to find her insurance documents to see if she could be brought back home by them. I checked her drawers to find the documents, I did, and I also found a baggie with about 50$ worth of weed. I left it there for a few days and as the days went by I found myself more and more attracted to this drawer. In April, as my friend was still in India and covid was hitting us in the face, I smoked a joint from the baggie, long story short, I smoked the whole bag before my friend came back. I then had to find more to replace what I had smoked so I contacted a friend, and I got 50$ to replace what I had smoked and the same for myself, thinking ""I will be fine, I only smoke a tiny bit and not even everyday"".. I started smoking more and by July I was back to my ""old stoner self"", I felt like nothing really happened since I quit, like everything I had done had been useless. 

A lot of good things happened in my life this year and I am not able to enjoy them fully as I am now addicted again. So two days ago I decided to quit again and here I am. 

I am still seeing my therapist but she doesn't know much about addiction, my mum is coming to my place for 2 weeks holidays in 10 days and on the 31st, I am leaving with her and going on holiday for a month. History repeats itself but I don't want to experience the worst part of the symptoms when she is here so that is why I decided to quit now.

I have been smoking daily since I was around the age of 16. I‚Äôm 22 now and over the last 3 years I‚Äôve tried to quit multiple times and failed every time. But I‚Äôve realised it‚Äôs because every time I tried to quit I either:
1) told myself I was taking a break for a week (or other short period). The problem with that was that I find myself looking forward to the day I was allowed to smoke again and the craving never left.
2) told myself I‚Äôm quitting forever. The problem with that is that I convinced myself it‚Äôs impossible and gave in.

So I tried what‚Äôs in between. I committed to quitting for a year. I set a hard date - July 15th (about a month beforehand) as the day that I will do this. I smoked my brains out the couple days leading up to it, but I stuck to my commitment. In the days leading up to July 15th I‚Äôve realised I was reasoning more and more in my head the reasons why I wanted to quit. Health being the biggest factor (I smoked spliffs - a spliff is as bad as a pack of cigarettes). Lack of motivation to exercise. But also that I was spending such a disproportionate amount of time stoned compared to any other normal hobby. No one plays football or guitar for half the day every day, unless you‚Äôre a professional. 

I‚Äôm 3 weeks in now. 

I‚Äôve taken tolerance breaks before that were this long but as I mentioned before I was looking forward to the end date and the cravings didn‚Äôt go away. Also these tolerance breaks were on family holidays, where I had a change in environment and family pressure keeping my mind off it. 

This time I quit whilst my social circles continued doing it around me (however one of my flatmates have quit with me on the same day and it has made it much easier). And I chose to replace smoking with going on walks (worked so well the first couple of days).

Now I‚Äôve started running. And I think I‚Äôve found my new obsession. I use strava - an app that really motivates you to challenge yourself. I started off nice and easy but every time you break your own records it rewards you. I‚Äôve seen myself consistently improve over the past 2 weeks and it has been so motivating for me to not pick up another joint.

I don‚Äôt even wanna touch it anymore. And I‚Äôve never felt better. I can see this being a very easy year. And I can see myself not even wanting to restart.

I hope my experience will help someone else. 

PS: I know it‚Äôs difficult to read people managing to quit while you are on the train, I was there myself. Don‚Äôt let this put you down if you haven‚Äôt managed to get off the train yet. It really is a marathon, not a sprint.

1. The brain fog is lifting! I can actually remember things I've been asked to do, and do them. I find myself singing along to songs and knowing all of the words... I had no idea my brain had memorised them for me, thank you brain.

2. My social anxiety is fading. I no longer jump when someone knocks at the door,  or feel the need to hide my stash quickly ""just in case it's my partners parents/my landlady"" because the stash no longer exists. And I'm sober, so I can actually talk to these people coherently.

3. My wit has returned. I'm so much sharper, and funnier than I ever was before. Why did I think sober people were boring when I was high? Love this sassy comedy queen emerging from me.

4. It helps that my hippy stoner friends live 200 miles away, but they visited yesterday, and didn't even spark up a spliff. We just drank tea and coffee, had some lunch, and caught up on everything. What wonderful friends they are üòä

5. Sleep is 1000% better, I actually feel rested for the first time in years. I'm still having vivid dreams, but I've been cocooning myself with nice things. I've found violent films, games and TV shows to be a massive trigger. I can't even watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer at the moment üòÖ I'm hoping it'll pass, but in the meantime I'll just be a massive softie.

6. My appetite is weird. I keep forgetting to eat, and then remembering, and the weight is dropping off of me. Food has just really lost its appeal (which is odd... About 5 years ago I really wanted to make a YouTube channel called BakedBaking üòÜ but it's illegal here, so I thought I'd best not. Point is, I generally love cooking and eating!) I've stocked up on soups and ready meals, so at least there is something half nutritious I can heat up fast. Hoping my appetite returns to some semblance of normal soon.

7. My brain isn't used to the rhythm of life anymore. I burn out so much faster than I used to. Still, it's nice to have 2 hours of focus out of 24, rather than 0. Also, my appetite being all over the place isn't helping this. Just gonna keep going and hope these last couple of things fall into place.

I am so triggered when people ask me about new hobbies I've learned in quarantine, or what I want to do with my life long term. The only thing I am certain about is that I want to smoke weed even though I rarely enjoy how I feel when I'm high. The other night I smoked a joint, and I could instantly tell I was having an anxious high. My thoughts were racing, and I tried to just get myself to fall asleep. As I was starting to drift off, I suddenly had the sensation that I could not breathe. I shot up in bed gasping for air, and I have never experienced true panic and fear like this before. My entire body was shaking uncontrollably until I drank water, walked around my house, and eventually fell asleep sitting up in bed. The next night I smoked again, and the same situation occurred. After consulting a physician, I know that these incidents were panic attacks.

Today is my third day not smoking, and as I lay in bed at night I am still finding my self ramping up with anxiety, quickening breathing, and the fear of not being able to breathe but this sensation is not comparable to the panic attacks while high I had on Thurs/Fri last week. I feel like this is my body literally rejecting weed and telling me to WAKE up and change my life. I'm posting on here for accountability, but I'm curious if anyone else has had panic attacks from weed or a similar experience? Grateful that there are communities online of people encouraging true self-care and improvement, I'll be needing this. x",13,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9975214600563049}"

I'm really struggling to have some kind of sober dopamine boost. I can't treat myself to food or an occasional drink. I don't have a car and I'm sick of walking around my neighborhood. I'm starting to exercise, but my energy levels are still shit and on day three of basic home workouts, my knee is acting up again.

I've been reaching out to friends more, looping them into my journey. I'm trying to get a volunteer project related to my interest off the ground. Im reading a lot outside of work. But none of it feels good now. I know this isn't permanent but fuck. All of me feels broken. And I'm not feeling yet, so it's not like I can cry and just sit with my emotions. I just want to lay on bed and stare at my ceiling (I can't even lay on my sides/stomach bc of my stomach issues). The fiend voice keeps trying to throw me, 'don't solve all your problems at once, bring the bud back and solve your diet and sleep first'. I know that's horse shit so I'm holding strong. I have no desire to give into that after all of the shit cannabis has added to my life. I've started therapy. I'm not suicidal thankfully, but I do feel like I'm barely holding on to sanity.

I've never posted before - first time, but thought I would share my own experiences. 

I started smoking the ganja when I was around 27 - at first, it was just a weekly thing - and then it became a regular nightly thing and the next thing I knew, I was blazed all day, every day. It sucked bad!

I'm 38 now and have been a daily smoker (8/9 joints a day - with each joint containing 0.5g to 1g of weed) for the last 5 or 6 years or maybe more. I honestly cannot remember the last time I was clean and sober. 

6 days ago, I had my last joint ever. I admitted to myself that I am indeed an addict and it just needs to STOP. For GOOD. I can NEVER EVER touch weed again. EVER.

I had tried and failed so many times before - constant relapse. But this time, I think something snapped in my brain and I knew it was time to stop.

I am on Day 6 today and overall I feel okay. I'm surprised at how well this is going. 

Please note: One of the reasons I am having an easy time is because at the moment, my life is very peaceful - work wise (I have a steady job), family wise (no dramas). I don't have any external stressors compounding the withdrawal difficulties. 

But the one thing is that I'm so tired. Fatigue. That's the worst! I have zero motivation to do anything other than the things I need to do to remain alive, working and afloat. I guess this is all part of the recovery process - the body working hard to repair all the damage. 

I just thought I would share my story - as a person who started weed in their 20s and quitting in their 30s, because I haven't seen many of those stories.

One thing that really helped me was the mental preparation I went through before quitting. I knew I had to quit and I made a plan. I kept repeating in my head that I have to quit. That helped. And another thing that helped was DOING MY RESEARCH. Understanding what weed does to the brain. Understanding the withdrawal symptoms and preparing for them because I expect them. Understanding that its not going to be an overnight thing and I will have to FIGHT EVERY SINGLE DAY. I knew it was going to be uphill struggle - so when I quit, nothing came as a surprise that I couldn't deal with. 

When you quit - ensure you have time and space and SUPPORT - I highly recommend someone to talk to, who can understand what you're going through. That helps TREMENDOUSLY and I am grateful for a recent friend I talk to, who is also a recovering addict.

Please also remember, that YOU ARE NOT ALONE! 

If I can do this, so can you! 

Peace & love to all ... 

I hope my story can give someone strength and inspiration ....

To start off, I'll just share a little info here. My husband and I are finally READY to quit smoking pot. There, I said it! Not gonna lie, it makes me sad to read that. But again, we are finally ready I think. 

I'm about to be 27, he's about to be 28. I started smoking pot in my early teenage years, kept smoking until I got with my hubs, quit, and then we both started smoking. We've been heavy/daily users for at minimum 5 years straight. Like toke in the morning to get the day started, soon as we get home from work up until bed. It most definitely has had us in the green grip for quite some time. I'm not saying smoking is bad, hell I have loved smoking and everything that comes along with it. 

But we are ready to move forward with our lives, and to do so, it's gonna require us both to give it up with our career choices...

We've tried quitting before, but we just couldn't follow through with it. It's so HARD! We were able to quit smoking cigarettes with the help of weed, and that's coming up on 3 years ago. So now, time to quit smoking this as well üò¢üòÜ (I'm trying to keep a positive outlook haha) 

We struggle with the stomach issues more than the others... Loss of appetite, constant sour stomach, nothing tastes as good. That's what got us before, we just couldn't eat without it. Pepto helped some, but not much. 

I know a lot of it is in the mind, like keep telling yourself you got this and keeping in mind WHY we're quitting in the first place. But sometimes that's just not enough. 

So to all those out there who are going through this same situation, and to those who have already defeated the battle... any tips or advice on what helped you?",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9919074773788452}"

Really recommend getting as much exercise as you can if you‚Äôre trying to quit. I know everyone won‚Äôt be able to do that much and some can easily do a lot more but whatever you can I think is worth it

It‚Äôs benefiting me in 3 ways I can see

1. Health, the obvious one. I‚Äôve already taken 8mins of my 10k time and feeling my breathing improving already.

2. Motivation, now I‚Äôm not gonna say I‚Äôm gonna turn in to Mo Farah or anything like that but being able to see steady improvement already is giving me an added reason to not quit.

3. Managing Cravings/Help Sleep, the worst thing I find is when I‚Äôm just sitting doing nothing that‚Äôs when I‚Äôm really craving a joint keeping really active I find stops that. Now the sleep thing for me is just anecdotal at this point but I‚Äôve got to think the fact that I‚Äôm lying down at the end of day pretty exhausted is helping combat any insomnia I would otherwise have.

2020-08-03 14:42:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/i32t3p/lockdown_hit_me_hard/,Lockdown hit me hard.,"Hi all,

I posted on here just before 2020 started and I ended up in a really good place. I wasn't smoking regularly, I'd started to realise my goals again and I felt in control for the first time in years. I want this feeling back.

Prior to lockdown, I started to slip into old habbits again, smoking on weekends kinda thing. (For context purposes I smoked near enough every day from 16-26. I am now 27 years old.)

Then all of a sudden, covid-19 appears and nobody can leave, socialise or work. All of my distraction tools that I had were taken away and I'm not so sure why I did it, but I turned back to abusing canabis. This time, much heavier than I've previously smoked. Near enough an eighth of weed a day on my own, I literally cannot afford to live this way financially and that's not even the main reason I want to stop, just another reason why I have to.

I guess the point of this post is me asking if anyone else has had any similar experiences? Or how have other people dealt with addictions during lockdown? Any stories or experiences you may have are very welcomed as I really want to see the light at the end of this dark tunnel I keep rolling into.

Kind regards.",11,"{'lockdown': 3, 'covid': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9877810478210449}"

My biggest issue was anxiety in the morning upon waking up, and waking up in my sleep multiple times. Exercising was also very tough for the first 2 months, I would feel like I was going to pass out after basic shit like moving dirt bags in the garden

I haven't felt any anxiety in about a week and a half. I sometimes wake up from even the slightest of noises (guess I'm a light sleeper), but never with anxiety anymore. Certain situations I'm made aware of can stress me out somewhat and give me minor anxiety, but it's nothing like it was before where I would get anxiety randomly in the middle of the day. First month or two it would linger for like 1-2 hours at times too.


For exercising I basically walked on the treadmill at speed 2 out of 10 for 2 months for about 18-22 mins, and I would feel somewhat sick/slightly nauseous afterwards. Now, I go on for 25-30 mins and mix in 5 mins total jogging. I don't feel like there's ice in my chest when I'm done jogging now, I just feel the tiredness of it - still need to catch my breath but there's no real physical ""my lungs are fucked"" feeling. Which is a very big relief in itself. Slowly working my way up there

My mucus issues are ENTIRELY gone. I had these the entire time I was smoking weed - every morning, was hocking up loogies out the ass to clear my throat out. Doctors diagnosed me with postnasal drip, turns out it was probably just my lungs trying to clear mucus out from smoking every night 

Went to the doctor for a physical exam few weeks back, everything was OK. Had my blood drawn, tested high for blood sugar and white blood cells - on a retest the WBC count was back to normal and sugar was slightly over normal reading, but A1C test ruled me out for diabetes. Heart rate was still a little high every time they tested it but it's fine at home (maybe nerves from going to the doctor and I do have some social anxiety). Had a chest xray one as well and everything looked normal. So it would seem the PAWS isn't affecting my organs anymore

My only real issue left is the stomach - have had bad digestive issues since I started smoking, but it could be unrelated. It's gotten better lately (no more munchies and i eat smaller portions, and rarely before bed now whereas before it was munchies city before bed every night), but going to see a gastro doctor for the first time next week to get examined. Maybe it's PAWS, but probably not

Feel like I am definitely in a better spot than I was 3 months ago and for a while I felt like I had the onset of cancer or something, it was rough. But I feel like this shit is finally on the end of working it's way out of my system and it makes me happy :)",24,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9944384098052979}"

im 17 and ive been smoking/consuming since 4th grade, so i was around 10 or 11. at first it started with drinking the gross oil, then started smoking when i was around 12 out of pipes and bongs, and now i think im addicted to dab and carts. my mom has always known, shes the one who got me into it. (yeah i know, that sounds awful and it is awful, she still knows) i really hope she doesnt somehow find this because she has reddit and isnt new to the app and how it works. ive never even considered quitting until i met my girlfriend, ill call her m.

we end up together, i wont spare you the painful details of having to cut ties with the partners we didnt love at the time. it was a bit of a shitshow. mind you, we were both 13 when we met, and got together within 5 days of meeting online. there are alot of details.

i was openly using when we got together, mostly weed, but also mushrooms and alcohol sometimes. i could tell m didnt like it. i was such a douchebag back then, i honestly dont know why the fuck she stayed with me. she tells me that ""she saw the good in me"" and ""she knew you would turn out okay""

i guess turning out okay means lying to your girlfriend about being sober since september. i feel like an absolute pile of dog shit. shes going through a rough patch with her family right now and shes been staying in humboltd with her family (yes i know that sounds sketchy but shes staying there for a little while so her parents can figure out if theyre getting a divorce or not, which we're pretty sure they arent, it would be a good thing if they did) she would never cheat on anybody, especially me, she has too much respect for me... i dont deserve that respect.

i don't know what to do. im currently laying in bed with a cart in my hand, wanting so desperately to go downstairs and grab the pen, i feel so fucking guilty. people on here have told me i have to come clean before she finds out - i know she wont. we still live with our families, we only see eachother when its planned, and our visits are like 1-3 hour hang outs at her house when her mom is there. i even smoke before going to her house. i dont make it obvious of course, also im just naturally slow, i have slow brain.

sorry this is so long, i could go on about how horrible i feel, i know i wont stop. ive been thinking once i finish this cartridge ill actually try and stop. but i dont know. i havent really tried to express my feelings through an app before until yesterday.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9987447261810303}"

I've tried many times never to make it more than 2 weeks, so this is significant for me. My partner still uses weed, and I'm able to be around her without breaking or having that desire increase. It doesn't bother me that she does, I'm not asking her to quit. She knows my struggle with it and is happy I've come so far.

I have a tracker, and I think that's helped, but the reasons I wanted to quit, to start pursuing what were once my passions again, haven't come easy. I still find myself wasting the days, emotionally crippled, but stuck in those emotions instead of seeking the temporary break through a hit off the bong. I'm currently stuck in our apartment, in a new country I lack any status in. The application is submitted and we just need to wait, but I truly have no obligations at the moment, yet I still struggle to do even the basics.

I don't feed myself often, I really only clean up for my partner because she likes it that way, and that's only just barely, and all I really do is browse the web and get into waaay more fights online. I never liked who I am sober, and I thought the high version of myself was a more pleasant person, more like who I want to be. I think weed actually helped me a lot in my neuroses, but only for a while before it became the cause of different ones. Now I am back to the person I dislike, a depressed, unproductive slug who can't even do the things I thought I wanted to do. The sense of failure is driving me to want to get high again. It won't make me who I want, I know, but it always helped me not mind that I am a failure.

I just keep saying what. That happened about 3 or 4 times, i swear to god it was a hallucination he didnt say what i heard.

I thought that by now all of the withdrawals would be over and that I would be back to my pre-smoking self, but that just hasn't been the case. 

I thought that stopping smoking would be easy, but that was proven wrong when I was hospitalised for Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome, and then for severe withdrawals, I was vomiting every meal back up for almost two weeks. 

Following that, I had a complete psychological breakdown and ended up in the psych ward. 

Once I came out of the hospital, my anxiety was ridiculously intense. 

I had to move out of my partner and I's house because he was still smoking at the house and there's no way I could be around it, our relationship has been strained. 

The nausea is still ongoing, my anxiety is still high. I don't really get much REM sleep and almost no deep sleep, so I am constantly tired ALL THE TIME. I still have regular cravings almost every day, but no relapse. 

But, I'm eating regularly throughout the day, I do sleep every night, even if it's just light sleep. I managed to go and get a haircut despite my intense levels of anxiety. I can remember things slightly better and my attention span is longer than a few seconds, before getting bored and stopping paying attention.

I have been smoking every day for the better part of the last 4 years - save for the many times I tried to kick the habit, which never lasted more than a week or so.

Since COVID, I knew I would have to monitor the habit, lest it get really out of control again, and I was doing a pretty good job of tracking my usage and even skipping days here and there for a couple months. But with the anxiety and depression I already had + COVID anxiety, things got out of hand again.

I get migraines fairly regularly - part of the reason I formed the habit in the first place - and they sometimes make me throw up. Some of you may know this, but chronic weed use can cause episodes of vomiting that don't like to stop on their own. Both of these facts coupled mean I have been hospitalized for this multiple times. I have known for a couple years that my weed-smoking is part of the problem, but still haven't been able to stop.

Guys, I am so. tired. And I want to stop. I don't want to feel trapped in the habit anymore. I don't know if it will be for forever - I'm just trying to take it day-by-day. My anxiety and depression are getting worse, and part of the problem is knowing I'm not taking care of myself properly. So I'm here for support, like-mindedness, any help I can get.

It‚Äôs been a fun 4 years, I fucking love weed. But I hate how lazy, unmotivated and how emotionally dumb I am. Most of the time I‚Äôd rather not feel anything then have to deal with real life. 

I depended on weed for everything. To eat, to exercise, to go to work, to deal with family shit, when I was bored, when I hung out with friends. My go to thing was to get high and I enjoyed the shit out of it. Weed and getting high became a security blanket for me and just the thought of quitting gave me major anxiety. 

But then a friend of mine overdosed on laced coke and passed away but no amount of weed helped. I was just getting depressed af whenever I smoked since all I could think about was that the last time I saw her was at another friends funeral and I just felt like shit all the fucking time. But I did what I do best, ignore the problem push it to the back of my mind and use weed to cover up the wounds. 

I had school, work and family emergencies to keep me busy. But then COVID-19 happened I don‚Äôt wanna get into it but I have to move back to my home country where a gram of weed gets you serious jail time. I‚Äôm not even quitting weed because I want to. I definitely realize I smoke to an unhealthy amount and that I‚Äôm addicted but I like my security blanket. It‚Äôs Irrational and silly when I type this out but weed has been there for me when I thought I had no one else to talk to. 

But I‚Äôm not about to risk my life for a stupid plant. I refuse to put myself or my family in danger just Bc I‚Äôd rather not communicate with professionals that I need help. I fucking hate asking for help, it makes me feel weak and ashamed that I can‚Äôt figure my own shit out on my own but I need to get over it and realize everyone needs helps sometimes. 

I‚Äôve been looking on this sub on and off for a year now and some of the stuff you guys said helped me with the withdrawals symptoms and just taking the first step of throwing weed away so thank you to everyone who ever posted on this sub in the past year. 

This is my first week 100% clean no weed and it‚Äôs been hell, I‚Äôve been throwing up A LOT and nauseous at LITERALLY everything.

I‚Äôm not going to ruing my life just because I can‚Äôt cope like normal adult. 

I‚Äôm 23 years old now, literally the rest of my life to look forward so I guess this is my venting break up letter with weed. I can‚Äôt do this anymore it‚Äôs going to destroy my future and I refuse to let put myself in a situation where It will literally ruin my life if I get caught.

I‚Äôd like to share my story about how I quit more than once, this time on my day 9

It was a daily thing, spent lots of money even though that‚Äôs not an issue for me, got a great job and some other side business. I was allowing myself to vape (1g carts 80%+) daily these carts lasted 3 or 4 days, so convenient and easy to hide and why not, I got a stable job great income but I was spending $600+ per week( yes legal weed in NorCal is expensive AF)

I was not myself and until my SO told me that I started to take this shit seriously.

Anyways last time I was able to quit for 70days until the Covid thing started. Then I was so bored and anxious and I said yeah why not let‚Äôs take a 10mg edible and I relapsed on day 4 or 5 made my first order, two 1g carts like the old habit. 

I was having bad panic attacks and some more other symptoms but I was like yeah this thing is normal until I gain more tolerance and that was for 3 or 4 months until I said ok this is it triggered by the worst ever panic attack (was taking a shower and suddenly started to listen some sort of voices/noises then I listened to my brother who passed away last year) my heart was racing at this point.

I started to cut the intake and using only edibles with precise doses and went from 100mg the first day to 0 when I started to count my clean days.

First 5 days were super crappy, wasn‚Äôt able to concentrate, even went with the doctor because a weird chest pain (nothing found maybe just a ton of anxiety) I was just carving to hit the pen all the time but what I did I was to throw away everything.

Today on day 9 I feel a lot of energy but still some other symptoms are there slowly fading though.

Worth noting that I‚Äôm doing cardio daily 45 minutes at high intensity (peloton bike).

It was a good ride but I‚Äôm moving on with my life now. üòÅ,"  I‚Äôm usually just a lurker but I thought sharing my experience might help someone else so here I am. I smoked daily for the good part of two years, and it was great I was able to unwind and relax at the end of the day and drift off to a peaceful sleep. 

  The problems started when I had to stay home for the majority of the time due to COVID (student on summer break). During this time, I was going to be staying with my parents who aren‚Äôt very drug friendly so I was planning on quitting but after a couple weeks of being sober, I was looking for a fix again. I couldn‚Äôt smoke anymore since I was now living with my conservative family and it would be too obvious. I was looking for ways I could get high and I saw that edibles would be a discreet way I could. One thing led to another and I was now hiding edibles in my room and starting my day off by getting high. So the days went by like this, with me stoned in my room watching movies and playing video games and laying in bed all day. 

  Then things got even worse. I was a porn addict but I managed to get it under control by replacing it with a good habit of working out and even managed to start dating a bit which was the main part of my life that the porn addiction was affecting. Flash forward back to the beginning of quarantine, I was spending my days high as a kite and as many of you might have experienced it quickly gets boring and you have to do more and more to get that dopamine rush. This was the perfect storm for my porn addiction to come roaring back and now I was getting high and watching porn multiple times a day. The months went on like this in a blur, and one day I saw the date and I couldn‚Äôt believe that it had been almost 4 months. I was consuming an ungodly amount of edibles and spending hundreds of dollars a month. I barely spoke to any of my friends during this time and often ignored their attempts to reach out since I was too busy getting high. 

  I realized that this had to stop and this wasn‚Äôt the person I wanted to be, and started searching for help online on how to get my life back on track. This subreddit was a great help, I saw the stories of so many people who took back control of their lives from weed and decided that enough was enough. It‚Äôs now been 4 days that I‚Äôve been sober and today I even went out and went for a jog around the neighborhood. My biggest challenge has been that I haven‚Äôt been able to fall asleep, I‚Äôve been sleeping 3-4 hours a day on average. (If anyone has dealt with this, please tell me what worked for you). I‚Äôm still going strong though, and I know I can keep going with all the support this community provides. To anyone else dealing with similar problems, I hope my story helps you on your journey of staying sober. I‚Äôm here along with the rest of this subreddit to support you.

I decided to quit weed 2 weeks ago (cold turkey) and I tried quitting cigarettes but I found quitting both too hard so I ended up cutting back the cigarettes by half of what I'm used too.

I've been trying to quit for a couple of months but the straw that broke the camels back was when my parents caught my youngest brother smoking weed. He basically said ""what about my big brother he keeps smoking weed"" and that ended up breaking me and became the primary motivator for me quitting. 

It's been 2 weeks now, and although the insomnia and lack of appetite aren't as bad as the first couple of weeks, my mood swings are pretty bad. I don't know but I think me living on my own and being isolated for weeks at a time with very minimal communication (this is during COVID) have made me pretty unstable unfortunately. I had a fight with my mom yesterday and I said things to her that I've never said and ended up devastated her. This almost led me to reusing again, with the excuse being ""I'd rather harm myself with my addiction than harm my family"". Luckily I came across this subreddit which saved me last second from buying weed again (I live in Canada so I can get weed almost immediately to satisfy my cravings). 

I don't have many friends to talk to so just reading this subreddit and knowing I wasn't struggling alone was pretty helpful, so I just wanted to say thanks.",4,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9952333569526672}"

Started smoking at 16. I made my first attempt at quitting weed at 21. Made it 9 months. Ended up getting back on again. Been trying to quit ever since, but always come back after a month or two. Am 25 now.

Today is my first day smoke-free. I had smoked 3-4 grams a day for the past 5 months before this. And honestly, I feel fine right now. 

It feels like if you quit weed before, it is easier to deal with the physical withdrawals the second time coming. 

THE BIG PROBLEM for me is after a month or two of being sober. I become extremely bored and always refute to getting back to smoking.


Last time I started up smoking was because of the Corona outbreak back in March. I had lost my job, and the public was told to stay indoors. I was already hella bored, but now I had to stay at home all the time and I had no job? Of course I started smoking again.

Now it's 2nd of August and I am giving it another attempt at quitting. Now the Corona outbreak has died down a little bit, so going out in public isn't as frowned-upon anymore. Which makes it a good time to quit for me. 

I am hoping I can make a lifestyle that doesn't bore the living shit out of me this time around. Thanks for letting me share",1,{'rona': 2},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.7767780423164368}"

While weed essentially solves problems like boredom, or acts as a lubricant for certain social situations (especially because I do not drink alcohol and refuse to because of traumatic experiences with it), it also makes me feel mentally incapacitated, creates social anxiety, as well as decimating my short term memory which in turn makes my ADHD and OCD worse. On top of the above listed mental side effects, I have also come to terms with the physical side effects of smoking weed, take for example the accumulation of tar in the lungs, bronchitis, sinusitis, etc.

Because of all above listed negative effects I have came to the conclusion that weed is something that negatively effects my life and potential, therefore it is in my best interest to remove the habit from my life.

I have quit weed or devised a plan to leave behind the pungent flower more times than I can remember. The longest I have quit smoking for was three months, however this was at a time in which I very much enjoyed smoking and was involuntarily forced to quit through a probation mandated drug testing program. Voluntarily I have gotten as far as two months before giving in. 

Smoking has become something I do almost every day at this point, yet, everyday I have the thought and even urge to quit. The activity of smoking weed has become such an integral part of my life that it is a baseline activity to do with friends and has even become something I use to alter/influence my hobbies.

I also feel that smoking weed is tethering me in a mental purgatory in which I am too lethargic to begin taking steps towards my goals, and whatever progress I make is insubstantial compared to what I can accomplish with a sober mind.

Just today,  I reconnected with a close friend I have not seen in a while. This particular friend is by all means a chronic smoker/stoner and the main premise upon which our friendship was founded on is smoking weed. I asked if he wanted to smoke and he told me he quit smoking and is several weeks sober, this was surprising to me considering how much I know this individual to cherish ganja. His reasons for quitting were similar to mine, so I personally understood why he had made the decision. 

In all honesty, this has inspired me to quit myself. I am fed up with the consequences of chronic smoking, and I know deep down that it is holding me back. Today is my first day sober in a couple of weeks, I am just going to take it one day at a time, regress from my bad habits and reinforce new ones that actually contribute to my overall wellbeing.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.995542585849762}"

That being said, being honest about the drawbacks and the reasons why we‚Äôre NOT going back is good too. 

Am I making sense?

I just think there‚Äôs so many ways to look at everything, rather than rejecting and hating the old stoner ‚Äúidentity,‚Äù transcending it and taking with you the good and valuable memories and experiences you gleaned while smoking.

 After reading several posts from here i felt like i wasnt alone in this and it gave me the motivation to stop smoking in order to pursuit a better life for me. 
 Anyway, i have been a heavy smoker since im 18 smoking around almost a gram a day. It started getting worse after my father died and the girl i had a crush on didnt want nothing to do with me, smoking was like a way of escaping a really hard reality. It eventually got to a point where the only thing i could think of was how much time left  until i can smoke my next joint
I would woke up, pretend i was asleep until my mum went to work and the second later she closed the door i would ran up to my stash and started rolling.
At first it felt really good, until it started to become a routine and i got trapped in it. Sometimes i didnt want to smoke but it felt like my body was on auto-pilot.

Im about to turn 21 in september, and i felt like these past 3 years i have no deep memories or new connections with anyone  just glimpses of true happiness that fade away as the high ends. 
My academic performance is way under average and i feel like everyone around me is dissapointed with my behaviour. 

Even though i spended hours reading and listening to podcasts, videos and articles about addiction in particular marijuna addiction  and how to end it i got to admit that its being way harded than i tought. 
The reason why im writing this was to distract my mind from the boredom and overthinking im currently strugling with. 
I hope everyone here can overcome their fears and be proud of who they are.

I can go through a .5g vape cart every day,  and that‚Äôs while trying to quit / moderate my use.  I could probably use a 1g cart per day if I hadn‚Äôt been playing a game of tug o war with my trying to stop.   I‚Äôd Wake up and hit the pen. It is the first thing I‚Äôve done for the last 2 years to soothe my uncontrollable emotions

I Downloaded that grounded app.  Having the ability to visualize how much I‚Äôm saving is a huge help. 

Additionally I have been reading ‚ÄúA Liberated Mind‚Äù at the recommendation of my therapist to treat my BPD but I find it informative for all things regarding our inner dictator and how they control our actions based on our thoughts and internal rules that even we ourselves arnt fully aware about. 

I‚Äôve come to learn that by telling myself over and over ‚ÄúI NEED to quit for reasons X,Y,Z‚Äù I kept pushing myself back to using.  

I‚Äôd last a little bit, but repeating to myself:

‚Äúyou need to quit, you *NEED* to *QUIT*,  *YOU NEED TO QUIT*  made me actually hyperfocus on my cravings and I would always find myself driving back to the dispensary that same day. $50 in hand because the ‚ÄúDictator‚Äù was saying:

 ‚Äúyou *can‚Äôt* quit.  Look at you,  you‚Äôre a mess,  all this withdrawl? You clearly *cant* handle it.  go smoke a bowl and calm yourself down‚Äù

I‚Äôm attempting to pivot away thinking from ‚ÄúI NEED to quit / I NEED to smoke‚Äù.      

To ‚Äúvaping is an action I can choose to do or not to do based on my own decisions‚Äù  

Adopting this mindset (or attempting to,  I‚Äôm sure setbacks will come) has been pretty helpful.   I was cleaning up my computer desk and found a cart that hadn‚Äôt been entirely used.   Maybe a few hits left in it. Previous attempts I would have immediately thought ‚ÄúI NEED to stop‚Äù (instant cravings) ‚Äúso I‚Äôll just use this last bit... since I NEED to,  and I‚Äôm not spending any more money by using just this little bit‚Äù and hit the pen.

Finally feeling better,"I'm not feeling 100% great, but I am feeling wayy better than when I was stoned all the time. I'm actually feeling proud for the first time in a long time.

I had almost 1.5 years of abstinence last year before I decided that I could moderate again. I did moderate that first week, but then the second week it was back to daily smoking. All of a sudden, 10 months had passed and I realized I had to make a choice: smoke weed daily for the rest of my life or never smoke again. Of course, I've broken down my goals into smaller than that. Right now I'm taking it a day/week/month at a time. But I would be happy with never smoking again. I don't even like smoking in general, but it's the quickest, cheapest way to consume weed, so I did it against the wishes of my body. I even developed a smoker's cough from it! So I decided: no more.

The first night was SO hard to fall asleep. I got an AirBnB with my boyfriend, who's sober, and we just hung out all night. Around 4am though, the negative self-talk started to avalanche. I just kept beating myself up and crying. Thank god he was there to hold me even if I was disrupting his sleep. Yesterday I came to my friends vacant house, where I plan on staying until day 7. I was not hungry AT ALL yesterday, but I got some food which I immediately threw up. I force fed myself some handfuls of cheese before I went to bed because my arms and legs were shaking, and I was feeling lightheaded. I also realized I'd only drank about 8oz of water over the last 48 hours and I'd vomited earlier, so I drank as much water as I could tolerate and went to sleep. I got close to 8 hours and i actually DREAMED!

So I did not take care of myself at all those first two days, but this morning I woke up feeling motivated... and HUNGRY! I got some dunkin donuts coffee and breakfast and a donut. I usually don't eat sugar for breakfast, but I do consume sugar on a daily basis and realized I hadn't eaten any sugar in the past two days! Which, although it probably contributed to my feelings of malaise, is a good sign because when I would get high I would eat so many sugary snacks that I worried, if I kept down this path much longer, I would develop diabetes.

I know I am capable of maintaining long-term sobriety, because I've done it before, but I'm trying to manage myself properly these first few weeks while my neurotransmitters are leveling out. I get so irritable at my family, even when I was high, so it'll be a challenge not to snap at them. I tried to quit a few months ago, but on day 3 I lashed out at my brother so hard that I felt so ashamed and got high. So I am trying to avoid those feelings of shame because the only way I've trained myself to cope with that is to get high. I've blunted my feelings for so long, it'll be hard emotionally to adjust, but I know I can do it.

I was a daily user, and stopped smoking the moment I suspected I was pregnant. But now my pregnancy has been extremely difficult and my brain won‚Äôt let weed go as the ‚Äúcure-all‚Äù to any ailment that pops up. 

I lost 14lbs. during my first trimester due to severe morning sickness. My OBGYN prescribed a combination of Unisom and B6 to help with the nausea and my appetite, but I just kept thinking, ‚Äúpacking a tiny bowl would probably make me feel better...‚Äù YET I somehow pushed through it. I made it out of my first trimester sober and I‚Äôm so incredibly proud of myself for that. 

But today I‚Äôm having serious anxiety. Can‚Äôt stop crying for 5 hours type of anxiety. Financial anxiety that comes from a wonderful, affectionate spouse, who makes HUGE financial mistakes and then tries to sweep them under the rug out of shame‚Äî TIL he made a $5k mistake that we simply can‚Äôt afford...especially now that we‚Äôre expecting a baby and I was laid off (I‚Äôm a server).

My brain keeps trying to rationalize smoking. It keeps telling me that it‚Äôs better to smoke a tiny bit rather than put baby through so much stress. It‚Äôs better to smoke a tiny bit and pass the fuck out than cry and stress for hours and get very little sleep. And it‚Äôs so hard not to smoke. It‚Äôs so so so hard. I usually turn to my husband when I‚Äôm struggling, but since he‚Äôs the source of this anxiety, I don‚Äôt know where else to turn. 

I‚Äôm trying to read articles about how terrible smoking is for baby. I‚Äôve suffered 2 miscarriages before this (to be clear, I didn‚Äôt smoke at all during those pregnancies) so you‚Äôd think I‚Äôd have more fucking respect for this little baby girl‚Äôs life inside of me. I‚Äôve wanted a child for so long. A healthy child. I‚Äôm trying to be inspired by all the people on leaves who are able to quit without a human-being-reason-inside-of-them. I‚Äôm sad and overwhelmed and so ashamed and I don‚Äôt know how to cope so suddenly without my husband and without weed.",71,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9607495665550232}"

Interesting topic. Im 2 months sober today, and nearly slipped up last night by smoking but thankfully didn‚Äôt... i started thinking about how weed can still be used as a creative tool to adventure the brain, brainstorm new ideas, figure out new business plans or inventions, create more appealing art, etc you get the drift... 

My question is: Do you think, after quitting a toxic weed addiction that you can ever come back to smoking weed here and there just purely for creative visualisation?? I have plans for being able to invent/innovate/create new theories/methods/products that one day could change the world. Can i ever use weed again if im using it on a strict basis of doing these problem solving tasks and working on ideas? 

Or is it simply not worth going back to it.. 
I do not ever want to smoke weed full time again, or really ever for that fact... but i just think that it would be a great tool for me to use to open my mind ever now and then when trying to draw my creativity or new problem solving techniques out in my head. 
i open and honestly respect weed for being able to open up your mind to new problem solving capabilities, and triggering new creative ways of thinking. Im a bit disappointed i wont ever get to access this different level of creativity again though without smoking weed. Do i even need weed to reach those levels of creativity and innovative designs? Does it just come naturally? Is weed just a fake tool that people glorify that ‚Äúhelps‚Äù them come up with new ideas, when really it is actually possible to come up with the ideas without smoking weed? 

Id love to know everyones thoughts on this please... 

Do you use weed purely for the fact of creative visualisation and adventure? Did you have a toxic weed habit in the past and still use it now just for this sole reason of accessing new levels of creativity? Or is it all achievable by being sober as well? 

Thanks guys.",3,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.6246147751808167}"
2020-08-01 02:11:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/i1ni5q/how_cannabis_affects_me_and_why_i_want_to_stop/,How Cannabis affects me and why I want to stop," 

**Intro**

Hello, r/leaves, my name is Jay and this post I‚Äôm making is why I want to stop smoking cannabis and how my smoking habit has impacted my life. My intention is to stop smoking cannabis completely. I started smoking 3 years ago when I was 17 and I‚Äôm now 20 years old living on my own. 

**Why do I want to stop smoking?** 

Well, smoking has impacted me in multiple ways, currently, the main reasons are a connection to myself, social anxiety, brain fog, mental health, and better sleep quality. I also want to pursue my dreams and become the best version of myself possible. 

**Emotional Sensitivity** 

My connection to myself has taken a massive hit due to my smoking habit. What I mean by this is I don‚Äôt feel emotionally connected to myself or my music nearly as much. Even when those experiences were filled with sorrow, they were healing in so many other ways and I felt a greater sense of emotional maturity and connection to myself. I‚Äôve always had quite a depressive outlook on life and I have very good reasons to feel this way. When I smoke I get less of these meaningful moments and I struggle to work on myself and make changes towards a better life. I‚Äôm hoping to gain more opportunities to feel connected with myself when I stop smoking and the ability to not rely on smoking to escape my feelings. 

**Social Anxiety**

Social anxiety has been a massive issue way before I even started smoking. My upbringing has been pretty rough and school was harder. In 2014 when I was 14 school got too much for me to handle and I shut off completely. I just couldn‚Äôt cope with it, I wasn‚Äôt socialized well as a child and everything that‚Äôs happened sure didn‚Äôt help me. I started to attend therapy appointments and I was tested for all sorts of mental illnesses but ended up getting diagnosed with anxiety and clinical depression. It all got worse as time went on and by 2017 I ended up turning to smoking to deal with it. Obviously it didn‚Äôt work and ended up making everything much worse. Smoking drastically exacerbates my symptoms re-enforcing the perceptions. I struggle to address the problem due to smoking and because of those exacerbated symptoms, it seems unbeatable. 

**Brain Fog**

I just can‚Äôt think as clearly as I used to. It‚Äôs like a residual high without actually being high. My short term memory feels like it has taken a hit and I forget things quite frequently. I get disoriented quite often and sometimes have to take a 2nd take at an object because I think it‚Äôs something else. I‚Äôve started to struggle to follow along with videos and my attention span feels significantly reduced. Even tasks I used to enjoy like my music feel like a chore. For me the fog usually lasts for a few weeks after stopping but getting through those days of brain fog is difficult because smoking offers a quick self-destructive escape. But that causes the cycle to repeat. 

**Mental Health** 

My mental state feels very fragile. I notice that cannabis has brought up symptoms of depersonalization and derealization. I feel a lack of connection to myself, who I am, and where I‚Äôm going in life. Every now and then I get reminded of memories that feel so long ago that cause me to emotionally breakdown. That feeling of lack of connection isn‚Äôt pleasant and I‚Äôm definitely not content with being this way. It‚Äôs the same with the derealization. It feels like I‚Äôm watching life happen before my eyes, behind a glass window. Objects, places, and people who I know feel eerie and surreal. I‚Äôm not sure how to describe this feeling so I apologize if I haven‚Äôt done a good job of it. 

**Sleep quality** 

I sleep reasonably well and my sleep cycle is alright. I just feel very lethargic on a regular basis. Even if I get enough sleep. When I‚Äôve abstained in the past I feel like everything was easier and I had so much more energy to just do things. I could wake up feeling fresh without much resistance to get out of bed without that foggy feeling in my head. 

**Conclusion** 

This is my first post on r/leaves and this is a new Reddit account that I have made for the purpose of self-improvement by joining subreddits like this one. I have left out a lot of details in this post but I feel like I‚Äôve summarised how I feel my cannabis use has affected me and what I hope to achieve from stopping. I‚Äôve done a lot of work on myself over the past year but right now the thing I feel that is holding me back the most is my cannabis use. Congratulations to everyone who has had success with abstaining and I wish everyone else the best who have the intention of stopping.",33,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9904614090919495}"

My first real attempt got to 4 months out of the green time vortex, but I fell back in. 

During my sober months I thought that one smoke every 40 days was fine, and it was the first time. Obviously it was then every 30 days, then 20 days then five nights in a week then a month straight of nights and now here we are! 

I dont think I'll ever be able to control my use of this plant, abstinence is the only way for me. Though I can already feel my tricky nasty brain planning to use again in a few weeks to months. Just know that if you feel like quitting now and think you won't have a problem when you pick up again in a few months time, it WILL become  a problem all over again.
