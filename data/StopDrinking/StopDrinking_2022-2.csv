I meet them and I am met in return.

Long story short, if I didn’t have the money in my account by tomorrow, I’d be stuck without it till April, and I don’t have the money - I drank it all away all month. However, I’m 6 days sober. And still shaky in my stability. 

I *would* have had the money, but some stupid automatic payment for some silly thing went through at the least convenient time and drained my account tonight, and screwed me for having enough for health insurance tomorrow. And I felt so kicked while I’m down. It was just the last straw on this humongous pile of bullshit endlessly stacked on top of my totally chaotic, completely insane, messed up life rn. And it‘s all exactly the kind of thing I’d drank so much to deal with. 

And I will admit, I had this weak, dark, awful moment of ‘what is it all worth? I’m screwed anyways now. Life is just always going to keep ruining me and it’s of no matter whether or not I try to turn it around. I might as well just get drunk cuz it’s all my life’s good for.’ 

Then, I took a closer look at my account to see… the money had already come out for the health insurance days ago! I hadn’t noticed until now. And man, I jumped up and celebrated like I just won the world title of some sort. 

But that whole little emotional ride tipped me off to something important: when I have those kinds of feelings, I need to be patient, and still. I had come very close to making a stupid mistake there over something that resolved very quickly. And I find that comforting as well as concerning. Less concerning now that I’m aware of it. Comforting because next time I face those difficult emotions, I’ll remember how this turned out and how glad I was that I didn’t drink. 

I know it seem stupid to get so bent out of shape about that, but as I said, having health insurance is a big one for me or else I’m kinda screwed and on top of that I’m dealing with financial ruin, mental illness, family tragedy, food/shelter insecurity, loneliness, work-related stress etc. Everything’s just a mess now. 

But I’m glad I experienced those dark emotions. Because what I experienced right after was an important lesson that those terrible intensely negative emotions will arise sometimes - and it got me in tune with what they feel like, and what they really are under the surface. And it served as a reminder to keep in mind that when the chaos and fury and darkness come for me, I don’t have to let them take my hope away.

I joined this sub about 5 years ago .. 2017 late January .. 

I had been drinking heavily for 8 years at that point and loved drinking but was starting to realise I had a problem .. 

I was broke, scared, paranoid, REALLY LOST about how to live life .. 

I wanted many things from life - money, success, respect ... But I was broke, about to go to jail, die or something like that .. 

When I came here the phrase that I heard was, ""one day at a time"" .. And ""I will not drink with you"" .. 

Once I was here I knew I was home .. I never met people like me who loved alcohol but had a problem with it before .. 

After being here for 2 weeks I discovered that there was Alcoholics Anonymous near me (Asian country) .. They are everywhere! 

Today I'm sober 3 years. Not a drop for 3 years. 

- I got married 
- I have my first kid on the way (a baby girl) 
- I have my first car 
- I'm paying for my first house 
- I've kept a job for 5 years (MIRACLE) 
- I was retrenched last year but did not drink over it 

All this happened only because came to this sub and found AA as well .. I also did therapy to sort out some trauma .. 

Every day of the last 5 years have been hard work to recover .. That's why it's important to look at just today .. Just focus on these 24hrs in front of me and not pick to that first drink. Just do the next right things. Stay away from triggers (smokes, friends, bars) and stay close to positive/sober influences (better friends, exercise, hydrate, AA) 

I'm still an alcoholic .. I still love alcohol .. But I cannot touch that stuff because it's poison to me .. 

However I want to give you hope .. 

There is life after alcohol! Fun, joy, happiness, family, job, income, travel, friendship .. There is so much to life after alcohol! 

I'm sharing because I want to encourage and give hope to even one person who came in here feeling hopeless .. 

I'm very proud of you for wanting to make your life better .. And it can be! Don't give up hope :) 

I will not drink with you today my brother or sister :)",48,0

Day 1 

Hey community. I lasted a new record of 23 days before succumbing to a week or two of maladaptive drinking. So I’m back on Day 1, the day before starting a new job, and two days before I see a specialist in regards to some health problems that have been exacerbated or caused by my drinking. 

I’m not demoralized though. Relapsing and staying sober isn’t about willpower to me. What has helped me stay sober those 23 days was strategy and self-knowledge. 

I am more conscious of my triggers than ever, and wrote out a preventative and responsive plan to each trigger this afternoon. For example: one of my triggers is severe chronic pain in my upper body. I have a plan to prevent that trigger (schedule regular massages, exercise regularly, prioritize regular yoga, eat enough magnesium-heavy foods, only wear well-fitting garments etc) and a plan to treat that trigger if it does come up (keep information and a little bit of money handy to get a massage on particular bad pain days, keep a large amount of CBD pain lotions in my house, car, and person, etc). 

What caused me to drink was a variety of situations that messed up my plans until the disorder felt normal again. So I need to be prepared for those situations with well-thought out responses. And get used to the habit and thought process of subbing adaptive habits for my maladaptive habit of running out and drinking when shit gets weird or hard. 

My husband has not lapsed the way I have, which I am very grateful for. But I need more support than him -- so I’ve been open with my close friends about my quest for sobriety, and my recent relapse. Letting people know what’s going on with me and letting them know that I might be reaching out more in the coming weeks and months prevents the feeling of isolation and shame that makes me more likely to drink.  

I had been posting here regularly in that 23-day streak. So I’m going to try to keep it a nightly ritual. It kind of helps me to lay out my thoughts in a forum of people who know how demonic a relationship with alcohol can be.

This is my first time ever posting anything. I am writing my story partly to clear my own thoughts and in hopes that it will resonate with someone and help them in some way. My story with alcohol began in 2015, before that I didn’t drink much. In college I was a studious person and spent most of my time in the library and when I hung out with friends, we mostly played video games or board games. After graduating, I moved states for a job. It was a new beginning for me, and I wanted to experience the “party lifestyle” which I felt like I never got to experience before.

I started going to bars and made new friends who also liked going to bars. Around this time, I also started taking antidepressant as I was always an anxious and depressed person. I started drinking heavily. I would finish a bottle of wine and a six pack of beer after work, and I would go to work severely hungover the next day. I would take a day or two break then do the same thing again.

One day I didn’t even wake up on time and missed work for several hours. People at work were concerned and were trying to reach me but my phone was out of battery. I was sure I would get fired but luckily, I didn’t. I told my boss I was taking new antidepressant and the doses were too high, so it made me severely drowsy.  

During my vacation I went to another country and got so drunk that I peed on the floor of the hostel I was staying at. The woman who was staying there woke up screaming and cursing at me. I was really embarrassed. I couldn’t even clean the mess I had created because I was fumbling everywhere.

I have driven drunk at night. I could have killed someone easily. I am not proud of any of this. My credit cards were all maxed out, I had missed several payments on them and some personal loans I had. My emotions were all over the place, one minute I would be ecstatic, another minute I would be bawling my eyes out. I do think the antidepressant I was taking had a factor in this. All of this was between 2018-2020.

What really opened my eyes was my father’s death. He was a lifelong alcoholic and he died suddenly of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. I stopped taking antidepressant and don’t drink as much now. When I do, I drink 2-3 beers, which I want to stop as well. I don’t go to work hungover, drive drunk or do anything that I regret the next day. I have paid off all my credit cards, and my credit score has improved greatly.      

I also don’t want to rely on any medication to help me feel better. Over the past year, I started reading a lot of self-help books, practicing mindfulness and Cognitive Behavior Therapy. It might not seem like much, but I am proud of where I am today. I’m almost done with grad school, which hasn’t been easy. Although I haven’t fully quit alcohol, I am proud of where I am now vs where I used to be. The journey continues.

Thank you so much for reading my post. You guys have helped me tremendously. The positivity and support of this group has helped me be where I am today. I wish you all the happiness and IWNDWYT ❤",14,0
33,2022-02-27 19:01:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/t31kc9/insidious_isolation/,Insidious isolation,"Back when I was drinking, I didn't need anyone. I felt comfortable in my drunken state. Content with life. Content with my decision-making. Sure, I spent time with friends every once in a while, but I often felt that being around people—even people I love—drained me both emotionally and physically.

This week, I was smacked in the face with a harsh reality; I'm fucking lonely. Extremely fucking lonely. And I have been for some time. But I was too drunk to notice. I was too preoccupied with the next drink—the next big escape—that I completely lost my way.

The result of heavy drinking caused insidious isolation. It didn't happen all at once. In fact, I didn't even notice it happen at all. This, in my opinion, is one of the most dangerous things about alcohol. It slowly takes you away from the best and positive things in your life and leads you into a lonely, dark room. A room that promises comfort and safety, but is full of pain and misery. That's been my experience, anyway.

Today I went to my closest friends' baby shower. I was surrounded with friends and perfect strangers. It made me realize how much I've missed the element of human connection. It was almost awkward to be so present in the moment of such pure love and kindness. I could have cut the affection with a knife.

It nearly made me cry. I was overwhelmed with conflicting emotions: sadness, joy, pride, and happiness. I realized how long it's been since I've loved myself. How much time has passed since I've truly been present in my most meaningful relationships. Today I realized how lucky I am to have such amazing and supportive people in my life. People who care about me and love me for who I am. And to think of how I've neglected to reciprocate for so long makes me sick to my stomach.

But today isn't a day of despair and misery. Today is a day to celebrate all the good things that surround me. The friendships. The laughter. The pureness of real love and happiness. I'm not perfect, but I'm learning to forgive myself. I'm learning to be kind to myself. I'm learning to appreciate the small things in life. I'm learning to love myself again. I'm learning that, despite my failures, all is not lost. In fact, it's just the beginning!

Thanks, SD.

Still having lots of other mental health issues i haven’t dealt with and still facing a lot of problems that might get worse. Still honestly not 100% seeing that quitting alcohol is helping any of it. But hell it’s within my control so. Trying again.

We just sort of drifted apart after our twenties where we both went separate ways but we always remained amicable. So me and two friends drove for four hours yesterday evening, we'd have a meal and drinks would be involved and the  next day we'd go over to the old friends party . They know I quit but for the occasion I thought I could have a few. Long story short, I couldn't have a few and I ended up puking and feeling miserable this morning full of loathing and anxiety. I was 36 days in.

Then we went to the friends house around noon and champagne was served, then much much more wine at lunch and then coffee and whiskey after the meal. I managed to stay sober all day long (not for their lack of trying, mind you), but I was shocked at how much booze was consumed. I don't know if it is my new-found sobriety, but I don't feel this was normal.

Mind you, in the olden days I would be right in there with them; I ain't no saint...

But now, I was happy I was back in my car driving home sober and it was so good to arrive home and see my wife and kids. That was a glimpse of a life I'm so happy to leave behind.

Anyhoo, I'm still figuring out how this all fits, but I am more determined than ever after this weekend to keep being sober. Now, about to turn in for the night and tomorrow is a sober, fresh morning! Can't wait!

It feels selfish to just wrote a post boasting about this, but i feel like I have worked so hard for this that I couldn't help myself. These two years have been a constant struggle and I have experienced some of the lowest points in my life. I've hated myself more than I ever thought possible. I almost ruined every single relationship in my life. I got kicked out of my home by my girlfriend (we are now trying again) after ending up in the hospital, shoved a box of wine down my gullet at my sister's house (with her two children in the same house) and try to flee the country barefoot and without any money. I reached rock bottom for the second time in my life. I thought I learned enough after the first time, as it (literally) caused my death. I am very happy for the medical services in my country.

I would not change it for anything though. My mistakes have tought me a lot about who I am and I have changed for the better. I have not been able to salvage all of my relationships (yet), but I understand it will take time. I do not feel blessed, I feel like I worked my ass off to understand myself, to stop feeling sorry for myself and I decided to take responsibility for my own future.

One of them, which by some miracle was me, found their way out of the drug use by cutting all their old friends out of their life and starting a new. Never looked back, but still drank quite a lot for the following years.

Here I am. They are not here anymore. My dear friend passed away last year - she overdosed. Yeasterday I heard my other friend died too, addictions and illnesses took him. They were good people, addictions to alcohol and drugs made them into living ghosts, not here, not there - it is an illness that is so hard to win😪 

Here I am, having a orange soda for their memory. Sober. Drug free for 6 years, alcohol free for 421 days.
 I survived, why didn’t they. Life is strange.

I hope their travels will be luckier and happier next time around 💖

I was enraged. I lashed out. I didn’t pick up a drink. 

Last night, we broke up. It was mutual. I will never forget how beautiful and messy and disturbing our relationship was. He will always be my best friend.

To be frank, I’m bored and lonely without drinking and dating is nearly impossible for me without it. I dislike being so “boring” and am wondering if I can switch to just drinking on the weekends. I have 4+ months sober currently.

Edit: thanks for the responses, everyone seems to believe: No, moderation is not possible for alcoholics. Guess I’ll remain sober.

Edit 2 to add: I feel better this morning. I think since I’m only 4 months in, the urge to drink and participate in the seedier side of life is still very strong. Nothing the gym won’t fix for today. And as for dating, I’ve decided it would actually be better if I got used to attracting women sober, as they will initially like me for me and the sparks won’t be due to a false sense of confidence. Also I got 10 hot match’s on Timder last night so I’ll give dating sober a try at this rate. I am prepared for it to be difficult, cause what the fuck does one do for first dates if not drinking?

I’m a 22F who tries not to drink. The last time I drank incredibly heavy, I called the cops on myself because I thought I had alcohol poisoning and was going to die (my mental state also declined almost immediately and I was absolutely terrified I was going to hurt myself somehow, on accident due to my inebriated state). I am on antidepressants, specifically Zoloft and Seroquel, which react horribly to alcohol, though I didn’t realize it and was never warned of it other than it could make me sleepy. 
Alcoholism and addiction runs in my family (Grandfather, brother, uncles), and as someone who already has previous addictive tendencies (nicotine and self harm) I decided that alcohol isn’t for me. My mental health is more important than the barely-remembered drunken nights with people I don’t call my friends anymore. 
Due to these facts, I joined this group to keep encouraging me to not give in to societal pressure of drinking for the sake of getting blacked out drunk. I used to work in a bar and I have seen some crazy things. I never want to participate in that, although I have as an underage teenager in the past. 
When I do go out with a friend or my parents, I’ll have either half of one drink or 1/3rd of a white claw. As soon as I finish the drink, I can feel the urge to get another one. It’s astounding to me how I just want to say “Well, just one more can’t hurt,” when I know it does. 
Just want to thank everyone in this group for being incredibly accepting, supportive, and encouraging to others, no matter where they are on their journey. So, thank you!",6,0

As the the title says,  I went to my first 12 step meeting in 17 years.   It was advertised as  secular ('even our coffee is secular!').    


I was around AA for 19 years long ago.   My longest stretch of recovery was 7 years and  I had numerous stretches over a year as well.   


But I grew apart and finally left,  because it became a huge stumbling block for me and that coin that says ""to thine own self be true"",  couldn't have rang more false for me as time went on.   At the end I felt like a complete phony so I could fit in.   


So Secular AA?  Cool!  That's for me.  I  was very psyched at first.  Then the speaker talked and nothing bad  about him,  he was a traditional AA, by the book recovery person but his  focus was on how God saved his life.  The people speaking after him  with the exception of myself and one other guy were spiritual/God based.     


What made it so uncomfortable was I spoke early (heck it was my first  meeting in 17 years!) and directly addressed why I left the program,   specifically for me,  that I was an agnostic and it was just not going  to change.  Then it seemed like people addressed what I said and  discounted it.  In fact, one guy said ""If people start taking apart AA  we won't have anything left at all"".     
 

Message received!  
 

I was so confused.  I looked up the meaning of 'secular' after the meeting,  thinking I had it wrong.    
 

I do not want a God-centric program  because that is not who I am or what I believe is true. This is not a  minor point for me.  I have read the 'Chapter to the Agnostic' more than once and it didn't change my outlook.  I am not trying to change anyone's  viewpoint.   It would be great to be somewhere where I could learn how people do this without that component.",17,0

1. I think Reddit is toxic overall and I've been cutting down on my usage
2. I'm far enough along in my journey that I feel like I don't need the extra support to stay sober (although it is still helpful nonetheless)

Anyways, I wanted to post about this.

I remember feeling very afraid of being judged. Especially in the context of dating. I figured that I was a dented can, and that being a former alcoholic is a badge of shame which bars me from ever having a  happy or normal relationship. I hate the stigma of it. This is the very reason that I still don't use the word ""alcoholic"". At the end of the day though, alcoholism is just like having any other kind of mental illness.

I'm not sure if it's my young age, or the fact that I don't really hang around problem drinkers, but I have not experienced judgment for not drinking like others on this sub have. If anything, people seem to respect me more for having the willpower in a society like ours.

As I said, however, I figured people might be more judgmental in a non-platonic context. At the time that I quit drinking, I was on a long dating dry spell. I had gone months without going on a single date. So I had no experience dating while not drinking, and what would happen was left up to my imagination.

Since quitting drinking, I've gone out with 5 different girls. Not a single one has cared that I don't drink. Last night, I went on a date, and she got a beer with dinner, and I didn't even really have any cravings. I drank water and I was solid, lol.

Not being judged by any of those girls, has been enough to pretty much quash my fear to begin with. I no longer worry that I will be judged for not drinking. Not to say it won't still happen, but I don't worry about it anymore.

I realize all along that the disease was simply trying to trick me. Telling me that I needed alcohol to have fun, when in reality, that was just an excuse so I could go back to an unhealthy life of indulgence.

It seems like the more days I have without drinking, the more I believe that I am better off without drinking.

Have a good Sunday everybody.

When I quit drinking this time I'd been in hospital with pancreatitis. I'd been drinking heavily, not just daily but all day, for most of the last 5 years after relapsing off 2 years sober. I was overweight, sick, miserable, and my finances were always a minute from blowing up in my face. My mom had to send me money when anything big happened and I'm 38. I don't make a LOT, to be clear, I'm under $15/hr working at a nonprofit. But still.

My first 4-6 weeks I did \*anything\* other than drink, no other goals other than keeping my job and keeping my pets alive. Ate whatever, slept as much as I could, devoured quit lit, watched Youtube for hours on end, bought new video games I barely played -  anything it took. 

Somewhere around 6 weeks I started feeling balanced enough to start exercising again, plus I needed something for stress relief. 20 minutes a day if that. A few weeks after that I started slowly cutting down on sweets. Slowly. A few weeks after that I started making it a point to meditate daily. Small things. One at a time.

I'm coming up on 5 months in a couple days and just checked my balances. I finished paying off the medical bills from my pancreatitis, and even though I've spent some money on new clothes and some sober celebration treats I think I can start saving money again next month. Today I'm going to catch a sale and buy a bunch of pet supplies without worrying about when my next paycheck comes. 

I hit my initial goal weight last week (I was working on this part for 2 years before quitting drinking, to give a more accurate timeline!) and I'm thinking I might shoot for my \*actual\* goal weight now. I'm exercising an hour+ most days, actually enjoying it, and seeing gains in muscle I haven't seen since I was 18 and in Basic Training.

I have bad days and still struggle with anxiety, ADHD, fatigue, brain fog and frustration. But the good days are outnumbering the bad ones most weeks. When they don't, I can usually at least find a way to rebalance and remember that this too, shall pass. I'm starting to be in a place where even when bad days happen, I feel like my life \*overall\* is a pretty good one that I don't need to escape from. Maybe I want to escape that one day or week, but not \*everything\*.

What all of that is to say is it's not just a cheap phrase to encourage starting small and giving things time. When I was curled up at my computer devouring gummy worms and wondering if I was going to be able to rebuild a sober life again, my goals were way smaller than where I'm sitting even after 5 months.

I hate - HATE - the entire concept of small work over time. I want to Do The Thing and Have It Done and Get That Sweet Dopamine Reward. I work amazingly well on a short timeline, under stress, in an emergency. I don't know how many times I reread posts on here encouraging others to slow down, take it a step at a time, trust that recovery takes time but is worth it. I had to, bc on my own my brain doesn't tend to believe that. I still have to read those posts to keep myself on track bc I STILL struggle with that thinking.

But...it works, or at least is working for me despite what my brain likes to tell me.

I was exposed to second hand pot smoke and unintentionally got a noticeable psychoactive effect. Alcohol was my main vice but not my only vice, I've struggled with cannabis abuse in the past as well, so sobriety to me is contingent on me not using either. This was at a work party. it wasn't required that I attend, but for the sake of my own career and to a lesser degree my social life, it seemed pretty important I put in an appearance. At the beginning of the evening I'd made it clear to my coworkers that I would not be partaking in the substances, and they readily accepted that. Towards the end of my stay, everyone was in a room (a treehouse actually) and a joint was being passed around, I simply would skip my turn. I assumed the room was large enough that I wouldn't be exposed to enough pot smoke to actually achieve a psychoactive effect, being that it was many times the volume of the inside of a car (large treehouse you can rent out) which I remember from my younger days it took quite a bit to ""hot box"" the volume of a car. A bigger reason I stayed in the room was because the alternative would have been to sit inside the main house or a different treehouse by myself, completely alone, which would have been awkward, or to have left after a strangely short period of time, and my goal was to stay at least a few hours (everyone else was staying the night) and, again, I didn't believe I would get high from being there, and no part of me wanted to be high because I probably wouldn't enjoy being high around coworkers even if I was still using. Ultimately  I suppose I lost track of time because after a half hour or so, a coworker walked in and commented how smoky it was, and suddenly I was like ""ah fuck I need to go,"" so after the quickest round of goodbyes, I left. I thought I was in the clear because I didn't ""feel"" anything until I was by myself on my way home, but then I realized, as much as I wish it wasn't true, I was slightly high, as if I'd taken a fraction of a puff of a joint.  I became quite depressed and frustrated because I'd been so resolute about not using, I'd  made choices that seemed correct at the time (again, from like a career/networking/social POV) and felt like I hadn't actively chosen to use, yet still, I was slightly high. The problem is, at the end of the day, I did put myself in the situation where I was exposing myself to THC and opening up the possibility for it to happen, even if I didn't mean or want to have it happen, and can find ways to justify it. I told my sponsor and asked if it counted as a relapse and he said it was up to me, but that's obviously a difficult decision to make. I'm inclined to not count it, though, again, I'm not completely blameless. I'm also considering the fact that, so long as I have this job, networking and socializing is going to be an important and arguably necessary part of it, and I'm inclined to keep the job because, without going into too much detail, it's really a once in a lifetime opportunity, and making good money for the first time in my life has probably been a large contributing factor to developing enough self respect to get sober and work the steps in the first place. So basically, this won't be the last time I'm around people using marijuana, so I will always risk exposing myself to levels of THC that might not be negligible. I can take reasonable steps to avoid it, and I now have a better idea of what concentration of smoke in the air is actually gonna be a problem, but this is going to be a continued issue, and I don't think that going and finding a place to hide every time someone pulls out a joint is reasonable or healthy, especially since 99% of the time simply not smoking should be enough to remain sober, last night of course being the exception.

Anyways, if anyone has had a similar experience and found a way to deal with it or has a perspective on this situation, I'd really love to hear it. At this time I feel inclined to not count it as a relapse for the reasons stated above, but that also leaves me feeling guilty. However, by counting it as a relapse and resetting my day count, I feel like i was cheated and that it's unfair and I become intensely irritable. Any feedback is appreciated.",3,0

I need to maintain a balanced lifestyle (work, self-study, leisure) to be happy, and in being happy I am more capable of helping others, and in helping others I feel more satisfaction with my life, and with more satisfaction in my life I feel less of a need to drink.  Drinking only pulls me from the world that I live in - when I would drink I would isolate myself and ignore everything around me, effectively pulling myself from everything that is meaningful.

But this understanding comes from BALANCE.  And when I'm balanced I don't talk to myself like I'm a failure and a mistake.  I can look in the mirror and tell myself that I am a good person.  And I know that I am.  Some of you would even agree with me - people that have never met me will tell me that I am a good person.  So why can't I ALWAYS tell myself that I am good?

""Goodness"" is a string of choices.  Being good is a chain of behaviors.  Even though we think that we are bad people for what we've done - cheating, lying, abusing others and ourselves - we can be good, and we are almost always already ""good.""  Balance helps with this understanding.

I hope that today you can work to find and maintain balance in your lives.  You are all Good and you are all worth it.

90,2022-02-27 11:48:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/t2s98a/drinking_during_personal_tragedy/,Drinking during personal tragedy,"A few weeks ago I posted here about a horrible night.  Without boring anyone with the details, suffice it to say that the last few weeks have been an absolute roller coaster.  I had to testify in court against him.  The state was pressing charges--I chose not to.  However I chose not to remain silent about what had transpired that night because I dont want it to ever happen to another woman.  

Staying sober has been a challenge as my default behavior in times like this is to hit the bar and drink until I feel numb again.  I tried it a few times.  However, after achieving sobriety and becoming more mindful these last few years I noticed that drinking had far reaching effects I hadnt previously noticed.  

After a night of drinking, the anxiety ramped up HARD.  I had a hard time with near panic like states.  That led me to chase another drink at the end of the day.  Wash, rinse, repeat.  I decided to take some time and not touch anything NO MATTER WHAT.  Guess what?  The mental clarity gave me the steadfastness to make decisions and deal with all of the impending fall out of leaving an abusive partner I share a home and life with.  

I noticed that when I drank, I became sentimental and glossed over the blatant acts of abuse that had occurred for a majority of our relationship.  I missed him.  I missed our life.  I missed the stability of just being with someone.  Nonsense.  I'm much better off alone even though it feels difficult right now.  It only feels that way because I've hitched myself to a damn man for almost all of my adult life.  This new state takes some getting used to and no matter what, I'm gonna do the damn thing.

Lastly, I noticed that drinking put me off wanting to make any moves in a positive direction such as packing my shit and getting it into my new place.  It only made me want to lay on the couch in a state of depression and despair grieving and feeling massive guilt.  The mental clarity from not drinking is invaluable to me right now.  Its literally the thing I need to move on.  Drinking makes me stay in a state of despair and I just dont want to wallow in the mud and self pity.  I refuse to lose anymore of my life grieving over someone who would only hurt me in the end.  

Yesterday I almost went to the bar after visiting with my parents who had flown out here.  I felt anxious and the loneliness of going back to our shared house was almost too much.  Instead, I drove past all the bars (theyre all really close in the town where I live) and thought about how lonely I would feel sitting there alone drinking.  How bad I would have felt this morning.  I'm so damn grateful I didnt do it.  IWNDWYT.",8,0

96,2022-02-27 11:12:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/t2rh6k/12_years_sober_today/,12 years sober today!,"12 years ago today I was laying in a hospital bed. I had suffered a compound fracture of my ankle while dancing with a woman at a bar. Before that day arrived in my life I had spent over a decade on a barstool. During that decade plus it seemed like I was having the time of my life, but the fact is I was letting time slip me by and all of the ""fun"" I was having... well I couldn't/can't remember most of it. 

Looking back at what I do recall is random bar fights (quite a few scars from those), a DUI that cost me well over $10k, failed relationships,  and strained relationships with my family and coworkers as I had become focused on when could I have my next drink.  I also lived in an old mobile home that was barely habitable. I did that because it put more money in my pocket to spend at the bar. That mobile home was literally condemned after I moved out. My priorities were jacked... 

Then the day came that I broke my ankle.  With it being a compound fracture that happened while I was drunk I only recall bits and pieces of the immediate aftermath... There was an off duty paramedic at the bar that night and he kept me calm. He helped divert my focus away from the injury while an ambulance was called. After that I remember laying in a hospital room with a towel over it. The towel was sticking up like it had tent poles under it. Those tent poles were my bones... it was f'n crazy. 

That was followed by surgery. Six screws and a plate later I was put back together again. Some days passed that I can barely recall.  People were in and out visiting me. It is all a blur. I was on a morphine drip for pain. 

I was going through terrible withdrawals. Shaking, sweating, I was thirstier than I've ever been in my life, and my heart was pounding like crazy. At one point I was rushed to the cardiac floor. I don't remember all of the details because I was so out of it. I do know I have been on medication for years to keep my heart in check.

As the withdrawals eased and there was talk of when I could go home a doctor visited me. I've always wished I could remember his name because of what he said to me.  He told me chances are I would not listen to him... he had seen people like me before. He asked how old are you exactly and I said 32. He then said with the way you are living you'll be lucky to see 40. ""You're running yourself into the ground."" He told me my blood pressure was off the charts, I had untreated diabetes, plus the heart issue. He also told me that it wasn't too late. I listened. I laid in the bed and thought this is it... I'm done. I wish I could thank the doctor personally today. 

It wasn't the first time I thought I was done, but as it turned out I truly was. It was far from easy. I think one of the things that helped me stay the course was I was injured. Couldn't exactly get up and move too well. Once the injury started to heal enough that I could I think I became so determined to start a new chapter in life I just kept myself away from what I call ""falling back into the trap."" 

I went through so many of the things that I see posted about on this sub. Not knowing what to do with myself, dreaming about drinking, depression, and feeling like I lost my identity.  It took me awhile to figure out who I was again, who I wanted to be and just where to go from there.  I feel like the first year was an absolute nightmare of ups and downs with it, but I weathered the storm and I came out on the other side of that storm a stronger man because of  it.

This may not sound like therapy or way to help a person get through stopping something like drinking, but one of the things I did is got a puppy.  A boxer that I named Hoss. He helped me in more ways than I could explain here. He needed me, so I wouldn't just leave him for a night out and I needed him. He was just there for me during the peaks and valleys. Hoss passed away in 2018, but he will be with me for the rest of my life. 

In the 12 years that followed me stopping drinking I have seen triumph and tragedy. I lost one of the best friends I've ever had. He was killed in an accidental shooting in 2015. I knew him for nearly 30 years. His kids call me Uncle because we truly were/are family.  In 2018 my 23 year old nephew drowned in a river. My nephew had been drinking at the time and the river was up a bit... I guess he just didn't have the strength to make it back to shore. The pain those deaths have caused me is immeasurable. I had people worried that I was going to start drinking to numb the pain, but I knew that wouldn't fix anything.  The best way to honor their lives is to live the best life I can possibly live. I do not need a drink to do that.

The triumph I have seen is so great that when I think about it I can't help but think that I could have only dreamed of a great deal of it at one time. I met a woman in 2016 who had a young son. His dad passed away when he was just 2 years old 
We dated for awhile and although we ultimately didn't work out that young son has remained a part of my life since. I see him often and in my eyes he is and always will be my son. After his Mom and I parted ways I met the woman that is laying next to me... we're celebrating our two year wedding anniversary this weekend.  I have landed a great job, we bought a house, a brand new car and I literally feel like I am living the dream. All of those things are tied to the decision to stop drinking. 

It hasn't been easy. Many of you may have a tough road ahead of you.  There are quite a few options for help. Forums such as this one, meetings, support groups and others as well. My best advice is do what works for you.  Know that you can do it. Know that you will weather the storms that come your way. Know that the best days have yet to come. They are on the way.

Know that I will not drink with you today.",1002,0

I’ve never been more convinced that alcohol is a poison and not for me. I’m not planning to go back to AA but I am looking for an alternative. Im hoping this sub will be a great resource to keep me on track.

 Good morning. 
 Our keynote is “Honesty”.
 Today’s reading assures us that conscious contact with God will relieve all our resentment, worry and fear. Calmed and guided by contact with The Divine, we will be able to go about our real purpose of being helpful to others.
 In my experience, the closest thing I have found to the panacea is awareness of my Creator. However, if I am to keep my mind on God and off myself, I must take action. I need to say to myself many times each day, “Thy will be done“.
 I benefit from holding the door to a room or car just an extra beat for God to enter.
 Other simple reminders, like a rubber band around my wrist or a wadded piece of paper in my pocket, have often pulled me back from the abyss of self-centered chaos to God‘s peace and usefulness.
 Dropping to my knees a few seconds to start a day over has calmed many a soul storm.

Yesterday, they accidentally gave me a margarita with tequila in it. Guys, it tasted HORRIBLE! I used to absolutely love tequila, but this was just awful & I’m THRILLED! It was the same with a comparison between a piña colada & piñata (the NA version). One of my friends wasn’t sure if she got my drink, so I tasted hers. It was horrible too! I used to love rum as well, but I actually spit it out. 

I’m ridiculously happy that I found it tasted so gross. It’s weird & great that the drinks tasted like shit because I wasn’t even tempted by them. The server was very apologetic & double checked to make sure all my drinks were NA after that. He got good tips from us.

Last week I talked about getting back on track after having covid. I think I did ok.. I out on a few of the pounds I took off when I was sick, but all I did was start eating again- and I have to eat. Something new I’m starting again today is pretracking my meals  in MyFitnessPal in the mornings- I did it yesterday and it kept me pretty on track. Going to recruit my husband for a few workouts this week too- power in numbers! Of course I plan to hit the yoga mat for my mind today too, I want to start the week off with a clear mind.

How are you all doing with your goals? Anything really working for you that you wouldn’t mind sharing with the class?

Downing drinks, meaningless babbling, waking up in a blur, hungover. There was no soaking in the place, or true enjoyment.  

We witnessed a table of six at a seaside restaurant at our resort ordering round after round, laughing obnoxiously, slurring their words, endlessly getting up to go to the bathroom, dominating what otherwise would have been a lovely seaside experience for us. Their conversations to them were highly entertaining. But it was just typical drunken babble. Really low level stuff. Their jokes, not funny at all. Their stories, spoken in slurred, sloppy fashion, not interesting at all.

We left the restaurant and walked a tiny deserted beach nearby. My kids snorkeled and saw a Manta Ray and hundreds of tropical fish. I found a beautiful piece of coral and watched the waves crash over the rocks. My wife and I embraced as our kids kicked along, focused on the beautiful schools of fish darting below them. To the east, a rainbow formed over the ocean. I suddenly realized I was living my dreams. And there wasn’t a drop of alcohol involved. It was all real. And it’s as good as I describe.

I had been drinking heavily for years, I was always a frequent binge drinker but in the pandemic it turned into nearly daily.
In December 2020 I tried to give up and got very sick from withdrawal and realised I needed professional help.
Then I started addiction counselling in January 2021 which did me a world of good with reducing but it didnt really focus on sobriety. Very harm reduction based. I spent January to September 2021 getting to a few days sober then drinking. 
Decided I needed total sobriety around September time, continued the cycle but started getting to a few weeks at a time instead, truly trying my hardest. I immersed myself in quitlit, started attending meetings (AA, NA, and non fellowship), took my counselling seriously, I still struggled to get past 3 weeks.
I got through christmas sober, only to drink at new years. New years turned into three day bender, it was hard to come back from. I managed it and about three weeks later (as per usual), I drank again. 
It sounds cliche but it was a different experience that time I drank, I really didnt like myself. 
That was a month ago now and I honestly have no desire to drink right now. Everything in my body is saying stay sober. My life is so much more manageable and I'm honestly so happy for the first time in years.

I started pushing the limits of my drinking when I was 18 & getting absolutely hammered, it was a challenge and I was competitive.

This drinking continued through college and into my 20’s, mainly a weekend warrior, because it was all I could afford at the time. As my career after college progressed and the paychecks increased, I steadily became a daily drinker and a weekend drunk. 

I finally admitted around the age of 27 that I had a problem with alcohol. It would cause my wife pain, I always seemed to have a fog that was only cleared by more drinking. Waking up and not remembering everything I did or said (but knowing deep down something embarrassing happened the night before), weight gain, drinking and driving, sleepless nights; the list goes on. 

It took 9 more years from when I realized I had a problem and a hit and run DUI to finally say, “fuck this poison, I’m done with you.” There were countless mornings I woke up from the time I was 27 leading up to my rock bottom moment where I wanted to quit, but kept making excuses to come back. 

The excuses my brain made up overpowered my will to stop. I wanted to quit, my addicted brain won salesman of the year… every year. 

The list of excuses includes, but is not limited to, the following: 1) I won’t do that again (after I cheated and after drinking and driving), 2) I’m successful at work, 3) I don’t drink everyday or in the morning, 4) all my friends and family do it, I’ll be the weirdo if I quit, and the weirdest one my brain used, 5) I wanted a cool ‘stop date’. 

I can’t just quit on a random day, it has to be cool like New Year’s Day, my birthday, 11-11-2011, etc. That was the strangest excuse my brain would use to delay the inevitable. You need a better stop date, NYE is only a couple months way, your birthday is right around the corner, Halloween? 

Stop before your quit date is just your date because you hit rock bottom. Life will be so much more fulfilling without alcohol. Quitting may not be easy, but the best things in life aren’t always easy. 

Let me tell you after almost 8 months without a single drop, no excuse is worth it in the long run. I’m a better father to my kids and husband to my wife (who stuck with me through all the embarrassing moments). I’m better at my job, I sleep better, I workout and eat healthier. I poop better. The sex is better. The morning fog is gone.

The demon that once lived in my skull is still there and will drop in to say hi and whisper thoughts and excuses to just have one drink. The demon used to live in a mansion on 5 acres and now has a cardboard sign at the intersection begging for me to start drinking again. Alcoholism will always be with me, but as each day without it passes, the voice becomes more and more distant. 

I hope this message gives just one person the courage to try quitting. To try a month and see how much better your life can be. Worst case is you’ll lower your tolerance back down to a respectable level and save some money. Best case is in the long run, you live a happier/healthier life. 

The people closest to you already know you have a drinking problem. The ones who are closest to you won’t make you feel like you made the wrong choice. They will embrace your decision and you will love your clear mind without the fog.

Ignore those excuses your brain comes up with for why you should keep drinking and remember every day of why you quit.

You and I have made it through the weekend, pretty cool I'd say, not a hangover in sight and little to no regrets, if that were true though I don't think we would be on this Reddit. I regret that I drank my last drink. Last year around July there was a major blowout, I had a mild alcohol-induced seizure, lost control of all emotions, and with complete disregard hurt someone that I held dear. I will never be able to say sorry enough to my ex or my best friend and to everyone that had to live through the turmoil. However, I have said on multiple occasions that the only way to be sorry is never to drink again.

I didn't stop completely, there are 4 days unaccounted for. I knew the dangers we all do, to what extent remains to be seen. 

To my ex and my friend enough was enough I don't blame them for leaving and I truly hope that they are happy and getting what they deserve which is nothing short of the very best in life. I love you both!

So I'm here, just like you, mastering sobriety, trying to perfect it. Fighting what feels inherently within, battling past transgressions and vanquishing demons. 
My sponsor jokingly said I need a exorcist, well I don't know about all that I'll just starve it from Alcohol and force feed it love until it turns into a fluffy pink unicorn lol! 

Have an amazing Sunday everyone!

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Sunday sober family! 

It’s my pleasure to host the daily check in, it’s my first time! 

Doing this is a big step for me. I am someone who can be socially anxious & drinking played a huge role in my anxiety.

Alcohol was a social crutch for me. I couldn’t cope without it, it was my best friend, my best friend who would get me in a lot of trouble. 

Social pressure is one of the things that influenced me to keep drinking, I needed my best friend & felt worthless without it. 

The problem was that it helped me avoid my problems & made them worse.

When I stopped drinking, I started going to the gym early on a Sunday morning. I expected it to be empty, I thought that everyone would be in bed hungover & I couldn’t have been more wrong! 

What plans are you looking forward to today?

My cannibis use was 20 mg. at night for sleep (unless I happen to enjoy a blunt occasionally). I was fine after I quit drinking (about 1/3 of a 5th nightly). After I quit the antidepressants I started to have panic attacks, but they faded (big stores were ghastly). After quitting cannibis I started having excruciating chest pain (probably panic attacks), unable to sleep, hyperventilating, and wanting to not be living, to get out of the pain.

I never wanted to drink or do drugs. Still haven't done heavy drugs thankfully. The first time I got drunk I knew it was a mistake. I quit for awhile when I turned 19.

I don't know if this has always been true and I just haven't noticed it, or if it's something that's new in my experience as I'm getting older (40 this year), but it's been a really startling thing to learn. 

Like, I seem to recall nights in my twenties where I'd get shitfaced, truly puking-in-the-toilet-at-a-party drunk, and I'd wake up the next day feeling shitty, but the hangover only lasted that day, and the day after I'd be fine. I certainly don't remember noticing the effects of the hangover lingering past the day after. 

These days, though: it takes me *five days* to feel like myself again after a night drinking. I've racked up enough ones (and threes, and fives, and sevens…) at this point that I can recognize the pattern, and it's one of the things that's startled me most about this journey towards getting sober. 

>**Day one** I am absolutely paralyzed by anxiety, shame, and depression, not to mention the physical headaches and nausea and dehydration. (The emotional shit is worse than the physical, now. I certainly don't remember *that* being true in my twenties!) I can't work and can hardly do anything other than lie in bed. I'm at the bottom of the hole, and I want to disappear. I hate myself.  
>  
>**Day two** I feel deadened, sad, but in a less paralyzing way. I can go back to work, but my head's fuzzy. It's hard to focus. My work colleagues have to reach out to ask if I've done a thing; I of course have not done the thing. I send a few emails, go to a few meetings, but I'm phoning it in. I'm exhausted.   
>  
>**Day three** I still don't feel 100%! At least at this point I can wake up early to try to catch up on all the work I've missed because of drinking. But I'm tired, and worn out, and my brain's still not really on board. I try meditating, but I can't focus.   
>  
>**Day four** I'm finally physically feeling okay. I manage to work, but still can't really put in my eight hours. I'm tired. I go to a family birthday party, and it's fine, but I'm low energy; I don't have the energy to sparkle and really give my beloved family the energy they deserve.   
>  
>**Day five** I can finally meditate and feel like I'm fully present. I can finally do things (dishes! laundry!) without feeling like I'm going to collapse afterwards. I finally feel myself regaining a little of my normal emotional resiliency. I'm still fragile—but I can weather a crisis at work with a modicum of grace. I finally feel like I'm back to ""normal,"" or my own version of it: who I am when I'm not drinking. 

So—today is day five. And I'm writing this out because it's been a real surprise to me to realize, concretely, that if I drink, I'm going to be dealing with the effects for *five days* afterwards—at least! It's real motivation not to pick up that glass of wine again. Much as I like the wine (and I'm not even sure I like it any more), it's not worth five days of pain.",50,0

My birthday is next week, so my partner and I went out during the day. We went to breakfast, to a cat cafe, and too a few breweries that serve some NA beers, I guess I still can't stop going to breweries even when I'm sober. It was a fun day all in all. 


When we got to my mom's house to go out for dinner I said something about getting a NA version of a beer I used to drink while we were out today. She very disappointedly asked me if I still wasn't drinking, not even on my birthday. It hurt my feelings and made me feel like she didn't like hanging out with me when I'm not drinking. I would have quit drinking in September, but we had a trip planned for September and October and I knew she would be disappointed/mad if I didn't drink on those trips, so my sober date is the day we came home from the trip in October. I originally told her (as well as everyone else) I stopped drinking because of headaches, which is sort of true, but then I realized how drastically better my life is without alcohol. Once we got to the restaurant there was a wait, she suggested we go next door to the bar to get a beer. Thankfully the wait wasn't nearly as long as we thought it would be, so we got a table quickly and didn't go next door.

I’m battling extremely hard right now due to things I don’t want to post on here in case someone in AA recognises my account. I’m in the process of getting a sponsor to start working the steps.

Do you think if I smoke a few cones of real cannabis, I’m heading back down a dark path, or if I do smoke that undoes all my progress with quitting my actual addictions? I just want to try a few cones to see if I can relax a little bit, keep in mind cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids are apples and oranges.

We hung out for six hours, playing games and chatting and enjoying each other's company. It was wonderful, but when it came time to leave, I swear every cell of my little addict brain was screaming at me to change my mind and take that bottle home. It was easily the most vicious my cravings have been since I quit.

Instead, I told my brother he was welcome to it. The next battle came on the trip home. I had to struggle with the urge to stop somewhere and pick up some wine. I argued with myself the whole drive, then, finally fed up, I stopped at one of my usual mom and pop drive-thrus, bought a gatorade, and went home. Just to prove that I could.

That wasn't the first time I woke up after a night of drinking full of shame, confusion, and regret. But this time I deeply hurt my partner and almost lost them. So finally I decided to take a break.

I should've stopped then...I should have stopped long before then really. Honestly, I was never good at drinking. 

But instead I tricked myself into thinking I could be a ""normal"" drinker like ""everyone else"". It worked for a little while. I was drinking in moderation, at least according to my standards. Then life happened and my drinking spiralled...again. I tried a lot of different tactics to get my drinking ""under control"": Short sober breaks in between heavy drinking periods. Getting on anti anxiety and depression meds (then mixing those meds with alcohol). Sneaking alcohol to pretend like I could drink in moderation (I'm positive I wasn't fooling anyone). 

So now I'm done. No more alcohol for me (hopefully). Today is a hard day. I don't want to drink but I'm feeling a lot of sadness and regret for all the ways I've hurt myself and others these past few years.

Beginning was challenging, but I quickly found not-drinking normal. Another week, another month, suddenly, a year alcohol free!  

I've been feeling much better, clearheaded, and despite all challenges from life in general, I have managed without excessive difficulties.  

Right now though... As I sit alone in my living room, with a brutal war going on a country away... I can't.  

My heart is breaking. I've been breaking down in tears for 3 days. I wonder, how much can a heart take?

I lost my 17yo best friend (yeah yeah my cat - well, my whatever-happens-in-the-world-we'll-make-it companion) 4 months ago. I've been covering for 2 full time jobs for 3 months. I am frankly burnt out. And now war. Next door. Senseless.   

My heart weighs 1000000kgs.  

I don't feel like I'll start drinking again. But I feel like I ""deserve"" a one day break? Where I can just numb myself out, have a break from it all?  

This sub helped me immensely in the past 410 days to do better for myself. But I do now wonder, whether giving myself a one-day out is like, I deserve it? I need it? And I'll just sleep it off on Sunday, drink lots of water, gather whatever strength I have left in me again, and back to 0?

I don't know. In any case, as I just looked it up, whatever I decide next, I just hit 410+ days, so I do want to thank this sub, everyone here, for the background help in this.  We can do it, I can do it, you can do it.",43,0

I had an injury (not sure if it was broken or dislocated) to my thumb as a child that I wasn't ever taken to a doctor over. It's been hurting for months but over the past month it's become extra fucked up. Looks deformed. Thumb literally points in the wrong direction. 


Not only does my thumb hurt but my whole hand and wrist does. I work in IT and typing is almost unbearable at the moment but I don't have a choice obviously. Can't play videogames, can't read because holding a book hurts as does scrolling on my phone. Basic stuff like getting dressed and unscrewing bottles hurts a lot. 


I have an appointment with a doctor on the 4th of March but I don't see it going anywhere. The NHS fucking sucks and I'll either 1. Never get treatment or 2. Have to wait 3 years for treatment. I'm also in recovery from painkillers (nothing too heavy) and I don't know how the fuck I'm going to cope with the pain without painkillers if it gets any worse. What if I end up being unable to work? I'm 26 ffs. 


Between this and the 2 weeks of severe period pains, constantly extremely tender breasts, IBS symptoms, full body pain, extreme fatigue, rash, acid reflux, headaches - and my mental health which is doing okay now but has been severely awful in the past - I'm not coping well at all. 


Before anyone chimes in with their health ""advice"" and starts blaming my thumb that literally pokes in the wrong direction on my lifestyle... I don't smoke, I'm not overweight, I'm a runner and weight lifter. It's not normal to feel like this at the age of 26. I was never a daily drinker (or even anywhere close) so alcohol cannot be blamed for this either. Haven't drank in 5 weeks but feel hungover every morning regardless.

So as  to try and not be a wall of text, I will bullet some of the thoughts I have about all  of this.

\- I left the program in Fall 2020 because  I wanted to go to rehab. I let the program know and they were very supportive and accommodating and let me join again. I am not the type of person to quit something (except substances lol) so I have reluctantly decided to complete the program even though I am becoming more and more disillusioned with the mentality of those in charge.

\- Not only did I leave a year and a half ago, a member of the new cohort that I joined also had to leave the program for mental health/alcohol abuse. One of the (two) ""professors"" has told me his son has struggled with substance abuse. The other ""professor"" (who is my ""mentor"") has told me it's not the first time they have had students struggle with alcohol. And even a different ""professor"" (who retired the semester I left) told me he has been sober for 5 years. So the fact that they end every Thursday night class asking us what bar we are going to go out to feels insensitive and irresponsible. Their comments about how great alcohol is are so prevalent that I can't help but have no respect for them anymore.  

\- My ""mentor"" has told me that unless I learn how to be around alcohol and go to bars (both of which I am fine with), then I will have trouble succeeding in my career. He has said that I probably have a reputation as a problematic alcoholic in the industry I am trying to get into and it's holding me back. Kind of funny that I worked out my demons and have become better for it, and I am not allowed to be proud of it at the risk of looking like a loose cannon? Shouldn't those who still drink regularly be considered more of a potential risk? Well I guess the world doesn't see it that way.

\- Even though I am fine being around alcohol, I have no desire to do so. So I never feel comfortable joining in on the bar outings that the rest of the cohort frequently engage in. What's more is one of the fellow students (who I believe is also sober but just never got into drinking) facilitated groups of us to sign up for intramural sports. Out of the dozen or so scheduled games we have had so far, we have forfeited all but two. And in one case, the reason was because they had planned a drinking outing. My problem is they had already made a commitment to these IM teams, and were aware of the schedules, but when an opportunity to go party came up, they had no problem bailing. That doesn't feel like leadership to me...

I wish the world was not so obsessed with drinking. I feel really self conscious that I have become sober, and it should be something that fills me with pride! And to think that this group of overachievers is going to bring this kind of behavior back to their respective companies, with no regard for the damage it causes to many people's lives, has me feeling defeated. 

I really appreciate this sub, and I hope I haven't overstayed my welcome. I am glad that, at least online, there is a community where I feel like a winner for making the decision to get sober, even if I feel isolated IRL. (Looks like I failed at the wall of text thing.)

I've had 2 OUIs. I've had friends tell me I act different when I drink and they don't like it. I've done many things I'd never have done while under the influence in alcohol. 

I stopped drinking in 2011 after getting my 2 OUIs. Things were pretty good for a while. I got married, had 2 kids pretty quickly and really had no cravings. I would never drink in my house, but occasionally i would get a drink when we'd go out to dinner. My mom and dad think I should never ever drink again. And they are most likely right. My husband was very against for a while but seemed to loosen up about when we went out to eat and on vacation, he'd be like, do what you want and that was that. 

Covid hit in 2020 and things got weird. I had always commuted into work, suddenly i was home, DH was home, our two kids (4 &6) were also home. DH came home with a bottle of Tito and was like let's make some drinks. I was surprised but didn't turn it down. About a month later we moved into a new house and I would sometimes buy vodka and have a drink. This is where DH started getting annoyed so i started hiding it from him. I should have know this was the problem. Over the course of a year I'd drink at home or out at dinner but it started getting bad. I would buy bottles of vodka and hide them. There'd be nights I didnt even really want to drink but felt like i kind of just had to because the bottle was in the house. I almost felt like i was missing out if i stayed sober.  

TLDR- my mom and husband made me go to detox. I was there for about 3 days and the detox people were kind of like well we're not sure why you're here, this is usually a place for daily drinkers who need to dry out, seems like you need help but not necessarily detox. My DH told me if i dont stop drinking we're done. My parents were telling me im going to die if i keep doing this. I havent had a drink now since the end of November so I've been sober for 90 days. For the most part ive been ok, but last week we went to FL and i got bad cravings. Alcohol was everywhere. It was in the condo we stayed in, drinks served at the pool, drinks served at the beach. My DH ordered drinks. He has continued to get drinks when we go out to eat. For a while this didn't bother me but it did on the trip mostly because he wouldnt let me get a drink. 

I wish i didnt want to drink but i do. I feel kind of upset that Ill never get to enjoy an ice cold lemon drop again. I was fine until i got to about 90 days and now I feel like i'm missing an ex that was bad for me. It's like i want to have occasional sex with this ex, just a drink at dinner once in a while. Never again bringing alcohol into the house...but my mom and my husband are adamant that i cannot drink. I feel jealous of people who can drink and be normal...heck i see people who don't necessarily drink normally but no one is forbidding them from having it. 

I'm not sure I can live a life of complete sobriety. I've thought about the next time DH goes away, maybe I'll sneak in some booze then and no one will ever have to know. The thought of never having alcohol again feels depressing. I just get good feelings from those first 2 or 3 drinks, but then it starts to go downhill. I have thought about just leaving and starting a new life somewhere else where I can drink when i feel like it. I just feel kind of trapped. I have wondered if maybe it's my marriage as it's not going well right now. But it keeps coming back to wanting a drink.

A day we'd be outside together walking the dog and enjoying each other's company. Instead I'm feeling isolated in a small room. I revisit the reasons she's not in my life right now and painfully realizing the majority of them involve mental health issues, not taking care of myself, and, of course, drinking. It's a hard pill to swallow, but I have no other way to go but forward.

I like to imagine a future that involves her in it, but it all seems so far away. I know now is the time to work on myself, and I'm doing just that. Just needed to vent a little. I'm currently cooking up some healthy meals for myself, and will soon go on a walk and finish out in the gym. I will do anything else besides numbing myself with drugs and alcohol.

Thanks for listening, SD.

Over the course of the past year or so, I broke up with my girlfriend, moved in with my parents, and, unfortunately, switched jobs to something toxic. And it is only now that the stress of it all has manifested in my life in a nearly debilitating way. I wanted to do something nice for myself... but I never had that meal.

I drank for three and a half hours until they cut me off, which had never happened before in my life. I left so utterly disappointed in myself and in life. I blacked out for the first time in years and awoke with the feeling of my world collapsing. Panic attacks are my norm for me waking up these days, yet a side of exhaustion and worsened depression never helps. My arms tingled all day long as I withdrew.

And yet for one fleeting moment, while I sat at that restaurant, I felt free from my woes. Because I have come to fully realize: it is an *illusion*. I was not free while drinking and I never will be. I will only delude myself while shying away of focusing on what has pushed me there in the first place. And I owe it to myself to try in this life to be who I *can* be: to cope with how I feel and seek healthy ways of dealing with those emotions.

Over the years I have had issues with valuing myself, because it was easier to drink or run from my problems than actually face them and stand up for myself. No longer can I do that because I know I will not truly live life otherwise. And so, I must stop drinking altogether as this is clearly a habit I cannot control. If I could, then this would not have happened. Thus, it ends, and begins, now.",8,0

No regrets today and I feel great!

I knew I didn’t want to drink (as always) but I had the screaming voice in my head, “Go on! This will be so fun! You can keep it under control and not be hungover on Saturday for class!” Thank god I recognized me lying to myself. 

I texted my friend earlier in the day saying I would pop by his place with my partner, and we’d hang out until they left for the bars. I shared that plan with my partner and reiterated that I didn’t want to drink or go out, that doing my cooking class was important and I didn’t want to fuck that up. 

Cut to the hangout: friends are making margaritas, pounding shots, having drunk loud conversations, and I felt envious. When they started to get ready to head out the door, I told my partner, “Maybe I’ll go for just a bit. I haven’t been drinking, and I feel in control. I think I’ll be fine!” Luckily he spotted the lie, and reminded me that my cooking class was important to me and that I did not want to drink or be hungover. He was right; we headed home while everyone headed to the bars. 

But I felt so upset on the way home! A little resentful of my partner for helping pull the reins (even though it’s 10000% what I needed), sad that I was being “boring”, annoyed that I can’t just “drink like a normal person.” I was moody for the rest of the night. 

Guess what, I’m **so glad I woke up without a hangover** this morning! I have energy to go to the gym before class. No hangover, no awful anxiousness, no deep regret for drinking too much or ruining my day, no spending $100+ on drinks and a cab home. I’m going to go to dinner or a movie after class because I don’t feel awful and have to stay in bed all day! 

It’s really hard to fight the resentment and FOMO, but it’s so nice to remember that I never regret waking up without a hangover.

ETA: Oh my GOSH!! I am literally tearing up while reading these responses and all the positive comments! Thanks you kind internet friends! You are making me feel all the warm fuzzies 🥰 cooking class was GREAT. I was so thankful that I wasn’t battling an anxiety-ridden hangover and could focus on the class. Heading to get some yummy dinner with my partner followed by ice cream! Have a great weekend, everyone!! IWNDWYT! ❤️❤️❤️",251,0

But I decided to go out to a comedy show with my fiancé and then ended up with him at a karaoke bar. I drank soda water (with a lime) the whole time, and was able to drive us everywhere. And what was amazing, those drinks were free. I’m down $0 from last night.

 I woke up this morning expecting to feel like shit, but I feel great. Hangover free. 

I didn’t even want a drink. I’ve chased sobriety more than once but this time is 100% different. I have so much accountability in place that I never had before and I have a lot to lose or a lot of people to disappoint if I drink again. And I’ve been working really hard to find coping methods, which I never searched for before.

I’m planning to meet with a therapist next week. That’s a big step for me because I’ve pushed that off for years. 

I can seriously live like this. I love this.

I can’t help but feel bad for them because on the other side it is painfully clear that they are fighting an addiction without realizing it and they desperately want to quit but don’t see any way out of it. If more people knew about this sub I could practically guarantee way more people would be sober. There is support everywhere once you quit for real but there is absolutely zero support until then. One of them even said they want to be where I am eventually but they aren’t ready. I understand this and even say that you need to be ready to quit, but I also said that to myself and it took a pretty scary event to get me to finally stop so I’m not sure how good of advice it really is.

I just wanted to share this phenomenon I’ve noticed. We are genuinely desirable for our efforts and it’s no wonder so many people try and fail. Being sober is freaking badass. It isn’t easy and provides an opportunity to achieve endless goals and betterment. People are afraid of seeing their true selves and it’s sad. Because they’re all wonderful people and while it is scary to quit it almost inevitably leads to the happier life that is believed to be just some myth to many.

 Good morning.
 Our keynote is “Humility“.
Today’s reading urges us to REALIZE that God has, and wants to give us, everything we need and that it is only our selfishness which blocks God’s bounty.
 To “realize” is very different than to “know”. It literally means to make something real.
 I give reality to being a beloved child of God by behaving like one.
 Each day I have a choice of angles of approach. I can live in a selfish and hostile universe, trying to wrest my needs from its unwilling grip, or I can live as a magical creature in God‘s magic and bountiful world.
 I can form an intention to live in the better world but, if it is to become real, I must then persistently behave as one living in that unselfish and loving world of plenty. Only then does my intention achieve  reality by graduating to a decision.

Somehow after reading the book I've gained a different perspective: ""I don't have to drink anymore"" and ""I get to be sober"". I was not bummed out at all. I had a good time. 

At midnight I took a bus home which was full of drunk people returning home from bars. And seeing that really drove it home for me. There was nothing to be jealous about. I didn't envy their drinking. Instead I felt very content in my sobriety. Seeing those people drunk just reassured me that sobriety is the way to go for me.

I had some plans, chill stuff I wanted to do with my husband. Instead I ended up on the couch with cold compresses on my eyes, and then spent a few hours at the doctor’s office because they got so inflamed and painful. 

Turns out I was having an allergic reaction to an antibiotic I’d started a couple days prior. They took me off it immediately and gave me another. I’m lucky I went in when I did. I almost got sent to the ER. My husband drove me to the pharmacy because I could no longer keep my eyes open, and we picked up my new meds, eye drops, and eyelid wipes.

No takeout from our favorite place (my tongue is blistered, another fun reaction), no movies and cuddling on the couch, no card games or puzzles, just fumbling around with weepy eyes clamped shut in intense pain and going to bed early.

I cried to my husband about my pain, stress, frustration, and disappointment. I’d been looking forward to my second anniversary since my first anniversary and this is what happens? He held me and reminded me that that’s life sometimes. Special days won’t always be wonderful. The most important thing is, I’m sober. Every day is a celebration.

He’s right. I’m so fortunate to be sober and to have his support and perspective.

It won't stop you drinking for another few months. But it will start making you open yourself to hope again. Recovery is not a switch, it's a path.

But don't focus on that. Don't focus on the scar. Focus on the future. You have forgotten how to do that right? So busy surviving, so busy losing yourself in the next drink, you dare not even think of tomorrow.

I need to tell you it gets better, in big BIG ways. But also in small ways.

Let's start with something easy, you know that baby weight you can't shift? Turns out your body burns alcohol first. You know that, of course, but do you know what you are having breakfast right now? Nutella. Nutella. You aren't even on a fucking diet and you lost a stone. Oh and we eat ice cream now. ICE CREAM. Do you know why? Because not only does stopping drinking make you lose weight it gives you energy and motivation so you move more. You still hate running btw, but you know the headspace is good for you.

Something a bit bigger, your relationship with your son is flourishing. He's still exhausting but he loves you and you are present to enjoy it!

You know those relationships you lost? Turns out it's multi faceted why you lost them, but you are rebuilding them, people actually like spending time with you. They like it even more when you focus on them and not the drink, when you remember what they say and when you don't repeat yourself 8 times. Those bonds aren't lost, you just need to be honest and put a bit of work in.

You don't hate yourself anymore. Well not every day at least! You wake up and you aren't scared of your phone, wondering what you are in trouble for, beating yourself up for your existence. You still need coffee to kick-start your brain though!

You asked for help. This is a biggy. I know you hate doing it, but sometimes you need to. You started by helping yourself, by not drinking, but that freed you to ask for help for bigger things. Sought help to stay sober. You don't have to do it alone. You also sought  help to fix the things that make you drink in the first place. Alcohol is an evil destructive consuming thing that makes you focus purely on it, blaming it for all bad things, trying to fix all things, be all good things, be everything. It's not everything. I know that's really hard to believe, but it's not everything. You can celebrate without it (and you will have things to celebrate!), you can cope with hard times, you can pick up the phone without a glass of wine to calm your nerves, you can be happy or talk or just be without it. I know. I know that's hard. But you can. 
And you can ask for help.

Don't believe the lies that alcohol told you. Yes you are a self absorbed, selfish, sad person right now. But you are also still a caring and loving mother and friend. And a year later, you still send random texts out of the blue to friends listing their good qualities, that wasn't vodka, that was you.

Dear me a year ago. I know how hard it is right now. To be honest, I think I see it even more than you do. You are so good at lying about the drinking, your relationship, your feelings about yourself, you have almost convinced yourself. But here I am a year later. I am not just alive, I am living. 

I am building a bright and hopeful future - I actually have a future now. 

I love you. Even though you don't like yourself very much right now.

Quitting will be really hard at first, but it is possible. And it will be the second best thing you did with your life (your son  is still the first).

Find Hope.

You are about to find out how strong you really are.

I’ve been engaged, ruined all relationships that have mattered. My current girlfriend was looking at new places two weeks ago. I wasn’t included in the move. I begged for one more chance. She said it won’t be any different than the other chances. I told her it would. She still doubts me. 

But, I made it 7 days today. I tell her don’t be proud of me yet. Not until I reach 1 month, maybe 2. Because I’m not proud of myself yet. I never should’ve hit this point. 

I can’t explain how good I feel in the morning, no longer barfing up stomach acid from so much whiskey the night before. I don’t need to go to the pub before I go to work just so I can function properly. 7 days only. And what a world of difference. Unbelievable. Why would I ever drink again? 

I have tried so many times before and finally, I want to quit for myself. Even if she did end up leaving, I’d be sober today. What an incredible feeling. 

Keep it up all of you. This is the way.

I work in the F&B industry and have done for 14 years. Throughout that time I have been addicted to cocaine, cannabis and alcohol. As anyone who has worked will know the accessibility is easy and habitual use is rife. I was in a downward spiral rapidly but fortunately found an opportunity to move to a country where the narcotics aren't available. It was the best decision of my life.

So I managed to remove 2 of the 3 toxic addictions. I have been cocaine and cannabis free for almost 6 years.

A little backstory. If you looked at my life now you would think I'm super successful, achieved a lot, bought a big house, got married to a beautiful woman, live in a great area. Etc etc

The problem now is alcohol. I know my life will improve in the same way it did by removing the narcotics. The fear of change or ""losing"" something, wether it be social events, friends, going out. I'm not sure what the actual fear is, I only know I can never stick to it. The first mention of a beer and I'm there.

I didn't have an easy life growing up and had a pretty brutal experience when my best friend died, which I blamed myself for, for 10 years. Ever since then I've substance abused to deal with pretty much anything. 

I have been doing incredibly stupid things, damaging my health and DUI through excessive, destructive binge drinking. One sip and I will drink til I pass out, or the alcohol finishes (which it never does as I am financially stable.) Last night I drove home after a bar binge and honestly this is the catalyst for change. I can barely remember it. I have to change before I hurt someone or myself.

The drinking is not every day, maybe twice to three times a week. But it is never controlled. Its never just fun. Once I begin thats it. The hangovers are brutal, the self loathing is massive. The weight is also starting to gain as I'm not so young anymore. My face looks bloated the black eyes are getting darker.

The main reason for writing this is to hold myself accountable. I can't tell my wife yet as I've said I want to stop drinking so many times but never do. I don't want her to hear another empty promise. 

There is some irony in my situation, as growing up in the UK I was surrounded by binge drinkers and alcoholics and always remember how much I hated them and always said I wouldn't drink. My mums boyfriend also died while drunk from tripping and smashing his head on a coffee table when I was young. Now I have become everything I hated and that is really difficult to look at yourself.

So I have no idea what I expect anyone to say, I'm not looking for any sympathy. I guess I am just asking the question of where do I even begin? How do I stick to it? I think this is the first time I'm asking for help basically.",12,0

I'm over two months sober. Things have been going well. Before I quit drinking I was seeing the doctor to treat my anxiety because it was becoming too much and was taking over my life. Lately I've had virtually no anxiety! Basically, drinking was the anxiety. Tonight I almost had a panic attack. My resting heart rate was 156. Guess I wasn't really resting, but I was having palpitations and taking huge breaths and shaking uncontrollably.

My mom is visiting, she's been drunk every night. We went to one of those ""sip and paint"" classes tonight. I had been napping shortly before we left to go on this, what should have been fun, mother-daughter date. I guess she had been drinking a vodka soda, or two, who knows. 

We get there, I get coffee, she gets some wine in a can. She wasn't shit-faced when we got there, but slowly I start to see the change happening. Not even that slowly really, I was kind of surprised. But more than surprised, I was embarrassed. She begins mixing all her colors together, runs out of paint and reaches across me to steal mine, while mixing all my colors. I try quietly talking to her because the lady teaching the class asked us not even to speak when she was, understandably so. And when I do she can't hear me, so she loudly says, ""WHAT?!"" 

It just keeps getting worse to the point where I'm really considering leaving. Eventually we do because she can't even sit up right. And she's just painting globs of crap all over her canvas. I was mortified. I'm the daughter, and I had to drag my mom up out of this class like a freaking little kid.

I'm so sad, I really wanted to have a nice night with my mom. We were both saying how much we had always wanted to do this. I was enjoying my painting, but didn't get to finish it. I even knew the girl teaching the class. She had invited me a long time ago and I finally show up to one of her classes and have to leave in the middle of it.

I think it’s been at least a year since then, but I’m so excited to share that I’m 14 days sober.

I think the biggest change I’ve noticed is my relationship with my husband. We’re separated currently and working on things, but when we spend time together I feel genuinely connected to him now that I’m not looking for my next drink or hungover. When I wake up in the morning, I feel genuinely happy to get up and start the day. I regret all the time I wasted just being drunk instead of being present with him. I really thought I just didn’t like him…but it turns out I just didn’t like myself. I’m so grateful to have someone so supportive and understand and patient on my side. 

I’ve also realized in this short time that a lot of my drinking was related to my binge eating, and a lot of my control issues surrounding food. Having that realization has really helped me to identify my craving triggers not just with alcohol, but with food! 

I feel hopeful for the first time in a long while.

I had had a falling out with Friend #1 and we recently reconnected. This was the first time the three of us had hung out together in a long time.

As the night continued, it seemed every story of the two of them hanging out revolved around alcohol. I’ve cut back on drinking significantly in the past couple years, and as a result, have not spent as much time with Friend #2 either (who is a very heavy drinker).

We had a lot of laughs and overall it was fun. They each ordered a couple cocktails while I prettily happily sipped my mocktail.

And then the bill came. Despite the fact that they had had $60 worth of drinks, it was clear the expectation was to split the bill evenly. I’m embarrassed that I didn’t say anything, and I will bring it up at some point, but it made me realize how little people notice/care about my not drinking. (I don’t necessarily mean it in a negative way, though it felt that way tonight.) I don’t think it occurred to them that I don’t want to pay for their alcohol, or that I feel weird when they consider doing shots at the table. 

I realize that I need to set boundaries and tell people what I need, while also accepting that they might not be able to give it to me. Doing it is the hard part.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Saturday, Sober Familia!  Highly functioning alcoholic, gray area drinking, alcohol use disorder spectrum. There’s all these terms and meanings being thrown around now that I’ve stopped drinking and am studying so much about alcohol.  “Highly functioning” seemed pretty appropriate to my brain.  I did many things and lived quite a functioning life until Thursday/Friday rolled around.  

I seemed to be such a put-together person that even now telling people or my mom, they didn’t realize I had any problems with my drinking. And these are people who are the closet to me!  I would completely black out and people around me thought I was fine even though I would have absolutely no memory of anything that happened.  I would be a walking zombie.  

So it’s strange really because you think some people know you so well, and that just may not be the case because they can’t see you are struggling.  Thursday through Sunday I would be a hot mess (maybe not hot but just a mess?) and all that binging takes at least a couple days to recover.  So by Wednesday maybe I’d start to be “on the road” to feeling better then I would start my drinking all over again.  Why?  What was the point?  To feel a slight buzz that never lasts and takes longer to recover from than is actually being enjoyed?  

All I know now is I was sick of it all.  As they say, I was sick and tired of being sick and tired.  It took me getting sober to see just how bad things were getting for me.  We have one life here and I want to make the most of it.  I want to plant the seed in others to look at their own drinking habits.  I have many friends who drink.  I don’t push anything on them, but they see me and are starting to ask questions.  

I’m on a mission to spread the word that being sober is a whole vibe!  Sober is sexy.  Sober is inspiring.  Sober is unique.  We’re not like everyone else, people.   We’re different.  We’re set apart.  We can be the strength that someone in trouble needs to see in order to get away from the darkness that is alcohol.  Be that light, my friends. 

“Do not conform to the pattern of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.”

So now I’m freakin out and talking to doctors and nurses asking about a possible seizure or death and my anxiety is thru the roof.

Anyone have any advice and think these doctors are right? I know seizures and DT’s are found in more severe cases however it seems pretty common on here. And what do I do now I already went to the hospital? and plan on quitting drinking when this is all done.

I pretty much gave up hope for sustained sobriety. I had a little over a year then COVID hit, meetings shut down, I became increasingly anxious and depressed and relapsed.
I learned about vivitrol from this group. I started it September 23, 2021 and I have not had a drop of alcohol since. It literally took away all my cravings. I go to parties, concerts, get depressed, have anxiety, recently lost a good friend to suicide, and so much more and drinking hasn’t been an option.
At the beginning when I was going through withdrawals I relied heavily on this group. For the first 90 days I checked in daily. Now drinking isn’t even on my mind.

A sober friend criticized me,"I met a woman who is in her late 50s (I'm early 40s) in an AA support group. I was going through a breakup and I had been drinking too much and while I wasn't sure if I was truly and alcoholic, I knew I needed support during this break up from an abusive man who had isolated me quite substantially.

Within the first 2 weeks or so, she invited me over for dinner and it was very nice of her and her fiance. But, she didn't seem keen on the fact that I was ambivalent on whether I was an alcoholic or not. But she had become a fast friend.

I realized though that this was because every time she called me.. she basically talked the entire time all about herself. I thought I just needed to take a minute and give her a break, but it was happening pretty much every time.

\*\*When I told her that I was using this sub for strength (you all kept me sober on NEW YEAR'S EVE!  Thank you!) she mocked me and said even going to meetings was not enough and I must do the 12 steps or I wasn't truly sober.  

She was trying to get me to do at least 2 (1 hour a piece) zoom meetings for AA every day and some where places where she was the featured speaker and it was ALL about her. I figured I needed to do this and stop judging so I did.

I had told her and her fiance a few weeks ago that I would love to return the favor and have them for dinner. She said yes, but said she couldn't for several weeks because they were traveling and didn't want to risk going out (even to my house?) and getting COVID. So I said no problem, but soon found out that she was going to morning exercise group classes and then asked to me to come to an in person AA meeting (just once) where she was being honored. I could not make it but I didn't feel great about the hypocrisy.

Then I was traveling a lot myself for work and wasn't on these zoom meetings and she didn't reach out to say hi... the only time we'd connect is if I reached out to her.

Then last weekend (the weekend we finally planned on the dinner) and I told her that I was speaking at an event a few days before and someone who was on the board of directors tested positive. She cancelled dinner and said she would prefer not to come over since I had been exposed.

I siad that was fine -- even though I was like WTF -- I am FINE and I have NO symptoms. So we rescheduled for tomorrow night. I had forgotten and I hadn't heard from her.. so of course, I logged on to the noon meeting and there she was... and she texted hello to me.. and said ""so excited for dinner tomorrow night...""

Damn. I don't even want them to come over now for dinner. I am not sure if I'm just being a witch or if others would feel the same. Should I go through with this dinner or just get out of it? I am frankly, bitter. I'm sick of hearing her talk every meeting about the same things and bragging etc etc and apparently living a life of double standards..

I am proud to say I'm almost to 90 days..

Lemme start by introducing myself, I’m a self taught graphic designer who used to spend 10 hours on YouTube learning new things in adobe after effects and photoshop as well after 6 months I found myself being good at it and started free lancing in that domain, in Africa most people used to think that graphic design and VFX can’t bring food on table back then, i worked with international companies and all got worse when i signed first contract as graphic designer in the university where I studied and live.

My life has changed upside down, leaving work at 5pm going to the pub, meeting my grownups hanging around with new girls. I know you know the vibe but here in Africa when you get a job u start living like a super star in Hollywood movies. 

Branded clothes and shoes, going out every single weekend even in some working days. The apathy and arrogance ruined my life. I was that type of a guy who give u sth and never come to take it back, early this year, I advised myself that this sorts of living won’t take me anywhere and i tried to change lane, avoiding PUB friends and stay away of my pregnant girlfriend(we talk on phone I don’t want to spend the money which might help us on her delivery) to be honest I don’t even know if she’s lying to me but it’s Okay...

Drinking and partying won’t take you anywhere that was the voices in my head and I cannot silence my Bruno anymore 

Is been 5 days and I decided to save every single penny and see the changes in like 6 months or a year, last night my friends phoned me multiple times and i aired them and I’ll never pick any call from them from 6pm cause it might be beers plots which I don’t want these days

Yeah that’s my story i hope you learned something new, we are all in this together and god will help us in this journey

My self confidence is picking up because I don’t have sweaty palms and can actually shake peoples hands without saying sorry. My shoes don’t stink (as bad) fro walking on water everyday. 

It’s 32 degrees here and my mom has the heater turned up. Normally I would have the window in my room open wide and a fan blowing at me and still be sweating.

UGH THIS IS TERRIBLE.,"I’m really stressed about work. It's that awful kind of unreasonable anxiety that has me convinced I’ve fucked up badly and everyone thinks I’m doing a bad job and I deserve to get fired—even though no one’s given me any feedback of that sort at all. I missed a big thing I was supposed to do, and now it's Friday, and people are having to scramble to make up for it. 

I want nothing more than to get really, really drunk so I don’t have to think about it.

 I’m not gonna, but it’s that kind of day, you know? Where you just wanna forget. 

Turns out I have zero coping strategies for anxiety and stress other than getting shitfaced. When you take that off the table, I have no idea what to do with myself. 

So now I'm just sitting here, intensely anxious and scared and stressed, and I'm not gonna drink, but… that just means I have to, what—sit here and *feel* this? This is bullshit and I hate it. 0/10 do not recommend!

I'm not gonna drink, but… I could use encouraging words, guys. Please reassure me that even if I get fired I'll be okay?

Then I also started one on one therapy to help get to the root of my drinking- which currently is also once a week (we will taper frequency of sessions as we progress).
I’ve been off work for a week and honestly I’m exhausted. The mental and emotional work of getting sober/ dealing with other issues feels like a 50 hour work week.

Ironically we’re going over how to combat negative emotions and emotional fatigue- using 3 point checks and mindfulness.

Currently I feel exhausted and tired and sad, when I feel like I should be feeling proud, energized and motivated.

Just gotta keep using my tools I’m learning and get over the hump. 
In great news- I went to a concert last night and DID NOT DRINK nor have the desire! So there is progress.

You fucking know what? I didn't have a sip of alcohol. Not a drop. I shouldn't be sitting here, sober, typing this out right now. I thought this was impossible. I had an iced coffee, socialized like a normal human being, made new friends, and no one gave a shit about me not drinking.

341,2022-02-25 19:14:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/t1ipmb/a_very_realistic_nightmare/,A Very Realistic Nightmare,"I just had a very vivid nightmare that scared the shit out of me and wanted to share it.

For context, about 5 years ago I moved across the state about 3 hours away from all of my friends and family. The small amount of accountability I had has been long gone and I've slowly spiraled more into addiction and depression. Only in the last 2 years have I began making an actual effort to get sober (therapy, meetings, meditation, etc). I've had some victories, some defeats, but things are getting much better and I've learned that for some people sobriety is not linear.

This nightmare managed to encompass every single thing about drinking that makes me want to quit.

In the nightmare, everything was exactly the way it is in my real life. It was in my house, in my bed, with my possessions, and my actual family members.

I was asleep in my bed woken from a blackout by a sound. From my bed, I can see down the hallway. I blurrily see my brother coming with a smile on his face. My brain is both trying to come to consciousness as well as figure out a way to address him and juggle thoughts. What is he doing here? What kind of state am I in? How do I get him out? I feel the dryness of my mouth and quickly jolt from my bed. My feet hit the floor and I see my cell phone there, broken, from the night before. I am assuming I probably stepped on it, or got mad and broke it. Fuck. Surely this was the reason I didn't have any warning. A broken phone cannot produce an alarm.

I begin looking around and there are other broken things on the floor of my bedroom, even prized possessions that I have owned for years. There are also a few plates of rotting food. I realize I haven't showered in several days and I am wearing only a filthy shirt and underwear. I have bruises and cuts on my arms and legs. My head hurts, my heart is pounding, and I don't have the wherewithal to remain calm. I yell at my brother asking what he is doing here and I watch the smile fade off of his face. (My brother and I are very close in real life, but we really only see each other on the holidays so it is easy to hide my life from him)

I feel the panic of being found out. Then my sister in law and mother also walk through the door. I lock them all out of my bedroom and yell at them to leave.

At this point, I am beginning to realize this is a dream and fighting to wake myself up out of it both physically and mentally. I finally snap myself awake and my whole body is covered in goosebumps.

Then, the worst part came. The first thought in my mind after I woke up was, ""You should call in to work and drink to forget this nightmare.""",9,0

On one hand, I'm grateful and ecstatic for my sobriety journey. On the other hand, I'm coming face-to-face with emotions I haven't felt in a long time.

I used to drink and take drugs to suppress negative and hurtful feelings caused by the trauma I've faced in life: depression, undiagnosed bipolar 2, a mentally unstable mother, a narcissistic father, and the early death of loved ones. I became numb to the emotional challenges in life.

And it makes sense that I didn't want to deal with them. Who desires to feel bad things? Who wants to sit miserably in their thoughts all day? Very few people, I'd guess. So, I coped by using substances and self-medicating with alcohol. This was my go-to strategy to deal with life. And I did it for years. And it worked for years.

Or so I thought.

It's amazing to me how quickly we are able to forget. How we fail to remember the pain and suffering we put ourselves through. This was the essence of my addiction. Failing to remember the deep, dark hole I dug over and over again while abusing alcohol. Failing to play the tape forward and consider how I'd feel after binge drinking away the sorrows. Pure and complete suffering.

**But today I'm sitting in the uncomfortable.** I'm facing the raw, buried emotions that I've so tightly bottled. I'm not running away from them anymore. I'm letting them flow in and out of my body, mind, and spirit. I'm feeling them. *Truly* feeling them. *Accepting* them. *Understanding* them. And, as terrible and awful they may seem, I'm learning to be grateful for them. They are a part of me. They have shaped me. They are teaching me the things I've searched so desperately to find.

So I welcome anyone who is struggling to join me. Let us face our deepest fears today, together. Let's give ourselves grace and kindness. Let's practice compassionate curiosity. Let's not judge ourselves. Let's sit still in the fear and uncertainty that drives us.

I truly wish you all the best, people of SD. You deserve everything good in the world.

Whether that be a stimulant or food or even something “healthy” like exercise my mind will always have something that I hyperfixate on. It bothers me and makes me feel like I inherently have no self control. It leads to weight cycling and impulsive spending and honestly just not living in the moment almost ever. My family has a long history of addiction and I just want to live normally I’m tired of chasing dopamine highs is there any way to fix my brain??????

This is my first post and I came here because the shame won't let me talk to anyone I know in real life.  I have been on and off with sobriety for the past few years thinking I could figure out some sort of life that included alcohol but after a horrible night recently I realized it's not possible.  I was 60 days sober and went on a trip with a friend.  I knew I would drink because it's what I do with this friend and most friends so I had two beers the first night.  I woke up with a little headache but still went about my morning and it was great to get in a long walk and swim.  My friend started drinking wine at the pool and soon I was too which then led to more wine, two margaritas and then everything got really blurry.  I didn't eat enough and by the time we had dinner I was fading in and out of blackout stage.  The next part is all black.  Evidently we went to the local bar, I was wasted and hit on someone who then was working on getting me to go home with them.  My friend stopped this from happening; I am married and have been together for over 24 years.  My friend then somehow carried/helped me home during which I peed myself.  I woke up that night in peed soaked pants and doom.  My friend was kind and told me to stop being so hard on myself but I am feeling extremely sad, alone and depressed.  I can't believe I acted that way and am not sure I will be able to forgive myself.   Outside of quitting drinking for good does anyone have any advise on how I should handle this major error in judgement?  Should I tell my partner or just keep it inside?   Thank you.",7,0

I work as a teacher where I always feel like I have to be ""on"" - and continuing that all weekend just adds to it. Drinking was always my way to turn ""off"" and just disconnect for a minute. 

I wont drink. I just refuse to give in. But Im...sad? I think, that instead of being excited to see my daughter and enjoy her company (and cuddles) I just feel kind of wound up and stressed.

I recently took a trip to Las Vegas with an emotional volatile woman. The first day there, the conflict started. I felt trapped and so I sat at the bar and eventually ordered a beer. I had 2 and ordered a 3rd but only got a sip in. I could feel the warmth hit my face. I could feel my intense emotions start to melt away. It only lasted for a moment before before my mind out right rejected the change in mental state and my body decided an immediate hangover was required.   


Sweet: I have had this specter of ""If I have a drink again, will I relapse?"" floating over my head for a long time now. I feel after my experience I am well equipped to say that is a fear I no longer have. Alcohol just doesnt seem to have a part in my life anymore. I am grateful for that.  


Bitter: The way this came about. I feel ashamed that I said ""fuck it"". Seems I have more growing to do.

My nose has seemed off tilt and very swollen and sore so I paid to see a specialist today to see if there was an issue.  It turns out that I do have a broken nose, my cartilage has been knocked out of place, the tops broken and there’s a crack on my cheekbone - the black eyes make sense.  

It’s going to cost me 9k to get it fixed unless I try to go through national healthcare which I don’t know if I can and don’t feel I should, it’s my fault for one, and my mum had her nose fixed through nhs and it went a bit wrong so I would really prefer to have a specialist do it.  

It’s made me find the idea of drinking both disgusting and a waste of money.  Knowing I need to save now is a very good reason to not drink - i feel like everything has gone too far and become too unravelled as it is.

I told my partner I didn’t plan to drink any time soon if at all and he’s really disappointed, wanted me to have some this eve then listed off a couple of other dates due saying ‘what you aren’t going to drink at the wedding’ ‘what about this holiday’ ‘what about this birthday’ then questioning whether I expected him not to drink tonight (he has to do him it’s his choice).  I’m worrying about these events myself but I don’t want to drink - I’m scared I’ll be bored sat there while he drinks and I’m probably right but at least I won’t be hurt/embarrassing or argumentative.

It’s really disappointing, he can see the state of me, yet he thinks we should carry on as normal and just need to ‘chill’ a bit when drunk.  Darling, if I could control anything I do when drunk I wouldn’t be sat here looking like a bashed up Quasimodo in the first place.  I think I’ll pass.

I’m planning to continue indefinitely, and I feel good about the decision! 

I haven’t told a lot of my family and friends yet, the only people that know right now are my boyfriend and my therapist. My boyfriend still drinks, and I’m fine with that. 

We’ve had one or two good conversations about what I need to stay sober right now. He’s been very receptive and I know this is an adjustment for our relationship as well. One of the things I asked of him was to keep liquor in the basement bar area instead of the kitchen. This rule is helping me but he still has a number of drinks during the week and I have a hard time with smelling his breath when he drinks.

I’m trying to decide if I should say anything or just stop asking for cuddles when his breath smells like that. Sometimes it doesn’t bother me but when I’m really down I can feel the need creeping back in again, specifically with the smell. 

I am also struggling when, on the weekend, I am asked to DD. I don’t feel like I can say no because I’d always rather make sure he can get home safe. DDing regularly gives me serious FOMO, which is one of the harder things right now. 

I know I’m not the only person that’s dealing with this, but being the only sober person in my immediate vicinity makes me feel kind of alone.

excited to not drink today. 

Any bar industry folks out there? 
Any tips on what really helped you get/stay sober while staying in the industry? 

I’ve been working in bars for only 2-3 years. Bartending for only 1. 
I never really had much issue with drinking but now I find working in bars has normalized a problematic drinking pattern for me that is reinforced by the bar culture and coworkers drinking habits. 
(For me I define problematic drinking as anything I personally feel is getting in the way of my goals, daily needs, and choosing To do it anyways. Im best when sober!) 

I’ve been in a pattern of trying/failing to get to a “healthy drinking place” for over a year now. Today I saw a meme that said “I’m not addicted to alcohol, I’m addicted to escaping my reality” and Wow it shook me a bit how much I relate to that when I always told myself I would never drink to escape. Beginning to think there isn’t a “healthy drinking level” for me personally. 


I Often consider quitting to support not drinking, but I feel like I can’t because there’s no other job I can make this money
and have this kind of schedule flexibility. (Open to suggestions!) 
I work 30 hours/week. 
I Am a musician, prioritizing music playing during the day, I need the ability to travel/tour a couple weeks at a time without losing my job. Need at least 3000/month minimum rn. I am trying my best to avoid working more than 30 ish hours a week because I’m putting all efforts into creating a career of my music which is an actual full time job in itself! So 9-5 life just won’t due unless I put aside music, not willing to do this just yet in life. 
if I could afford it I would work elsewhere to support this life change!

My wife left due to issues between her and our daughter (18yr). Lots of background I can't go into. But things came to a head last night and my wife left. Daughter left to get away from everything and to calm down. Here I am the coolest one of the three just trying to get those two to hear each other and listen to each other. My wife was gone about an hour and a half. She had packed enough stuff for a few days. Drove south toward her parents, then turned back north past our exit for a while, then came back home. I don't know what is going to happen or how this all will end. In my silence and breakdown once they had both left I had a talk with God. I was fucking angry. All this sobriety, all this work, and this is how a marriage ends? The only things he told me was ""just try to get them communicating."" I then asked him if I can work all this out with them. He said ""it's not up to you.""

Today my demon is trying very hard. The only thing going through my head is while running away from each other they were both running away from me. The self loathing kicks in, I don't deserve to be happy. I'm stupid for thinking I can be. Things like that. I made a promise to myself and God through my tears last night that I wasn't going to drink or use. I have come too far and I am no good to myself or others if I seek to numb these emotions. I want to control and navigate the outcome but I can't. Giving up control is what has kept me sober. I just have to accept whatever it will be it will be. Right now breathing seems hard. Taking steps seems like there are weights on my legs. I hope all this will work out but I just don't know yet.

 Good morning.
 Our keynote is 
“Courtesy“.
Today’s Meditation and Prayer declare faith, fellowship and service to be the cure for most of the world’s ills.
 I was prompted to wonder whether I am part of the world’s ills or part of the cure.
 My conclusion is that, in the course of most days, I am both. 
 Whether I carry healing or illness depends upon what I️ am doing, or not doing, at any given moment.
 When I️ allow my self-centered nature to control my actions, there is apt to be a little more darkness in the universe. It is certain that, with each selfish and inconsiderate stitch, the light within me dims.
 However, when I️ am responsive to the Divine Spark and seek to love, comfort and understand my fellows, there is one more pinpoint of light in the world, and the Sunlight of the Spirit brightens my own soul.
 Whether I️ smile or glower at the next person I️ encounter may actually impact the balance between the world’s ills and its cure.
 It will surely impact whether I walk in darkness or in The Magic.
 I️ love you all.",8,0

One thousand days ago, I was trapped in hell.  My entire life was falling apart, yet I was still spiraling deeper and deeper into my addiction.  I had lost my job, my health, my friendships, trust with my family, all of the meager savings I’d had, and was about to finally lose my amazing girlfriend (now wife).  If you’d asked me 1,000 days ago where I would be today, I would have told you with almost 100% certainty that I would be long dead, either by suicide or some horrible complications from alcoholism, which I guess could be considered a long, agonizing form of suicide in and of itself.  

Instead, I’m still here, and I’m absolutely thriving.  I have not only rediscovered myself after losing sight of who I really was for years, but sobriety has allowed me to grow into a much better version of myself than I was before, and I’m truly happier than I’ve ever been.  I’ve lost 40 pounds, rekindled my passion for cooking, set personal annual records 2 years straight for running and weightlifting, and dove 100% back into old hobbies I had given up on in favor of staying drunk 24/7/365.  I’m writing and recording more music than ever, mostly as a cross-country collaboration project with one of my oldest friends, and I’ve developed a true passion (maybe even addiction) for golf like my father and grandfathers, who tried to pass their love of the game down to me when I was young, but instead just gave me an excuse to day-drink outdoors.  These things are all giving me so much more happiness and fulfillment than drinking ever could.  

Professionally, it was tough essentially re-starting my “career” at age 30, but being my kickass sober self has allowed me to grow and thrive more than I ever thought I would be capable of. I spent my 20s trapped in a series of dead-end corporate jobs barely paying the bills and supporting my addiction with no hope of ever advancing, since I was just struggling through 9-5 doing the bare minimum until I could go home and drink until I passed out. Towards the end, once the withdrawals became too much to handle, I was also drinking before and during work. I obviously had zero ambition or ability to do anything better for myself, and I was stuck watching my peers grow and advance while I languished in drunk professional purgatory.   After getting sober, I was actually able to talk my way into an entirely new line of work where I have found my calling and exceled.  With my first company in this industry, I learned quickly, exceeded expectations, received nothing but positive reviews, and got raise after raise…all things I never could have even imagined as an alcoholic. While drinking, every time I met with my bosses, I was certain I was getting fired (and I eventually did).  Last year I made the jump to another company with even better pay, and I recently earned a major promotion which feels almost unbelievable. I’m still not fully used to the feeling of good things really happening for me.   

In my personal life, sobriety has been a godsend. For years while I was drinking, I dreaded anything with family or friends where the focus of the gathering wasn’t alcohol. I dodged calls from my parents constantly, cancelled on plans repeatedly, lied compulsively to hide my addiction, and even when I did actually talk to people or make it out to a social event, I felt like nothing more than a drunk zombie going through the motions and faking my wellbeing until I could go home and obliterate myself with booze in solitude. Hiding the DTs I was developing from friends and loved ones became harder and harder over time, so I drank even more to cope, and for the last few months before rock bottom I honestly barely even remember anything I did. Today, I will happily answer the phone and talk to my parents when they call, I’m almost always game for any social plans, and I don’t have to lie to anyone about anything!  It’s such an amazing weight lifted off my shoulders being reliable and trustworthy again, and my social life and relationships with friends and family are stronger than ever.   

And as mentioned earlier, somehow my incredible girlfriend stuck by me through my lowest low point, was my biggest supporter through withdrawals and detox, showed nothing but love and patience as I got my feet back under me and figured out my new sober life, and through sobriety I was thankfully able to get my shit together enough to become someone worth marrying.  I saved for the perfect ring, she said yes, and last year we had our dream wedding.  I felt like such a horrible partner while drinking because alcohol always had to come first.  I’m very lucky I was never a mean or abusive drunk towards anyone other than myself, but I was certainly never fully present in anything I did, I was NOT dependable, was a liar, and was going nowhere in life. I’m forever grateful that my wife still saw the “real me” through the dense fog of my addiction, and always believed I could win this fight against alcohol.  

Anyway, I just wanted to blabber a bit about my story to hopefully show anyone currently struggling and feeling hopeless out there what is possible. I never, ever thought any of these things could happen for me when I was in the grips of my addiction, but one thousand days later, here I am. I promise you that all the good things you daydream about are still possible for you too, even if you don’t believe it right now.

I want to wake up feeling good on a Saturday morning. It's been a long time since I've started a weekend with a clear head. I want to get out in the garden without a hangover and just think about whether there is anything I can do.

I want to be there, in solidarity, with my brothers and sisters who are anxious about war. I'm scared too. But I'm not going to let it drive me to the bottle.

Thank you for this sub everybody. 

I will stay sober with you tonight.",36,0

You know, the can.  My preworkout was kicking in, and I had that stray thought yet again, ""gosh, do I have addictive tendencies?""

Active ingredient in a lot of preworkouts is anhydrous caffeine - serious stuff.  It's like liquid speed at times.  Use with caution.

But yeah, thinking/feeling, ""Damn it, I gotta cut back on that.""

Well, I'm not the first one to point this out:  It's not that we're addicts.  It's that substances are addictive.  Being addicted to alcohol comes with that societal judgement.  That somehow we're ""weak"" if we can't ""resist"" a substance that is designed to be addictive.  

Nobody judged my mom when she got cranky because she didn't get her MORNING CUP OF COFFEE.

Hell, caffeine even has withdrawal.  (Caffeine withdrawal headaches are the WORST.)

But yeah, it's related to how a lot of us struggle with just saying ""I am an alcoholic"" in the first place.  While true, ""*I* am an alcoholic"", the emphasis is in the wrong place.  *Alcohol* is addictive.   There is nothing *wrong* with us. for responding to it the way we do.

There is nothing *wrong* with us.  Alcohol is addictive.

I told her before I left that I wasn’t drinking, and I told myself the same all the way here. So here I am, with my virgin mojito and spring rolls, enjoying some great live music without spending a quarter of my paycheck, and with no fear of a hangover or regret tomorrow. On the contrary, I took my first sip of the drink and could feel my brain searching frantically for the alcohol, only to not find it, and I almost teared up from joy and relief. 

I’m sure this is all the “pink cloud” and I have a supportive wife and systems in place for when that cloud inevitably fades, but for tonight, I’m celebrating my little three weeks, a nice night out on my own, and the feeling that I can keep pushing. And pretty much all thanks to this sub.

I am trying to hold onto gratitude for that since even before this bitter turn of events, I was already lamenting the decline in quality of life that so many are experiencing, here and many other places as well.

So that’s my rant and I suppose I can end it by saying that, thankfully, my unease does not make me want to drink. I am at a point that I easily recognize and accept that drinking will only make things worse. I remember a time when I didn’t fully believe that, or was willing to take the risk anyway. I still keep in my mind the fact that one day I might forget this and be forced to find or fake the strength that is readily available to me today.

It doesn’t happen on my terms, it happens on the body’s terms.

It does probably a trillion things everyday to keep itself running, to adjust and optimize itself. It does it diligently, with no rest, with intelligence I can’t grasp, a miraculous machine. Alcohol has done a lot of harm to it and it takes time to recover from.

Say you take a plant and start to water it with water mixed with a poison. You do it day after day and you see it starts to weaken the plant.

You stop watering it with the poison and expect it to be in full health in three days (withdrawal). It doesn’t work like that, the plant looks just the same after three days. You let time pass and see it takes a lot longer to fully heal.

The body is the same. As you start to go on the body’s terms and give it the time to heal you see your body, mind and conscious mind all get stronger. It’s longer process than I expected in my wishful thinking. It’s also worth everything. A lot bigger, more surprising, more incredible process than I expected.

To me it’s a miracle how the body does all that. And I get to enjoy it. Let the life inside you do the work, and do it one day at a time ✨

I have spoken to a service that will provide psychological and medical support.  They have advised that I cut down rather than stop completely. 

Problem I have is that I cannot just have less as I drink to get drunk, so I struggle with that idea. I tried but what ended up happening was I had the taste but not drunk so I went online and ordered more. 
It was suggested that add water in between drinks, again not my mindset once I start. 

I think my way would be all or nothing so its getting in the way.  I am getting in my own way and I know it. 

I was thinking that maybe I could reduce by days on days off and increasing days off over time.

I'm not a frequent poster here, but I'm a very frequent reader, and all your posts and comments really help a lot. So much, that yesterday I had my first full month of not-drinking!   


I work in a cultural place that includes a bar, all my friends drink (a lot) and my daily life is surrounded by alcohol. And other things. And I was very, very nervous starting this, because it's very hard not to do something that is ALL around you.   


But everyone was absolutely nice and so incredibly understanding. I am now the official alcohol-free-beer-taster in a bar of a friend, and they make sure to have a new one every week for me to try. My own colleagues directly asked what I needed in terms of help (which wasn't a lot, just for them not to offer me drinks) and on birthdays my friends now all have crates of alcohol free IPA.   


I still drink a lot of alcohol free beer. A lot. But it works for me, I get up every morning very enthusiastically and motivated, and I started two new projects already.   


Of course it's also very hard. I still think about having a drink every day, and I leave parties early when it gets too difficult. I still dream about being drunk, then feel super guilty in the morning for about two minutes until I realize it was just a dream. But overall, it is just a little bit less hard than I imagined at first (that's why I postponed stopping so long), and that is because of my friends AND my online Reddit friends. (That is you.

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Fri-Yay Sober Society!  You know, I keep seeing something people say here along the lines of “Something bad didn’t happen every time I drank, but every time something bad happened I was drinking.”   I love a play on words and that is so so true here with this sentence.  To tell you a bit about my more reckless days, I’ve been in fights before.  I’ve been pulled over by cops before while drunk and managed to not get arrested.  I’ve had overly dramatic toxic relationships.  I’ve done various drugs.  I’ve been in scary car accidents, scary enough realizing now how I could have easily died from what happened.  I’ve been near shootings going down next to me where I had to run.  I’ve experienced what I was told was close to an OD.  I’ve put myself in very dangerous circumstances.  And now that I look back on my life to where I am now, these events all directly involved alcohol/drugs in one form or another.  Either I was drinking myself or the people around me were.  Writing this down and seeing it in print is a bit alarming.  Because alcohol was always the one constant for these scary events in my life.   How I made it to 41 years only God knows.

So I thank God I’m alive and like to think I’m here for a reason.  Maybe it’s to share my story and give hope to people that no matter what we’ve been through we can get out of this seemingly endless cycle.  I’m sure we could all swap crazy stories of bad things we’ve gone through during our drinking days.  What an entertaining meeting that would be if we met up because it’s funny yet it’s not because it’s just so sad and depressing.   I’m happy to have found a place to share these types of things without judgement and people who can relate through their own experience.  Let us all be a bit more wise now with our life choices.

“Wine is a mocker and beer a brawler; whoever is led astray by them is not wise.”

&#x200B;

Goodness! I forgot to add my ending lol

(Since it's Friday, if any of you have 30 days or more of sobriety under your belt if you'd like to get out of your comfort zone and host the DCI, then let me know and we can make that happen.

Last week, my boyfriend was away on a conference trip, I did not drink while he was away Monday/Tuesday night. I got excited when he was coming home Wednesday night, and thought I would have a glass of wine while I wait. That turned into half a bottle, then some gin shots. I remember him waking through the door and the rest is blackout. I was unable to work the next day (from home thankfully) but the anxiety and depression was horrible. 
I’m tired of living with constant shame, regret, no knowledge of the nights events, and hangovers the next day. I don’t like how alcohol makes me snap at my family.  I don’t like the person I am becoming. On Tuesday I decided to stop- the thought of forever freaks me out, but regardless I am stopping for now and for today.

A few random thoughts:

-AA is definitely not for me. I've been to several meetings, and all of them were way too spiritual for my comfort. I still like the ""reward system"" of the coins, so I thought of a new way to reward my sobriety every 30 days: buy a beaded Buddha bracelet that corresponds to the color of the AA coin, and wear it for those 30 days. It will be nice to have a visual reminder of my own strength and power.

\-LaCroix Limoncello is the undefeated champ of LaCroix flavors. Change my mind. :)

\-Hot yoga. Cold showers. Game changers.

\-No one prepares you for the profound revelations you have as a sober person. These have been the Number One factor driving my sobriety.

\-I admitted out loud that I know I can never touch alcohol again. If I do, it will be the end of me.I never thought I could admit those words, and it was both scary and liberating.

\-The rest of my life will be spent battling addiction, and I'm coming to peace with that.

It's a saying I've come across many times in my recovery. I understood the premise, but I don't think I ever really ""got it"". That is, until a week ago... the day I hit *my* rock-bottom.

I'm desperate for change. I'm desperate for sobriety and clean living. I *want* it. I *need* it. At this point, I will do anything for it. And I truly believe that is making all the difference in my recovery. I was given The Gift of Desperation.

I used to count the days of sobriety. Kind of like a game. I would look forward to ""sobriety milestones"": 1 day, 3 days, 30 days. At first, gamifying my sobriety seemed to work. After a period of time, though, I was back to my old ways.

""I can handle alcohol in moderation"", I would tell myself. ""I wasn't *that* out of control. Things weren't *that* bad. I convinced and bargained with myself again and again. But the truth was I was white-knuckling the the entire process. I wasn't fully committed to sobriety.

I also bought a house in an entertainment district in my city and I'm constantly out to meet and make friends with my neighbors. I joke that ""I'm codependent with Waldo"" (the name of my neighborhood), but it's true. And it ain't no joke. My drinking has made me 75lbs overy ideal weight, and it is all that beer consumption and obesity that are causing my gout. So, this is not what I was expecting today to be like, but here we are: Today is my Day 1!

How loud I was with my music in my home complex.. then I will remember how I felt in the morning! That horrible feeling of waking up the next day! When my eyes first open and I say oh no I drank!

Started last Friday. Passed out on the couch in horrible stomach pain, like the kind where if you move you would get sick. Might have been bad pizza but let's be honest it was the Vodka. 

Proceeded to drink, pass out. Pretend to work all week. Sleep over lunch. Drink throughout the day. Only consume Spite, Vodka, and chips. Empty stomach now. Feel sick, cant eat right now. Lose 5 pounds. Im the skinny alcholic type, too skinny. Pass out in the early evenings. Become dehydrated and leave a dry red face. Miss a call from my mother yesterday and she hasn't called me back yet today, grandpa in hospital. And I drunkenly fell and hurt myself. Don't remember if it was Tuesday or yesterday. 

What a waste of life and time. I'll be 30 in a few weeks.

This is where I now stop digging. I hate feeling this way.if I keep this up I will either die in a drunken stupor by accident, get arrested for dui, end up in the ER, and generally waste my life.

The title of this blog is very foreboding. But it is necessary to examine. I grew up in a house where I was always lonely. 4 kids 2 adults and I did not have a connection with anyone in that house. I clamored for any connection to fill this empty void that was left by my family. My connections were always rooted in anxious or insecure attachment. Last weekend was my 30th high school reunion. I did not go because high school was not filled with happy memories. But on the group chat of all of the graduates, someone posted something I had written in the yearbook three years ago. In that little card I predicted that I would be married to my current HS boyfriend at the time and I would be part of a church running their youth program.

I see a young girl who was desperate for this relationship to be the family she never had. I see a young girl who thought she could create a family relationship at a church so she could fill her need for connection.She did not have a homebase. She was desperately longing for belonging and willing to do anything that fostered that connection. Rather she would do anything and she perceived would accomplish that. I now know that drinking and being sexually active does not foster connection and belonging. They foster further emptiness that is living in us because they are outpourings with nothing coming  back.

My whole life has been defined by that pursuit of finding something or someone to be my family that never was. Two failed marriages later and 30 years of drinking before I  could quit on August 11, 2020. I learned that I was going to be the family that I never had. That I was going to provide the comfort I never had. Last July, right before I celebrated my one year, I was by myself because school was out for summer. My son was busy with all of these activities and not at home. And I went into a deep deep depression. Finally in the beginning of July, I reached out in my sober groups. This wonderful sober person showed up and helped me. I took care of myself with my extra money from summer school and brought someone in to help me with my house. (by the way I totally recommend doing that) I met my current boyfriend three weeks after all of that and have completely built a relationship founded with a secure attachment built with emotional connection, communication, and affection. However, in the last seven months, I had not been alone. I was either with Keith or I was with Brayden or I was with Grace.

 This past weekend, I was going to have four days completely by myself and I was looking forward to it! I couldn’t believe that I would be at my house and not have any obligations and I got to hang out with my cats. I slept. I binge watched Family Ties. I set myself up to eat through the weekend which was a first for me because being alone usually meant I would restrict and not eat. I posted and shared on Facebook pages about that. Friends called and checked on me. Both my son and my daughter called at 7;00 pm and 8:00 pm on Saturday night just to talk. I got to watch Braden solve Rubiks cubes on FaceTime. And it was not lost on me but neither one of them would’ve made that call if they had thought I had already started drinking. This was the first time being alone that I did not fear it. This from the girl who always went to the bar so she wouldn’t be alone after work, on weekends or when her kids were not with her. I straightened up my house. I got a load of laundry done (There is still a load in the washer) my tutoring business is taking off. Through that, I have met another beautiful sober soul. There is a lot going on at my school where I feel even more isolated because people talk about me behind my back. I set boundaries and didn’t just go along to get along. And no, my regular life has so many meaningful connections where I am helping others and helping myself. There is truly beauty in this sober life on the other side of the pain and on the other side of alcohol. Don’t quit before the miracle.",12,0

I love my current position, but I struggle a lot with my job. For me it was a miracle when I got hired back in 2020. It's exactly my field of interest and study (urban policy and public law) and though it doesn't pay much, it's quite enough for my living today, even more so without alcohol. The problem is that I already drank a lot before, but with the stress from the new job it just got REALLY out of hand.

I drank so much and so recklessly in 2021 that I almost lost this job. I cringe with the stupid things I said and done, my responsibilities were piling up high and by October I just couldn't work. My anxiety was so intense that I was just incapable of even opening my email. And - surprise - my response was to walk through the city like a lunatic, drinking beer, eating supermarket sandwiches and passing out when I got home.

I go to therapy once a week since 2019, and, through it, I found a nice doctor (psychiatrist) which prescribed me some antidepressants to deal with the anxiety. It was going well, but when I started to mix it with alcohol it got explosive. I had several dangerous black-outs and felt like I was really losing control. But I kept drinking more and more, every day, every hour. And the work and health problems just getting worse...

So I decided to stop drinking. I was scared, really close to lose my job, and to hurt myself bad.

Today, 30 days in, I'm still having major difficulties at work. It's a highly specific job that demands huge attention to details, which is hard to do with a foggy mind and an addicted head that only wants ""fun"". But today I just finished the oldest task that I had to deliver. It was stuck with me since September 2020. 

So it's a spark of optimism. IWNDWYT

I’ve mostly been a beer drinker, but as my alcoholism has worsened, I started buying liquor more frequently. Often times I’ve taken my drinking way too far, often staying up late binge drinking and waking up hungover the next day feeling miserable than ever before. I have been repeating this same cycle, forgetting about how bad that hangover truly felt. So about a week ago I came to my senses and realized that I’ve had enough. The amount of money I have spent on booze is RIDICULOUS. So I decided to quit. Well last night, on my day off, I thought it would be okay to have one or two beers (I ended up having 3). I stayed up until almost 4 bullshitting. Some of you may be laughing at just 3 beers, but today I’ve had a pain in my upper right abdomen every time I breathe in. This pain also happened to me on the last time the day after I drank. So this should be a wake up call for me, because I’m going to end up destroying my liver along with my bank account and relationships if I keep it up. My father is a full blown alcoholic who doesn’t work and relies on welfare only to spend his entire check on beer, so I should really know better.

Maybe the worst part was realizing that my tolerance wasn’t even *remotely close* to “reset” by then. I’ve been drinking so heavily for so long that an entire bottle of wine by myself (a 5’4” woman) had virtually no intoxicating effect at all. I can’t believe this is what I’ve become. 

Having already fallen off the wagon, I was going to grab something harder for this weekend—until my partner reminded me that I had actively regretted the wine last week and had claimed that I wanted to stay sober for longer. 

And something in me just crashed. I don’t think it was the fact that I wouldn’t be drinking tonight after all; rather, I think it was the realization that I had fucked up my own brain chemistry so badly that I couldn’t even resist the bottle long enough to restore the very effect that I was chasing. It’s just... well, it’s pretty sad. It’s sad to realize that I’m not a normal drinker anymore, if ever I was at all.

I never planned to quit for good. I’m still afraid of that commitment. But I clearly need to commit to a *much* longer period of sobriety than I’ve ever done before.

So I’d love some inspiration! Horror stories may actually work best for me, since the rewards of long-term sobriety feel so far off at this stage. Like most addicts, I find future gratification hard to grasp 😅

I like a very strong bite of ginger, and the best ginger beer I've been able to consistently get is Goya.

It's amazing by itself but I imagine you could work it into some bomb-ass mocktails if that's your thing.  I love it because the spice chases down your throat almost like the slightly delayed burn you get from liquor, but unlike liquor it calms your stomach down.

It all started slipping again when I started dating someone who had at least a bottle of wine a day. Soon enough, it was my routine. Even when I went back to work in September 2021.

When we split and he kept living with me for a bit (he’s a master manipulator and narcissist) I started drinking more. Although it never really went below a bottle an eve. 

Finally he left in November after I forced him out but I lost/quit my job in January because I couldn’t keep my shit together. I started calling people drunk. Asking for help etc and not remembering it. Just generally being messy.

Sunday was the last time. I knew either I was getting out of this or dying. It still took me to Tuesday to buck up the courage. Thankfully I have a few good people in my life.

So now, I’m in the mental ward of the hospital. Trying not to kill myself and remain sober until I get into rehab.

After 4 months of sobriety I picked up again and ended up in an awful relapse that lasted 3 months. During that time, I made mistakes and proceeded to knock myself right back down to where I started and then some. My family brought me out of my situation and to a place that allowed me to collect 30 days of sobriety. During this time, I have thrown myself into AA and serious self reflection. Today, I am so grateful that the obsession and compulsion to drink has finally been lifted. I am grateful that I am behaving in a way that I can be proud of and I have clear eyes and a clear heart. I am grateful that I finally see the gravity of my problem and how much I have to fight for. I can work on myself and show up the way I am meant to show up during my time here on Earth. I have the experience of relapse to remind me that I no longer control alcohol and that it controls me and my life and decisions. I am grateful that I don’t have to live that way anymore and that I experienced the miracle of making it back into the rooms safely. I could be dead. I was somehow able to get off the crazy train before it took all that I love away from me. The train goes nowhere but to loss, sorrow, regret, disaster, and grief. I don’t have to chase something that doesn’t exist anymore. I don’t have the luxury of numbing out anymore and I have to face the hardships in my life with courage and faith. There is literally no way forward for me than to do that sober. I love my sobriety today. I love my family. I love my higher power. Today is a gift. IWNDWYT.",5,0

Never missed work, but plenty of hangovers and a few really bad hangovers, struggling through the day.  I'd kept a journal for many years and could look back and see myself trying to manage my drinking (only on weekends, only every third day, put tape on the bottlecap to remind my inebriated self that I don't need more).  But I flailed a lot and only made ""meh"" progress.

Finally, for 2022, I decided that the only motivation that could stop me from talking myself into trying to moderate would be to promise someone that I wouldn't drink.  Someone I love and respect and who I would feel very bad about letting down.  My wife, I love and respect her, but the relationship is such that if I told her ""I think I can handle a glass of wine"", she would allow it.  Having her hold me accountable wasn't working out.

My sister, who has struggled with binging as well, and my daughter, who I share a very tight and special relationship, came to me as two people I would not want to let down.  It felt a little inappropriate to ask my daughter, since I had another good candidate.  I called my sister in December and asked her ""Can I promise you I won't drink in 2022?  And will you tell me that it will be meaningful to you if I keep that promise?""  She of course said yes, and I feel great.  Whenever I get even a spark of an urge, I remind myself that I made a promise to my sister.

I also recently read Annie Grace's ""This Naked Mind"" and that helped really shape how dysfunctional alcohol is to our lives and in society.",6,0

How most help options don't seem to be options for me, unless I'm missing something. Talked about how AA hasn't helped much, and so on. 

So we started thinking about what could help. I told her weekends are the hardest these days, and a 12 pack on Friday leads to the same thing until I can't stomach it anymore day after day. So, we decided that I'll be giving her my wallet on the weekends. 

She wasn't comfortable with ""controlling how I spend my money,"" and I understand that. So, we decided that I give my wallet up on the weekends since Friday is always the hardest, and when I get on a roll, slipping up on Friday leads to slipping up all the next week. 

So, I've taken my card off my phone. Can't use that anymore. And all my accounts only show the last four of the card of course. So if addiction wants my wallet it has to get through my mom first. We talked about it, and she's aware I may get mad. I may argue with her, I may yell and make a scene, but we both know why. We both know I'm not like that. We both know I won't hurt anyone.

I’m not sure why I relapsed in the first place. Convinced myself that I’m not a problem drinker, I guess. But I am. I never make good choices when I drink—seriously though, who does? And while I am the type of person that can stop after one, and I don’t need more, I can’t seem to follow that rule when I drink socially. And doing that, I put myself in bad situations. 

My dad had a bad drinking problem. He ended up committing suicide and I’m 100% sure that his constant relapses with alcohol were a significant contributing factor to him ending his life. I know that I should avoid alcohol probably based off that factor alone. But it’s so hard when it’s such a part of the lives of people that are closest to me. And it’s hard to I know I have to avoid those people. Not forever, I hope, but until I no longer feel the desire and need to drink when I spend time with them. 

But what really has pushed me to get sober this time is just concern for my health. My dad ended up with gout, amid numerous other health issues, from drinking. And now I feel like I am living with constant joint pain (although after drinking, no matter if it was only after 1 drink, my joint pain was significantly worse). I’m hoping that with quitting, the joint pain will eventually alleviate.

 Good morning. 
 Our keynote is: 
“Help God’s kids do what they need to have done“.
 The Meditation and Prayer for the Day urge us to treat each person who crosses our path as if they were sent by God.
 It reminds me that a few years ago I added to my morning prayer a request for help in trying to make the day a little brighter for everyone I️ encounter. This includes the people closest to me as well as strangers in fleeting encounters.
Sometimes a mere smile or letting someone know they are seen as a person can brighten the day of a fellow human being.
 My part in treating my fellows as if they are sent by God begins with courtesy.
 In my experience, courtesy is the single most underestimated spiritual trait. I believe it is impossible for me to be discourteous and spiritual at the same time.
 Courtesy carries the message of God’s love and makes people comfortable in approaching me for help.
 It is magic in human relations.

Had cut down exponentially from a few years ago where I was consuming upwards of a six pack a day, but the daily nature of it bothered me. And I knew I was a ticking time bomb if it progressed. 

Luckily didn’t experience much classic withdrawal, my skin broke out a bunch which I’m sure is from my gut having to reset itself. I’m starting to feel rested when I sleep, and more energetic during my day. 

Starting to get back into healthy habits is also easier. I was an insanely healthy person before I started habitually drinking. Gym 5 to 6 times a week, yoga, lots of veggies etc. Drinking made me uninterested in eating, and I found myself a year and a half in the pandemic 30 lbs lighter, with cellulite and no muscle tone. That’s the beer talking. Everyone just saw the weight loss and congratulated me- but my lack of nutrition and alcohol consumption took me from sculpted to a slim tube of polenta. 

And I’ve realized I hate the feeling of being drunk. Numbing pain/my thoughts and the ritual of “relaxing” after work was keeping me in the cycle. So I journal and have a seltzer, or a hop water (it has ashwaghanda in it ) if I’m really feeling wired. So it makes it easier to never want to go back.

I had a coffee. With caffeine! I know that sounds minor, but for the pst few months the alcohol hangxiety was so bad every morning that I quit one of my favorite morning routines - making my cup of coffee in the morning. I gave up one of my calming routines for a vice that was destroying me.

I drove to work without having to blast nearly freezing temperatures of AC at my face to compose myself and keep myself grounded. My car had a neutral, heck, even warm temperature circulating through it and I didn’t feel the need to change that.

I'm 32, and in my 20's I just couldn't fathom the thought of life without alcohol.

I just got back from a work trip, where I had to fly to CO for a week. Normally my routine to go to the airport WAS: Wake Up, don't check phone and immediately head for a shot of vodka to calm my crippling anxiety before basically opening up my eyes. Then before heading out the door making sure I brought my big ziplock bag of 15 small titos airplane bottles so I could bring my own liquor on the plane...

Even in just 2 months my life has completely changed. My sleep, my health, my confidence, my relationships have dramatically improved.

One thing I have found interesting is, wherever in the world I might be at the time people either usually gravitate towards me because I have tattoos or take a step back. Same thing with alcohol. People have chosen to move closer to me emotionally and some people have exited my life.

All of you no matter where you are in life, what your ethnicity/gender is, what you do for work... Who YOU are is who I want to be.

I vividly remember reaching for the glass and pouring some Cabernet. I felt guilty in the dream. Then I woke up and felt pissed at myself for having the dream. 

I’m well aware that drinking dreams are standard after getting sober, but to have my first one on the one day I’m really tempted to break sobriety was a slap in my face. It’s like my lizard brain knew it would get to me.

Today is 10 days sober. I’m proud of myself for that. But I won’t lie and say I haven’t been horribly depressed, and basically numb, for the entire of those 10 days, though. Hell, my SO told me it’s like I’m not even there sometimes. And I agree, I don’t even recognize this person. At least I was well acquainted with the me who used substances. I knew my ups and downs well. This sober person seems like a stranger. A lot of the time I feel nothing. Like, actually nothing. It’s pretty damn scary.

I was able to make a pretty lame excuse at dinner as to why I wasn't drinking that night, but nobody really pressed me about it.  We then went to a bar, and it was a bit boring but wasn't hard to abstain.  Since then, there have been a few instances where I would have normally drank with others (post MTB trail riding, hanging out at a pool, a dinner at our house) but no ""big"" events.  

Like many, the hardest part for me is still keeping friends when most social events involve drinking.  I am not inclined to make big announcements about my personal battles but others have noticed I'm not drinking and have brought it up.  Most just know me as a typical social drinker who rarely overdoes it (but they don't know that, the next day, I was starting early to drink off may tiredness and would spend a day comatose on the couch).  Still, I know there will be some things I'm excluded from when a friend wants to hang out for the sole purpose of drinking (which I'm fine with).

Tomorrow, I'll be going to a concert.  While I usually don't drink to excess at these events (who wants to pay $50+ for a ticket to not remember it?), I would always have a couple pre-concert beers and a couple in-concert beers.  Maybe 4-7 over the course of several hours; enough to get and keep a buzz going.  My one friend, of course, also does this and is disappointed that I won't be drinking.  But, he is not a d\*\*k so isn't harping on it.  It actually feels good to really say it, that I won't be drinking.  I am sticking to the story of ""I did dry January, and have kept it going.  For now, I just don't want to be drinking.""  I'm sure people can read between the lines and now I recognized a problem to be addressed, but that's better than being a mess at a social event or drunk on the couch over an entire weekend.

The point of this?  I think you'll find most friends and people either:  i) are okay with you not drinking, and after perhaps an initial question just let it go, or ii) are somewhat proud of you for recognizing a problem and taking action.  Those that want you to drink and won't take no or drop the topic are not friends worth keeping and are simply worried about how it will affect their own problematic drinking patterns.",10,0

Well it’s true. Even if you don’t believe it at the time. 😂

When I was about 23/24 still living with my parents before I graduated, I would have some wine a few nights a week to unwind after horrible days of class and work. My dad likes to have a glass of whiskey or liquor at night. One night, a glass of wine wasn’t doing the trick, so I poured a little glass of Grand Marnier along with it. I didn’t think twice about it. My mom saw me do it and to say she freaked out was an understatement. She was horrified, she said “this is how it starts. Who needs liquor? Who needs two drinks at once?” I reassured her I never do anything like that and I just wanted a taste. She wasn’t having it. 

Fast forward a few years later and her words became true. Wine no longer did it for me, I was sneaking shots at nearly every occasion and every night at home and hiding Jameson and Tito’s bottles. Right before the New Year in 2021 I blacked out once again and she found out because she didn’t hear from me since 5 pm on a Friday (blacking out at 5 pm? Seriously how humiliating). That was really what I needed to wake up. I had such a disgusting feeling of shame speaking to her about it. I know she’s hurting. I’m her only daughter. I felt sick in the pit of my stomach for being this way and her seeing it. 

I haven’t blacked out since that night. While I have drank, I’ve controlled it. But I’m still not happy with how I feel after a weekend or how stupid I act when I have liquor in my system. I’m tired of feeling gross and poisoning myself. 

I’m 11 days sober today and I feel incredible. I know it’s not a lot, but I really feel like it’s going to stick this time. I want to make myself, my fiancé, and my family proud of me.

Yesterday she left gif a two week trip and I drank myself silly on a 6 pack. Realized in the middle of the night “hey- it sucks just as much sneaking or not.” Sounds simple and very “well duh” but my brain hadn’t caught up to that yet. 

I’m going to take these two weeks with myself and just heal, grow, and hopefully formulate a steadfast mindset on not drinking. I’m here, I’m ready to get back on the bandwagon, and that in and of itself is great!

I started drinking when I was 17 years old and had my last proper drinking session on 8th August 2020.

I was by no means an excessive Alcohol drinker but I think I fell into my own pattern of Alcohol Abuse.

I could very easily go weeks without drinking alcohol but when meeting up with friends (every once in a while) I would drink hard. This led to a lot of shameful and embarrassing behaviour along with terrible hangovers. 

I had often toyed with the idea of giving up but only to be told by my friends that I should just drink in moderation or that there was nothing wrong with drinking in excess every once in a while.

I've only just come to realise what a difficult task that would be for me....Alcohol is literally designed to lower your inhibitions making bad ideas seem good....as such why wouldn't you have one more drink? It made me realise that alcohol abuse comes in many forms

One of the benefits of these recent lockdowns is that it gave me enough distance from my friends and those nights out to decide what I wanted. I had my last alcoholic drink on 8th August 2020 and haven't looked back.

I'm the proud father of twins now and I find I have a lot more energy to spend with my kids. Despite being woken up several times during the night I still have the drive to get up at 4am most days and go to the gym before coming back to look after my boys and then start work.  I work a full 8 hours and find the time to tidy and cook everyday

Brewery culture normalizes all drinking. It's ok. There weren't many policies against drinking, just be responsible and don't get drunk at work (basic test: can you still run the forklift? You're good).

I was the kind of drinker that almost never got hammered. I seemed in control by all outward appearances. I always drove myself home after work or meetups for drinks. No DUI for me! How responsible! The important drinking happened at home. When you work in a brewery, beer becomes more free than water. Other breweries bring you their beer and we didn't really have a policy for how much we were allowed to take home. I usually brought home a case or more a week just for myself. At my peak, I was averaging 80-100 drinks a week. More calories in alcohol most days than from food. But I didn't get drunk at work. I could drive myself home. I didn't black out or throw up. These were my baselines for convincing myself it was ok.

I developed a rock star tolerance. I was obviously drunk but I had been consuming so steadily for years that I had pretty decent motor skills from all the ""practice."" It was a badge of honor to be able to go out and drink all night. I was really good at it and could hang with Lemmy if he were still alive.

I don't have any wild rock bottom story. I was drinking my usual 7-10 beers a day before I quit my job. I had a health scare that started my abstinence (fully intending to drink as soon as possible) but after getting over the problem, I just didn't go back...to work or alcohol.

I managed to fix my depression, but the drinking persisted, it was just too much of a habit at that point. 55 days sober","I was extremely depressed pretty much from puberty to about two years ago. I'm a transgender woman and I was in the closet. Living in denial of myself, deeply repressing my essential nature, made me very unhappy. In my late teens I started relying on alcohol to cope with my depression, and was pretty consistently an alcoholic for about ten years, getting smashed 2-3 nights a week. I'd often be hungover for work and call in sick, I spent all of my money, it was just a terrible habit.

A couple years ago I finally accepted that I was a woman and started transitioning to living as one. The entire process has made me immensely happy. Through social transition and hormones, I have become a person who I like. I've discovered wells of motivation in myself that I never had before and it has allowed me to start achieving my potential. I finally went to school and am getting a STEM degree, and I'm able to form meaningful romantic relationships with others that I never could before. Every part of my life got better, and I could honestly say that I was no longer depressed. I look in the mirror now and I'm a beautiful woman and I like myself and I'm in love and I am perpetually overjoyed that I managed to dig myself out of that hole.

And yet, the drinking persisted. Despite the depression and gender dysphoria that I was using alcohol to cope with being gone, I guess I had just internalized the habit so deeply that I kept on binge drinking. I kept spending money that I shouldn't have, being hungover when I shouldn't have been. Last year my New Years Resolution was to quit drinking, and I made it 2.5 months but got into a relationship with a serious alcoholic and ended up drinking more than ever. I'm in a much healthier relationship now with a partner who doesn't drink and is very supportive of my continued sobriety, so I tried that New Years Resolution again. If I'm counting right, it has been 55 days since the start of the year, so I'm 55 days sober.

I just don't like how it makes me feel mentally. It makes me anxious and unable to sleep and makes me just really start hating myself. Like geez, the self hate talk in my head is REAL

Im starting this off by leading with reduction, because in the past, when I tried to just go cold turkey, I tended to hyper FOCUS on alochol, which just drove me crazy!!

I tend to do really well during my work week. I've started not allowing myself any alcohol during the work week, and am allowed 2-3 drinks on my off days. But in reality, I really just want to cut it out entirely. I'm trying to lose weight and get healthier and these things just don't correlate.

But for so long, being the friend that enjoys good craft beer, and going to breweries and bars, has been a part of my identity, that I'm really having a hard time separating myself from this habit. My wife even made a comment yesterday: ""Drinking is not who you are, it's a thing you do"" and it just really stood out to me as what my real issue is with quitting.  It's been something people have associated as ""me"" for so long...

Idk. I guess I just needed to ramble my thoughts out.

For example, when I got my 2nd dose of the Covid vaccine. I was worried about the side effects and I didn't want to have alcohol in my system. That was nearly a year ago. There have been days sprinkled in that I haven't had any alcohol, but only a handful and this has been going on for years. Rarely, do I wake up with a hangover because my tolerance is so high. 

Physically, my health is deteriorating. Continuous heartburn and on numerous medications to treat it, yet it still comes back. 

My liver is still functional, but my numbers are high. I tell myself taking dandelion root, milk thistle, etc. etc. will counter the negative impacts. As far as I'm concerned, they don't. If they do, it's only minimally. 

I've gained a significant amount of weight, even though I'm very active (workout 4-5x week) and outside of alcohol, my diet is very healthy. I love to eat veggies, eat a salad every day, high, lean protein, limit carbs, yet still(!) I've gained nearly 30-40 pounds. 

As a cyclist and runner, I used to race competitively. I can't any longer, because every time I start training and increase my efforts, I have an injury -- usually my calves, because of my weight and constantly being dehydrated. 

This last summer, I started taking Wellbutrin, at the recommendation of my doctor and therapist. I wouldn't consider myself depressed, but somewhat 'blue' based on a variety of factors (two small children, unsatisfied by work, pandemic, gaining weight, etc. etc.). I found it didn't work at even the highest dosages, likely because I continued to drink. Additionally, the side effects were mild, but noticeable, particularly stomach related (gassy and constipated). 

Over the past few months, I have weaned off and I haven't noticed any ill effects of going off of the drug. 

Most recently, I started taking Contrave -- a non-stimulant, weight loss drug, intended to inhibit the area of your brain that receives pleasure from eating among other things. The drug is part Naltrexone, part bupropion (Wellbutrin). Interestingly, Naltrexone can be prescribed to people battling addictions (including alcohol). 

Again, and as I've increased dosage (on 2nd week now), I've started to see unpleasant side effects. Yet again, stomach issues. Insomnia. Anxiety. I'm typing this at 1a, because I can't sleep and felt like I was in the early stages of having a panic attack. 

To be entirely honest, I haven't stopped drinking. Tonight even. I had a couple of glasses of red wine and a tequila on the rocks, because you have to with Mexican food, right? Sarcastically kidding. 

I guess my point is that I have done all of these things to change certain aspects of my life, including taking prescribed drugs, to combat things very likely caused or partially caused by drinking. What have I not done? You guessed it. Stop drinking. 

Deep down, I know alcohol is creating unhappiness and is a problem, but I look elsewhere to change things, which have created additional issues. Has anyone else had something similar? You try everything else, except to stop drinking, and still create multiple issues? 


I can't continue to do this. As superficial as this sounds, I don't want to be fat. I don't want to continue to have new issues that I need to address, while not addressing my alcohol consumption. 

I've lurked in this sub for many years and you all have so much to be proud of. Right now, I'm working on harm reduction and trying to limit consumption. I need a change and I'm realizing no pill can counter the long-term effects of regular, and continuous alcohol consumption. 

I'll end with this. I don't really know what I hoped to accomplish in putting together this post. As I stated above, I was in pretty poor shape a little earlier and I feel a little bit better; less anxious for sure. 

**TL/DR:** I've always known alcohol was likely the root for many of my issues, yet tried to fix them in other ways, that never have worked, and have created other issues in return.",22,3

I've been drinking heavily for about two years. 4 days a week, 10-12 beers a day. I work overnight weekends, getting off around 6 AM. Most of the time, I would just make a snack and go to bed, only occasionally drinking a beer.

Monday, my first off day, was a whole other story. I'd get a 15 pack of Blue Moon, and drink 10 of them. This carried on through Thursday, except with PBR, and the cycle would repeat. I absolutely know that's a problem, hence why I'm going sober.

However, I find it hard to relate to this subreddit, or alcohol groups in general because of this: I've never lost anything from my drinking. I'm 29, I've been promoted, I'm a new homeowner, my health is good, my relationship is great. I've never had the ""come to Jesus"" moment that a lot of alcoholics have had.

I know that sounds like a dickish humblebrag, but I'm not intending that at all. I don't have any withdrawals, and my motivation to maintain this lifestyle is high. My SO is also in support of me, although she can just have a few like a normal person.

It feels like it would be so easy to slip back into the ""well, nothing bad ever happened. Fuck it."" mentality, and I don't want to do that. I'm sure temptations and cravings are going to come.

This week I’m thankful I’ve been able to get out and about a bit. I went to Liverpool for work yesterday and it was fun to get a change of scene, if veryyyy windy. This weekend I’ll be going to my friend’s hen (or bachelorette party, as the Americans call it). Now that I think about it, it’s actually the first hen party I’ve done sober. I’m grateful to be my friend’s bridesmaid, it’s been fun helping plan the party with her maid of honour - especially being sober.. When I was drinking I was not the greatest friend, or bridesmaid, or wedding guest. I am looking forward to being able to support my friend and celebrate hers and her partners’ union.

Can confirm the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything is not 42.","My sobriety has become the norm for me. I don't drink. And I don't care what other people think about that. 

A sober person cannot possibly articulate the difference between life when drinking heavily vs after stopping, to people who are still in the midst of their addiction. And as time moves on, and the distance between that last drink gets further, I feel it becoming harder to remember or explain my full lived experience. 

But, if I'm brutally honest, I know with my every being that I can never drink again. That ship has sailed and sunk. I took it beyond my personal limit. 

So let's try to recap. 

The good:

The physical changes are nothing short of dramatic. Where I once looked bloated and frankly unwell, I now look slim and healthy. 

My relationships are generally better. Or more in my control. I still have altercations with people, but I am better at setting boundaries with them, standing my ground and correcting my mistakes. 

I can rationalise better. I have the grace to hesitate before reacting now, which means I can take a moment to understand something, come up with some options and really work out what will work for me and what is fair. 

I am confident in myself and my ability to hold myself to a standard that I am comfortable with. 

The working on it:

The mental challenges are something I'm still working on. I drank because I feel socially awkward and unworthy. That has improved somewhat, but I wouldn't say I'm ""better"".  Not by a long shot. 

The bad: 

There is still some people in my life who either resent me for being sober because it shines a light on their own drinking, or those who are fatigued with this and just want me to join back in with the fold like the good old days.  

If I was to choose whether to be where I was 3 years and 1 day ago or now, it's a no brainer. I absolutely, whole heartedly and with every being I have, choose now. 

And by being sober, I choose me. 

This is not an impossible dream. We got this. Xxx

The task of sneaking the trash to the recycling bin after hours only to hear them light up the neighborhood in a high pitch shatter when the trash man came, wrapping razor blades in cardboard and duct taping them so they didn’t mangle some innocent unsuspecting public servant, dumping baby powder of the floor in case I missed anything on the clean up, washing the blood out of the sink and hiding it in the trash by layers of toilet paper, cleaning the toilet seat of bilirubin infused urine orange toilet seat stains, showering to scrounge an ounce of energy to get through a day of work and a pretend half hearted attempt of being a husband and father, using visine to hide the red/yellow eyes, a cold stone to roll the perpetual bags from under my eyes to rush to a hidden treasure stashed before the migraine, nausea and dry heaves kick in.

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Thursday, Sober Society.  Mommy Wine Culture/Beer Dads.  Five little words, but that sentence has so much weight.  I must admit I fell into this trap.  I thought like the masses it was funny and cool.   
Walking the aisles at your local store and laughing at the ""Mom Wine Repeat"" or ""Boxed Wine is just a Juice Box for Mom"" or this really sad one ""Parenting is mostly just empty threats and full glasses of wine"" and on and on.

There's something about this kind of advertising that doesn't sit well with me.  It feels almost like an attack now that I'm sober.

And I would hate to have her memories of childhood be filled with images of her drunken mother.  I want to relish every moment, good and bad, the laughs, the tears, the struggles, the giggles, all of it with a clear mind.   I take pictures like a maniac, since I was little and we had one of those big polaroids.  I've always loved taking pictures.  I love the idea that they capture a moment in time that will never come again.  I want to be able to look back at pictures and have independent memories of being there.  I was getting to a place where I knew I was there from a picture but no memory in my head.  Why you ask?  Because I was too busy getting plastered and depessing my central nervous system which was not imprinting these images in my brain from the effects of alcohol.  Being able to remember the precious memories you’re making with your family and friends and your fur babies and your life in general is a gift.  Booze robs you of that gift.  

This child is now watching every movement I make.  Sure, she will become her own person, but I am a big influence here.  We were at Disneyland the other day (as we always are) and I see all the parents, both parents even, drinking.  And I know in my heart they’re drinking and driving home.  Because that was me.  That’s exactly what I would do.  Disneyland was such a trigger for me when I quit.  I was ashamed I had let it turn into that.  But now it really is turning into our happy place but without the booze.  I’m grateful to be sober there now, but I'm now also sad to see other parents in this cycle probably thinking they need this poison to “have fun.”  But there’s nothing “fun” about driving drunk.  It's a horrible thing that is too casually done by many drinkers.  

Commercials do not show us the consequences of alcohol or the adverse health effects.   If they did and it was repeatedly shown to us in all the ads and commericals and movies how life shattering alcohol truly is, who would really drink?   We need to be mindful in our culture of what we promote as normal.  Because drinking abnormally is not normal.  Drinking excessively is glorified.  Being a champion of mixing drinks doesn’t make you a man.  Taking a drink because your kids are driving you crazy won’t make you a better, more fun and relaxed mom.   Happy hours can be just as happy without the booze.  And we're also not ""boring"" or ""buzzkills"" for being sober.  Don't believe the hype.  You are not the abnormal one for not drinking.   We are pioneers who are paving the way!

I was absolutely convinced I needed it.  I have been a functioning alcoholic my whole adult life drinking every day for the past 10 of them.  I drank 3-5 drinks a day.  I wasn't black out drunk and the world never said anything to me about it.  No DUI's, no comments at work, home, etc.  

I was, however, on a slow decline beyond natural aging. Physical problems were the first wake up call, and then the past year I realized a deeper problem - my soul was atrophying.  

I was at my son's baseball game on a summer evening and realized I was thinking about drinking.  I then remembered what it was like as a kid to be playing outside as the sun set  on a beautiful summer day.  It was a just that - a distant memory.  I was sad to realize I was genuinely incapable of feeling that and that I was not ""in the moment"" at the game. 

11 days in committing AF after a year of cutting down dramatically and I feel great.  I exercised this evening. It was not this unbearable burden.  I ""just did it."" 

The alcoholic mindset within me loves to wallow in my misery while I drink. It makes any other activity like exercising, or hanging out with my family unbearable - I'm too busy enjoying my misery thank you very much.

I now realize and *feel* alcohol is not my Siamese-brother with whom I cannot live without, but a parasite sucking my life energy.

I'm not quite sure how I feel about the situation. I didn't drink but it doesn't feel like a accomplishment or like I've learned anything either. Anyways I'm back in my hotel room running the whole scenario back thru my mind and figured I would post what happened tonight.

        # 2 My roomate , (Friend ?) This person has a habit of weekly venting to me,and about me . It's a angry rant , that consist of the same dialogue everytime . He claims I'm in his way of getting on with his life and he can live homeless , and I'll be out on the street without his help with the bills . It's threatening and insulting. He fits narssissist behavior. I'm familiar with because of 20 years of experience with one ! It's very difficult but I've been distanced from him from the start. I know this person and there's no way of reaching him in any other way than what he believes. So today the rant . It was a big one . I don't usually respond because it fuels it . All I said was "" I'll pray for you "" This is your thing to deal with"" 
            "" So you can keep that"" 

I really meant this to both of them! I gotta stay sober .

Hello guys, I hope you're all doing well. I logged into an old phone and found this throwaway account. I wondered if I'd ever posted anything on it, so I looked through the account history, and found a post I made discussing a suicide attempt two years ago. I didn't remember I'd posted about this. Reading what I'd said, how I felt, it was... painful, and tender.

The update is long, and positive. It turns out that the man I was calling boyfriend at that time wasn't actually all that nice in the end. Perhaps I was too much for him, or perhaps he wasn't enough, but regardless of the sections of sobriety that I would string together, he would often resort to emotional abuse during arguments about non-alcohol-related subjects. I always thought that it was my fault. That he was reasonable, and I was simply Far Too Much To Love. That relationship ended, and I moved out to my own place. I relapsed a lot and struggled with my mental health, but I didn't consider suicide as seriously as I did on the day that I posted. 

During lockdown, I met the love of my life while passing time on a dating website. Before we even met, I accidentally referenced my reddit account username  handle to him, and while joking about having a twitch (which he promptly googled, and thinking I was being serious...) He read about my struggles with PTSD, domestic abuse and alcoholism long before I would disclose anything purposefully. He invited to me stay in his flat over lockdown on a temporary basis, and I learned very quickly that I have never Been Too Much To Love. 

He loved, and loves, me patiently, tenderly, consistently and unrelentingly. Despite having no mental health or addiction problems of his own, he has never passed judgement or thought less of me. When my self esteem drops and I ask him what he sees in me, the list of qualities is long and sincere. He earns a lot more than I currently do (although I'll catch up somewhat when school is done). I told him early on that I desperately needed therapy, but I would have to wait to be able to afford it. He didn't want me to wait, so he offered to pay for me to go. It took some months of convincing for me to accept that level of generosity, but eventually, I did.

Therapy is a god damn fucking blessing. I learned so much in only a few months - to accept that I cannot control how I feel, that I'm not responsible for my emotions or a burden, and to unpack the experiences that lead me to feel unable to cope without the crutch of alcoholism. 

Sometime in August 2021, after discussing a terrible recent relapse with my therapist, I decided that stopping, mattered. Really mattered. I am currently 194 days sober - a little over six months. I haven't had therapy since November (as I felt I had the core issues addressed and didn't want to spend more money than necessary, as it wasn't mine.) I haven't felt much urge to relapse, I am comfortably sober. Nowadays, when I cry about silly things to my boyfriend, the crying corresponds with my upcoming period. I am finally the *normal* kind of oversensitive.

Also, when I wrote the original post, I was 315lbs, as I also had a comfort eating problem. I am currently at 215lbs and continuing to lose - I haven't weighed this little since age 16. Although I am still fat lol, I'm eating around 1200 calories a day and on track to keep losing. I am happy, sober and healthier.

I hate to feel like a cliché, to think that a man came in and saved my life. In reality, he didn't. He didn't do any work in my therapy sessions, he didn't portion out my chicken and broccoli, and he didn't work through my cravings for vodka. But, shit - being loved by a good man for the first time in my life has helped make me completely unrecognisable.

Stumbling onto this account, seeing that horrible post I made, it's... unexplainable. The questions I asked, begging to know when it would get better, I would ask that for years. I just needed to be loved properly, without abuse - and therapy. I desperately needed therapy. 

I wish, more than anything, that I could reach my palm through those years and stroke my own hair, and provide comfort. I wish I could tell her that things will get better, and that she's got so much to look forward to, and that she's enough. Trying to be sober and failing, trying to eat less and failing - it wasn't my fault that I wasn't set up for success when the support just wasn't there. I did the best I could do with the resources I had. It wasn't my fault that I felt so awful, it wasn't my fault that I was an alcoholic, I'm not a bad person for being sick. I've never been Too Much To Love.

Please know that if you are struggling, if you can't see an end in sight, these are truths which apply to you too. We can't typically fix our problems through sheer determination and willpower - that isn't how people work. Sheer determination and willpower got me through therapy.

Wishing you all self-compassion and tender loving care today. Please love yourselves as best as you can. ❤️",20,2

I’m having a real tough time stopping myself from drinking. A little before Covid I was going through an amicable divorce with my ex and I really picked up drinking. Before I would rarely drink, maybe on a Friday or Saturday night out. 

During the summer of 2020 I found out at 28 years old I have gout and let me tell you it is beyond painful. During flare ups I can’t even put a bed sheet over my foot. I feel so embarrassed because there are days I can’t even walk and I have had to call out of work.

Since my diagnosis I’ve been trying to quit but the longest I’ve made is 4 days. I’ve had a few flare ups with gout and I always promise myself to stop but I can’t. I’ve had to go on full time, life long medication to control it but I know drinking will make the medication next to useless if I don’t cut it out. 

My now wife has noticed my drinking and has asked me to stop for the sake of my own health.

Really could use some help to stop!",7,1

For a long time I thought I could moderate and my increased drinking was just a phase while I was stressed. But the phase has gone on for too long and I've realised drinking and the thought of drinking is taking up too much of my time. Recently this has extended to buying cans of wine at 1pm - if you don't have a bottle in the fridge it doesn't count right?

I really resonate with a lot of the posts in here which show how tiring drinking is. At the moment I'm seen as the one who will always be keen for an after work drink, but never get completely wasted. I keep a constant buzz as I've snuck a drink at lunch time. My outside appearance is a 'good time' and a sensible, hardworker. However I'm exhausted and out of control. Alcohol is such a horrible drug, as it feels like you need to consume it to fit in.

While I have made a lot of friends through going to the pub,  I know the harm it will do me in the long term and that it is doing now. So now is the time to move forward in my live, rather than sinking into the swamp.

So to toast to the future- IWNDWYT

I’m 23(24 on 4/15) and am an alcoholic…. 

I started drinking because of a toxic relationship that ended in may 2020, just thought I was just numbing my pain at the time. That summer, dealing with the breakup and just being home all the time because of the pandemic, I would just drink every night. Just for something to do while I play video games alone or with friends. 
Little did I know it would lead me down this road lol. 

Now I find myself drinking because I have those cravings, and because for some reason in my head I feel “I have nothing else to do, why not drink?” 
I’m also dealing with pretty severe social anxiety and some depression, but I feel drinking has just made it worse since I refuse to drive drunk, and that has limited me from some social situations. It’s like I know all the detriments that drinking has, but just can’t stop doing it for some reason  

Does anyone else have those feelings, the feelings of “since I’m not doing anything, I’ll just drink”? 

I don’t get it, I’m young, have a good job, good friends, and a good family, I’m really lucky in that regard. But yet I always think to myself “I might as well drink since I have nothing else to do”……

I’ve been trying to get sober, but only last about a week until the thoughts of being bored and drinking comes up. 
Doesn’t help that my house is 1 mile away from like 4 liquor stores. And yes, I do alternate because I’m embarrassed when the same person is ringing me up. Lol I know I have a problem

I remember how unstable and unmotivated it made me. I remember the mood swings and how anti-social and isolated I became.

So today, I'm saying no to both booze and marijuana. I'm keeping sobriety in front of my mind. I'm sitting in the uncomfortable knowing there is light at the end of the tunnel. I know these feelings will dissipate. I only need to stay strong and focused on recovery. Just for today.

Where I live, drinking is a huge part of the culture and our country is known for 'binge-drinking'. I drank almost everyday for 16 years. There is nobody in my social circle who doesn't drink. 
My friend recently got pregnant and her baby is now 6mo, I basically didn't talk to her during her pregnancy as I told myself it would be soo boring!! This incredible person who has been my friend since high school.. who's family I lived with in my teens when my own parents kicked me out. Who had me as a bridesmaid at her wedding.. 
The clarity I've gained only after 2 weeks makes me ashamed of the person I've been. My days all revolved around drinking and I was always either drunk, hungover or on my way to the liqour shop.
I was acting as a passenger in my own life. But not anymore. I'm quitting so I can take control of my routine, my career and my relationships. 
I'm sorry for rambling, I've been a lurker here for years now, I never thought I had the willpower to stop but here we are and it feels so good.

I don't even know if I want this to be another day one. I didn't earlier, so now I've got (yet another) bottle of vodka which is gonna be really, really difficult to convince myself to pour away. If I don't pour it away, the only other option my brain will go for is drinking it. So even if I change my mind and do want this to be another day one, I've probably fucked it for myself now anyway.

At least the alcohol in the kitchen isn't mine, so it's slightly easier to resist it, but if I do want today to be day one again, that vodka needs to go.

Just wanted to share. I have been speaking to an alcohol crisis counsellor since week 1. It’s been fantastic, and has really helped.

However, this specific service was very much an early recovery process, designed to help you in crisis situations and to give you the tools you need for longer term recovery.

Over time, I suppose the counsellor and I both felt that I was ready to sort of “graduate” out of the service. That doesn’t for a moment mean I am complacent or that I think “wow gee I’m cured”. However, what it does mean is that I feel I am ready to go my own way more using tools I have learned, without a weekly phone call with them. 

I guess I resisted finishing up with them for a long time because I had this fear that if I stopped doing it, I’d immediately go back to square one. However, I now feel ready - and I have also got a regular therapist I see every couple of weeks who I can now check in with too.

I’m not sure why I’m posting this, other than maybe to kinda journal my thoughts and let you guys know how it’s going. I never thought I’d be here and, while I know there is still lots of work ahead of me and that I can’t take my eyes off the prize, I do feel a small sense of progress at feeling “ready” for this development.

It’s called Euphoric; Ditch Alcohol and Gain a Happier, More Confident You, by Karolina Rzadkowolska.

I used the audiobook format and found it to sometimes be a bit “basic” and “woo-woo” with cheerleader enthusiasm, but that didn’t detract from the content. It actually enhanced it by taking the negativity often associated with this topic out of the equation, and showcasing how glorious an alcohol-free life truly is (much like Annie Grace does).

The author seems to have done her research, as she references top researchers in the field of addiction. She also offers an eight-week plan for those dabbling with sobriety. Overall, it was easily digestible, touched on topics that women face, and offered guidance, all while keeping it light and expansive. 

Whether you’re the girl that can’t fathom a tasting menu without the wine pairings, or you’re the girl who doesn’t know how she’ll be able to hang with the crew without tying on as well, this book is for you.

Enjoy! I hope others find it as helpful as I did in solidifying my reasons for quitting.",11,0

The only way I see controlling it is through sobriety,"Hi, this is my first time posting here. But I'm doing so because I feel I have a problem with alcohol. 

Currently , I don't have any day by day issues. I have alcohol in my cupboard that's been there for years. I don't crave for it everyday or anything.

However, my issue is with social events, places where drinks will readily be available and other people are drinking. I'm kind of quiet, introverted generally. But alcohol, once I drink enough, gets me hyped up and wired. I don't feel shy anymore. I feel like I go from introverted straight to extroverted. I totally change to the opposite person. So I like that feeling of uninhibited confidence it gives me because I'm normally really reserved and quiet. 

The problem is I like it too much until I don't. Case in point, anytime I go to said social event that drinks are flowing it never ends well. I always say I will moderate but after the first drink or two my mind says ""fuck it, you'll be fine"" and I either keep buying myself drinks or never saying no to shots offered. I get trashed. And to the point where I make myself and my whole crew with me embarrassed. I don't like admiting to these types of embarrassments but I'm realizing this is the problem. A few days ago I went to a club, got sick...and not in the bathroom. A little on myself..a little on the booth seat...yes we were in a booth...I ruined that for the ppl who paid to have a good time and can actually control themselves. I fucked it up. They had to help me in the bathroom. Call me an uber. I smelled like vomit. I had it on me. It was disgusting. 

I had another time, a work party at that, where I took someone else's jacket home, puked out the side of a cab. And had to come home in shame to my mom who took care of things (bless her). 

Another time it was in the street in front of lots of ppl.

A couple other times where other ppl had to take care of me same shit. 

And too many other close calls that luckily were just hang overs and not puking until I got home. 

I'm ashamed and embarrassed of myself. Especially because at this point, it doesn't just affect me anymore. I embarrass others too. And I'm afraid no one will want to invite me out anymore (and I mean...can I really blame them?) I wouldn't want to hang out with someone who gets shit-faced either and has to be baby sat all night. 

I've tried several times with intention to just drink a few drinks to be more comfortable or to drink just enough to get drunk but I just can't seem to do it. It always ends with a night and several days of regret and shame. Once I have a drink or two most of the time I cannot control myself to say no. I feel like my body is telling me no but my mind is saying yes. And I can't seem to control that urge. 

I never thought I was an alcoholic or even that I had a problem because I don't drink often. But I'm realizing that alcoholism and addiction isn't always about how often you drink but rather your relation to alcohol. When I start I can't stop. And I'm well aware of this. However, not everybody else is. People will tell you to just drink less or in moderation. But if it was that simple, I would not be embarrassing myself and others. If it was that simple I would do it every time. I might be able to do it if I had someone baby sitting me all night. But that's not worth it for anyone. There's no fun in that. And I'm an adult who should be able look after myself. 

I might be able to control it on occasion or with certain people. But I'm getting to the point where, I think it's better I don't drink at all. It's not worth the shame and embarrassment. I want to have the control to go out and have just a couple drinks. But I can't trust myself anymore. I think it's time to admit that I have a problem. And the only way to control it is to stop totally.",23,0

I was a heavy drinker. I stopped all of that 1.5 years ago. Cravings for alcohol have stopped a long time ago. However, I still have these residual symptoms that I haven’t seen anyone else mention here.

At least once or twice per week I only sleep about five hours during the night and wake up with brain fog and feeling spaced out. My body always feels really tired and exhausted but my mind won’t let me go back to sleep. On these days I basically can’t focus and function at all. I can’t get any work done and feel really depressed on these days. It’s been so bad that I asked my doctor for sleeping pills (klonopin 0.5mg) which I take as sparingly as possible. Normally they help me get another 1-2 hours of sleep on a bad day and that will help me function a bit better.

The thing is that I actually feel pretty good most of the week but then I get these 1-2 days per week where I’m suddenly not feeling normal at all.

Finally, \*finally\* I realized sobriety has to be it.  I can't have just one.  I can't nurse a bottle, just knowing it's there is enough to trigger the compulsion.  I wanted to tell a little more story and dive a little deeper as writing and chatting with you lot can be cathartic.  I've been in EMS as an EMT and a paramedic for about 12 years.  I've seen some truly awful things, I've seen some good things, and everything in between.  Then COVID happened.  I had a newborn and went back to work in this bizarre, masked-up world.  Sweating in a nursing home in a Tyvek suit, booties, hood, and respirator, working a code that you know is pointless.  Seeing the screens up where loved ones could only touch each other through plastic.  Being told to cease resuscitation efforts on what could have been a viable code because of COVID concerns... the list goes on.  I'd work all night, come home, have a shot (or two), and go to bed.  I was a walking shell for 4 days a week, and tried to play normal the other 3.  Tried to pretend I wasn't fiending for a drink, tried to pretend I didn't feel nauseous or shaky or anxious.  Had the ""you drink too much"" talk too many times.    


I worked in an incredibly toxic environment, so the stress from that, my baby, my home life, and my (as of then) undiagnosed depression, anxiety and PTSD came to a head.  Vodka was always my poison of choice.  I bought a bottle, drank most of it, and went to work.  They knew, I was suspended, and it still wasn't enough to stop me.  I kept my booze locked in my gun safe so nobody could find it, or all of the empties.  For a while I was okay, I stopped drinking, and then it crept back in.  A vacation, a dinner, a meeting, all good excuses to drink.  Then I started my sneaky trips to the package store for tallboys, then to the liquor store for vodka.  I still didn't stop.  I was a monster, just drinking and stumbling through the motions of life.    


In the days following, I sought help but I didn't want it.  I'm a 28 year old man, I can handle life right?  Everyone else wanted me to ""get help,"" but I didn't need it, I could \*easily\* get my shit together on my own.  Yet another lie.  My days off were spent drinking and ignoring the home gym I was so proud of.  Watching Netflix.  Streaming, then deleting the VODs because I was a mess.  ""Getting help"" was a barrier to me doing these things, the things I wanted to do, and it wasn't fair everyone thought I ""needed help"" before I could do them.  So I tried AA, that was lame as fuck.  I tried counseling, my counselor talked about herself more than she talked to me.  Called my primary care doctor, he got me set up with a psychologist who actually listened for about 4 hours total, prescribed some meds, and checks in on me.    


I wish I could say that was it, and I'm all better, but that would be another lie.  In the last few weeks, I was back at my old ways with sneaky liquor store stops and hidden bottles.  Never before work, I'd never interfere with my job again, but at home?  Why not?  What has helped significantly is not being afraid.  Not being afraid to say, ""I have a problem,"" not being afraid to open up to my friends I've known for decades about why I'm not drinking, and not being afraid of myself.  Knowing that words have weight, and admitting the problem and talking about it makes it something tangible.  Something to be dealt with.  Knowing that the real, true me can overpower the monster looking for its next drink.    


There have been setbacks, there has been relapses, there has been struggle, there has been anger...  But there has also been tenacity, tenaciousness and perseverance.  Someone here once talked about, ""playing the tape forward.""  Knowing that, if one chooses to drink, the next day will be the foggy, anxiety ridden hell we all work so hard to avoid.  Knowing that we're a better version of ourselves sober.  Knowing that there's this incredible community to turn to is a blessing, and if you've made it this far, thank you for being here.

Today is day 2. I didnt drink last night. Im not really worried about today or the next couple of days, exactly. Just last week I went 7 days without drinking (only to decide to have a beer on presidents day, which turned into 7ish of those 16 oz ones, all IPAs, which left me hungover going into Tuesday).  


I seem to be able to go a few days or even a week without too many cravings. Day 3 or 4 is always bad. But Im tired of the fact that I know this, because I go a week or so, get past that 3rd or 4th day, finally actually start feeling really GREAT and proud of myself, and then go have a drink......and repeat cycle.

So I began drinking at 16 years old and lost my virginity at 18. I got sober for the first time at 22, and I am now 25. Up until my current relationship, I have been drunk during every sexual encounter I’ve ever had. Many of my relapses involved wanting to have sex, but not having the confidence to do so sober. I made a lot of questionable decisions, but that’s not exactly what I’m here for. At 24 I really buckled down to get sober and was really on the right track until I met my current boyfriend. I was 6 months sober and stayed sober for another month with him before I ended up picking up again. He was clueless to the disease of alcoholism and I figured I could get away with drinking some. He didn’t find out about it until about the 4/5 month mark. again, despite the point. 

So. The first time we had sex was my first sober sexual experience. It was truly awful and was so, so awkward. I believe we tried again after that and those were the only two times I was stone cold sober during sexual relations. For the 3-4 months we dated while I was hiding my drinking, we were having sex daily and I was mostly enjoying it, although I don’t remember a lot of the encounters. I just know I was actually aroused when we started having sex, and I was initiating it often. Fast forward to the last 3 months that I’ve been sober again, and I just don’t really like having sex anymore. It’s so “meh” to me. I like that he feels good, but I rarely get anything much out of it. 

I still want to masturbate, so I don’t think it’s exactly a libido thing. Whenever we start doing the deed I’m never wet enough to get it in, which is not something I struggled with while drinking. Then while we’re having sex, it just feels so mechanical. I never know what to do other than pretend I’m really enjoying it. Every now and again something will actually start to feel good, but it’s always right before he cums and it’s over like 20 seconds later. 

I’m struggling because I really don’t know what’s going on. I don’t know if I’m not physically attracted to him (I never have really experienced any tinglies or overwhelming signs of attraction unless I was drunk), I don’t know if we’re sexually incompatible, I don’t know if one or both of us are just really bad at sex, I don’t know if I have some desensitivity to actual sex because I watch porn, or if I’m overreacting and this is just a result of being newly sober (3 months, if you missed it). Everything I read states libido should come back within a month, so I just feel broken. 

Any advice or similar experiences? Either way, thank you for listening. It’s hard to talk about this with anyone and I don’t want my partner to feel unattractive, or hear that I’m not really attracted to him if that’s not what’s going on.",21,0

My daughter forgot her backpack and we didn’t realize it until we had made all the way to her school. It’s a bit of a commute, so I dropped her off and let the front office know I would return with it as soon as I could.

While driving, I started to become really frustrated with myself for not checking that she had it before we left. That frustration took hold of me and resulted in me being a total asshole on the phone to my husband that was just trying to help.

I’m just so mad at myself. Like crying in my car right now mad at myself. When I get like this it unearths all the shame I have from when I was drinking. It makes me question why I ever quit (it’s been just over 90 days) and it all feels hopeless.

I just numbed everything out for so many years that I feel outnumbered when it comes to dealing with my emotions without alcohols “help”. Forgetting a backpack obviously is very fixable, I just wish that situations like these didn’t send me over the edge into despair so easily. I’m thankful that I held it together long enough to drop my daughter off so she didn’t think I was frustrated with her. I wish I could have held it together while talking to my husband too.

(Her hometown.)  There was zero opportunity for me there to do anything that made me remotely happy and I fell into a pretty nasty depression for almost three years.

On that Tuesday a month ago my sister-in-law who is an EMT came by for a visit to the house I moved to after my wife and I separated.  She said I looked awful, no surprise there, I've been drinking vodka most of the days all day long since I closed myself off and started living off of my savings in May.  I've been going through this cycle for a while now where I would spend about a week pickling myself to the point of making myself too ill to keep drinking.  Three to four days of puking, shaking, and misery later I would start the cycle over again.

At my SIL's urging I went to the hospital and had some labs done.  The news was not good.  My liver enzymes were ten times the acceptable level.  My bowel movements were a ghostly white color, which a little googling told me was a bad warning sign of upcoming Alcoholic Hepatitis.  (Sorry if this is TMI, but TBH it was the symptom that spurred me into action because of the doom and gloom prognosis that google gave me.) 

I decided at this point that I had to do something drastic, because frankly I don't want to freakin' die in my early 40's.  I googled and googled some more, ordering a contingent of the most effective liver cleansing and support supplements I could find.  I completely stopped drinking, suffering another four days of absolute misery until things began to feel better.

It was at this point I knew I had to make a life change.  I accepted the new job I had on the table and moved to a much larger city about an hour and a half away from where I'd been living.

I'm astounded at the progress a month can show.  My bowel movements are back to normal, accounting for all of the markers that show progress.  (Again sorry if TMI.)  I feel a lot better, and my physical strength, (which had all but disappeared) is slowly coming back.  I'm looking at gym options near me, knowing that working out helps me feel better and stay sober.

I also have an appointment with a liver specialist next Friday, at the urging of the doctor who went over my lab results with me.  Considering the dramatic shift in how I feel as well as the abatement of symptoms, I'm hoping for good news.  I don't expect everything to be back to 100% so quickly, but knowing that the liver can heal itself over time gives me some hope.

 Today’s Meditation tells us the busy life is a joyful life and is to be loved.
 Some of my extremely busy times have been useful, productive, joyful, and peaceful. Others have felt like a chaotic living hell in which I was under attack from every direction.
 Looking back, one factor always determines which of those two busy worlds I️ inhabit. That factor, of course, is whether I am conscious of God being in charge or am floundering in the delusion of control. 
 When my ego convinces me that I am in charge, I am like an ant floating down a river on a log believing it is steering the log. Such a hapless ant will know neither peace nor success.
 Conscious contact with God clears my mind of the delusion that I must or can  “steer the log”. It IS The Magic!

If that makes any sense.

And then it hit me. I went from drowning to drowning. Instead of drowning in alcohol, drowning my neurons with fake dopamine and more fake dopamine with shit I would do/consume while drunk...I'm now drowning in the rawness of reality. Instead of drowning OUT emotions, I am drowning IN emotions. None of this feels real...because...it isn't. Well, it is, but I have just never experienced it before like this. And if our brains and our ""selves"" are basically a compilation of our lives up to this point...it isn't ""real"" to me, because I have never experienced it like this before (cue the HARD anxiety this past month).

We're all learning to swim here. We're learning how to actually DO life again. I think we owe ourselves a lot of grace and compassion for this.

I could get better long enough for her to not be mad at me and then I’d be right back to drinking. I never was abusive, or attacked her, so why did it matter what I did to myself? Well I see now that I neglected every aspect of our relationship. I didn’t hold up my end of the bargain. She couldn’t stand by and watch somebody drink themselves to death. She tore into me and ended things  on the spot. And I sat there and took it without a fight. Things were going to be different this time. I told her point blank “ok.

I’ve just come to change my bedding and realised I’m confident enough in my sobriety I can take off the waterproof sheet. Two decades later than I’d prefer to be making this step (am in my 20’s) - but progress nonetheless.

I’ve also been offered the job I’ve been training for for 2+ years and I couldn’t be more excited.

I feel like an adult that’s finally got their shit together. I couldn’t have done it without the people on this sub, so thank you all.

To anyone still drinking / lurking; I used to be one of you, stuck in a cycle of hangovers and regret, perpetuated by the belief I wasn’t strong enough to stop. Well, I believe in myself now, so that means I believe in every one of you too.

Wanted people to know I was sober and saw the fuckedness that had become my life and was taking corrective steps.

Guy across the street was a heavy boozer (like me) who tended to get violent (not like me;  I was the solitary alcoholic).  After a string of the sheriffs showing for ""disturbances"", he approached me while I was working on my truck curbside.  Made sure he was reasonably sober before even talking to him.  I was actually more prepared to put him on his back in the street.   He wanted to know how I was doing it, how I was staying away from alcohol even though I was in the same shithole living conditions with the same annoying people with covid raging and life just a general sense of fuckery.   We talked about why we each drank and the respective results.  Neither outcomes were good.  Shocker, eh?

""Why should I quit drinking?  Nothing seems to get better, nothing changes.""

""Well, it's only been 93 days, but I can tell you this:  My life may not seem better, but it sure in the fuck isn't any worse.""

Once you get that little nugget (among many) through your thick skull, it's easier to approach each day as a huge success simply by not drinking.

So I definitely did 6 months, but the milestone got to me along with the hot weather and standing in shop queues behind people clutching their bottles of chardonnay. After first ""treating myself"" again, it was a matter of weeks before I was finishing a bottle in one go and then not sticking to my ""only on the weekend"" rule within the first month. I've been on and off ever since, sigh.

As a good sign though, my hangovers are now BRUTAL, which wasn't the case before my sober streak, so that's kept me from daily drinking but not from hitting the bottle. Friends, it's time to say hi, I missed you guys, and thanks in advance for your help and support through what I know now will be a challenge I can't meet alone. I'm on day 2 today.

These folks throw incredible parties. There’s atmosphere, whimsical displays, and activities to suit most types of partygoers. 

It was my first large party since the pandemic began and I got sober. Precautions were taken (must be vaxxed and boosted, negative rapid test day of) and there were probably sixty or seventy people who came throughout the night. Since leaving my partner in November, I have been enjoying solitude for the first time in years. Outside of work, I rarely see more than one person at a time. 

I made the decision to indulge in some MDMA at the party. For some, my actions count against sobriety per se, but since my issue was specifically with alcohol, it suited me fine. There were moments of temptation where I thought maybe one drink, why not try the forty foot piano liquor luge, but these moments were brief and I am proud of myself for staying strong. It’s thanks to all of you here that I could play the tape forward and see the brutal hangover in store for me if I decided to drink. 

The real problem was that the party was overwhelming. It was loud with voices and music crescendoing together to create a special type of cacophony. I used to drink to be social and find the person inside who could manage that atmosphere and have a great time. That isn’t me anymore. There were spaces at the party where things were quieter but even there I was overstimulated to the point that I couldn’t focus on conversation. Even the MDMA, which usually makes one excited and inviting of touch and conversation wasn’t enough to make me feel anything but a desire to go home to snuggle my cat in the softly lit quiet of my home. 

Here’s to putting the party monster who used to live inside me to rest. She’s gone and buried, and I don’t miss her like I thought I would. Here’s to quieter nights with small groups of friends. That’s the space where I can connect with the people I love. Here’s to sober me and sober you. We are out here doing the best we can for ourselves, learning as much from each other as we can on our way.",84,1

I feel awful. I have apologised and he was fine but the withdrawal made me feel so agitated and paranoid (can anyone else relate?) and then the phsycology behind avoiding alcohol (when I’m in the habit of opening a bottle of wine after a stressful work day (and not having that vice)) was making me feel a bit trapped. It made me feel defensive, where I was not allowing myself a drink, was stressed from work (without having my normal ‘destresser) and he’d been home all day and organised dinner his own way etc and I got in it felt as though nothing was on my own terms or I didn’t have my own space when I got in. I hate sitting in front of the tv after being in an office all day, but the weather is horrendous so couldn’t really do anything else. I have of course apologised and talked it over he is fine (he gets it), he works from home so understands sometimes we are on different wave lengths when I get home from a busy office. We both feel amazing for not drinking though so overall it’s worth it, I’m hoping it gets easier… and most of the advice shows the worst withdrawal symptoms stop by 72 hours so I’m positive about that. 

The good thing is I haven’t had so many nights sweats this time, which I usually get, that’s a plus. My body is de- swelling too.

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Wednesday Sober Society!  

Grace.  I like this word.  I like to give myself a little grace these days when I find myself giving ME a hard time.  I guess grace could come in the form of many things.  For me right now it’s giving myself grace to enjoy food 😂 as I’m sure many of you are as well.  I’ve indulged in ice cream with you all before I even knew ice cream was a go-to around here.  I delight in food much more now.  I actually finish my whole plate!  Getting full on drinking and taking home leftovers was my thing.   I also know I can’t keep that up because I don’t want to fatten up on delicious treats and big dinners.  I’ve even found myself exercising more.  I'm a little lazy, so consistently at least twice a week is success for me!  I am losing inches…slowly, but it’s happening.  Finally hitting the single digits number in my jeans!  Just a little bragging moment right there.  

I did quit drinking for one month last summer in June, and once my 30 days were up I went right back to it and with much more gusto.  So even though I haven't really tried moderation at this point in my life, I have a sneaking suspicion I won’t do as well as I think (or hoped) with that elusive idea.  So instead I focus on other things like walking more and getting on my bike.  Some weeks I’m killing it on my bike or walks.  Other weeks not so much.  Sometimes I have loads to do and I just sit there on my couch snacking and watching tv.  I tell myself I’m taking a mental break, and it’s true.  Thinking about alcohol all the time is exhausting.  Because I’m still in the phase of constantly thinking about alcohol.  My thoughts used to revolve around fighting intense cravings.  Now it seems to have shifted and just be about life in general sober and how to go about it.  

But through it all I’m giving myself understanding.  And you should, too.  I also keep thinking of the word compassion.   What is compassion?  Well, Google says it is sympathetic concern for the sufferings of others.   Are we not  suffering in a way?   We’re mourning a loss of our old way of life.  We've either shed completely or we're trying to shed our old self.  We’re no longer who we used to be.  There is a wonderful freedom from this toxin but also a grief there.  So I've decided to be more kind to myself.  Sometimes I’ll physically hug myself and say to me, “It’s okay, you’re okay and doing okay.”   Have you ever hugged yourself that way?  Give it a try.   I’m giving myself grace and compassion…and you should too.  We are on a journey many can’t fathom.   It takes much strength to navigate the seas of sobriety.  Take courage, loved ones.

I usually just stick to lurking but this one feels especially bad. 

This weekend I hung out with my partner's two best friends and one thing led to another so we all ended up drinking (a lot) and, well, I said a bunch of things I shouldn't have.

While talking to one of his friends thinking my partner wasn't listening, I basically said and questioned things my partner had told me in confidence. Needless to say I completely broke his trust. I hadn't actually been drinking for almost a month before this and I just assumed I was in the clear (ha!!!!). The following morning, he took the time and patience (God bless this man) to explain the things I did and said and he overheard (which I couldn't even remember)-- so I apologized profusely (multiple times). I hadn't breached his trust in the time we had been together and this feels like a new low. He'd never seen me in that state of... lack of control. He said ""I don't want to drink with you anymore"" -- which, it felt like taking a huge blow to the heart. 

At this point, I know I need to trust he actually forgave me and I won't do this again (or at least commit to trying) but the doom feeling is there. Will he leave me because I turned into a monster who doesn't deserve to be trusted and loved? Its been hard not to drink today given all the self-loathing. But we're back to day 2.

What do you all do to cope with shame and regret? Hurting a loved one and then trying to build all the trust back up. 

I could use some words of support. Listening we all fuck up and things will be okay. I don't know. I'm feeling pretty hopeless.

Edit- Just to add since people seem to identify I'm not all innocent. My drinking was the cause of many fights and rightfully so. I did not value things the way I should have. But I have commited to stopping that violent cycle. I always knew that it wasn't all me doing the damage in this marriage and I committed to making a better life for myself and for our family. But the drama increases while sober. Before I would just drink myself to exhaustion to forget about the situation I was in, knowing it would happen again.

That didn’t keep me from having insomnia that had me rolling around in my sweat. 

Today I felt fine for the most part in the morning, but the anxiety and dizziness was sinking in during afternoon. I had thrown up yesterday and today things decided to go the other way, quickly. So I’ve been doing everything to stay hydrated and force food down my throat since I’m running on low fuel.

I’m also not completely sure if this is from the medication I was given (the dizziness), but I wouldn’t have needed that medication in the first place if it wasn’t for the panicked mess alcohol got me to be. The alcohol and my anxiety are a package deal, and they always will be.

Hoping I can sleep tonight and feel a sense of normalcy. In the meantime, take my struggle as a sign to keep up your sobriety. Nothing is worth this at all.

Oh, and the doctor I had yesterday told me he was 8 years sober when I explained my drinking caused my anxiety. A handsome person with bright eyes and an upbeat personality. Sobriety looked great on him and I hope it will on me too.",6,0

What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life, see how our SD family is doing, and support each other. Share your good, your bad, and your ugly (or your pretty, or your future, or your funny, or whatever else is on your mind) with us below!

-----------------------------------------

**The Good:** Because of the compromised state of my health, I cannot go into my elderly mother’s assisted living home. Instead, I put two folding chairs and a small table out on the lawn, where she can come join me for coffee. It’s actually kind of fun.

**The Bad:** I have had more bad news about my immune system. It’s getting kind of demoralizing.

**The Tribute:** Back when I was in my twenties, I was sick with fear because my boyfriend (whom I loved deeply) was drinking too much. (Coming from me, that means drinking *a hell of a lot*—multiple vodka shots at 6:30 in the morning and completely blotto by 8:00 a.m., every day of the week). I could not get any of our friends to take me seriously about how dangerous this was—they all told me that he was a big, strong Marine (true), that he was fine (not true), and that I needed to take a chill pill. 

One night, in complete despair, I called the alcohol helpline and spoke to an empathetic man. I poured out my story to him, and he shared his with me, as well: his own boyfriend, whom he had loved deeply, too, also had a drinking problem. His boyfriend was fine on a Thursday and dead by Sunday. Volunteering at the helpline was the only way that he could cope with his grief.

This was the first time that I had spoken to someone who actually took me seriously about how dangerous the situation was, who believed me when I said I was on the edge of a nervous breakdown, and who understood how helpless I was to change the course of what I saw happening. (My Marine Corps boyfriend died from alcohol poisoning two months later.)

Fred Rogers (from “Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood”) said, “Always look for the helpers.” Once it came time to face my own drinking problem, I found a whole community of helpers here at r/stopdrinking. But that young man at the alcohol helpline was my original helper. In some ways, he launched my long journey towards sobriety all those years ago by validating for me exactly how dangerous alcohol is—and I have never forgotten him, his heartbreak, or his kindness toward me.",66,1

Lost in my mind I forgot I had wings I forgot I could fly I got locked in a cage of my own devise. I imbibed from the murky waters until inebriation and I went round and round in a perpetual state of intoxication.  The numbness masqueraded as courage and patience while my higher self mourned the time wasted. I don’t recall where I heard or read that “the only way out is through.” So through the pain I went and sometimes it seemed that life would only tighten the screws. It came to a point after falling and getting back up all scratched up and bruised where I finally understood that the only way out was through. I now consider this to be one of my greatest truths. There are no shortcuts and there is no excuse so I finally grew strong and got through.

And I have no friends without it. Our social lives are completely intertwined. Our professional lives are intertwined. I can’t maintain the status quo of my life without this component and it’s making me furious and so very, very resentful. 

I feel as though I cannot win. This is hopeless. All I want is a better life where I’m in complete control of my emotions, my decisions and my behavior. And this is being taken as some sort of act of war.

I was very used to being hungover. It was a nice change to feel productive again. I started eating healthy (keto + intermittent fasting), exercising, lost a good deal of weight, and have been taking my vitamins daily such as thiamine, b12, zinc, vitamin D, magnesium. I was slamming roughly 15 beers a day for at least a year, plus some shots, weed, occasional stimulants. I know I really did some damage. I fortunately didn't end up with pancreatitis and my liver function was just very slightly elevated. 

Anyway, fast forward to today. I can't escape this feeling that I was in this honeymoon phase and life feels pretty dull. I have been doing AA and I honestly don't feel like i'm reaping any benefits from it. I'm trying to stay focused and sober but the temptations to fill up my flask with some bourbon is increasingly getting stronger by the day. I was even thinking maybe introducing some pot back into my life to possibly mellow the cravings, but a lot of my pot use was in conjunction with booze, so idk.

There is a lot of drama happening in my family right now which i'm sure plays into this, but it didn't anchor down my mood as much as I feel it might be now. I have a brother who is suicidal, does heavy amounts of coke and drinking daily, was cheated on by his toxic bitch of a girlfriend for the umpteenth time, and my cousin has cirrhosis of the liver and isn't expected to live much longer. This all sucks and shit like this has been happening for a long time but I at least was able to wake up feeling positive about the day, at least until about 2 weeks ago.

I also ended up in the emergency room that night. I was suicidal and dangerously close to death. The ER kept me for about 7 hours until I could see the hospital's psychiatrist. He said, ""Go home and get sober.""

So I did. 

This past Friday I got a bill from the ER doctor's group, as they bill separately from the hospital, and the doctor's fee is $1015.71. It was noted on the bill that my health insurance refused payment. I sat there holding that bill in trembling hands, my anxiety growing, nausea creeping in. I have decent health insurance, why didn't they pay? 

So I called the insurance company and after being on hold for nearly 30 minutes a representative told me, in no uncertain terms, that unless I could provide documentation proving otherwise they did not see that ER visit as ""medically necessary"". 

That visit literally saved my life. 

But my mind immediately went to that dark, dark place that told me, Why even bother? What does it matter if you're working so hard to be healthy and sober? Why not have a drink, or 20? The health care industry just told you that you're not even worth the cost of a new set of tires. But I bet they'd pay for a bad bout of pancreatitis or something so WHAT'S THE POINT OF EVEN BEING SOBER? 

Sobbing, I left the house, got in my car and drove. I was within minutes of the store; I could have easily run in, grabbed a bottle, and gone straight back to the dark side. 

But I didn't. I went to the park. I called my sober friend and we talked for an hour. When we hung up I felt ready to go home. And I did stop at the store. 

But I only bought a Twix. 

I'm still reeling from this. For the most part these 97 days have been okay. But I was shown just how fragile my recovery is when I was faced with something as simple (albeit shitty) as beef with my health insurance company. And it's not about the money, although it's not like I have that amount to spare. It's about the fact that I've been told, anecdotally, for my whole life that if a mental health crisis arises it is a health crisis and treat it as such. Go to the ER. 

But now I have to prove that I had the right to be there when my life was hanging in the balance. 

I spoke with my therapist today and I feel confident that, with her help, this will all be resolved. It's an American health insurance company after all. But to see my life reflected in dollars and cents was a hard, hard thing to take in. 

Thank you for listening r/stopdrinking.

I feel like my drinking problem is pretty minor compared to a lot of people who suffer with alcohol use disorder, but it does cause some issues in my life.

I tried so many times to stop but honestly I do still have a lot of fun when I drink, and I behave myself. So instead of keeping on trying and failing to quit altogether, my plan is to drink only once per week and the deal is, every time I drink, I will spend a significant portion of the evening exercising or working out.

Working out after a few drinks makes me feel like I am at least offsetting some of the negative effects of alcohol abuse, and honestly, it makes the exercise more fun. Of course, I am being safe about it. There are no free weights involved or anything that can hurt me. Just my stationary bike usually with a resistance band attached to it.

As I got into my 40s I found myself aching more after runs, feeling worse the next day, and just not having the same energy as I did when I was younger. Then in summer of 2020 I had a hip injury caused by many years of running. Combined with the pandemic, well my drinking really ramped up. After recovering from hip injury, I tried running again, but the hip was alway sore, legs felt worse, and I figured it was time to hang up the running shoes. 

Fast forward to early this month (last drink on Nov 13th of 2021), I’m feeling more energetic than I have in years, so I start doing some short runs on the treadmill. I notice I can do 2 miles of running plus some waking without hip pain, and, amazing to me, my legs feel good and the next day I feel like I can do more. Then one day I feel great, and I tell myself I think I can run 5 miles….so 45 minutes later, I’m done with the 5 miles! I figured I would be hurting the next day (yesterday) and I woke up and my legs barely hurt at all. Another 3 yesterday and 4 today and I feel like my old self!

Now this might not be tied to not drinking,  it I sure think it is. I’m not dehydrated from drinking, my body can use it’s energy on healing muscles from working out and not ridding itself of toxins, I’m sleeping better which obviously helps with recovery, I’m not having the drinking shits, so my body is keeping the nutrients it needs, and best of all, my hip doesn’t hurt nearly as much! It’s amazing what the body can do when not drinking!

But I couldn't this weekend. I was out of town for an event and our leader decided we would all meet at the hotel bar to discuss our upcoming program. I didn't want to go, but if I didn't I would be missing out on important strategy planning of a project we have coming up. So, I had fear of missing out....but not of fun or companionship. Fear of missing vital information to this project we are doing.

So I went. And when the waitress came, I refused to even acknowledge her at first. Rude. But I was afraid I would order something I didn't want to if I did. I finally told her I didn't want anything and got an very awkward look from her. Everyone else ordered alcoholic beverages. And consumed them. In front of me. And it was torture. I was so distracted that I didn't even pay attention to what was said.

When there was finally a pause in the action, I excused myself from the table. But instead of leaving like I knew I should have, I went to the bar. While I was at the bar, everyone was ordering their second round. I got the attention of the bartender. She came over to take my order and......I asked her if she could make me a virgin margarita on the rocks. And she did. And that is what I returned to the table with. And then I ordered a second one from the waitress when she came around again about a half hour later.

And it worked. And I did it. I was very, very tempted to not include the ""virgin"" part of my order. But I did. And I didn't end up have 5-6 regular ones. And I didn't embarrass myself in front of everyone. And I didn't wake up with a hangover forcing me to drag ass all day. I actually did. I feel good about it. I wanted to share. But I also don't ever want to feel that level of temptation again. It is the most I have had since starting this journey this time around.

Then it’s like ‘responsibility is done for the day; time to chill-axe’.    I can even go on a week long scout trip where I’m not permitted alcohol at all and I’m totally fine—beyond the restlessness of a new and uncomfortable bed of the first few nights.  

I don’t have shakes or other signs of withdraw if I don’t drink 

My only sign or symptom is that I crave it once my day is done, when I’m at home, and that my total amount of consumption is hidden from my wife (who would criticize anytime I’d have more than 2 drinks)

Long story short, my partner ended our relationship out of the blue and he said some things that confirmed my worst fears about myself. 

I had already been struggling mentally and emotionally and this felt like the last straw. After he dumped me I sat in the parking lot and sobbed for a long time while internally debating what to do. In the past when I've felt this bad it feels like the only option is to drink to distance myself from the absolutely crushing emotional pain. Of course this is only a temporary, shitty band aid and I feel worse in the long run. 

It was really hard but I didn't drink. This isn't a great success story because I did use eating disorder behaviors to cope, but in the past I would have used alcohol on top of that and it would have exacerbated everything. I was considering relapsing into self-injury, too, but I managed not to. So I guess I'm making a tiny bit of progress. 

I spent the weekend with my mom (God bless her, she's a saint) and honestly I was a completely miserable mess but I knew drinking wouldn't make anything better.

I'm back to work today and my life is feeling slightly more manageable although I still have a long way to go. I know it's no huge accomplishment but I'm trying to cling to every little bit of positivity I can find.

It's my first career job and it is a huge factor as why I started heavily drinking to begin with. Happy hours with coworkers, lunches with beer or wine, brunches on the days before holidays with mimosas or screw drivers. It also was the kind of culture where you would openly talk about having that glass of wine after work - on days when it was hard and on days when it was fine. We started in an office and then went remote about a year prior to the pandemic, so it was also totally acceptable to start drinking wine at home at 3 in the afternoon or a little nip of baileys in the morning coffee for team meetings. I didn't fully understand until I got sober almost a year ago that one of my many triggers for drinking was my job. Now that I'm sober, not only is the alcohol still EVERYWHERE, but like a lot of things, it's been so isolating in the pandemic. 

The company I work for doesn't seem to care what happens to my team or my product or my clients unless there is a serious crisis, and my clients are educators, so it's almost a monthly crisis at this point. There is little direction, no professional development, no upward mobility for people like me, who work hard and are engaged, but to advance in this company, I would have to essentially quit this job anyway and go on to manage or lead a new team in an unrelated product and start all over again.  I do the same thing every day and  every day, I feel the same boredom deep in my soul. I don't care about my job performance anymore, and I've been 20 minutes late once a week for months. The actual work hasn't changed in 5 years and the product is being discontinued in some undetermined timeline down the future. I don't hate my coworkers or my boss, and the hours are stable, the money spends, and the insurance/benefits are OK, but I don't want to do this anymore. It's been the most soul crushing 6 months of my life. 

I've had 7 managers in 4 years due to their turnover, and when I talked to my current manager about this, she was like, get a bottle of wine, because it sounds like you're overthinking this situation. She knows I am sober now, and it was a really off putting conversation to have. I didn't realize how much of my drinking the last four years was caused by my need to numb myself enough to do this job.

In my heart and my brain, I know that this job, as stable as it has been, I've outgrown this job. I want to do something in another direction that I've been interested in for a while and I have a little cushion of money saved so I could quit today and just leave, but I'm also so scared, and this is an emotion I don't know how to process, since I've always numbed it out with alcohol or weed. What ifs are flooding my mind. What if this is the best I can get and I'm being so ungrateful? What if I don't find another job or a find a job that is worse and more than I can handle? What if I turn into my mom, who never held down a job for more than 4 months in her whole life and I end up homeless and debt-ridden, no future and no hope? What happens to my cats if I can't afford to feed them and me? What happens to this life I've worked so hard on? 

I feel so overwhelmed and bored and scared and crushed and ungrateful, but I am smack dab in the middle of this rope. There doesn't seem to be anywhere up the rope for me at this company, but it's a really far drop from here so I don't know if I keep holding on or let go. I don't know what to do, because all the options feel like they are setting me up to inevitably fail.",5,2

Yesterday my boyfriend and I hosted a game night. It was my 13th day sober. I got up and cleaned and prepared for the party. My boyfriend and I were arguing a lot. He was triggering me and so was the party.

I said fuck it. My dad situation, my boyfriend situation, the way the world is and my addiction got the best of me.

So, here I am again. Day 1. Nothing bad happened, everyone had a great time and I really enjoyed it. One person got way too drunk and fell and lit a cigarette in the house. Wasn’t me though. But I was easily on my way if I hadn’t recognized the wall between drunk and completely dysfunctional. I thank my work I’ve put in to being sober for that.

I don’t want to beat myself up, but it’s hard. I was so set on never ever drinking again. I’ve wasted half the day to a hangover. And the rest of it I will feel like shit. Mentally and physically.

There’s almost two bottles of leftover wine and a beer from the party. I’m already fighting myself about keeping it or tossing/giving it away.

I fucking hate alcohol.

I told my boyfriend that I need at least a month before we have people over like that again because I obviously couldn’t handle it (it was too triggering). He made me feel really stupid about it.

Anyways. I know pretending on here that I didn’t break won’t keep me accountable and I need support and accountability. Yesterday proved that I still have a lot of work to do. My sober muscles aren’t quite strong enough yet and I need to be very careful about the situations I put myself in. Even if they aren’t necessarily bad situations.

My 8 hours a day at work are the only 8 hours a day I’m sober and the pain was unbearable.

I have woken up today to find the pain in my feet and legs is already almost completely gone. The relief is amazing. I threw up one more time this morning but have been keeping down water and orange juice.

I have no way to access medical help during this detox so if things start to get bad I am going to try to wean off, but as of right now I’m approaching my 18 hour mark and feel surprisingly ok.

Work, kids, wife, more work, it has been a never ending cycle of rinse and repeat.

I didn't stay strong, I wavered and I crumbled to alcohol.

I like being sober, I loved being here with you all, reading your stories, your struggles, your accomplishments! I feel (felt) pride in you and in turn myself for this amazing journey we make together.

But alas, I relapsed.....

As we do, in secret, in the closet, and in the dark, alone....

I don't know how much longer I can lie to myself. I know I'm an alcoholic, I know this will kill me, I know my fiance will not tolerate it any longer, I know my son is hurt seeing me succumb to this, I know I hate myself everytime I drink again.

Yet I drink again, I've relapsed after being so high on myself and my feats.

But, curse you monkey, I once again am in a hole of self doubt, hatred, and frustration over this sickness I feel. I feel sick of I don't drink, and I feel even worse when I do.

I know this is probably the hole alcohol makes, but I am so fucking tired, so lonely, and so desperate for something else.

I won't lie and will tell you that I am severely depressed. I feel alone, I feel angry, I feel desolate and I don't like my life that I've built.

I don't know what to do, everyday is hard, everyday I don't want to move, everyday I want to drown in drunk to ease the pain and give up... I am so tired, and I am tired of feeling alone...

I brought a bottle of wine with me in my car to try to drink as much as I could before- god forbid- I had to be without alcohol at the dog park for 45 mins. I was so drunk I couldn’t even get out of the car and called my best friend because I needed help and needed to surrender and be done. She shared with me today, that when she picked me up I didn’t even recognize her. I had a glaze over my eyes and didn’t look like me. I had wine stains all over my shirt and my car. My car had empty wine bottles all over and smelled like throw up. She somehow got me and my dog in her car, and took me home and just let me sleep all day. 

I wanted to die the next day. Truly, wanted to not be alive. I could not handle the pain anymore. I just tried to get through the day sober. I started putting together days, with 2 AA meetings a day. 

I had already been to rehab twice, so I knew what I needed to do. Just stop drinking, no matter what. I slept all day for a couple of weeks. Ate a pint of ice cream for dinner every night. Watched tv all day. Just didn’t drink.

One freaking year sober today. I cried all morning. Just can’t believe I did it.

My best advice- immerse yourself in everything alcohol-free related. AA was important for me, but I stopped going after 8 months. In the beginning I went 2 times a day and met sooooo many women who were like me. I fought AA because I didn’t want my life to be obsessed with NOT drinking, but I also didn’t want it to be obsessed WITH drinking. I wanted a third option.

Education and changing your thinking is the key.

In addition to AA, read read read read. Read all the books that everyone recommends on here. Both memoirs (Drinking: a love story was my first book) and non fiction (alcohol explained and the naked mind).

I would read the Reddit every morning and night.

I also started listening to sober podcasts. Recovery elevator saved me. Make sure you start from the VERY BEGINNING- episode 1. And work your way backwards.


My first dinner out, I felt like my skin was crawling not being able to have a glass of wine. I literally thought I was going to implode.

Then all of a sudden one day, not drinking is normal. Your routine builds up and you don’t even think about alcohol anymore. That’s something I wish someone told me more in the beginning, it truly gets easier. You just stop thinking about alcohol after a while. You really have to work so hard and learn as much as you can, but it happens.

If I can do it, anyone can

Being sober was going really well. I was sleeping well, walking a lot of steps daily, eating well, keeping up with all my responsibilities and getting out for hikes on the weekend.    
Then there was a death in my family. My online course felt too overwhelming to keep up with. I started to fall out of my good routines.   


Then I drank 1 night. I tried to resist. My partner and I had both admitted we were thinking about it then he went and bought some. I sat for a couple hours, glass of wine already poured but trying to resist, knowing I didn’t want to throw away my progress and start the cycle. 
   
Caved. Told myself it wouldn’t happen again. Blackout, don’t remember going to bed. The next morning I felt so crappy. Tried to power through but drank again “to take the edge off”. Blacked out again. Argued with my partner. Don’t remember going to sleep again. Attempted to go for a walk and do some chores the next day but still felt so off. Anxious, even my vision felt weird, my entire body felt weird. So we drank again. Not as much as the previous nights. It didn’t really make me feel any better but I do remember going to bed.    

This has to come to an end now. It’s so easy to fall back into the cycle of feel crappy, drink, feel crappy from drinking, drink again. It feels like life on hard mode. Basic responsibilities feel so so difficult. Just trying to keep my plants and fish alive and not let my home turn into a total wreck feels so hard but it is the bare minimum. All I want to do is curl up in bed but the anxiety is so bad there’s no way I can sleep the day away.

It's that irk every time I hit a milestone.  The ""yeah, I did it!"" and then I'm in uncharted territory.  This span, after 69ing, I've done before.  But much beyond that...

My best was 78 days last year.  I have a vacation next week, so I'm pretty safe to 90 and 100 days.  But.  It's the worry of how I'll feel then.

The ""What now?""

This recovery, at least, has been the easiest so far.  Two recoveries ago, I was still putting together a ""how to recover"" strategy.  Last recovery, I was tried to fall back into those slowly forming habits.  And this recovery, it's building upon those successes.  But beyond around now, I'm not sure where to go.

Won't lie, I certainly have those ""what is the point of living"" whispers.  The ""where am I going?""  The ""well, I can always 86 myself if I can't handle it.""  My depression isn't crippling, but I'm always on the lookout for intrusive thoughts.  (If it must be said, my depression was FAR FAR worse when I was perivodka.  I am almost mentally STABLE now!)

I don't have any cravings.  But I didn't (have any cravings before my) last relapse, either.  Until I did have cravings.  I knew it was going to be a binge, that one shot would mean a dozen, but I did it anyway.

So forgive me if I sound like a pair of 'noids.

I know the DayCounts can be intimidating, but I overall feel there's no gatekeeping here.  Remember, veteran sobernauts and those that are sobercurious:  we're all one shot away from the same fate.

Went to the ER, expecting them to commit me and medicate me. Nope. Gave me some lorazepam thru an IV, a script for TWELVE librium, and told me to kick rocks. 

NOT ONLY THAT. They gave me instructions to follow up with a detox center the next day, so I did. They said the soonest they could get me in with the doctor that was recommended, was in fucking APRIL. Like what am I supposed to do until then, just keep drinking my life away? I asked for a different doctor and they gave me an appointment for a week later.

My prescription said to take four pills daily as needed. So I did. But when I went to get a refill, they said they couldn't because ""it's a powerful sedative"". Apparently the doctor neglected to tell me I was supposed to TAPER the pills. I thought they were supposed to hold me over until I could get admitted. 

So I did a self-administered taper. The first two nights were the worst. Horrible anxiety, tremors, shivering, and the HALLUCINATIONS man. When I turned my bedroom light off, it looked like my room was covered in spider webs, with HUGE translucent spiders crawling all over them. Shadow people walking around everywhere, bugs and rodents on my floor. Didn't get a wink of sleep. So the bulk of my pills were used for the first two nights. Didn't stop the hallucinations but did help the anxiety a lot. Went from that to one pill a day before bed. Last one ran out the night before last. Slept like a baby last night, feel fucking great today. 

Im still gonna follow up with the detox center, but mainly just to make sure everything is right with my health so I can get back to work. I'm taking daily methyl b12 sublingual drops and a multivitamin to replenish my thiamine, vit A, folate, etc. I have ZERO desire to drink. Not even a little. Tbh I got sick of drinking long before I took the plunge of quitting. 

The anxiety hits still sometimes and I get really irritable, but other than that I feel great. Weirdly enough, my appetite came back with a VENGEANCE. Like I just eat and eat and eat all day long. It feels great because the gastritis from the alcohol RUINED my appetite for so long. It's so great waking up and not having my stomach burning and nauseous. It's great waking up feeling alert and ready to take on the day. It's just, really fucking great feeling sober. Not needing to worry about buying alcohol every few days just to stay afloat.

If you're still considering quitting but are afraid, don't be. See a doctor, a rehab center. Help is out there, you're not alone.

However, I did experience strange sensations that are difficult to describe in words plus the usual symptoms like terrible anxiety and nights sweats.

I know this community is almost obligated to recommend involving a doctor in this process but it is really impossible at the moment. I am living abroad with my partner and we are both recently unemployed and money is unbelievably tight (I’ll eventually have to leave and get employment in my home country). I am strongly considering tapering but an accelerated version since I’m scared a more gradual version would simply continue this current binge. 

I’ve been consuming approximately 750ml-900ml of light 27% abv rum for the past week to week and a half. Today I cut down to 375ml. I have one more smaller 250ml bottle for tomorrow. Still undecided to taper at least one more day beyond that or just cutting it after tomorrow. Honestly the thought of consuming more makes me nauseous which is a surprising good sign.

Just a recap: I’m at square one again and terrified of the next few days. My partner knows the situation and will observe me. Also, we live super close to a hospital which is obviously an ideal safety net. But I haven’t a clue how we’d pay the bill.",8,0

And I was jealous y'all.  For the first time since I quit drinking on Jan 15 I was so tempted to just say eff it, grab a table with my husband and join in on the fun!  But I ""played the tape forward"" as I've read so many times here.  About how I'd want to stop and grab another bottle of champs on the way home to watch my Sunday night shows drunk.  How I'd sleep like garbage.  How I'd feel at work this week.  How I'd hate that I gave in to the call of the wild.

Getting sober is forcing me to reevaluate who I spent my time with, how we never did anything without drinking, all of the money I threw away every Sunday to get wastey, I mean hell it was part of our identity.  Going back through my old FB posts I always had a drink in my hand with my ""friends.""  Inevitably someone would end up in tears over a man.  One time I witnessed an acquaintance yell at her kids in public and her ex-husband had to be called to pick them up - they were sobbing, begging their mom to stop drinking.  It was so sad.  But we never blamed the alcohol.  Oh no you can't go there.  She just needed to learn how to manage herself.

Another time during a Sunday Funday I took a shot of tequila after all the mimosas I had downed and got sick in the restaurant bathroom.  Classy.

And yet another time I made the smart decision to get drunk at brunch with my FWB, pick up someone's baby at the bar, have him ditch me there (not the baby lol) and text him relentlessly and show up at his house uninvited.  His roommates had to call me a cab and ask me to leave.  I was blocked everywhere after that.  

I still cringe when I think about all of the stupid ways I embarrassed myself when I got drunk on a Sunday.  But I really wanted to this weekend.  So glad I didn't.

Drinking has ramped up in the past couple of years. 4+ beers almost everyday, with plenty of days that were stupidly excessive.  I've felt sick, embarrassed, physically and mentally unhealthy.  Yet, I keep doing it, over and over.  I took a month off in November, and it was fantastic.  I slipped back into bad habits in December, and they became even worse in January and February.  I'm flat out effing sick of it.

I'm writing my goal here, just to put it out there. To make it real. I want to go 6 weeks without alcohol. Reasons for this are to improve physically, mentally and emotionally. I want to lose 10 lbs in that time.  I will keep a daily ""Drink Journal"" that includes how I slept and feel when I wake up, a check box for slamming 32 oz of water first thing in the morning, workout for the day, food eaten that day, productivity, and thoughts in general.  I've written out a list of triggers so that I avoid them, or not cave to cravings by being aware of them.

So, today is day 3.  My liver feels not great, but better.  Waking up not hungover is awesome.  I've played guitar, about to hit the gym, and have a list of things to do.

At the end of 6 weeks/10lbs, I'd like to think that I could indulge on social occasions, with a 4 drink limit.  I'm concerned that will lead to slipping back into habits, like stopping at the store after work, going to a restaurant with drink specials for lunch on my days off.  Honestly, I'm just going to focus on getting through 6 weeks, one day at a time, and will cross that bridge when I get there.

Guess that's it.  Feel free to join me if you're ready to make a change.  Let's do this.",14,0

Things I should know better by now: 

* Not to make a recipe that calls for wine, because if I go to the package store to get cheap cooking wine, I'll also get a bottle (or two) for myself. 
* Not to open that first bottle, because if I do, I will finish it, and I won't stop at the first bottle, either.
* Not to open the second bottle, because if I do, I'll brown out and make a fool of myself. 
* Not to assume my sister/housemate couldn't tell I was drunk. I'm sure she could tell. 

The worst thing about this disease/addiction (whatever you want to call it) is the depression the day after. The headaches are bad, sure, but I'm used to headaches. The depression is the worst.

I’ve spent the last couple of years trying to convince myself that it isn’t that bad, that I’m not an alcoholic like my father (he just hit his first year of sobriety), that I have it together but, after waking up drunk for the third day in a row, I’m finally ready to say that I have a problem and that I need to stop.

I’m calling the place that I use to go to for therapy on my lunch break. I was better when I was there even though I was lying to him about the amount that I drank. He had to have known anyways; one of the last times I went, I was still drunk from the night before and I am sure I stunk of scotch.

I don’t know why this time is different. I’ve been in the same cycle for almost ten years but this is the first time I’ve actually… wanted to stop. I’ve quit before; a week there, a month there, but I always knew I was going to drink again. This time, I just don’t want to anymore. My kids are young (Jesus, I didn’t even take them to preschool yesterday because I wanted to drink and I knew I’d have to pick them up.), my wife loves me (although I can tell she hates how much I drink. Her face when she wakes me up from the couch says more than she would ever actually say), and life is overall good. I should be content but I just keep reaching for the bottle and making my own life worse.

At this point last year, I had my first slip up the day before after a 10-day streak. This time, I didn't want to same thing again of having my body readjust for a week after stopping drinking again. Every day has been hard fought to try and get to this point.

This group has helped me tremendously. It helped me just switch my thinking to I just won't drink today. Just today. That simple mindset made this journey a lot more scaleable. In June, I really started getting help for my mental health and trying to get at the issues that caused my drinking to become problematic (a lot of anxiety with a mixture of depression and a bit of trauma). Some days are better than others, but there are moments where my control over my anxiety threatens to break and I want to just have one drink to numb myself temporarily.  But the simple mindset of I will not drink today or not even that minute or that hour helps me get past those. Then, after 6 months, it became a matter of pride after it seemed like something I could actually do. I didn't want to throw away months' worth of work. I also started back at the gym in June and that has been slow progress too. But all this work has been for the positive (even though I hate working through my emotions a lot).

A year later, I haven't lost a ton of weight like I wish I had. I still struggle with my anxiety every day. But I took a picture of myself last year when I quit. I look at myself then and now. I look so much better than I did a year ago. It may not be much, but it is progress, and I'm better for it. A part of me still hopes that one day I might be able to have a beer with friends at a BBQ and that will be it. I just know that isn't right now. 365 days done. Looking forward to conquering 366 days.

However, this time around I’m unable to avoid stress. I’m overloaded right now with too much. And I just want to be isolated, but I can’t escape. So I’m just venting. 

a) My job site had some sudden turnover so now I’m working my job site open to close with no help AND training new people (I absolutely hate training new ppl) because my manager is on maternity leave. I’m now having to work 50-65 hours a week.

b) I’m standing up in my best friend’s wedding and 5 of my friends from out of town are staying with me. 

c) I’m feeling guilty for dreading the wedding. It’s stressing me out and I just want it to be over with. And the triggers it’s going to provoke. Feeling this way about my childhood friend’s wedding makes me feel overly self-involved, but I can’t help it.

d)I have to clean the house for the guests staying over. It’s overwhelming me and hiring a house cleaner to do it for me would just create more work. Plus I’m too stressed to do that, so it’s easier for me to just clean it myself even though that’s stressful already.

e)I have a side hustle doing digital graphics and suddenly I’m getting an influx of orders I have to keep up with every day. All while working 50-65 hours a week and dealing with the other stuff. 

f) I feel guilty, self-involved, and bratty for being so unhappy about all of those above things, because most of them are good and positive thing.

 Good morning. 
 Our keynote is: 
“Humbly say to ourselves many times today, ‘Thy will be 
done’,….”
 The Meditation for the Day warns against failing God because of our doubts and fears. 
 Just as it is with faith and gratitude, I have no immediate control over feeling trust in God.
 However, I don’t believe I fail God just because my thoughts, feelings and beliefs are clouded by doubt. I fail God, others and myself only when I allow waning mental faith to prevent me from behaving as the Divine Spark directs.
  My God gives me control over only one thing in this universe, which is my own next action.
 God does not give me immediate control over my mind, and, based on my experience, does not judge me on something I cannot control.
 If I persist in taking my next action as one who trusts God would do, I am trusting in God, regardless of what is going on in my mind.
  The person I am, to the world and God, is defined solely by my actions, not the crazy picture show in my head.
 By behaving trustingly, I enjoy all the magic of trust and am eventually returned to the comfort of feeling that trust.

I didn’t get into any huge trouble from drinking, my blood levels were kinda fucked though, but nothing the GP said wouldn’t clear up with 3 months sober. 
Like, 3 months ago I would just be drunk from the second I woke up until the second I passed out at night, and probably the entire time I was asleep. And I’d make all the usual excuses, the plans to moderate and take days off that would never pan out. Probably 25-30 standards drinks a day, as a 27 year old woman. 

I guess, has anyone else had this experience of giving up and then almost being like “oh well maybe I didn’t need it that much anyway”?

Personal story time… I went to the hospital for alcohol withdrawal yesterday (first time). The first doctor just told me to quit (super helpful, thanks!) and there was nothing he could do. And accused me of lying. 

The second doctor came in and told me they they’re seeing SO MUCH of this because of the stress the last few years. She said “you’re not alone. I will help you” and gave me some meds in my IV to stop shaking and then wrote me a Rx to help at home. I sobbed because I was so grateful. 

Like, what the actual fuck.

For contest, I’m a young mother of two with an advanced degree who has NEVER sought help of this magnitude before. I’m not a repeat patient. I just needed some help. 

But that doctor just decided that I didn’t deserve it and that I needed “willpower”. 

So, bless all of the nurses and doctors out there that have compassion.  You might have saved my life and kept my children with their mother.

ETA that I don’t think that repeat patients don’t deserve help too!! Of course they do.

At first I felt great, I was enjoying the challenge of being sober. I changed my routine to keep busy, joined a gym, slowly starting to get my physique back, booked to climb a mountain in Italy in July of this year. I needed something to focus on and keep motivated for. 


Now that the novelty of being sober has worn off I'm just sad all the time. I find no pleasure in doing anything that I used to find pleasure in. I find it hard to be able to be intimate with my partner while sober so I make excuses when she makes advances or wants sex. Our relationship has been strained since I got sober because I just don't feel like I'm the same person I was when I was drinking. We met and got together when I was drinking so she has never really known me sober. She's an amazing woman and we have so much in common and such similar interests and backgrounds. But I just push her away time and time again.


Getting together with family is tough when we go out for meals etc because they all drink, and while I have no desire to drink, I can't be on the same level as them because, well, they're all drunk and it's just annoying. Being the only sober one in a group of drunk people you realise how much crap people talk when they're drunk. It usually ends up with me making excuses and going home because I just don't want to be around them. 


I just feel so fucking lonely. Lonely when I'm with people and lonely when I'm not. 


Can anyone else relate to this? Can anyone offer me any advice? Can anyone just tell me that it will get better, because as it stands I don't want to live this life as it is. I want to be happy again.

Yesterday I made a doctors appointment to follow up after my hospital experience last month in which I blacked out and ended up at the ER.  Wanted to have blood work done and just make sure that I didn’t do permanent damage.  Well power steering feels sluggish.  SO has been driving vehicle ‘I didn’t notice anything wrong with it’ seems like power steering fluid is almost empty…. Ugh borrowed SOs vehicle made my appointment waiting on results on labs but GP said that he’s not to concerned.  SO goes to the car to see if there’s leftover alcohol in it in the middle of the night in which we find out our apartment had the vehicle towed because the parking permit they gave us was already expired.  Can’t do anything about that for a few more hours.  But then had to have the conversation with my SO that they should not be driving my vehicle when it’s low on fluids and to just stop at the tow place on the way to work and pick up their vehicle.  Just trying to talk logic when their drunk but don’t really think they are is beyond irritating and gosh I was sleeping real good before I got woken up to that.

I officially hit one month Sober as of Sunday, which is a great achievement, I am starting to see the benefits already,  especially since I started working out around two weeks in and eating more healthier. 

The issue comes in when ""The Voice"" in my head starts to try entice me into ""Moderation"". I know myself well enough that I cannot moderate for shit, and I am glad I have finally realized that, but it does not make it any easier. Especially over the weekends, mainly Friday and Saturday. My question is, does it get any easier with time or does the voice become at least a little easier to ignore as I go on? I was expecting it to be hard, but did not realize that with all the years of weekend binge drinking that I had trained my brain that much that it automatically thinks about drinking once the weekend comes.

Been reading here last few days. So like 6 years ago I stopped drinking. The first 4 years, I didn't drink at all. Then, up until recently I only had a celebratory drink here and there. But I got the itch to have a drink this past weekend and 1 drink turned into 10. Holy hell-my entire mind, body and soul hated me the next day(s).

It's like my brain went dumb. Focus? Forget it. Hand-eye coordination, gone. I don't know if anyone will know what I'm talking about - but even my vision felt shaky. Along with my vision, my hands and legs were unsteady - like a baby horse learning to walk.

I felt emotionally drained. Before having these drinks - I was fairly mentally stable. After drinking? I felt intense guilt. The kind that makes your heart hurt. I'm having like flashbacks to being drunk and it's giving me anxiety as if I suffered some kind of trauma - even though I didn't (aside from maybe what I put my liver through.) The emotional aspect is so severe that I feel like the only way through them is to isolate myself for a few days until they are back in order. My whole shit was thrown out of whack.

That's not even including the inability to sleep even though you feel beat and exhausted. Or the headaches. Or that stomach ache where you feel super hungry but have no appetite? I mean wtf is that? I'd also like to point out - a side effect I never had before - but I felt fever-ish.

ALL of these negative side effects... and for what? I have never appreciated being sober more than I do now. I didn't drink for a long time and I haven't felt any of these awful side effects for so long that I  underestimated how bad a ""hangover"" is. It's been 48 hours and I'm only starting to feel better - still not 100% though.

I'd basically say Ive stayed on a steady binge since 16 or 17, at least 4-5 drinks a night with some breaks in between. I'm moderately successful, job stress in the restaurant industry always keeps me running back for a brew... Or 6 or 7.

I sobered up for my ex-wife like 10 years back. Was the most productive I ever was in my life for that period, and essentially put myself on easy street. If I keep current pace I'll be able to retire at 40, not in my plans really though. Because I own property and restaurants, I can't really ""hit bottom"" (I suppose I could, but it would be a drastic stretch for a steady alcoholic) I just maintain at like a 6 pack of high alcohol content beer and maybe one or two shots a night. 

I've gained a lot of weight back since sobriety, but I'm not obese by any stretch. Went from like 5% body fat to like 15%. I've lost interest in most everything but social or drinking alone and gaming. I'm still very successful in my industry and am doing better than my competitors in terms of (the big killer right now) employee retention and sales.

I'd like to stop drinking daily to get back into my size 30 pants and just to have some positivity towards life, but I can't seem to find the motivation. After therapy for a couple years and different diagnoses, I guess I'm depressed and have high levels of anxiety coupled with adhd, but I don't really like labels. I've always felt the tension from my anxiety and ""adhd"" have been some of the things that made me successful in the quick service food industry. 

I guess I'd just like to be able to get back to the place I was, waking up early, working out before work, killing the game at the restaurant, and generally feeling happy. 

Yet every day, I find myself back at the convenience store, buying the same six pack, going home to my loving girlfriend and my dogs, drinking all night, feeling hopeless in the morning. Idk why, but I need to break the cycle booze has on my mental health, although I've managed it from making me seriously in a bad spot. 

Idk. Sorry for the rant. I guess I'm hoping some can relate. I feel numb to the world and like I'm just going through the motions of life. I can't really complain because I've built myself up to be well off, but I just feel generally unhappy and booze is always the solace at the end of the day.

I’ve permanently ruined all sorts of chances at my greatest life goals and desires. 

I don’t know if I drink quite heavily enough to get withdrawals, or have for long enough. Or, if I will, I don’t know whether or not they’ll be dangerous. Admittedly, I know nothing of what it takes to be at that point. I’m going to talk to my doctor tomorrow, and I hope he can shed some light on that. 

If I have to go to a detox and/or rehab, I think I’ll lose my job and quickly wind up homeless - which I’m right on the cusp of anyways, because I spend all my money on alcohol and drugs - and I can’t take any time off from work. I’m already on the chopping block there for showing up drunk/hungover, and calling out/going home early a lot. 

So I’m kind of hoping I can do this without detox/rehab. I know you can’t give me advice regarding that on this subreddit, and I’m not sure if there’s one where I could get it. I’m just venting the situation here. 

I’m tired of drinking being the highlight of my day. And I’m tired of drinking ruining my life, mood, overall happiness, success in life, physical and mental health, relationships, and everything. Support in my life is very, very slim. A couple friends at most. And then about 20-30 people who actively make the problem way, way worse lol. 

I want to get 100% sober and clean, that’s all I know. I want to heal, and fix my life and be a better version of myself. And I know why. I just hope that’s enough to survive on. And when that *other* guy shows up who prefers to drink? I hope I can consistently out maneuver him with self-understanding and an awareness of the situation. But that scares me, because consistency ain’t my strong suit. I just wish I could snap my fingers and be sober and fixing my life.

Other than the weekend-warrior dorm-room drinking in college, and a 4 year stint of heavy drinking when I thought I was the king of the world, I spent most of that time just being a 2 beers a night kind of person...up until this pandemic shut-in. Now, I might have missed a half dozen days of work due to alcohol in that 36 years, NEVER drove drunk, and the last time I puked from drinking was about 8 years ago (crazy party)....so I never really felt like I had a problem until this last December when I opened my eyes and realized I was up to 5-7 drinks a night (hard-A and beer) and realized that was solid for about the last year; increasing since the pandemic started, I figure. So, for the sake of my gizzard, I decided to stop drinking (especially for no reason/alone). 90% of the time I was just on the computer and drinking alone. So, I found some (really crappy) NA beers and got one to stick so stopped entirely for January of this year, and have had 3 drinks in February so far. I did not really read up or learn much about the whats and whys and expectations of quitting, but I can say this. My brain is on fire. Not pain, but it is racing 19 hours a day. I think the last 36 years I have had ""control rods"" in the form of alcohol keeping it at bay...but now I have a conundrum. I like how my thinking has opened up to a broad-band type of awareness. I can multitask, I can remember stuff better, and I can get things done instead of putting them off. But...I can not shut it off. My 5.5 hours of sleep went to about 4 now (I have learned I have to nap or sleep long weekends if I can). I wonder if that is why I started drinking in the first place, because my childhood was a blur and my school was boring (easy), and I was hyper and such. There is probably an acronym that would be applied to me if I were a kid today. When I turned 19ish I started drinking and I can only think that maybe it helped calm me and I liked it?

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Happy Tuesday Sober Society!  Another week of sobriety for me and congratulations for many of you out there.  I’m starting to get a little brave and hit up one of my old haunts.  We live in a beach town.  My daughter and I would go to a restaurant/bar down the street by the water that is kid and dog friendly and we love the food.  I’m trying to “get out there” and push myself because I like to be out and about.  I just am relearning how to do it sober.  It’s not yet summer, but we just had a week of weather in the 80s.  That's how it is in SoCal.  Summer and heat is a huge trigger for me.  I tell myself I need to be active because I enjoy the water and its activities.  It will just be something new for me to do without a drink in my hand.  But I believe it can be done!  And it is being done.  The waitresses know us and came to hug us and say hi.  I didn’t feel awkward ordering my sprite instead of my regular IPAs and Jack and cokes.  There was no “where’s your beer” questions, no “let’s take a shot” suggestions.  I even met my friends with their kids who had their own beers.  (the friends, not the kids lol)  It gave me just a bit more confidence to know I can do that and make it without being assaulted in my head for an intense craving.  

Although with all that positivity said, I don’t think it’s a situation I will be putting myself in as often as I was there before because as much as I’d hate to admit, it is a very slippery slope.  I still have to keep my guard up.  It’s important not to fool myself.  I am the brick house in the Three Little Pigs story.  Alcohol will huff and puff in order to try to get in.  Alcohol will disguise itself in form to try and enter my dwelling.  Alcohol is a sneaky little devil and likes to attempt to trick me or to outright convince me.  It tempts me with thoughts of fun or relaxation and encouraging thoughts of “I got this now,” but it’s a persistent pest that will say anything it can to get me back in its clutches.  It ain’t gonna happen.  Like playing sports, I must always play defense to protect myself.  Because we are at war…at war against a common enemy that wants to take us down.  Well, not today!  Let’s keep our motivation to avoid the poison that is alcohol going strong, and I’ll end today with a little giggle.

“People often say that motivation doesn’t last. Neither does bathing. That’s why we recommend it daily.”

Turns out many of them indicate possible internal bleeding, liver damage, or at the very least, prolonged damage to my insides (given that I already have GERD and many other things of the sort). 

I have a doctors appointment in a few days to either ease my possible hypochondria or begin treating whatever damage I have done to myself.

I hit rock bottom by maxing out my two credit cards. I can't afford to drink anymore. I've always wanted to stop (to lose weight, to not hate my body, to save money, to not feel like garbage every day) but there was always an excuse. Now I literally cannot afford it, so I have to make a change.


I found a small solace: CBD drinks have given me all the good parts of alcohol (releasing me from my anxiety, allowing me to relax and focus and be calm) without all the negatives.


Day 1, I had chills and shakes, was crippled with anxiety, my anger was overwhelming and every little thing made me irritable.


Day 2, the shakes continued and the chills were still there. Still angry at every little thing. CBD helped the anxiety in the evening at least, but it took me hours to fall asleep


Day 3, today, the anxiety is still there as always, but I feel more refreshed and present/mindful.  The shakes and chills are frustrating but manageable. Focusing on one day at a time is helping.


This post is a little chaotic and messy, but I think it'll help me stick with it if I make a conscious effort to put myself and my recovery somewhere permanent, rather than just telling myself yet again that I'll quit. If I post here more I can hold myself accountable.

I'm 51 days sober today, and alcohol has really ruined a lot of aspects of my life, I'm not going to get into detail but I have spoken about it in other posts. Like many people here, I had a very real obsession with alcohol, and since quitting drinking I feel like I am having to entirely reinvent myself as a person.

Well I have a friend/coworker, we'll call him Joe, and he's been pretty supportive of my journey so far. In outings, I know he could tell I drank a lot, and since we used to go out on the weekends he was one of the first people I decided to tell so that he didn't think I was flaking on him. 

Joe's new years resolution was to cut down on alcohol, and he told me he's only drank 3 times in the new year. Since he's moving, he planned two going away outings, one for friends and one for coworkers, they both took place at bars. A couple days ago he got really trashed at his friend-going-away party, which I attended but just spent drinking non-alcoholic beers.

Today we went for lunch, and my sobriety came up, and he said he was thinking of becoming sober like me. I said ""for the rest of your life?"" because that's my plan, and he said yes.

He said he's only had wine a few times this new year barring his going-away parties and that he thinks he's just going to stop forever, ""except drinking a little bit because I'm going to try and get a job at a brewery and I'll probably have to taste stuff.""

And guys, I don't know why the hell that made me so mad, but it did. I felt like he was trying to relate to me but wildly misunderstands how crippling my struggle is. Oh, you can just work at a brewery? I cried on the way home from your going away party because my life feels worthless when I can't drink. I have to watch the amount of kombucha I drink because I will down a barrel of it on the off-chance hope that it'll come close to a 5% beer.

You can just have a few tastes of the alcohol you're serving and still be sober? I got fired from being a bartender over my drinking. A BARTENDER, the one job where drinking at work is acceptable, and I even took that too far.

I feel angry, and it makes me more angry that I can't express this to anyone else except you guys. I know its gatekeepy of me, and petty, and that I should just be happy that my friend is making a positive change in his life, but for some reason it just feels diminutive to me.

I feel bad, I feel like a bad person. Am I insane that this upset me? I think if anyone knows why this hurt me it might be you guys. Do you know what i mean?

longer version: almost 6 months in (yay!!!!) and i have my first girlfriend in 10 years (first meaningful, supportive and loving relationship of my life)... I've heard the term ""gifts of sobriety"" and i feel like i'm receiving them daily. however, I'm writing to share a hiccup with the community for feedback: 

my gf drinks 1-3 drinks max maybe once a week, she can easily drink one beer and be done with it. when i'm with my friends i never feel tempted or even like i'm missing out when they drink but with her it's different. i feel anger towards her that she can drink so easily and responsibly. I've had to work hard to believe that alcohol is not a comfort support, or happiness, yet i see her waltzing to the hot tub with a beer in her hand, wondering why she wants to drink at all. on one hand i'm angry she drinks around me because her drinking makes me think she's not on my team. i also ask myself what is the moment missing that alcohol would fill for her (she says nothing, I've asked his question). i'm also jealous that she can drink so lightly without bother, and i can't.  on the other hand, i don't care if ANYONE around me drinks, except her.  I've been to bachelor parties, work trips to vegas, met new friends all unphased yet she goes to the hot tub with beer and i'm sideways. we've talked about this a little bit but i can't help but put her in a separate bucket from my friends, which i believe is unfair to her (what's her drinking have to do with me?).

this leads me to believe my discomfort with her drinking has more to do with me than her. i used to drink a lot during relationships because they were so uncomfortable for me (anxious + avoidant attachment style). in general, i feel so much feel better, much more comfortable in my skin, i wonder if the desire to drink around her is to numb the intimacy or to put some distance between us and nothing to do with her actual drinking. my solution will be to continue to grow close to her emotionally despite the discomfort and despite the occasional craving, in the hopes the craving will subside one day. i also plan to discuss this a bit more with her if it seems appropriate and i will absolutely discuss this with my therapist. if i'm dangerously close to crossing a line I'll also call a friend, post here, etc but that's not a worry, at all. the worry is how intimacy creates cravings.

I had just gotten a promotion, and this black out was the final straw for me after many years of problem drinking. 

I cut my hair short, got in to therapy and really leaned into what made me… me. I read a lot of “quit lit” in the beginning, as well as several books on my shelf I’ve been meaning to read. I also learned to listen to my intuition more and it hasn’t led me astray yet! 

I got pregnant, had a beautiful baby girl, and we just celebrated her first birthday. We also have a 3-year-old and I show up for her every. single. day. 

I’ve also leaned into my hobbies more and have gotten comfortable with my introverted-ness. I no longer need to drink to “fit in” (which we all know lasted maybe an hour before I was a hot mess). Truly amazing. 

One of the most comforting things I’ve learned in two years is that there are sober people all around you, you just might not know it yet. In the early days, I was so alone in thinking I was the only one who had a problem. But, that’s not the case at all.

I’m also getting really honest and realizing how much of a problem I had. I justified my drinking, found loopholes in the surveys (“Do you find you can’t stop drinking after you start?” Well of course not, I planned to drink all night!), hid my drinking, and functioned pretty well. I quit for 90 days (which stretched around 100) to “take a break and reset,” then started drinking occasionally…then frequently…then daily. Again.


After one embarrassing night and a string of hangovers, I quit. I said I was quitting for a year, but I meant for good.


The thing is, I’m realizing that I am reluctant to say I’m done for good or admit how serious my drinking was…because that closes the door forever. Then if I drink again it’s a relapse, not just the end of my little experiment.


I have no desire to drink and can’t really imagine why I would, but now that I admit to myself I had a serious drinking problem for years and finally got sober…I’m scared to fuck it up.

But I still believe there’s a good person in there somewhere under all that pain and self-loathing that spilled on to me and every once and a while I send a little prayer into the universe that he and his life will change and I hope he gains some divine strength for that path.

If you’re struggling, if you’ve destroyed your life and maybe someone else(s), too, I hope you can find some hope in that.

They may not be able to talk to you but they may be silently sending prayers that you’ll get better. That they’ll heal, that you’ll heal. That it will all change for the good somehow.

That’s the best thing he could do for forgiveness and redemption. Just heal. Maybe someday I’ll get the apologies I deserved and never got but I’m taking care of myself now and I’m ok. 

But for him, I heard he’s still struggling and I pray for that divine strength, and for you, too.

I like that phrase, ‘when we all do better, we all do better.’",8,0

I was scared I was going to drink more but went for a run instead. Instead of giving me relief I’m just in this incredibly dark place where I feel like I somehow can’t handle how bad I feel. It feels like it has nothing to do with tonight and is more a general problem where I don’t know how to handle emotions without numbing them. The emotions don’t seem to be about anything, just a general feeling of crushing sadness and lonliness. Apart from therapy, which is too expensive for me right now, does anyone have any tips?

I didn't feel any stress or anxiety about the future for nearly a decade because I had a cure in the form of alcohol but what ended up happening over the years was I just stopped caring about anything beyond getting home  getting drunk repeat. I just survived life, I didn't plan for anything good or bad as long as I had enough money to get my fix and a bed to sleep in I was okay.


This year, I'm sober and have been sober 140 of the last 154 days and my life is getting better day by day week by week. I'm beginning to care about things again. I care about my friends and family more deeply than I have in a decade, I care about my future so much that I re-enrolled in school to finish my degree that I couldn't complete when I was drinking heavily. I have a savings plan to finally get myself out of stupid debts and build a nest egg so I'm not flying by the seat of my pants. I see my friends settling down and building families and I now want that again so I'm trying to seriously date again. I had a few casual type relationships during the past decade but honestly I cared more about getting drunk than turning them into something real.



I have goals and dreams again and the thought that I might not achieve them brings me great anxiety but I've realized that fear of the future is why I numbed myself for years and hiding from the fear didn't get me anything. I'm scared shitless but it's such a weird amazing type of scared, my future is mine again and if I take it day by day and don't get too far ahead of myself it can be mine until eternity.

I have been really good and only drank one glass of wine (which didn’t even taste good) on vacation this weekend. 

Now my doctor recently told me that I am basically burned out or close to a burn out. She told me I basically have to do something NOW or I will be forced to by my body.

Problem is, I still feel like I have to end that one project before I slow down. It’s two more weeks. I know it’s stupid. I know I am doing all of this to myself. But I am only 29, how could i already slow down? Who will take me seriously? Questions I know are stupid since my health is on the line, but it is what is forcing me to continue. 

Now, today was really bad. Normally after such a day I would drink with my colleagues to forget the day. I went to play some volleyball instead. I felt like that was such a good idea. But I almost started crying on the field because the thought of choosing what to wear to work tomorrow suddenly seems like an impossible task. Not even work - JUST getting up and getting dressed. 

I feel so tempted to drink just do I can shake this feeling and get some sleep. Just to get through the next two weeks. But I know that’s not where it would end. Not the drinking. And the overworking probably won’t, either. 

I just don’t know what to do. I think I just needed to vent. And maybe I need some words on how it’s so stupid to solve this with alcohol. I just feel so overwhelmed by everything. I want some calm in my head.

I am 33, will typically have a beer or two Mon-Thur evenings after work, then maybe 3-5 drinks on a Friday or Sat night if I stay in. Approximately every two weeks I will have a decent binge with friends and consume maybe 20 drinks, getting pretty damn intoxicated with some memory loss and typically leading to a modest (sometimes severe) hangover and low productivity the following day. I drink far less now than I did 5 years ago.

My partner hates the binges and me coming home late as she worries that I'm either doing something stupid or getting myself in trouble (not usually the case).

That and banging on random apartment doors in my building pissing people off because apparently my friends (who literally had to carry me home) said I couldn’t remember where I lived. I was completely incoherent obviously. My fiancé said he was so scared and he stayed up all night to make sure I didn’t choke on my throw up. 

I feel absolutely disgusted with myself and sooo shameful.

I’ve lurked in this subreddit for a few months now under a different username but my real name was in the old user name and I’d prefer to maintain privacy. Anyways, I’ve been using alcohol for around 11 years. I’d never consider myself an alcoholic but I would consider myself a Binge drinker. It’s all or nothing for me almost every time I pick up the sauce. Alcohol started as an escape for me. It felt like the only thing I could use to feel truly incandescently happy. I had my first drink around a campfire when I was 16 years old and I remember looking up at the stars that night and smiling. I was in heaven. Fast forward 11 years later and more drunken nights than I can count, I’ve made the decision to stop. Alcohol quickly became self medication for me. I have struggled with anxiety and depression as far back as my childhood and the alcohol turned all my shitty feelings into amazing feelings. It created a completely different version of myself that was fun, happy, confident, bold, and carefree. Getting loaded once a week (most of the time more often than once) has been a staple of my life for the last decade. It’s been my escape from the mundane painful life that my anxiety and depression have created for me. In a strange way the binge drinking served as a kind of mental “reset” for me in the sense that it would allow me to feel good for a few hours and then the resulting hangover was almost like a reminder that my regular life wasn’t that bad. The hangover was shittier than my regular anxiety and depression so things always got better after the hangover. However, recently the hangovers have progressed to a point that I experience genuine withdrawal like symptoms each time I drink. Strange thoughts, inability to think straight, massive anxiety and depression, and worst of all hypnagogic hallucinations. The last 15 days of sobriety have been a roller coaster. The first weekend without alcohol had me on a mental high but that has since worn off and week 2 has been full of anxiety and depression. I am writing this to keep myself accountable, I know it won’t be an easy ride. Im basically going cold Turkey off of the only thing that has given my life meaning and joy for the last decade, but I know it has to be done. If I don’t get it under control now it will continue to destroy my life. So with that being said thank you for reading this far and pray/send good vibes for my continued sobriety.

Initially it was 2-3 nights out dedicated to drinking and socializing. And then once Covid hit it was 7 nights in drinking and playing PlayStation. 
Now it’s neither and I’m trying to find ways to fill those voids. A lot of people have suggested exercise and reading, which I may well take into consideration, I’m just hoping it’s enough to combat this profound boredom.   
That’s all. No real alcohol cravings. Just bored and sad lol.

I was using it against depression but I’m not sure if it helped or increased my anxiety. 

One year later, with help of my gf and friends, I decided to quit smoking weed. A little bit later I also decided to quit smoking cigarettes too. It was around October 2021. 

Then I started buying beers occasionally.

After a couple of weeks later I was buying beers every day and making sure my fridge always has it available.

At first I was having one or two beers to help me to go to sleep.

It turned to two to three. And then a whole 6 packs.

Without even realizing, I found myself going to store at nights to buy a second six pack. They normally don’t sell alcohol after midnight but since I was buying every day, I was good I guess.

I started buying from different stores every day. And continue justifying my drinking. It’s funny the reasons we give ourselves to have “one more”.

I was becoming a functional alcoholic but one day I read a confession at r/askreddit 
some of replies were suggesting r/stopdrinking for the guy who can never stop after one drink.

I continue abusing alcohol and read this subreddit. 

Eventually I realized I am not special, I am not alone. So decided to quit and it’s been already one week. My sleep quality increased and feeling much better.

I don’t know if I had any influence on her recent decision as they were for different reasons but she told me she’s actively taking a break from her drinking as well. I’m so so proud of her as she works a very strenuous job being a psych nurse at a senior living facility where a lot of her patients are demented or on their death bed.

Worry is a mental state — a series of thoughts, mostly difficult to control, and intrusive in nature, that can lead to anxiety. Anxiety is a physical, hormonal, chemical fear that can stem from either worrying thoughts or a neurological/physical issue that has little to do with the mental state. 

Well, I’ve been really worried about Ukraine. I have family there — close to the middle of the conflict. It’s sad and infuriating that Ukraine and Russia, (which are akin to US and Canada in things like family ties, culture, language, etc) are close to war, and the media are beating the war drums for whatever reason. 

I honestly have been thinking of drinking. It’s surprising — I never drank because I think shitty thought or fee shitty feelings. I used to drink because it’s fun and it makes passing the time better. 

Obviously I won’t do it, but I think I understand the people who use alcohol to help with worry.

The numbness. That was my comfort zone. I was terrified to face my sober self.

The biggest thing I've been able to do is allow myself to have ALL THE FEELINGS. It's so wonderful. I didn't know life could be this good.

Sometimes life is hard--the sad emotions are SO overwhelming. But the good ones are SO GOOD. I feel like the most authentic I've ever been. I can comfortably say I know who I am now. 

I was inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/sxnzvq/1_year_sober_achievement_unlocked/) to post some of the things that have changed for me:  


* I've got my health back on track! I no longer have most of the health issues I used to have. I'm still not perfect and realize I need to take care of myself by drinking water, eating right and taking my supplements! (This is not medical advice, just my experience!)
* I have feelings and can actually feel them!
* I lost about 5 pounds but the biggest physical change has been how much energy I have. And so much less bloating! I also feel naturally tired and naturally awake more often now. 
* I just feel so much more present in my own life and enjoy my own company.

I haven't taken up any new hobbies or have a dramatic weight loss, but the mental benefits have been extremely amazing.

I have my dream job, adore my partner, adore my pets but alcohol is stealing away the best of me and I’m going to lose everything if I don’t stop.  

It’s not going to be easy, it may end my SO and I given he drinks as much as I do and doesn’t think it’s a problem.  But I’m lying here on a work day with two very black eyes, numb teeth and what I hope isn’t a broken nose feeling devastated I’m going to have to find reasons to avoid all my meetings for the next week or so until it heals and I know I am letting myself down.  My life is a shambles, I need to get a grip and grow the hell up.  I feel sad every day that I don’t make better choices, and all in the name of a liquid which adds nothing to my existence.

Enough is enough, I’m strong and I can do this. 

I’ll probably be on a lot - I have always dreamt of doing a journal of getting sober and making life better, I think following my progress with your guys support is probably as good a way to do that as any.

Thank you all for your honest and insightful posts, they really do create the want for change.

Hi,
I have been a heavy drinker for 20 years with some cycles (never touched a drop while pregnant and nursing my boys). This pandemic with the isolation (I live with my boys, work from home, no partner, etc) made my drinking out of control.  I felt I was drowning last fall but didn't know who to turn to (could drink 2L of wine in one evening eadily).
Betwern Christmas and New Year I developed this severe pain in my shoulder, with what felt like electric shocks going through my arm and hand whenever I was trying to use my arm.  It is a strange pain because when it bits I have the most severe pins and needles in my right arm.
I am on sick leave because of that. Waiting for an MRI, my doctor thinks it looks like a cervical hernia.
While I know this is not a medical forum, while on this sobriety journey I read about alcoholic neuropathy and I am wondering if this is what I may have.  While I am waiting for an MRI, I was just wondering if my symptoms could also match alcoholic neuropathy.  From what I read, it would start in the extremities. While my hand gets tingly first now, it still started in my shoulder.
I know alcohol can be super damaging on our nerves so I would be curious to know more about your experiences if you have had something like this before.",5,1

Talking to my therapist, we discussed my disease. And it hit me. If I had cancer, what would I be doing? Everything my doctor says. Would it be difficult? Hell yes. But would I do it? Yes. (I have several kick ass family members you have gone through cancer treatments and I know it's not easy. Fuck cancer.)

The point is, I have a disease. The path forward is not drinking. The therapies for my diagnosis are group, 1 on 1 therapy, medication from my doctor, and r/stopdrinking. We will work together to treat and manage this disease. Just like any other.

I have had a week here, a few weeks there, alcohol free. Some of the groups/podcasts I really enjoyed and learned from..Some, I really did not like or benefit from.

One valuable lesson for me was, even if I was only sober for a period, and went back to drinking, it doesn't mean it negates what I learned during that sober period. Anyway, this time around its been much easier to not drink, and I believe its because of all the work I put into it previously.

I am trying not to stress about ""what if I drink?"" in the future and just focusing on the moment. I mean...what if I do drink? Then I will stop again.

Sometimes, I still really crave it. But for the most part, it grosses me out. I think about the shitty hangovers, my puffy booze face that foggy feeling all day, and weekends NOT being relaxing and rejuvenating.

I stopped by at a friends yesterday, she and her boyfriend were drinking wine. They are total normies, fit, slim, nice skin, don't over do it. I told them all about my crappy relationship with booze and how I needed this. It was pretty liberating.

I am looking forward to the spring, getting into working out, having nicer skin, a clearer mind. My cognitive abilities are getting better. Just looking forward to them getting even better.

I make alcohol for a living. I am a brewer. I have unlimited beer at my fingertips all day long. I could, at any second, drink at work, and it not only be fine, but just a part of the job. I know in the longterm this isn't the career I want to be in forever, and not the healthiest for me, but for now it's where I am at, and I am damn proud of myself for saying ""fuck you"" to temptation every second of the day at work. I have plans to get out and become a successful Health Coach. Trust the process.

Vomiting, nausea, severe stomach pain...so many flashbacks to the multiple times I've had acute pancreatitis caused by drinking.

So after much debating, and having to call in sick to work I dragged myself to emergency, bringing back many memories of having this exact scenario and how unpleasant it was. Had that moment when I had to call my partner and tell her I was going to the hospital and what my symptoms were - knowing exactly where her mind would lead her. 

After many scans and tests it turns out I've got appendicitis and going under the knife tomorrow. Not a big deal but such a stark reminder of how sick I had made myself previously, the life I had led, and the contrast to this time where there wasn't (justified) shame and guilt associated with everytime I felt ill.

The fact it happened on my 69th day and I get to join in on the trend is just a bonus! Here's to sobriety and joining all you awesome people on this journey",11,0

Decided i was not going to be drinking in the house anymore - only drinking for social occasions and meeting up with friends. No more random midweek beers watching TV.

Fast forward to february and every Friday/Saturday i've had a social occasion on (friends birthdays & engagements etc) and its been events I couldn't get out of or not drink at. Each saturday night was actually sucessful, i kept it reasonably sensible, didnt make a fool of myself and came home at a reasonable time. What fucked me up, is each time i came home, i proceeded to have another beer or two as a reward for being sensible (what is the logic here?!)...which in every case every saturday, resulted in me staying up untl around 4/5am watching tv and drinking beers/anything else i could find.  


No matter how shit i felt the next day, the same thing happened 3 bloody saturdays in a row. Its never happened before - ive no idea what is going on, I think my reset in January triggered something that made me want to do this. Anyway, i'm rambling now.

3 saturdays in a row its happened, 3 weeks i dont feel properly right until around wednesday each week. No more...im taking another break from the booze completely for 2-4 weeks and i'll see where we go from here. If i can cut out that ridiculous staying up till 3/4am having another 2-3 beers then i'll have made huge strides",5,0

No excitement as I woke up in the morning to take on any kind of task, let alone something as simple as a shower. 
That was all terrifying. People, places, and even thoughts and ideas terrified every fiber of my being. 

“Set some goals for yourself!”
“Look around you.”
“Aren’t you tired of this?”
“It’s time to grow up.”
“I miss my son.”
“I miss my brother.”

All of these things that were said to me could not be answered. All I could do was give them a blank stare and shrug my shoulders. That’s all I knew, and that’s all I felt I could contribute.

Fear was at the root of anything and everything I did, thought, and said. Fear gave me an excuse not to show up. Fear even comforted me because I could at least try to understand why I was the way that I was. No one else understood, but I at least had an idea. Fear was my best friend.

I’m grateful for those fears, i’m grateful for the fears I have today, and i’m grateful for the fears I will have tomorrow. Without fear, I wouldn’t know what it is that needs to be done to live a quality life. One where i’m actually present and not looking over my shoulder waiting for the next hardship.

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Monday, Mi Familia Sobria! Threw a little Spanish in there meaning my sober family. How is everyone waking up today?  I texted my friend during these first sober weekends, “I do notice when the weekends roll around I’m way less excited knowing I’m not going to drink, is that a thing?” My weekends and the feelings attached to them were kind of a bit of a bummer when I stopped drinking, but now that I’m 50 days in (yay!) that feeling is slowly beginning to change.  Now I get excited knowing I’m going to sleep in and be productive and still do something fun but sober. At first I joked about what a grandma that I am becoming but stopped because I don’t want to downplay what I’m experiencing here now. 

The reality is there’s something so precious and peaceful about life sober.  I feel like it’s slowed down. It’s sweet.  It’s calm.  I notice all the tiny things more and appreciate them.  My weekends are a time to tackle all the things I can’t do during the week and to sleep in!  What a joyous feeling.  Alcohol robbed me of that.  Alcohol made my weekends go by so fast trying to recover and eat and sleep my way to feeling normal again.  Alcohol also gave me the worst insomnia.  I’ve read people have problems sleeping and used to use it to sleep, but I found myself going through the opposite.  Yet I continued to do it knowing this.  The madness!  Why I would put my body through such torture all under the pretense that I thought I was having a good time, why I chose to poison myself as a form of recreation, why I was so happy to numb myself from living in reality are things I’ll have to figure out on my own with time.  For now and at least for today my decision is clear on what NOT to do.

After my ER stent in December, I ended up quitting for good on December 26th. My liver enzymes were great. Both ALT and AST showing below 40. Hell. Yes. I was excited. 

Randomly, I started becoming short of breath and lightheaded. Not knowing what was going on, I went back to the ER. ALT comes back at 66 with an AST of 40. Doesn’t make sense… I hadn’t been drinking. I ended up chalking it up to multivitamins and the crazy amount of Niacin in them. 

Went back to the ER for crazy URQ pain last night where a CT Scan showed “There is a diffuse decrease in hepatic parenchymal density, consistent with fatty infiltration”. The crazy part? Even without drinking for so long, my ALT rose to 77 and AST declined to 25. 

I’m meeting up with my PCM on Tuesday to discuss. I’m super nervous. I’ve been sober for almost two months and everything is falling apart. This is one of those times where I wish I could sprint away from it all. I just know that I don’t want that poison near me. It is leading me on a whole other path that I didn’t think I was going to be taking.

I was 2 months or so into my sobriety journey then, and was incredibly thankful that I could be there for her.  She’s fine, recovered, and doing well.

Yesterday, my wife slashed her leg when a bowl shattered on the counter.  It was a nasty cut resulting in 5 stitches.  But the scary part is that she, apparently, is susceptible to vasovagal syncope.  Which, of course, I discovered … as she passed out.  Thankfully, I was next to her when it happened and fully managed her descent to horizontality, so she didn’t hit the ground.  Once I got her back to semi-normal (while keeping her blood on the inside), we set off for the ER since all the urgent care facilities were closed.

I cannot be happier that I’ve been sober, because I can’t imagine trying to handle that situation if I was 5 drinks deep (Saturday afternoon, great weather, listening to music … 6 months ago, I’d have been well on my way).

I'm uncertain how close alcohol is to the core of my issues, so I don't really know if it's ok for me to post here when I know there are people who have alcohol abuse as their main issue. 

Anyway, let me give some context.

38 year old man here. Started therapy and finally finished high school about 5 years ago. After a life long struggle with anxiety and depression, I've finally started processes of fixing my life and am currently a nursing student, wanting to work with young people with mental health and substance abuse issues. My issues weren't like having massive attacks, more in the sense of being apathethic. Just... having no hopes or belief in anything.  


One of the bad habits that I've had for 18 years approximately, is using a pub I'm a regular at as an escape from my life. Despite the progress I've made in life, I was never quite able to shake the joy of going to the pub and pretending my life was in order and that I was only taking a break.

Luckily, a friend who works there mistreated me for whatever reason a while back. My feelings got hurt, but it shook me out of my apathy and made me realise I was investing more into my role as a regular at the pub, than I did invest in my life as a father or a student or anything. 

So I quit the pub and i've felt surprisingly focused since then. I also quit automatically checking the fb-account of a girl I've loved since 2006. 

But while I'm a student I live at my parents house to save up money. Some days I have a feeling of losing control. The last 3 days I've been emptying bottles of whiskey. Promising myself everyday that I would start studying because I'm falling behind to the extent that I might fail my education.

I can't choose not to buy whiskey, because I don't buy it. It's my parents' stash.

I've been sitting with a bottle of Jameson tonight feeling it super clear that the best thing I could do for myself would be to empty it all in the toilet. The only thing stopping me is I feel it's a waste of money, as I have to buy a new bottle and put it back in the bar.

I'm sorry for a messy post. I just want someone to tell me if I should pour the bottle out in the toilet",2,0

I stayed up with him all night holding his head until I could call the vet. He could barely breathe but he could still manage to eat so he thoroughly enjoyed the steak I made and cut into little pieces for him. He got excited to go for a car ride and looked at me trustingly when we got to the vet. He went to sleep peacefully and he finally got some relief. I'm so heartbroken. I wish I could turn off the feelings because it's almost too hard. But I'm making my way through this without drinking. My SO is drinking his way through it. I guess I always had some seedling of thought in the back of my mind that if someone died I would probably drink. But I'm not, and I'm so grateful. I can't say I haven't thought about it.

Advice would be appreciated.","I (21f) had been drinking heavily almost nightly for the past 1.5 years. I also smoked weed daily. I quit drinking 12 days ago, and I stopped smoking weed 6 days ago.

For the first 6 days, the anxiety and panic was overwhelming, dry mouth, shaking, I was freaking out. Since then the symptoms have mostly calmed, I’ve been exercising daily and eating healthy foods as well as taking vitamins (multivitamin, folic acid, St. John’s wort and vitamin e) daily.

For the past week I’ve been mostly okay but I get very easily overwhelmed. I can’t stop clenching my teeth, the anxiety makes swallowing hard sometimes, and I still get a panic attack at least once a day. Does anyone have experience with this, or advice? I feel much better than last week and I felt fine all day today but I sat down to watch something and just had a panic attack. I am going to see my doctor on Thursday but I just want to know how long these symptoms are going to last because it’s really rough when the anxiety comes. I also had some tests last week and I am not anemic, and the dr said my heart sounded fine. 

Has anyone else gone through this? And how long did it last for you?

Edit: I do still vape (like once an hour) and I had anxiety before I began using. I am going to see a psychiatrist as soon as I get a referral for help with my anxiety, it’s just been 1000x worse since I quit.

Edit 2: I started smoking 4 years ago, and aside from a few months here and there without, I’ve pretty much smoked a bowl of flower every day. Most posts I see about weed withdrawals are made my people who say they smoked 5-15 joints DAILY which I can’t even fathom (no hate whatsoever, I just could never handle anything close to that much at once. Half a joint would be too much for me). I’m hoping my withdrawals aren’t as bad because I never smoked a ton at once.",9,0

Now I’m at work not quite feeling the same way (I work in foreign financial markets so I am in the office from 8 PM to 5 AM. This is relevant).

So Friday AM I get home and my weekend has officially begun. I go to sleep right away though. I have some people coming over later and I already know that I’m going to be drinking with them. There is a part of me that is saying that I can have as much fun sober, but I know my decision has already been made. So they come over and honestly it was a really great time. Everyone leaves at about 1 AM and I’m alone. Normal people would go to bed at this point, but I’m not tired at all due to my work schedule. So I stay up until about 6 AM drinking. At some point I finally pass out and when I wake up a couple of hours later, maybe 8 AM, I order some disgusting McDonald’s. As a person who is normally very health-conscious, this is a betrayal to myself. I eat and go back to bed until about 5 PM.

I wake up and plan on having a sober night, but I have a few drinks leftover from the previous night’s get together. So I tell myself, I’ll have those and that’s it. By the time I finish the third I want more, so I get some beer. Once again, I’m up late drinking alone until I pass out. Sleep is fretful for me. I’m sweating and I’m cold. Anxiety is raging. I know my plans to run before work are moot.

I get 23 days of PTO between vacation and sick days. and I get 5 days I can call off without a doctor's note unpaid without getting written up. I can use any vacation day as single days or I can even split any of them into half days. I learned how important the ability to step away when I'm overwhelmed is after losing 2.5 months of sobriety around the holidays because I just couldn't catch my breath and I wanted to feel something. But starting this year after only 14 months on the job I hit the next level for PTO and I made a promise to myself to not feel bad about using that time if I needed to take a day off and go to a meeting or relax in my bed and peruse r/stopdrinking  for inspiration, support and strength.


Last Thursday, that's exactly what I did. I had just gotten some bad family news. I had to make massive payments on lots of repairs I needed to my car and house. I was starting to get irritable and started using nicotine again (not good but at least right now I prefer that to booze). I felt very weak disheveled and wreckless and worse, the coming week after Presidents Day is typically when work becomes mad busy and there is almost no downtime until the fall. I knew I needed to get my head straight or I'd risk falling back into bad habits. So while one of the reasons I quit drinking was I became disgusted with how dishonest I was when I was in the throes of alcohol abuse, I lied to my boss and told her that I wasn't feeling well and needed to use a sick day. I'm trying not to rationalize lying in any form anymore but until there isn't a stigma around drinking issues I didn't feel comfortable fully explaining why I didn't feel well.


So originally I planned on just laying in bed all day and being sad but sober. Instead after a little bit of self pity I started working on solutions to some of the things that were weighing on me. I got all my tax information together and knocked that out and the refund I received was enough to offset some of the expenses I had to deal with. I communicated with my family and got that situation squared away. Then when I realized I had a lot of day left, I cleaned my place and made a nice healthy dinner. Afterwords I went on a walk and then played video games until I was ready for bed. I went back to work the next day refreshed and more focused. My thoughts had become clearer and the weight of the world seemed to lift a little bit and the urge to drink retreated somewhat. 


I'm 57 days sober today and in hot pursuit of my longest streak of sobriety in over a decade because I was able to pause when it felt things were spiraling. I thank each and every one of you who shared your experiences in this sub and didn't pass judgment on those of us who tripped up before hitting the really long stretches of sobriety. Because of that type of advice I was able to use my previous relapse experience and catch myself before I was ready to risk everything for the drink.



Tldr; relapsed last year when I was super overwhelmed with work/life. After being sober since Christmas Eve I was beginning to feel antsy and stressed the hell out. I didn't actively pursue drinking but I learned from last time that was coming in short order.

I’m feeling really good. It’s the first time seeing that side of the family since I discharged from PHP. It was so nice to be honest about how I’m doing & really truly mean it.

I have a stable job, I’m not sleeping in as much, have more natural energy, & so many other perks since I finally quit drinking for good.

I’m not sure what “clicked” for me this time but I’m SO thankful it did.

So thankful I’m not spending my Sunday completely hungover only to rush to the liquor store by 7:45 to get booze for the night. That is, only if I didn’t spend all day drinking already.

We were fighting constantly, a lot of which stemmed from my mental health and drinking. We mutually decided to take a break, and have been supportive of each other in this transition.

I've recently been diagnosed with bipolar 2 and started medication. I am making a diligent effort to take better care of myself and work on past trauma and addictions (alcohol and marijuana). I truly want to become the best person for myself. And maybe, just maybe, win her back.

Over the last week or so, I could feel her inching away from me, and it terrified me. She is my best friend, someone who said she would always be there for me. I can't fathom losing her. So last Friday I relapsed hard. I now recognize that immense work stress, sadness, and gut-wrenching loneliness played the biggest factors in relapsing. I messaged her and received a response that caught me off guard. I felt she was giving me the cold shoulder, and I completely lost it. I have been working so hard to fix things and her response felt shallow and inconsiderate. I responded very poorly, telling her to delete my number and to never contact me again.

None of what I said is true. I didn't mean a word of it. I was drunk and felt hurt and misunderstood, and I lashed out. She has since blocked me (rightfully so), and it's killing me that I didn't have a chance to apologize. I understand she needs space, and I respect that. But it leaves me to wonder, ""Why would I ever say something so hurtful to someone I love?"" I just can't understand why I would do such a thing when the only thing I want is to show her how much I love and care for her? It seems like the more I try to fix things, the more I'm fucking everything up. I just don't understand.

The silver lining in this story is that I'm ready to truly get sober. Not half-assed attempts to please others, but giving it a real and honest chance for me to be the best person I can be. For my own sanity and happiness. To address and work on the trauma and mental health issues I've so desperately tried to avoid. To start living for both myself and those I love instead of impulsively and selfishly drinking myself into a grave.

I'm hopeful that I'm on the right track. The first step is always the hardest. Sobriety seems like a long and lonely road, but I feel it's the right choice. I like to imagine a future where I'm safe and happy, surrounded by those I love. They trust me and know I love them too. They are my family, and I'd do anything for them.

But right now, it all seems so far away. However, I will not give up.

It is musings about his own life following a cancer diagnosis. (I will link in comments)

At the end of my multi-drug sixties, I figuratively put all the chemicals in a funnel, and they came out bourbon. Jack Daniel’s-on-the-rocks, with a splash, except when scarce funds reduced me to Heaven Hill. Alcohol was liberating for me at first. A standard progression: great, good, fair, poor, bad, very bad, and then a phase for which any word but “Hell” fails. Halfway through the second drink, there may be a flicker of the old euphoria, quickly snuffed. You chase it in vain for the rest of a wretched night. It’s over for you. A line has been crossed. Yet you cannot imagine yourself not drinking. The obsession is at one with your core sense of self.

I remember, in rehab, on the Upper East Side in 1992, an alum of the place, a tough guy from Queens, addressing the nightly A.A. meeting. He told us of once showing up at some clinic, drunk and filthy and soiled with his own diarrhea, and throwing a fit because the doctor was ten minutes late. “If you’re a real alcoholic,” the guy said to us, “no matter how low you go, you will have an attitude.” He added, “If you’re a real alcoholic, you will never feel quite right. Whatever you want will be a little bit out of reach. Can’t handle that? Get the fuck out of here and get drunk.” I went up to him afterward, in tears, to thank him. He said, “You heard me?” I said yes. “Good,” he said, turning and walking away as if from some crap on a sidewalk. Saved my life.",73,0
1119,2022-02-20 18:30:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/sxelhl/not_today/,Not today!,"Things have been going great since I quit drinking. There have been some temptations of course but making it to bed sober always strengthens my resolve. I've been avoiding drinking situations other than restaurants. Even going to the restaurant I get all stressed out. In my head it's like I'm going to be offered drinks the entire time but then I get there, order tea, and everything is fine. This leads me to my next situation

A few days ago my wife and I ordered Kevin Hart tickets. It's close to our anniversary so we decided that's our gift to each other. A nice dinner, a show, and a hotel. I spent the next 4 hours stressing out about drinking. The show is in SEPTEMBER. Finally I said to myself ""why the f are you stressing out about this right now!? You're not drinking today, that's all that matters. When the day comes you'll get to dinner, order tea, go to the show, get a soda or something and 90% of the night is won at that point."" 

I guess my point is to NOT to stress out about future days. It's never as bad as you think. Typically you MIGHT have to turn down one drink. Then you're good to go. If someone pushes you to drink you'll probably just get pissed off and not even wanna drink after that. Stay sober, internet friends.

I'm 31 yo and I have been drinking nearly every night for the past couple years. 3-4 drinks on average. Every time my drinking gets excessive, my body starts rebelling and showing signs that I need to stop. I reached this point again. 

During the first year of the pandemic, I started dry January and kept it going until June. I just knew that I'd be miserable with everything going on and didn't want to add more problems with drinking. I was so proud of myself and felt great mentally and physically. My husband was supportive but has been a heavy drinker for as long as I  can remember. I know I can do this, however, his drinking has triggered me in the past. These past couple days, since my senses aren't dulled, I nearly gag when I go to hug/kiss him because of the alcohol wafting from his breath. He even apologizes because he notices my recoil. I love him to death, so I pretend it's not a big deal. I wish he had the strength to quit with me. I've long learned that I can't make him do a thing. The last time I was sober, I'd hoped maybe he'd see how good I was doing and join suit. How do you cope with a partner who drinks heavily while you're trying to be sober?

If you stick with sobriety for long enough, it simply becomes your life. I forget that I’m an alcoholic constantly. I almost forgot to post today, but I was watching something where they were talking about sobriety which jogged my memory.

That’s the beauty, and the reason I remain sober. It gets easier over time. If it didn’t, I would just drink.  
 The people I know don’t like to say “recovered,” we say “in recovery.” I think largely this is a way to remind ourselves that it’s easy to fuck it up. For some it’s a way to remind ourselves that one drink can return us to active alcoholism. What I didn’t realize years ago, was there’s a point where you don’t feel like an alcoholic anymore. I know that I am, and I can force myself to remember, but I don’t miss it. It’s something I used to do, and I know is dangerous for me, but I just live my life.

If I could talk to myself six years ago I would say this: “Quitting isn’t fun, but it’s totally worth it. If you start now you’ll start feeling better soon. Eventually it won’t feel like work. One day soon, you won’t think about it at all.”

I’m down in Mexico for a bachelor party so we’ve been going pretty hard. I made so many bad decisions the past few days. Namely not drinking nearly any water yesterday. For some background, I’m well aware that I’m a full blown alcoholic, drinking multiple glasses of hard booze damn near every day for the past two years. 

But this was nothing like any hangover I’ve ever had. I’m sitting next to the pool in the morning and it kind of all hits BIG TIME, I nonchalantly walked back up to my room, all while I’m getting crazy ass tunnel vision. I got in the room and knocked some stuff over. I started panicking and really thought I was going to have a heart attack or a seizure or something.

I call the front desk and see if I can get a doctor to come up to the room while (not successfully) trying to relax with breathing exercises. My blood pressure was 160/120 and heart rate was 140 bpm. The doctor said I needed to immediately go to the ER.

I literally thought I was dying, I was seeing people who weren’t there, the overwhelming sense that I knew I wasn’t going to make it. Currently laying in this hospital bed with an IV drip and some blood pressure and some Valium in my system. I still feel like a bag of wet, hot garbage but I think I’m going to make it. 

Anyone out there that has a similar story that can point me in the right direction of leaving this life behind?? I’m very grateful to be feeling better but I also worry that I’ve done permanent damage to myself. Any guidance would be extremely extremely appreciated

Edit: thank you all for the kind words. I’m out of the hospital and feeling fine. Had a long talk with my friend who is sober and feeling incredibly lucky and as someone said blessing in disguise. I know it ain’t gonna be easy but really looking forward to the rest of my life",156,0

(Fading Affect Bias is very real) Got to the point of a nightly 750 about a year and a half ago. Started getting very bad depersonalization/derealization and alcohol was really the only thing that helped in the short term. It turns out, even the constant fear and anxiety of mental problems wasn't enough to keep me away. Mostly writing this in hopes it will help get me back on the horse tomorrow morning like I plan. The last 7 months have definitely been the worst of my entire life and this subreddit has been the number one thing that stopped me drinking for those 17 days.

Is this normal?,"Long story short. I drank almost every single night for 4-5 years. I never got to the point of drinking during the day, but my tolerance did increase a lot and I would drink 100% to get wasted.

Anyway, I tried to stop for years but never could. August of 2020 I lost my job (100% unrelated to alcohol) and I forced myself to cut down drastically since I couldn't afford it and it was time. When I stopped I did notice I felt like shit, physically, I never thought I'd get withdrawals but I did. For 3-4 months after losing my job I drank maybe twice a week and I was drinking a lot less too.

Anyway from Beg of 2021 till August 2021 I drank waaay waaaay less, went 6 weeks sober twice and whenever I would drink I wouldn't really get drunk. Just a little tipsy and I'd stop.

In August 2021 I got a much better job than what I had before, had more money that I have ever had and slowly began making excuses to drink every weekend. Back to the getting wasted mentality. Every Friday, sometimes Saturday.

&#x200B;

To sum up my question. December of 2021 I had several long weekends and drank more than usual and would notice that I'd get what I consider withdrawals the following 1-2 days after. With me these withdrawals feel like this weird feeling in my skin. It almost hurts, or feels cold, it is very uncomfortable and I almost feel at time like I have a fever.

&#x200B;

Now my question, is this normal? Does this make any sense? I am trying to stop 100% again. I went the past two weekends stopping myself after 2-3 drinks but two days ago I drank more than I should have. And I spent the whole day yesterday feeling like death, that feeling on my skin and nausea all day. I tried drinking last night again but stopped myself after 2.5 drinks and said enough is enough and stopped.

Today my body feels like death again. I seriously believe this is withdrawal but how?! I mean just drinking once a week? WTH?

I hate how common I feel right now, but I'm looking forward to being one of the uncommon non-drinkers who just put it away for good and live my best life.

\--

I quit drinking back in August 2020. During the early phases of the pandemic my drinking was becoming something 'other-worldly'. There was nothing to do. I worked from home, everyone was always home, and I didn't see any friends. I'd start drinking around 7PM, go until about 1 or 2AM, get up and go to work online, lather, rinse, repeat every day. Weekends I could drink until 4AM. 

I had been a 'problem drinker' since my sophomore year in college back in the 90s and I always knew I was just like my dad, uncles, aunts, etc. who all were alcoholics. But in August 2020 I finally decided to put it away ""for at least a year"" to clean up my life a bit.

It was a great year. SO many benefits, including doubling my income, being offered multiple jobs, wonderful bonding with my family, and feeling physically healthy all the time. The quality of sleep alone... \*chefs kiss\* 

In October 2021, my father-in-law, who was very close to us, died in my arms from a pulmonary edema. A neighbor and I brought him back to life with CPR and he was alive and aware at the ER, but the trauma was too much and he passed a few days later. It was...devastating. 

He and I had been drinking buddies for 20 years. We'd sit on the back porch and he'd complain about his wife's nagging, and he'd listen intently to my complaints about my industry or business partners. Our bond was a good one and he was such a great father figure for me (my father passed when I was 10). He was also an alcoholic who definitely missed drinking with me when I quit.

The day he passed, I poured a drink for him and one for me. And then I drank mine. 

I decided that night that I could drink normally, and would occasionally have a drink then on. I KNEW I'd wind up drinking heavily again. So it shouldn't come as any surprise to you (nor to me) that that's exactly what happened. 

This week I was on a business trip and I drank 5 nights in a row, heavily every night. I've been trying to lose a little weight and the #1 item on my calorie count for the past 30 days is alcohol - making up more than 14% of my total calorie count.

I've been irritable, sleeping poorly, mentally foggy, anxious, depressed, unhappy, and ashamed every day I have drank since starting again. I regret that drink, and I regret throwing away a year or more of sobriety. 

I have SO MANY REASONS to not drink. I have a fatty liver. I have high cholesterol. I am overweight by at least 40 pounds. I can't workout the morning after drinking. I am in a high risk category that suggests I can't drink anymore. And yet I'm convincing myself I can drink normally. WHY DRINK AT ALL? I need to get healthy! I want to stay connected to my family! I want to go back to where I was in 2021 without the alcohol dominating my day-to-day life. 

So let this be the last Day One and the first day where I am 100% firmly committed to being my best self, which is the version that doesn't drink.

I can only speak for myself when I say that I CANNOT HAVE JUST ONE DRINK no matter how long it's been. But I'm not the only one who's tried and regretted it. Let my story be a cautionary tale in the pile of reasons to never start again.",1181,1

I’m 34F and I have 1y old twins. Maternity leave was really bad for me. Childcare is stressful and I’ve picked up some problem behaviors - I often start drinking in the morning, perhaps a beer or two in the car park now that I’m back at work.  I almost always stop on the way home at the liquor store and buy a one of those mini cartons of wine to start the evening. Alcohol is an invasive thought for me - if I know we have it in the house it’s on my mind until it’s gone. I’ve been known to drive while slightly impaired. Never wasted, but it feels like a slippery slope. I stopped buying spirits because that’s led me into bad places before

So here I am. I’m still working out what to tell my partner (from whom my drinking is mostly secret), my friends and colleagues. But we’ll figure that one out later.

I let alcohol strip colour from my life.

I shrank and I drank. I thought it made me larger than life. It made me selfish, self centred, repulsed at myself, ashamed of myself, sad. Scared to look beyond the next drink. 

I am almost 9 months sober. I am growing every day in very, very, very small ways. Stretching a leg; building my confidence, my connections; standing a little taller, bursting with love and joy from my child. I am filling up with memories. Learning who I am. I am more me.

I let alcohol shrink me, I work with my sobriety to expand me.

Thank you in advance for reading my story.

Some backstory I guess, I'm 25 almost 26M. Had a lot of childhood trauma, and I had a lot of family problems pop up during college. Got diagnosed with depression during college. Took on a lot of stress financially, mentally, physically from about 2014 till this year. I was at my lowest when I was drinking myself to sleep alone at grad school, because I didn't know how else to get myself to stop working, I couldn't keep up with the work. That was 2018-2019. Left my dream career path and felt like a loser, moved and turned to shiftwork from 2019-2022. Not seeing the sun, working lab shiftwork took a heavt toll on my mental health. When I lost my grandfather in 2020, he wad the closest person to me in my family and I started spiraling again. Got into a bad habit of getting off work, going to a bar, getting dinner/getting drunk, going home getting 3 hrs of sleep, repeat. End of 2020 I got arrested for a DWI after I was pulled over for speeding. Ironically, I was having the best day I have had in years.

Since my DWI I have really changed my life around. I got out of the financial crisis I was living in for years. Got a new truck and a massive promotion at work that got me into a much healthier schedule. I got my long term girlfriend to finally move in with me. I even stopped drinking completely for about 4-5 months just to check up on myself and make sure I don't have a problem with it, and it wasn't difficult for me to say no to people.

Where I'm at now, I have beer in my fridge at home that's lasted me since probably December. My girlfriend works as a bartender at a pool hall, and I go see her at work on weekends to shoot some pool with people I've met there. At first I was very strict on not drinking, because I want to drive my truck home (blowbox). I would bring a gallon jug of water and leave when it was empty, usually by likd 11pm. 

But these days, I drink again. And I feel like I regret it almost every time. Spending too much money, staying out too late, sleeping in too late the next day and wasting half a day and feeling like shit anyway. I don't even drink that much. 3-4 beers. But I feel like I'm stuck in some kind of habit loop again. Cause 1 beer puts me out from driving my truck for an hour, so 4 beers I'm looking at a four hour night out, at least. 

I guess I'm just making this post to get my thoughts off my chest and out there to people who might understand. Part of me wants to give up drinking and smoking for the $$$ and my health, but part of me finds it really hard to give up that bit of socialization/safety blanket that makes me feel good. And also I worry about my girlfriend working till 2am at a semi-sketchy bar by herself, so I'm pretty much drawn to be there.

I was working night shift, and my dad gave me the brilliant idea to use it as a sleep aid (he is a heavy drinker). There were times where I would stop for a few weeks/months, but then would end up falling back into it. I had it pretty under control until around May 2019.

That month, I started a new, very stressful job (working in an ICU at a children's hospital) and my girlfriend (now fiancé) moved in with me. All at once. The insomnia was real, the anxiety was constant, and I lost several pounds just because of stress. I tried to give it up and keep it away, but I wasn't able to. I ended up staying with no more than two beers a night to fall asleep on nights where I had to work the next day.

Things sort of escalated, life didn't get less stressful for 2020-2021 (pandemic, ICU stuff, life, etc.), and for a while I was using alcohol, plus CBD, plus trazodone to fall asleep. Not a great time, and definitely overkill. That was the case until recently.

I have a weightlifting competition in May, and my fiancé and I are going to be in a circus act (doing partner acrobatics dressed as elephants) this Friday. I don't like the beer bloat, and I want to make it into the 89 kilo weightless (I'm at 90 now). I also realized recently that I'm not stressed about my job anymore, and I've acclimated after three years, so last night, for the first night in a few months, I didn't drink anything. At all. And I woke up feeling great. 

I guess I'm writing this to feel accountable. I want to be able to say, next weekend, that I've gone seven days without drinking. Trazodone is a great sleep aid on it's own. I hope that I can come back next Sunday and say ""I did it, and this is just the beginning.""",7,1

Never had an issue with drinking (or anything else) prior to mid/late college. Introduced to weekend binges in 2018 through college friends.

Starting in 2019 I drank liquor by myself to feel good and tune out in the evenings. This continued until late 2021 when a doctor told me I had very high triglycerides, cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure.  I reduced the frequency and amount. I bought an air fryer for fish and veggies and started to take prescription strength supplements from the doctor like vitamin D and EPA fish oil. I started losing weight and sleeping better. 

In the past 5 weeks I have abstained completely and the screaming, clawing cravings have dissipated. But there is something happening that is making me feel a kind of existential dread and anxiety that I have never felt before. 

I have a passion for indoor and outdoor plants, especially plants native to my area. I grew up with access to a garden and had family that taught me a lot about it. It makes me happy to see my own plants in pots growing, flowering, attracting all kinds of butterflies, caterpillars, moths, and last year, I started seeing lizards, frogs, and turtles stopping by. 

Since 5 weeks ago I have spent a lot of money and time on ceramic pots, potting mix, native plants, and seeds. I have all this energy to take on these projects even though I have minimal room (I rent and have a very small yard space). I have realized that I am spending a fortune on these things and starting extremely early in the season for my area (still dips below 40F sometimes). 

I have so much energy and creativity it feels like. I want to have so many plants and attract so many native critters. 

Through my grad program I get free access to Adobe Creative Cloud software. and a Gym. I keep thinking to myself, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE THINGS. Buy a new computer to handle that software. Get gym clothes and make yourself go. I could radically transform myself. Start making designs for RedBubble and videos and social media posts. I could make myself proud and financially independent by sharing what I love with the world, native plants, art, and the like. 

I am not manic but my significant other is worried about me because I don't feel much better, I actually feel worse in some ways. 

I can't bring myself to spend money wisely, be patient for the frost to pass, and I haven't taken advantage of all this free time with the gym or anything else. 

Movies and TV shows are not interesting to me and my SO's choice of reality TV is unusually irritating to me now (it is vapid and meaningless, and I don't find the humor funny anymore). I feel like I have a stick up my ass. I am grumpy with my SO but they are trying to support me. 

I am writing this just sitting inside on a beautiful day. I can't explain how I feel. It is like a dread. All the things I could be doing but am not. I am focusing on having to go back to classes and work this week. I have a ton of plants, potting mix, and pots around me and have made a mess. I spent so much money on these nice pots for the plants and my SO says I could have gotten way better deals. Where is the receipt so I can go help you return them? I don't know I say. My car is a mess. 

I keep day dreaming about owning land. All the native plants blooming and chickens and no pain. 

I am anxious about my plants. They might die with the cold. I couldn't wait to get them. I HAD to get them. I feel morbidly depressed and like I have no purpose if I am not growing something, caring for them, beautifying my corner of a town and neighborhood I despise. I don't like my grad program. It now feels like a drag and a huge waste of money and time. But I get all these things with it like the gym and Adobe Creative Cloud. My parents and SO say I will regret dropping this for the rest of my life but I can't see a clear reason for this degree, I am not on a career path that really requires a grad degree, not from what I can see on Indeed. 

I will continue to not drink. There are some positives I am not mentioning. My body, my family, and my SO are thanking me. My head and my heart are on fire though. 

Why am I not happy? What can I do? I am so, so, so bored and constantly anxious about my future. I am hemorraging money with these plants. I have no diversified income streams and my PT job sucks, as do my night classes. I still have a year of this program. I've been in school from PreK all the way until now with no break.

I sat there for a minute and realized that I have never had one. A small little thought arose that kind of sounded like, “watch me have one now.” Well, last night I did end up having one. However, I was not drinking. I was at my cabin back in high school and there was a bunch of kids who had stole alcohol out of my parents cabin. The adults were all searching rooms trying to find who may have their bottle stashed away somewhere, and my friend was panicking looking around our room, thinking someone may have hidden it in one of our drawers. I looked at her as she was crazily looking through everything and I said, “it’s okay if someone hid it in here. We didn’t drink. It doesn’t matter.” I have a feeling my “friend” was the old panicked me, and I was the current version of myself. That was kind of cool, and it sure felt that way too. Then a whole inception kind of thing took place-and I realized it was a dream. Lol.

Drinking and smoking.  And somehow, after years of barely scrounging 3 days of sobriety at a time, I was able to finally stop.  I spent 13 years being piss drunk 5 out of 7 days, blacking out, just getting worse and worse.  And not smoking made it so much harder because I couldn't rely on it as a crutch.  In the past it just got me right back into the booze every time.  Like they were both two sides of the same habit for me, couldn't have one without the other.  

But I made that promise and every time I almost fell off the wagon again I would think about her, and how I wanted her to grow up knowing she could trust me at my word.  I wanted her to know that when her father said he'd do something then it meant *he would do it*.  And I did.  And I'll keep doing it.  

For anybody who needs to hear this: you can do it too.  It took me several years of constant failure, and I mean CONSTANT failure.  I can't count how many times I'd say ""OK, never again"", and then three days later wake up with yet another hangover and smelling like an ashtray.  I completely believed that even six days sober would be a miracle.  The key was to keep trying, even if I didn't believe it I'd say ""OK, never again"" and keep going.  You just can't give up.  You only really fail when you stop trying.  

It's a daily thing, I know.  This is far from over.  It'll never BE over.  But today, even if I'm all by myself, I get to celebrate the milestone I thought I'd never see.

I have seen so many people relapse after many months, because they focus on quitting drugs and alcohol, and not enough **focus on really changing as a person**. Things like managing anger and stress. You're going to have a bad time in sobriety. We're going to need to get through those tough times without falling back into drugs and alcohol to cope. I'm not kidding, 75% at least, relapse before hitting 1 year. There are real stats out there, but I just pulled that one out of my ass. Even really ""happy"" sober people who seem to have it together. Usually it's one of these two situations: Overconfidence after some solid sober time, or giving up due to a lack of magical happiness manifesting from nowhere. Sobriety doesn't magically fix things. A ton of people may be sober, but not really changing in a meaningful way. It's taken me about 6 years to string together 2 years sober. I had not begun to *really* change until about 3 years ago, when I started to figure it out.

I'm no expert, and I'm only at 2 years, but I think some new people need to hear this. You're not going to have real, long-term success in sobriety if all you focus on is avoiding drugs and alcohol. That's not the only thing to it. The most powerful thing you can do is change yourself.

""Build a life you no longer want to escape with drugs and alcohol."" That's not just changing your surroundings, it's also changing how you yourself react and deal with life. I'm not saying ""magically become happy!"" It's a very slow process to actually change as a person. However, it makes sobriety so much easier when we aren't that same addict we were when we started.

If I could give anyone a place to start? I would say accepting things we cannot change is a really great place to start. Learning that there are so many things we cannot control, and being okay with that, grants me so much peace that I did not used to have. Sure, I still get upset, I'm no saint, but it's entirely different from the anger I used to have.",180,0

I only super watch my weight when I definitely need to lose some, otherwise I'm pretty casual about it. Right now my weight goal on my Fitbit is set for the lowest weight I previously had recorded on it. That previous weight was from 2016 - before my relapse. My last recorded weight on there symbolizes the point in my last recovery that I realized I'd lost more than I thought I could (still healthy weight, to be clear) and was confident enough to stop tracking it. I had confidence I'd stay around that weight by then and didn't want to get too obsessive since I was back into healthy territory and would still be fine either losing or gaining a couple pounds. And I was fine. Up until I relapsed on alcohol later in 2016; then it all started creeping back and then some.

I just weighed in about a pound less than that weight. I didn't eat all that well this week and wasn't actually expecting to hit my goal, I had already told myself not to worry about it.

The emotional part isn't so much about the weight itself, if that makes sense. It's like Past Sober Me is giving me a high five and telling me we can do it for good, without relapse, this time. And like I'm telling Past Drunk Me that we really can do it, we can do even better in recovery a second time if we only DO THE THING and stop drinking again.

This isn't me getting complacent, it's just a lot more emotional than I expected to hit a solid quantifiable goal that I haven't met since last time I was sober.

IWNDWYT!

(EDIT: Bc I know a lot of folks get frustrated about weight. Last time I was sober it took nearly 2 years to get to that goal weight. This time I've been sober for less time BUT I'd already started with diet and exercise for about 2 years before going sober again.

I said those words to my husband yesterday. I don't know if he was ready to hear them, he's always been quick to justify my drinking. It never seemed bad enough to him, I was never drunk enough, often enough, for him to see it as a problem. 

But I know regular people don't calculate the amount of alcohol in the house each night, tallying up the bottles of wine to make sure there is enough for me to get drunk without buying more. They don't check the clock to make sure there's enough time to start drinking and get drunk before bed. They don't plan where to have lunch based on which restaurants serve alcohol. 

They don't use every excuse to drink, meaning a celebration, a commiseration, a Tuesday, a Friday! All are good reasons to drink. And there have been plenty of times over the years where I have gotten ugly drunk. I've thrown up, I've fallen, I've broken things, spilled things, said and done things I shouldn't have. 

I have a night and morning routine around managing how much I drank the night before. Drink this much water, take Tylenol, take electrolytes, eat a big snack at night or a big breakfast in the morning. 

I don't want to be that person anymore. I don't want to sneak a beer or three before my husband gets home or our guests arrive, so I can drink the same amount they drink in front of them, but get drunk enough. I'm tired of the obsession. I want to be able to stay awake through a board game or a movie or a late night talk. I want to be able to read a book or watch a show without interrupting myself to get a drink, or sending my husband to the store for more alcohol because I drank it all too fast and I still need more. I want to be a better parent, who is present and patient and aware.

I need help.,"I started my reddit account almost four years ago because I wanted to join this sub. It was a last ditch attempt at trying to save my life. 

I'm here again because I need help. And I need help in finding a way past coming down from ""cloud nine."" 

Some context: 

I've been a drunk for 15 years and started 20 years ago.

The last few years have been marked by 2-3 months of sobriety, the longest stretch being 5 months, followed by days or even weeks of heavy binge drinking. 

These binges ruin a lot of progress I make. And it's seemingly taking longer and longer to spring back to life.  

The last hangover I had was the worst. I even wrote down my harrowing journey over 3 days to remind myself what happened. And i plan to read it when I feel like drinking. 

I honestly should've been hospitalized but American healthcare...

Now. All this being said, I want to make it clear I'm not going to go to aa.

I've been court ordered to go, gone on my own volition and gone to support others.I've taken what works and left the rest. 

I don't need to be told I'm powerless every day. I've been telling myself that my whole life and it's led to some serious self esteem issues. 

I am however planning on getting into therapy again asap, and I'm planning on just staying dry for a year. 

I think I can manage being a year sober. It's always easier for me to set a date instead of one day at a time or the dreaded forever. 

I have other goals too like losing weight, getting my sleep apnea under control, having a stable job and finding love. 

There is a lot on my plate and I can't be someone who ""puts sobriety first."" I drink cause my life fucking sucks. So I figure I need to simultaneously fix my life to at least curb my urge to drink. 

As it is, I manage fine for a few months when I'm seeing the immediate and positive outcome of sobriety yet I return to the bottle when I don't see the long term results I want. 

Things like Yoga, mindfulness, cardio, resistance training, golf, therapy (sometimes), even being more involved at work has helped. 

But here's where I get stuck. 

What can you do when you've exercised so much that you're basically injured, worked a mentally demanding job to the point of catatonia, done every possible chore you can think of and still lie awake in bed at night trying to sleep? 

What do you do when you don't understand the concept of less? What do you do when all your brain wants is MORE? 

How do you stop a body that does NOT want to sit still? 

How the fuck do you people deal with the monotony? 

I need to find solutions to staying sober longer than a few months and all I've come up with is just trying to fix my life. But I can't seem to get past a certain amount of time simply because I'm very unhappy being sober. Probably more so than being a drunk, it's just less anxious. 

Help is appreciated. Thanks in advance!",10,0

I am a very grown adult that moved in with my parents pre pandemic and ending up staying.. during that time I found out that I have been living with undiagnosed autism.

That changed everything and I do not know when I will be moving out now, or if I will ever really feel independent again. When I did live on my own it was pure hell, but at least I had the space I needed from other humans.

I feel like I have zero space to myself here, which is just not true. I have wonderful parents that are very understanding- I am so grateful for them. It's the autism that makes living with others almost unbearable. It's really hard to describe unless you have a brain like this and I wish I wasn't like this.

If I go out of the house when I am feeling like this, I run the risk of drinking, it has happened so many times. I know better now but I need space away from this house today. Normally I would go hiking or on a long ass walk but I am dealing with injuries right now and can't. I know that is the main problem here- walking is my SANITY- and the only time I feel like I truly get space from the world. I have been hitting the gym- but that is also overstimulating instead of being a release- I also keep lifting too heavy and hurting myself bc I am craving that hard work out feeling so bad. If I could go walk 5 or 6 miles right now I feel like I would be fucking fine! Ahhhhhhhh. 

I can't do coffee shops or things like that due to noise...I would really like to not be autistic today. 

Thank you for letting me vent. It's day 46 and I will not do anything that puts my sobriety in jeopardy. As mad as I am today, I am so proud of myself for not drinking this away. Even two months ago this would have forced me to the bottle. I can live in this anxious fucking mind one more day. This will pass and my injuries will heal. I will be able to walk again.

I was never someone who was drinking nonstop, 7 days a week. I wouldn't drive drunk. I didn't lose jobs. I didn't end up in jail or the hospital. 

But that's the thing - I'm 31 and have drank heavily since age 15. My mom, dad, and sister are all alcoholics. My best friends are drunks. My grandpa passed away from it. And every time I drank, I drank way more than I intended, and I wasn't willing to wait for one of those terrible things to happen to snap me out of it. 

I'd spend the whole night either sneaking more and more shots in the kitchen, or begging my husband to go buy me more, or skipping dinner at a restaurant to get drinks instead. I'd black out, every time. 

I'd message anyone I could with raunchy, needy, horny, lovey, cringy, or nonsensical stuff and have to go on an apology tour after. I'd wake up in the middle of the night, still half drunk, wondering what the hell I wrote to people. My heart racing as I searched through my phone. Sometimes I wouldn't touch my phone for a whole day after just to avoid the whole thing. 

And when I did have to apologize for messaging people some bullshit, do you know what they'd usually say? ""Haha, it's okay, I figured you were drinking."" I did this often enough that it was just expected now. Still, now, sober, I can't tell a friend how much they mean to me without them going ""aw lol, I love you too, are you drinking?"" How embarrassing.

Anyway. This sub is seriously saving my life. The encouragement, love, and support. The one day at a time attitude. Now, 50 days sober - I'm sleeping well. I'm exercising and eating right. I'm dependable. I'm stable. I'm happy. I'm me again.",161,0

Hi all! Sorry for missing the last few Sundays… we can all thank the finicky little badge bot for that.

Welcome to another edition of Shape Up Sunday, SuS for short. This is our weekly thread where we come together to set our fitness/diet/and mindfulness goals and intentions for the week. I like to reflect on our past week and chat about our wins (and losses) and leave them here. I find it is so helpful to chat it out with our peers, especially those in sobriety. For me, and many others, fitness/wellness and sobriety go hand in hand, so it’s nice to come together and have people to relate to! 

Personally, the last few weeks have been tough. I just came off a bout of covid, so my workouts did not happen. Thankfully I stepped it up on keeping my diet very clean while sick, and I got over it pretty quickly. I started back up on the Peloton last week, and am continuing that into this weekend. My husband is currently shopping for our meal prep, and I plan to spend some time on my yoga mat when I wrap up this post. All things considered, I’m getting back on track as best as I can. 

I have been a little “down” since getting sick, so I hope the working out and clean eating helps me. Through this, I’ve had some moments where things were tough and I wanted to drink- but I didn’t. Whenever I had an urge, I busied myself with something I consider mindful and good for my body/soul. Even 1.5 years in to sobriety, I sometimes have to whip out the old “toolbox.” I’m happy to have so many ways to power through one of these moments. 

Hopefully you all are finding your wellness grooves, looking forward to hearing from everyone today! What do you want to accomplish this week? 

Happy Sunday!

At the start of it, I was suicidal and self-harmed. But through speaking to the Samaritans and going to AA meetings, I feel I am in a better place. Just this last couple of days, I have been able to smile and laugh again. And it felt like that might never happen but it feels silly to have thought that now.

What brought me to the realisation that I am an alcoholic was I hurt someone that I loved with all my heart. They were angry, scared and didn't want to talk to me. I still don't know what I did, but whatever it was I know it was bad. Thankfully we have managed to get to a place where we can talk again. In fact we have agreed to be friends, even though we did end up in bed together yesterday.

I wanted to rush back into our relationship because it had brought me such joy and love. But reading the big book and listening to other alcoholics, I realised that it is not right for both of us to do that. I need to work on my sobriety so I can be trusted again and that I can trust myself again. So we have mutually agreed to take it slow.

I plan to keep going to virtual and physical meetings as much as possible. And I feel ready to go back to work next week. I am trying to surrender myself in so many ways, to not try to control everything and accept that. Because at least for me, that loss of control is what drove me to succumb to addictive substances. 

So I am looking forward to doing the hard work, truly feeling my emotions and to another day of sobriety.

I managed and it felt so good that I decided not to drink this weekend either and tbh, I felt it was even easier than last weekend. I have so much more time for other things and I feel much better mentally.

I think this was a great ""experiment"" for me because it made me realize that I often link certain activities (a housewarming, going to a bar) to alcohol, whereas it doesn't need to be like that.

I just wanted to tell you that being sad without alcohol will always be better than with it.

The phrase ""Wanna find out who your true friends are? Get sober."" turned out to be very true. Yes, I don't hang out with the same people anymore, but the people who stayed are my real friends. Yes, I feel like I'm less comfortable socially but on the other hand my relatives trust me, and I do less bullshit with my dates.

People tell me that I shine, that I look good, that I seem to make better decisions.True to be told : I have been forced to face the reality of my life for three months. It was very difficult but now it's kind of ok. 

I still sometimes find life without alcohol and drugs boring. I miss that feeling of invincibility, I miss feeling confident and free. I know that in the long run I will eventually find healthy ways to feel those emotions again.

I see quitting alcohol as a process. I'm learning to live again without these chemical barriers that I put between me and the world, it's hard but I know I'll be fine.

I feel like I'm dancing with the devil and teetering on the edge of something that could turn bad again and I'm kind of scared. I guess I have been trying the 'moderation' thing for a while. 
I quit drinking in the July just after Covid started, well, that was the time it stuck. I didn't touch a drop for 9 month and felt amazing. I was so proud of myself but also I guess some part of me hoped that I was one of the exceptions who could moderate their drinking. 
I started off just having one or 2 drinks one time. Then maybe a month or so later the same. Then over Christmas I went back home to Ireland and went binge drinking a few times. Since Christmas, I have been on 2 'nights out', the first I got black out drunk and don't remember, and the second was last night. It was a grim night. 
Where I live I really don't have many Irish friends, or friends in general, except one older lady I met through work. I guess she is about 70 years old, and I'm 28. I met her at her local pub for some food and drinks, where I also met most of her 'friends'. Most of them older men with wives at home and sugarbabies on their arms. Honestly, they were foul. They were so crude and it seemed all alcoholics, including my friend (and myself). Because I had driven there from another city, my friend offered me her couch to sleep on which I accepted. It's was about 6am at this point and we were both very drunk. I was shocked at how my friend spoke to the driver. She shouted at him calling him an idiot and stupid for accidentally taking a wrong turn. I was mortified. I don't want to end up an old drunk who only has alcohol in common with her friends. 
No one could consider the volume I drank last night to be moderation. Or the amount I drank the time before. I almost vomited driving my car back home this afternoon.
Why am I back here? What do I get from drinking and why did I decide I even wanted to moderate? I don't want it at all and I get nothing, NOTHING good from it... I'm so confused. I was even scared before going out because if the possibilities of what could happen if I got drunk, my main fear revolves around getting taken advantage of when passed out or black out drunk. But I still went anyway, luckily nothing like that happened, but why did I go of I was actually scared of the consequences at the time? I feel like I did it even though I kind of didn't want to.
I have an amazing boyfriend who has never drank in his life and I don't want him to have a girlfriend who goes out and drinks like a fish and looses control and gets in to terrible situations like I have in the past. I don't want to meet or associate with anymore questionable characters whos company I would never be in if it wasn't for alcohol.
I'm not sure what I need or want right now but I know I don't want to drink. I will reset my days as seeing them go up really helped me at the start. I should have done it after the first drink but I felt like it meant nothing lol.",11,1

I knew the husband before he got married, and they are letting me stay with them while I sort through the home buying process. I'm really grateful that they're letting me stay with them, but alcohol is ever-present in this house. She especially likes to drink, and since she works from home (the husband and I work at the same place) she feels like she doesn't get to go out as often as she'd like. 

So tonight I went with them to the home of another couple the same age as all of us (early 30's) whom I also know, but not as long as them. It was the usual fun chit-chat before their kids went to bed, and they all know I'm not drinking and there was thankfully never any pressure on me to drink. 

After they put their kids to bed the drinks flowed much more freely. They both drank quite a bit, but she got kind of sloppy, and was really loud knowing that our friends' kids were trying to sleep upstairs. She also likes to argue when she drinks and was kind of baiting the host with things she knew he'd argue with her about. Neither of them made many coherent points. I stuck with the exhausting conversation for as long as I could, but eventually hung out on the couch with the dog and played with my phone.

I finally got them both in the car after a good bit of convincing and the ride home was one of constant repetition, complaining of wanting fast food, and gratitude for me being willing to drive them home. When we got home she initially tried to sleep on the stairs until her (also drunk) husband told her she had to come to bed. They have to get up and go to the airport in 5 hours. I texted him after they went to bed to not be afraid to wake me up if they need another ride. I'd much rather be mildly inconvenienced than see my friends get hurt out of pride. 

I hope I don't sound too judgmental. I just couldn't help seeing flashes of my own past drunk self in their behavior. I would've been right there with them, trying to shout over one another about pointless subjects. I would've been pining for McDonalds that I don't need. I would've been an absolute worthless wretch in the morning. As it is, none of those things have happened or will happen, and it's the sort of reminder I needed to stay the course.",117,0

She continues to endure me even after all I put her through.  I definitely feel my drinking took more out of her than it did me.  It wasn't until today that I truly understood the depths of her pain.

I quit drinking in December 2018 and since then have been focused on burying the man that alcohol made me.  I have moved forward, achieving every personal and professional goal that I have ever desired.  Every milestone I pass pushes the memory of my alcoholism further and further into the rearview.  Every achievement is one more barrier between me and the bottle.  I have developed a resiliency to life that does not depend on alcohol, and I know that I am safe from taking a drink, for now.  I just feel better, you know? Happy, alive, ready to surmount any obstacle.  I am OK.

But she doesn't know that.  I tell her.  Every couple of weeks it gets brought up and I ask, ""Am I the same as when I was drinking?"" ""Have I not gotten better?""  Then she tells me that nothing has changed and she still worries that she's going to find my stash.  Even though I am doing so well and continuously assure her I am not drinking, she is the one who is still burdened by my alcoholism.  For so long I have thought that she was exaggerating, or that if this is how she truly felt, then there was nothing I could do to convince her otherwise.  Then today happened.

The topic got brought up again, I said the same things, then she said the same things, but then it hit me out of nowhere like an absolute ton of bricks, leaving me sitting in my room in tears.  *When I was drinking, I abandoned her for the bottle.  When I quit drinking, I ran as fast and as hard as I could away from the bottle,* ***and abandoned her again****.*  I moved to Alaska, buried myself in schoolwork, set goals and focused my efforts on achieving them to push the memory of my alcoholism as far into the past as possible.  I feet better.  My beautiful wife on the other hand, the one I abandoned, hurt, lied to, she only sees me running.  She hears my words, the promises, the reassurances, the exact same ones she has heard before, and she knows that I am one bad week, day, hour from crawling back into the bottle.  She has been worrying this whole time.  As I have been feeling better, getting better, living, she has just been waiting for the inevitable fall.  I ran away from the pain and left her holding all of it.

That is what I realized today.  It doesn't matter what I say.  It doesn't matter how I feel.  There are no words of mine that can assure her that this time is different, that I am better now.  She worries about me all the time, and I did that to her, I left her to bear that alone.  The only way I can help take some of that burden from her is by slowing down.  I need to become active in my recovery again, relearn the tools, and replace the barricades that I have neglected for so long.  My wife wont be free from the burden of my alcoholism until I prove that it is safe to let her guard down.  My alcoholism burdens my wife, but it is my burden to bear.  I must be active in my recovery to prove that it is safe to love me again.

tldr: I though I regained my life, but I never regained my wife.",27,0

Hello and Happy Sunday Sober family. Nice to meet you all. This is my first time hosting the DCI, and I’m happy to be here with everyone in different parts of the world. Today I’d like to share something odd I do as a sober person. I find myself “checking out” bars and liquor stores. Meaning I’m driving by and just staring at them.  I slow down and gaze past.  I asked myself why I’m doing this. Some sort of a longing I suppose?  

Before I begin to romanticize my past relationship with alcohol, I grab the steering wheel of my mind and change direction. It’s so easy to blot out the bad times and remember what “good times” I had with alcohol, but it’s a slippery slope.  If I really think about it, alcohol didn’t offer only the good times. Alcohol offered the bad too like embarrassment and headache and regret and shame, addiction, dependence.  I hated being dependent on it.  I hated the mornings when I needed a beer just to combat the shakes and be in a good mood.   I hate knowing that I needed alcohol to function in that manner.  

Now that I’ve changed direction I find myself falling into old things I used to enjoy before a time when I let alcohol control my life, before I becamed chained to the bottle.  It’s nice to be back in what feels like centered in myself and experiencing things all over again that are old yet somehow new and different and better.   It’s comforting to know that no matter where I am today, I can change the direction of the path my life is taking and steer myself towards something better.  I’ll leave this quote for today.

“You can’t go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending.” Beloved Sober Family, IWNDWYT",460,0

Last year in May, I went to hangout with my brother, got black out drunk, and I drove. I drove in an area I wasn't comfortable with, I have no idea how I got home. I do remember covering one eye with my hand as I couldn't figure out what lane I was in. This was one of many wake-up calls. I could have hurt someone else, I could have hurt myself. I made it home safe and sound but was so distraught and disgusted with myself for getting black out drunk again. I read The Naked Mind and was sober for 5 months, I travelled and wondered if I'd be OK on vacation, I tried a few drinks, 3 in fact and had no urge to pick it up. I was good, healthy, clean, the self-loathing that was ever present and killing me inside slowly disappeared, meditation and being present helped. I was proud of myself.

I went to a wedding abroad recently, for some reason the urge to drink came up, the conflict raged inside and I gave in. 2 days, perfectly fine, the 3rd day I had a shot of whiskey straight and it went downhill from there. I asked my sister if I had been alright, she said I was. She didn't see the interaction between me and the groom (good friends), the way he aggressively pushed me away, she didn't she his friend turn away from me after I said he was clingy. I guess I didnt get the memo that badmouthing the groom is a no no. I apologised to him after but he hasn't responded, so I guess this is my first relationship that I've ruined. 

Its been 3 days and the self-loathing, the guilt, the shame, the anger at myself and at them (irrational defensive mechanism) has been killing me inside. I keep thinking I should just die (suicidal ideation comes on strong in the aftermath of a binge - I would never do this), I guess it's just self inflicted punishment. This isn't me, I dont know who this person is, I hate her. I've been in bed for 3 days because I cant bear to deal with the constant intrusive thoughts, I know the past is the past. There isn't anything I can do about it. I have to move forward. I just wish it wasn't such a difficult and lonely path, the difficulty is in processing all the emotions. I feel sick with the pain I've caused myself and others. Sometimes, I just want to let it all burn.

I believe (think) that I'll make it through this, I cant afford anymore wake-up calls. I dont want this. Its been 3 years since I've started on this journey and this sub has helped me out a lot. I just wanted to let it out, and lighten my burden a bit. Thanks for reading.",19,0

- worst days were: the first couple of days, first weekend, and especially the first day I had a miserable day at work. Besides those it's been more or less tolerable, just going to bed early lots at first 
- overall it's been easier than I thought after the initial period. By the 3rd weekend my cravings were more out less gone, 4th weekend I'm barely thinking about it
- I no longer need sunglasses outside, and I don't mind the blinds open anymore inside 
- my attitude has improved immensely, more hopeful and optimistic about life, much more energetic. I can accomplish a whole lot more and am much more motivated to do chores etc. 
- my friends and family are much more supportive than I expected. I've lost zero friends over this, and they are all big drinkers. Never felt embarrassed telling anyone. No one was surprised 
- my memory has improved DRAMATICALLY. Im terrified about what is gone for good. Id say it took around 2 weeks to feel like my head was actually clear. I can think hard again, goldfish memory slowly going away. 

- it's not all good. I think I'm more impatient, and my temper is quicker. (I pray this fades over time) 
- migraine headaches were nasty the first week. Now they are gone completely, I used to get them every couple of days while still boozing. It's an amazing feeling. 
- Sunday night anxiety is still a thing 
- not having something to cope with when shit goes wrong is rough. I'm definitely not through the worst of the mood swings.
- I was delusional in thinking that most of my problems would go away when I quit booze, in reality, it's solved many important things (more money, getting to work on time, spending more time with family, better outlook on life, health benefits) But a large amount of the problems are still here, but now I feel better about tackling them, and maybe more importantly, i know that I need to and can't keep kicking the can down the road. But definitely tougher when I can't run away to the bar. I am much more aware of and concerned about things now like my health and finances, can't really just say fuck it any more with having a clear head. 
- I thought my blood pressure would go down faster than it has. I thought I'd lose more weight than I did (like zero lol, the cravings for junk food are still bad)
- I still need to lean on NA beers in social events. I feel like this is an easy one to overcome eventually tho. 
- I feel foolish for spending so much time and money in this garbage over the years. Honestly, when I looked in the mirror shortly after starting sobriety, I cringed. I had a hard time looking. I felt stupid. I still do. I can't imagine going back. 

 I honestly thought this was impossible. It's not. If I can do it anyone can. iwndwyt!

There was a get together after a match and this is usually where it gets dicey for me. Luckily, I had two NA beers with me and sparkling water. 

Someone almost poured beer into my mug and my first instinct was to pull away and half-shout “no.” Poor girl was taken aback. 

I was really worried about this event, but by the time people started getting absolutely hammered, I was ready to go home. 

I felt as if I really had my own back. I was protective over my sobriety and I also discovered I’m decently funny even without the alcohol.

Lots of fun, I finally beat my dad, and I damn near beat my friend. Couldn't have done it if I was drinking like I used to. I even managed to win a few games of chess while enjoying a cigar with my neighbor after. And I won't be hungover tomorrow, so I can crush some boulders and hit the shooting range.

It was such a productive month. Then came November, and I was hit with the deepest sense of dread and self doubt and I started drinking again. A lot.

Fast forward to mid-December, and I’m drinking at least a bottle of wine a night if not more. Every single night. And it was making me miss so many important things, meetings, classes, etc. but yet I couldn’t stop.

I almost didn’t even go back home for the holidays because I just was drinking so much and so often that I didn’t buy anyone gifts until literally the 24th. I ended up catching covid while home and that actually got me to stop for about a week. But then after I recovered I went right back to the wine.

Now it’s February and I think I have to delay my graduation from my program because I just completely wasted the last few months heavy drinking and hating myself. It’s so bad because sometimes I get really really depressed while drunk and will self harm. I haven’t self harmed in so long but this past month I’ve done it a lot and much worse than before. 

I feel like a failure. I don’t want to throw every opportunity away. I’ve worked so hard to get to where I am in life but yet my stupid disposition to drinking has the tightest grip on me than ever before. The worst part is that I still want to drink! My body craves it at this point.

I’ve been able to stop for like a few days at a time but then I end up giving right back in. I don’t know what to do, I wish I could just end it all. I’m so tired of the pain, the self hatred, the annoying voice in my head, the loneliness. Alcohol has been my only escape. And it makes me so sad how much it’s ruining me.

Yes, I've had enough. And I'm truly ready to do something about it. I've been through inpatient/outpatient rehab and therapy. I've seen psychiatrists and have been diligent taking my medication. Yet, I haven't been able to stick to it.

That is, until now. I truly think this is my bottom. I'm ready to get out. I'm ready to take control over my life.

Listening to her shaky voice, begging me to get the help hit me in a way I never thought possible. The thought of losing my best friend is something I can't shake. The way I've treated her and the things I've said to her in my drunken stupor is a deep, constant pain. I'm not sure I can forgive myself for these things. How can I possibly treat someone I love so much so poorly?

I've had enough of this shit, and I'm ready to get fucking sober. I'm ready to be my best self, The Sober Stu. Today is yet another day 1. But I'm ready to make a real, lasting change.

So here I am, universe. I'm asking for peace and forgiveness. I'm asking for guidance to a positive mindset. I'm asking for love and true happiness. I'm asking to discover the person I know I can be.

It all starts today. Another day 1. I'm making it my last day 1.

Thanks for your support, SD.

Was a daily (but not always heavy) drinker before this  with some periods of sobriety. Basically a functioning alcoholic on and off for around 20 years.

Anyway, I don't think I've ever had to deal with a significant life crisis without alcohol before and now a family member is terminally ill. 

I won't drink. I'm sure of that (whilst being mindful of the potential to slip) . But I realised today that I now don't have the crutch of reaching for a drink to take the edge off difficult things. And because I always used alcohol, I haven't developed other healthy habits or mechanisms for dealing with tough stuff, like death or loss. 

I'm planning on dusting off my running shoes and have booked therapy. But I'm wondering if anyone has any other advice for dealing with this horrible situation.

It was for my partner’s birthday so mostly his friends. I stayed for about 2 hours. My body felt a bit awkward and I wasn’t as chatty as I would have been when drinking, but I still managed to have conversations and made some people laugh. 

I kid you not, I can’t remember going to a party without drinking since I was 15, before my first ever drink. I’ve been a weekend binge drinker and I’ve been sober for 5 weeks now. 

Anyway, then the heavier drugs came out, and I couldn’t handle the ‘fear of missing out’ so I left.

Just to add, my partner only drinks (no drugs), and he also encouraged me to go home whenever I wanted as he knows I’m at the beginning of my journey. 

I’m glad to be home and comfortable but I also still am getting pangs of ‘oh it would have been great to stay and bond and do loads of drugs and booze’. But I’m not missing out. I have to keep reminding myself of that. I’ll wake up tomorrow remembering why I chose to be sober.",39,0

I'd manage two days, three days... before the most recent relapse I had almost eight days.  Screwed it up and drank for the next eight days.  My last drink was this past Monday, on Valentine's Day.  And bad wine too; couldn't it at least have been champagne??  Anyway, it'll be day 5 at midnight tonight and I'm feeling great, next to no cravings, clear head, why did I miss out on this for twenty years.  We're going to our favorite Irish pub for dinner.  I have broken my sobriety at this restaurant before.  The urge to have a pint will probably hit me.  Just one...you always have a beer here... But I don't want to.  I don't want to set myself back again, and have to start at the beginning again.  I never want to go through another day 1 again.  I'm going to try having black tea with my fish and chips.  That's just as British as a pint.  I'm posting here because I don't have any other support; my husband, who will go to his grave a moderate drinker, has absolutely no idea how bad my alcoholism has gotten or that I've quit drinking entirely.  I'm not at a point where I can tell him about it.  He'll probably wonder why I'm not getting a beer, although he may or may not say anything about it.  And my dad is visiting, who is a hardcore alcoholic and will almost certainly never change.  I'm pretty sure he has at least eight drinks a day and has for at least a decade.  He and I used to drink loads of wine together when he visited and have drunken conversations about the meaning of life which were almost certainly just a bunch of nonsensical babble out of two drunks.  He actually does know that I have a drinking problem, in fact is literally the only person who knows, because I confessed it to him when he was visiting over Christmas, after I ruined New Year's being black out drunk.  He was supportive, but at the time I only said I wanted to cut down, not quit.  I doubt he'll say anything tonight either.  Watching him on this visit, stealthily drinking up the entire bottle of the cheap brandy I keep around for cooking, is actually helpful in keeping me from drinking.  He's a shell of his former self and he has no clue that he is.  And I don't want to end up that way.  Any more than I already have.  So I'm pledging to all of you wonderful people that I will not drink tonight.  And I'll come home and post about it this evening.  Let's do this thing!

Update:. I did it!  I only had tea!  Didn't have time to update last night but doing it now.  The tea was terrible, worst kind of bagged tea really, but I didn't care.  Plain water was also a good contrast to the greasy fish.  My husband and my dad had beers and I honestly didn't want one at all.

I'm not someone who has trouble controlling my drinking. It's easy for me to have one or two drinks and stop.

But drinking ties into my real vice / lifelong struggle: **overeating**.

When I drink, my hunger signals get scrambled. I feel hungry even though I've already had plenty of food.

When I drink, my stomach gets upset. Then I need to eat light carbs to settle my stomach down – more calories I don't need.

When I drink, I flare up my chronic pain condition. Flare-ups take ages to get over, and I often end up eating while I'm in pain to distract from the feeling. 

When I drink, it's easy to slip into ""we're relaxing!"" mode. And ""we're relaxing!"" mode also includes eating whatever I feel like and scrambling to eat as much as I can before I ""have to get back on track"" tomorrow.

When I drink, what I'm really doing is **trying to create a feeling**. And that's exactly what I do with food too – I overeat to feel good and block out feeling bad. Let's stop doing that, overall. Let's face life boldly head-on, feel the feelings, and figure out what I REALLY want. 

**Let's create the life that exists on the other side of numbing my feelings.**

Conveniently for me, I'm making this decision 5 minutes before I head to a wedding where I know absolutely no one other than the bride.

Well, no better time than the present to start. ""If you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere."" What better place to learn how to do this than this wedding?

It's going to be scary at first. **And then I'm going to feel so damn strong and proud.**

I'll check in with you guys afterward and let you know how it went. And you may see me commenting here from my phone if I need to reinforce things for myself while I'm there.

I got quit like a woman and I didn't expect to love it, I was just in a validation that I'm doing the right thing mindset but the book is actually really good and I am slowly becoming proud of myself again.

I could have had so many excuses to drink for the past month or so and yet, I'm proud to say I don't need a day count reset. I've also made some important and very much needed positive changes in my life while feeling like shit and it feels like a major win.

And today I had slept over 11 hours, mainly due to being exhausted for being up for 20+ hours yesterday, then I ran 4 miles at the track near my house to train for a half marathon in April, which I just signed up for moments ago. I'm attending a dinner with some friends and a concert afterwards, but I don't envision myself drinking alcohol nor do I mind seeing others having a drink.

Here's why I keep coming back.","On February 19th, 2018, I had my last drink. It was vodka and Gatorade (mostly vodka) in a plastic bottle, in the car as my wife drove me to detox. I was an absolute wreck of a human being, filled to my eyeballs with fear, anxiety and sheer desperation. Until that day, I was too sick to keep drinking, and too terrified to stop. I was a hungry ghost, barely clinging onto existence. Now, four years later, I'm still here, and life is better in almost every conceivable way. I've spent just as long sober as I did getting my college degree. It's an amazing thing.

Someone here recently asked, ""If you've been sober for a long time, why do you keep hanging around here?"" That's a fantastic question. Here's my answer:

* I need to stay green. If you keep at this thing, you'll eventually notice that things get better and easier over time, to the point where life just seems...normal. The chaotic highs and lows of being drunk all the time taper off to a nice steady rhythm. Small bumps on the road here and there, but rarely any euphoric highs or crushing lows. When everything's going okay, that's when the alcoholic who lives in the back of my head likes to chime in with his charming bullshit. ""You're fine now, you can just have one,"" and so on. You know that voice. So it's absolutely critical for me to remember how completely and thoroughly broken I was at the end of my drinking and the beginning of this wonderful new life. Because that's exactly what awaits me if I start drinking again. I've run the experiment too many times, and I know exactly how it turns out. So I need to be here to hold space for you, to hear your stories, and to remind myself of what things were like and how far I've come. And that makes me feel so profoundly grateful.
* I need to stay present. I've been sober for 1,462 consecutive days, but the only day that ever really matters is this one. Today. Twenty-four hours. I get the same today as everyone else, and it's up to me to figure out what I'm going to do with it, and who I want to be. No matter what happens today, if my head hits the pillow at the end of it and I didn't drink, I win. Period, full stop.  What do I win? Clarity. Serenity. Empathy. Kindness. A wife who loves and respects me and a son who didn't have to see his dad passed out drunk today. If I want that prize, I can't drink, or else it all goes away, like tears in rain.
* I need to stay connected. Alcoholism (and I consider myself a recovered/recovering alcoholic) is a disease of isolation and loneliness. Like a wolf or a coyote, it wants to get me alone. If I'm in the middle of the herd, though, I have all that protection around me, and it doesn't stand a chance. If I start drifting towards the outside of the group, it'll have its chance to pick me off, and that's the last thing I want. If we stick together, we're gonna be alright. Thanks for being my herd, and having my back. You know I have yours.
* To help! We learn a lot about ourselves and about drinking along this path, and many people with excellent, long-term sobriety shared their wisdom with me when I was new, so I find it incredibly important to offer the same kindness, knowledge and support. It's an established fact that helping others helps us, too. (In psychology, it's called ""[Helper Theory](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-joy-giving/200809/updating-the-helper-therapy-principle),"" and it's remarkably effective.) Selfishly, helping newcomers out makes me feel good, and, more importantly, it makes me not want to drink. So I'll keep doing that whenever and however I can. Plus, I get to meet cool and interesting new people without having to go to a bar, which is a major bonus.

There are more reasons, but those are the most important ones. Anniversaries can be filled with strong emotions, and this one is no different for me. Mostly, I feel gratitude. I'm grateful to be sober, grateful for my life, and grateful for this community. And tomorrow, I'll wake up and do it all again for another 24 hours. Thank you for being here for me, and like every day in the past four years, I WILL NOT DRINK WITH YOU TODAY!

Your friend, Turtle

I am comfortable being sober around friends. I can even go to a bar with them and not drink, no problem. It's not a craving for the substance that gets me. It's the idea of going out and walking around and seeing where the day takes me when it's 60 degrees and sunny. Talking to strangers in a socially acceptable setting. Having an adventure.

Except more often than not, what starts as a friendly conversation with some tourists turns into 10 missed calls from my spouse, a bunch of cigarettes even though I quit, random stops on the way home to charge my phone but also drink more, a blackout. But the idea of losing the adventure is really hard to wrap my head around, even if that is just an illusion I've romanticized in my head that has little relation to the sad reality.

I quit drinking on 1/1/2021. Haven't had a sip since then, except when I accidentally picked up a beer can sitting next to my seltzer and took a sip, which I immediately spit out

The main catalyst for my quitting was because my drinking and the habits surrounding it forced my girlfriend to move out with our 5 month old son in November of 2020.

So I did my ""woe-is-me"" binging and then cleaned myself up. I sought therapy, got on antidepressants, and focused on my job and being the best father I could be. My progress lead to my girlfriend moving back in with my son, a promotion at work, and (with the promotion) the ability to start renting a house for us instead of the small apartment we were in.

Now, for my girlfriend... She and I have had a rocky road. She had cheated on me. More than once. Several times. But I am in love with her, deeply, and always believe that she won't do it again. She has continued drinking all along, which I have no issue with because she is a stay at home mom and our son is a handful. I found healthier ways to unwind, whereas she hasn't gotten there yet. But she did recently start therapy and also started taking antidepressants. And now I'm 99% sure she is cheating on me.

I don't want to go into the details because just thinking about it causes me a lot of pain. This is resurfaced trauma from every other time this has happened, and it gets worse each time.

But I'm home alone today. And her case of beer is sitting right across the room. And I am feeling the weakest I have felt since I quit.

Any kind words of support or advice are welcomed.

I was even able to converse with my friend's dad! Previously we had only met while at the pub but after the initial uncomfortableness, my nervous settled and was able to enjoy the conversation. I would not have been able to handle that situation a few months ago.

a year ago i was standing at the top of a bridge, ready to take my own life, being wrestled to the ground by 10 or more police, full of a bottle of whiskey and done with the world. 

today, my skin is glowing. my car has insurance and i’m not driving around with a 0.2 BAC. I still get nervous when police are behind me, but now I can breathe a sigh of relief when i realize i’m doing nothing wrong. 

i am much more in control of my emotions. only rarely do they feel bigger than me. 

my relationships with my daughter, my boyfriend, and my family have improved greatly. 

the ONE thing i can’t seem to figure out is this:

i don’t know how to feel like myself again. i used to drink to cope with anxiety and fear of social situations. now that i am sober (and happy about it) I find myself to be meek, timid, and like I can’t be myself. I am overthinking a lot! anyone else deal with this?

I don't know about y'all, but I started drinking around the age of 16-17, and started heavy nicotine use around 17 as well. Now, I don't have any science or anything to back this up, but it seems to me all these emotions and mood swings experienced in quitting these substances (I quit nicotine about 10 years ago) are just our emotions and vibrational energy trying to immediately catch back up. These substances are such a soul-killer and energy suck that we just get stuck at the emotional age we started using them at. 

No wonder I have literally ALWAYS been jealous in every relationship I've ever been in, and lacking trust and self-confidence. No wonder I ALWAYS lash out in anger when drinking like the angst a 16 year old has for the world. No wonder I am not a well-adjusted adult. No wonder I have been so ""stuck"" in my life ever since then...I've been acting with a fucked up energy running through my body at ALL times (drinking - hangover - hangxiety - drinking again cycle). An energy whose should purpose is to keep us anchored down, never able to swim away and start life as it should actually be lived.

I've had some pretty heavy life things happen after stopping drinking and can count on one hand the number of times I've had a real craving. That said my wife is out of town on a business trip for the first time and I realized I could totally get away with drinking if I wanted to. I played the tape forward. I could go drive around a bunch and do errands to run the car out of gas then I'd prepay just under that 3/4 of a tank and sneak a 12 pack into 1 bill. She's gone 3 nights so I'd drink it all the first night so there would be no chance of a hangover or smell and have it out in the trash that same evening. Since we live in an. Apartment there would be no way to say it was mine. I literally could have done it if I wanted and that was both terrifying and thrilling. I was up for hours just thinking about it. 

Then I realized all this effort and worrying and thinking about it. Is this what I want? Even if I could do it and get away with it what would it before? Even if I got the exact amount of drunk I wanted and managed to hide it with no consequence thy am I doing it? Is the feeling g of alcohol really that great? 

I miss drinking to some degree. I miss cocktail bars and I want to have a beer with my coworkers. I am likely going to go on naltrexone / do sinclair in a year so I can do those things again. Right now though proving to myself that I can live sober (in case nal doesn't work for me and i choose permenant sobriety) is what I want. I don't want to need alcohol. With this realization the craving passed and I'm just living my life this weekend with my sobriety intact. I'm proud I don't need alcohol and I can overcome cravings if they come my way.

So my plan for Friday night was to get takeout, put my son to bed, and watch the Lord of the The Rings with my wife, while eating a disgusting amount of ice cream. 

And... I did it! I got through a Friday night without drinking. I've been worried about it all week, and through the movie, I was a little... on edge? uncomfortable?

The party scene at the beginning, with all the hobbits getting drunk and high and jamming out, that was a little triggering, but I shoveled ice cream into my face until I felt sick and couldn't imagine drinking.

It \*did\* work, though, and I want to thank everyone who was so awesome in that post earlier in the week. It seems a little strange, but I felt like... I felt like I would be letting everyone down if I drank. I don't \*really\* know any of you, but all that support was very moving. So, thank you.

 I see myself drying my eyes and being greatly relieved at first. But, then, I imagine Mama not immediately dropping everything to untangle the yarn to my expectations.
 Even though I made the mess (and threw a hissy fit over my inability to fix it), I begin to think I️ can do the job better than my mother.
 She lays aside the yarn to tend to something else.
 Of course, I️ pick it up and proceed to undo all her progress and make the mess worse than ever.

And how sobriety is a field with clean air and green grass and pretty little flowers and lots of super cool sober people to spend time with ... but you have to crawl through the world's worst obstacle course to get there. And how people start over, over and over again, and end up convinced that the obstacle course is never ending. When, in reality, it does end, and even before it ends, it gets better, easier, because you get stronger. (If anyone has that post saved and could link me, I'd be forever grateful. Somehow forgot to save it myself.)

Something really clicked for me, when I read that. Comically-loud-thunk-inside-my-head kind of ""clicked into place"".

I don't think the post itself was some kind of miraculous writing that fixed my relationship to alcohol. I think I was just in the exact right emotional space for that writing to impact me, to change me.

Therapy helps, too, ngl. (Biggest mental shift was realizing my drinking was an attempt to escape the symptoms of my PTSD. I'm not trying to ""be sober"" - I'm trying to build a life from which I do not need to escape. That includes getting help from other people, which hoo boy, am I bad at asking for help, but I'm working on it.)

Will this be it? Will this be the year where I finally am sober, forever and ever? Eh, who knows. But I do know that this time is just as hard as all the other stints of sobriety, while being a lot easier in the same breath. Every time I start to make excuses in my head (one drink won't hurt!) - I talk myself out of it by reminding myself that I really really *really* do not want to go back to the start of the obstacle course.

Also, I keep telling myself that if I make it to 30 days, then I can definitely make it to 69 days. Eyyy 😎

Anyway, I wanted to share this, in case it helps someone else out. Thanks for listening, fellow sobernauts! IWNDWYT!

Each day, month, and turning of the sun has brought new rewards and new challenges.  After years of drinking but pretending it was not a lot, these two years, especially the last few months, have been a succession of experiences in which I have engaged for the first time in a long time sober, without my crutch of drink.  Especially in a new professional situation, I have mourned my choice to forego alcohol, where I see how it allows for relaxation and bonding among coworkers and colleagues that is not an option for me.  I have been in family situations for the first time in forever, fully sober and what for me feels exposed.  Year one was about the release from feeling trapped in the cycle, tremendous self-care and pride.  Year two is about gaining the strength to face and feel a tremendous amount of emotional pain that no doubt drove my drinking, related to my family of origin.  It is humbling to sit with this pain, to sit with the human capacity to feel and mourn and grieve and make new roads, better habits, find places and sources of joy and creativity and community.  I guess I want to say that I am very grateful to be sober.  There is one morning where I woke up hungover and thought ""I may never get out of this.  This is serious.""  I am out of that.  I am now into another part of my life, also scary but authentic and mine.  Its impossible for me to post something that says it gets easier.  The not drinking, for me, gets easier.  Its rarely a thought.  Life is hard and what I have to remember is that drinking was stopping me from my true path of healing, of learning- it delayed, for me, a necessary growth that I am only truly now embarking on.

After they left and our our kids were in bed, I got my wife a beer from the fridge saying she earned it. I was happy to report that I had NO cravings or thoughts of ""missing out"" on anything. 

When I first started this journey in the beginning of January I knew I wanted to quit, but my thought was I simply that I was re-evaluating my relationship with alcohol. I didn't know if I wanted to quit for 1 week, 1 year, or five years; but I always kind of knew I would delve back into it after I felt comfortable. Flashback to last weekend when I had 18 sober days under my belt. I felt confident, strong, rested, and clear for the first time in years. The wife and I went away for the weekend and I dipped my toe into drinking thinking, one beer is enough and everything would be fine! One turned into two and before you know it, its 2:30 in the morning - I woke up sweating and in a startle and I wasn't quite sure how I got to bed. The TV was on and I apparently even tried to get the Wordle. What a fucking joke. 

I can honestly feel this time being different and I know that I have no intentions to drink in the future. Two mantras on here that are helping include; ""Play the tape forward"" & ""The only drink I can turn down is the first one.""

He’s (47M) one of those people who just shouldn’t do any kind of addictive drug because he just overdoes it. Almost died of a heroin addiction but no longer uses it. No more cocaine due to heart issues. Still smoking like a chimney, but recently quit drinking. Mainly because I (32F) broke up with him over a scary and abusive incident 4 months ago and refused to talk to him if he had been drinking.

I was drinking more than ever since the pandemic hit. I quit to curb my habit for mental health reasons, to look after my general well being, and to support him and a healthy relationship for the both of us. I even switched to a booze free work environment.

Our agreement was more of a “ I can’t feel safe around you unless you’re sober” rule I instated after the countless times he has scared the shit out of me while in a blackout state. There were long talks about boundaries and grandiose promises to cut alcohol out completely, after trying the No Hard Liquor rule or the 3 Count Rule to miserable failures. 

Yesterday I enthusiastically congratulated him on his 2 month milestone to tell him how very proud I was and how magical things have been since we both chose to only hang out sober.

It’s not that he took *allegedly* one shot of vodka tonight that has me upset. It’s that he looked me straight in the eye and said he didn’t have anything to drink until I told him I could smell it on him. Then he denied it again and said he ate mushrooms and that’s why he “was a little off,” before I called bullshit and reminded him that I saw him eat them the day before. He didn’t even try to argue. Finally he admitted okay, he had a measly shot. 

His exact words were that he needed to taste vodka one more time to be sure he didn’t like it 🙄 Then he said, “it was just a shot so it’s on you if you choose to be mad at this.” 

I was so optimistic, maybe too much so, but he kept saying how it was so easy to not drink. I feel crushed all over again, and foolish that I expected him to go longer without relapsing. Is it normal to be this disappointed? 

left to meet other friends and considered a revenge shot While I was waiting for my soda. If he doesn’t give a fuck, why should I?

My mood has just done a whole 360.,"I decided to do Dry January cause I knew my drinking had gotten worse over the years and I figured it would help to experience a break. It was never really my intention to quit, just a break. After week 3 I was feeling really good. I was productive at work, I felt rested on my weekends, and I was never missing workouts. I really started to consider just getting rid of alcohol all together cause I felt great.

Then January came to an end and those thoughts crept back into my head “Do you REALLY think you are NEVER gonna have another drink until the day you die? Come on man just be better than before and you can manage this, you already reached your goal.”

And I did manage it, I drank a little bit and had some fun and didn’t get smashed. Seemed fine.

Then alcohol reared it’s ugly head HARD on me last week. What turned into “just a few drinks on Friday night” became a 3 day binge. I smashed an entire bottle of whiskey and about 15 hard seltzers along with 4 IPAs. So much damn alcohol for me (even compared to my worst times). The entire weekend was a blur and I felt out of control.

Sunday night I had insomnia and major anxiety and felt really depressed- a super dark place mentally. I decided to take Monday off work because I didn’t sleep and felt like I was dying.

I just got back from a night out at a bar with some of my friends I went to grad school with. I stayed sober and had a great time! My mood has been on the uprise all week and I’m in such a better spot mentally then I was 6 days ago. I am really going to try and keep it this way..I do think it’s time to let it go. And if I do fail again, I’m not gonna let it stop me from continuing to try to get there eventually.

However my friends keep joking about how I’m “sober” now as if I was some heavy drinker and keep mentioning “sobriety” as if it’s something they need to tiptoe around, not sure why it’s such a polarizing reaction. I’m getting a lot of negativity from others and just wanted to know if anyone else was getting similar interactions.",12,0

We may be a world apart, but  we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding  what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily  commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to  inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender  or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a  sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*.  It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes  impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person  can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again.  And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not  drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that  they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and  participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at  /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed  introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.  You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

A link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar.

I met my friend Nancy in the 1980s. Our offices were next to each  other, and every single workday, at about 10:15am, one of us would step  into the other’s doorway and ask, “Will you join me in a cup of coffee?”  The response from the other was always the same:

“I don’t think there’s room for both of us.”

The weird thing is that neither of us ever tired of the interchange,  which lasted for half a decade. I’ve thought about it a lot over the  years—was it a ritual of comfort? Was it our delight in the language?  Maybe the bond of shared silliness?  Or maybe it was just our way of  saying to each other, “I’m your friend, and I’m here.” 

When I check in here at SD every morning, I’m performing a ritual,  and “I will not drink with you today” is my liturgy. And checking in  today will be just as rich an experience for me as it was on Day One  (note there were a lot of those). 

Thank you for letting me share with you this past week.  Of all the  words SD has allowed me to post, none are as important as these: I will  not drink with you today, Saturday, February 19, 2022.",404,0

I work with a company that I’m happy to be with. Basically I was contracted to them for 3 or 4 months jobs, and now they are hiring me with the company (which i’m thankful for!)..but I also think it’s a way to get rid of me in their office because my personality is so different than it was when I drank every night (possibly moving to another department)

I love this job, but when I would drink every night afterward, my cares for the job went away. I just didn’t care. I wasn’t trying hard

Now after the pandemic and sobriety, I have come to realize I annoy my coworkers because I’m always asking questions, or double checking something. I’m working my ass off each day to make sure I do things right. 

I feel they hired me for that “idgaf” attitude. And now i’m the person who stresses about deadlines. Anyway, I’m not going to drink, but i’m just sad to know that they may be putting me in a different department I’m way more “uppity” of a person now.

I did get a pay raise last week. i’m thankful for that and sobriety helping my life get better. It’s just that this company  has helped me so much along the way..and I hate that my sober personality is annoying. I’m sharper at my job, but I feel at the risk of talking too much, or answering questions not asked for me….I was always hungover and just quiet. 

I was always contracted based on the “confidence I show in my job”, and they now hired me full time…but that confidence was all a facade with the boozing. 

Anyway just venting. I just don’t even know how to explain it to anyone else. I never thought I would get harder to work with in my office.

Well, December 28th, I took a pregnancy test and SURPRISE - positive! While this is great news, being pregnant makes me feel like my continued sobriety doesn’t count. It’s shockingly easy to not drink when you know that you can’t have a drink no matter what anyone says and no matter how bad you want one.

Eventually my legs and my stomach were swelling where I could hardly walk. I now noticed the jaundice in my eyes it may have been there for a while i avoided mirrors and people. I went to the hospital was told I had liver failure through cat scans blood test etc they gave me diuretics for about a week to make sure I had all the fluid taken out of me I am now out the hospital no edema no ascetics walking normal but the jaundice is still there.

For the majority of the last year (probably more) I've been a daily drinker. I'm a single mom with two young children and I work full time with no support AT ALL. I fessed up to my psychiatrist and we worked together to get me back on the right track for my mental health so I could stop coping with alcohol. It was embarrassing to me that I had been treating myself so poorly for so long but I knew it was just time, I needed to get this under control. That appointment was about six weeks ago. Two days ago I went to my Dr and was proud to inform her that I have been 5 weeks without drinking on a work night. Admitted that I had had wine on the weekends (non work nights), but also acknowledging that this is a huge improvement from being a daily drinker. Also a bonus, I have lost ten pounds! (Just from cutting out alcohol). My mornings are better, and my nights are more restful. I barely need sleeping pills anymore. My mood has improved. My stomach and head isn't hurting all the time from the night before. I'm using the money that I would have been spending on alcohol for family dinners once a week at a local diner and giving my kids a small weekly allowance. I implemented dinners out and the allowance in order to hold myself accountable, buying alcohol would take away from those things. I'm comfortable with allowing myself to have wine on the weekends but I would eventually like to phase that out as well as quitting smoking cigarettes. I hope this finds the right people as a message of motivation, especially my fellow struggling single moms. You can do it, one day at a time. I just wanted to share my experience and my progress.

\*Avoid all breakfast plans bc I can't eat in the morning, I can only drink.

\*Wake up late because I was up too late secretly drinking the night before.

\*Be ashamed of how bloated I am if we go swimming.

\*Avoid all desserts bc I'm already taking in way too many calories from booze.

\*Struggle to be present.

\*Google liquor stores in the area to see which ones I can get to while making it seem like I want to run a different errand.

\*Wonder if she can smell alcohol on my breath when we hug.

\*Worry if anything will come up that will make her ask questions about my health or my drinking.

I don’t really feel the urge to drink on the weekdays typically, but if I get a drink or two in me, it usually snowballs to more than I’d like.

What prompted this post was this week I felt muscle pain and mental fog all week, along with a heightened heart rate seemingly out of nowhere after an especially hard drinking weekend. I thought I had COVID but tested negative.

Frankly, I’m kind of lost and I feel like I need help.

I’m a 38 year old man. I’m married and I have 2 little kids (2 and 5). I have been drinking consistently since about the age of 20. From 20-36 I was essentially a partier. I binge drank pretty much every weekend night. I’ve always held a good steady job and *mostly* felt like alcohol was just a regular part of my life.

I mulled over the idea of quitting for a few years, mainly because I just kept feeling worse and worse after drinking sessions. Things came to a head on New Years of 2020. I blacked out and embarrassed myself in front of my brother and sister-in-law.

The next day I decided to quit for good. I told my wife, got into therapy, and stayed 100% sober from January 2020 until May of 2021. I started drinking again because…frankly I don’t know exactly. I felt like something was missing from my life? The feeling of commitment eventually just wore off. I told my wife I was going to start drinking again, talked over a plan with my therapist, and tentatively went back.

It hasn’t gone very well. In this exact moment, I’m hungover and I feel like garbage. I want to commit to stop drinking, but I know from years of experience that in 48 hours that feeling will have faded. I’ll be back to “normal” and I’ll write this experience off as just another slip up.

I would say that about 1 in 5 drinking sessions feel fine to me. I judge that mostly by how functional I am the next day and how I behaved the night before. The other 4/5 times are like last night. I have a vague plan, I way over drink, and I usually black out at least part of the night, forgetting things I’ve just done.

I apologize for the lengthy post, but I could really use some advice from anyone with a similar experience. I want to quit drinking, but what I really want is to keep drinking and just always keep it under control, even though I know that’s almost impossible for me.",12,0

I started thinking about how I often said ""I drank too much but I'm not an alcoholic because I don't have a physical dependency"". 

These rationalization I used to make and my friend is currently making had to come from somewhere and I immediately thought back to high school health class where an entire chapter was devoted to alcohol. What I realized was we were mostly taught, there are two type of people. Physically dependent alcoholics and people who aren't. But unfortunately as I learned the hard way, you don't have to have a physical dependency to have a very unhealthy relationship with alcohol. I've never experienced the dangers of delirium tremens or had the shakes so bad I couldn't function. But I still drank enough to do long term damage to my body I've had high blood pressure for the past year and even though getting sober has lowered it when I slipped up and went back on a couple week bender it shot right back up and took months to bring back down. The full extent of the damage I've done to my body isn't fully known but I gained a bunch of weight. While I'm not diabetic, my blood sugar is higher than it should be for a 26 year old man. My drinking did disastrous things to my emotional and mental health. I never got fired from a job because I was drunk or drinking but in hindsight I realized how many times my poor performance was related to being hungover or anxiety riddled because of a booze filled evening the night before.


I just think (and it might have changed in the 11 years since I took high school health) there needs to be a more honest education kids recieve about the dangers of alcohol abuse. It's not as simple as ""addict"" vs ""non addict"" there's a lot of damage that you can do to your life before you hit the standard definition of addiction. This isn't to put down those of you in this sub who are or were physically addicted you are my brothers and sisters in a shared common goal of sobriety and I wish you nothing but success in your journey. I just think there are many more shades of gray to alcohol abuse that need to be defined and taught to young people to hopefully as a nation and world form a better relationship with a very accessible mind altering substance.",9,0

I think I'm approaching nine-ish month sober although luckily I've stopped counting the days. Life has sort of just been life as a thing on its own and not just a way to rack up days sober. That sounds weird but hopefully you guys know exactly what I mean.

I guess I want to share a little story as a way to give people struggling some hope. In the first few months of sobriety things were bleak as life came back in full-force and I couldn't rely on my crutch. It's hard because you have to learn how to take life as it comes with no alcohol to escape it. But time goes by and soon things do get better, as cliched as that sounds.

Sober, I had a realization that I've let anxiety and dread rule my life for way too long. Alcohol hid this fact from me. It helped ""cure"" my anxiety and let me make periodic progress in my life, but at the expense of what? Alcohol lures you in like that, easing your fears while at the same time making them worse when alcohol isn't around. Once this clicked it was pretty simple: I let anxiety rule, I'm sober, and it's probably time to change that in the name of growth and progress.

I was at my job 16 years and only recently -- last month -- took a promotion to become a supervisor. I guess I knew I had the skillset and the talent but for more than a decade there, covered up by my semi-controlled drinking, I was stagnant. To job was a union job and had great pay, great benefits, but I kept feeling like a cog in the machine. Like I wasn't doing all I could do with my life. Like I was wasting something precious. Alcohol, in it's guise of comfort, got me through as it does but kept me there at the same time. Both the cure and perpetuating the problem. The temporary fix to the permanent problem of being scared of life and change.

The promotion isn't really a huge deal and doesn't make a whole lot of financial sense with losing my union benefits, but it's the right thing for me, no doubt at all. Once I sobered up and realized how scared I was of change and living my best life and given the opportunity to get outside my comfort zone I had no choice. Sober me was here and sober me was pretty pissed off about all of the wasted time and sober me, and while still scared, knew he couldn't let fear rule anymore. I committed to the promotion before I could overthink it, dealt with the anxiety without drinking a single drop, and while it was about the most stressful thing ever, here I still am.

I'm proud of myself! I feel almost ashamed to write that so blatantly, but I did it. Quitting drinking was one of the hardest things I've done and it didn't seem to have any instantaneous payoffs, but I kept thinking, sometimes sarcastically, that ""ThInGs WiLl GeT bEtTeR."" Guess what? They did. Here I am in a place I wouldn't have imagined a year ago. I feel like I'm challenging myself, living life adventurous for once, going outside my comfort zone, growing as a person. Like this is who I've been all along and alcohol just made me forget my true self. And guess what? I'm actually a pretty damn good supervisor! Sure there isn't a direct correlation between sobriety and actually growing as a person -- I could've taken the promotion as my old functioning-alcoholic self -- but would I? Who's to say.

Yes, sobriety sucks at first, but you might be surprised where you end up thanks to your sobriety. It's only the first step of a long process and for once I'm enjoying the journey.

Two years ago today, I was so hungover and ashamed. I had “quit” so many times, I was sure this would be another few weeks struggling and then folding. My family had given up on me several years before. I’d been drinking for 25 years, and the last several years had been blackouts and emotional meltdowns several times a week. 

But this time I had this sub to come to. I had AA, my hubby and a friend (also an alcoholic, I found out!) supporting me. I read all the quit-Lit books (this Naked Mind is my favorite). I bought a soda stream machine and drank ten thousand gallons of fizzy water. I made sure to exercise more, and get some sunshine in my skin. I had projects and hobbies to do during the hours I used to drink, and I kept busy. I signed up for some volunteer work, because thinking about others is healthier than dwelling on the mess I’d made of my life.  Slowly I forgave myself, and replaced drinking with acting like a normal functional adult. 

I won’t lie - the first six months sober were really hard. I had PAWS, and had insomnia, anxiety and depression off and on. But I vowed every morning not to drink, and kept going.  I leaned on this sub heavily, and several times only the thought of having to reset my sober counter saved me from myself. 

Somewhere about 7-8 months sober, I realized I was sleeping well, the depression was gone, and I hardly ever thought about alcohol. It just kept getting better as time passed.  My family and life was exactly the same, but *I* had changed. I established boundaries for the first time, and respected myself.  I went to the dentist, had a physical and cut my hair. All things I neglected because I didn’t love myself.  My relationships with hubby and my grown kids is so much better. They’ve cheered me on all the way. 

There’s nothing new to report at two years sober.  But that is so wonderfully normal and boring, and I’m grateful!  I’ll never let my guard down about alcohol (or any other addictive substance), but I don’t think about it at all. For the people thinking about sobriety, or those in the early days, keep going!  It takes time to heal our bodies and our relationships, but it’s so so worth it!

1552,2022-02-18 12:01:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/svmuj1/the_sugar_struggle_and_some_things_ive_learned/,The sugar struggle and some things I’ve learned about it,"I’m over 7 years sober and I know I’m not alone here when I say I’ve struggled with my sugar intake since quitting drinking. I was torn whether to post this or not as it pertains more to sugar than alcohol. But since there’s a correlation, I decided to go ahead with it. And it’s part of my whole journey and maybe it’s relatable to you too. 

At the start of my recovery I was absolutely allowing myself grace with my sugar intake while escaping the hell of my alcohol dependency, and I don’t regret that. But after years of being sober now, something had to give. And changes needed to happen. While I am definitely healthier and more fit now due to positive lifestyle changes I’ve made since quitting drinking, it had been bothering me how much I needed sugar all the time. Then it got to the point where I would have literal sugar binge out sessions - especially on the weekends. I was going to the grocery store on Friday to stock up for the weekend. Literally buying gummies, chocolate, ice cream, cupcakes, cookies, you name it. Then consume all of it. Because fuck off, at least I’m not drinking right? I was using my sobriety as an excuse to binge on sugar. Well the thing is I would wake up Saturday, Sunday, and sometimes even Monday morning with what can only be likened to a hangover caused by sugar. You all know what I’m referring to. Groggy, tired, puffy eyes, upset stomach, headache etc. Not to mention guilt, shame and regret -  just like the drinking days. And I was embarrassed because on the outside I was portraying this girl who had successfully gotten sober, quit smoking, lost weight etc. but felt like a fraud behind closed doors. Then after the weekends were over I would try to be “good” again throughout the week and restrict myself from sugar, but then cycle back. Every weekend. It was horrible. Once I started eating sugar, I couldn’t stop. I knew I was craving sugar at the start due to giving up the booze. But it had become a new unhealthy void filler. I was putting my poor organs through the wringer yet again, only this time in the form of copious amounts of sugar. Not cool.

So in 2020 when our wonderful new friend Covid-19 decided to grace us with her presence, I had time to assess my situation while I was laid off from work. And I decided to take a couple courses about nutrition and triggers and such. A few things I’ve learned:

My first “a-ha” moment was when I was informing my mentor about my recovery and how I needed sugar all the time. She simply asked me why I feel I NEED sugar, and challenged me to reframe my language. I had never really thought about that. I was always saying “I NEED sugar. I NEED it”. Kinda like “I NEEDed alcohol”. I was giving power and control to fucking sugar by using those words, just like I was with booze. So I changed it to I WANT sugar. It’s weird how something so simple shifted something for me. I didn’t need sugar, I wanted sugar. Language is very powerful. 

Then she asked me why I want it. Another simple question with impact. She suggested that next time I’m at home and go to reach for something sugary, take a pause. Literally sit down. Analyze my craving and what’s going on in my body. It’s uncomfortable. Where do I feel discomfort. For me, it’s a tingling in my skin for some reason. For others perhaps it’s in their chest, butterflies in their stomach, pounding heart, your throat - everyone’s different. Then she asked what’s really so wrong with this feeling of discomfort. Discomfort is just a sensation. It’s not to be afraid of. It will pass. Ride it out. And if you can’t, that’s fine. Eat the sugar. But at least now you’ve given a pause and you’re becoming in tune with your body. Which is more important in the long haul than it may seem. And the more you practice this, the longer the pauses become. And you realize you weren’t perhaps craving sugar after all, but something else. I got to a point where I would have a tea or a bath or even go for a walk instead. 

And lastly, I’ve stopped restricting myself throughout the week. I eat some sugar everyday. I’m trying to get over that whole “all-or-nothing” mentality I developed from my drinking days. If I want a cookie or a slice of cake or some gummies, I’ll have some in moderation and move on. My goal has not been to cut out sugar from my life. Because life isn’t meant to be joyless. I’m just trying to get a handle on it. I’ve become more mindful of what I buy, and I stopped pre-buying the whole goddamn candy aisle for the weekends. Instead, I buy a single chocolate bar instead of a bag of those mini bite-sized chocolate bars, or ice cream bars instead of a tub because they’re portioned out. Things like that. And sure I still have my moments where I consume more than I probably should in a sitting, but I’m getting better and those moments are now fewer and further between. And I always get back on track. 

Anyways, don’t know if any of it was helpful at all or not but I just like to share things that have aided me along the way in case it resonates with someone else too. Have a nice day everyone. IWNDWYT",54,1

According to my sobriety tracker, that is 1,096 days, which, to me, sounds a LOT longer than just three years lol. Yet if you go the other way, 36 months doesn’t sound like a lot. That number only sounds longer if it were part of an auto loan term. 

Either way, it’s kind of unbelievable. I think about it every day, but I realized just after the one year mark that this was going to be different. I had 18 months before a relapse in late 2018 and today I think that was even more impressive because looking back I have NO idea how I did it with how unstable I was.

Also, it’s funny as a NASCAR fan because I managed to get sober on one of the most infamous days in racing history, when Dale Earnhardt died in the Daytona 500. That was pretty traumatic to me as a kid, and now years later I have something positive to think about on this date instead of “oh yeah… *that* is coming up.”

It’s a beautiful thing though. I’m transitioning into a new job soon, I’m going for my Master’s, and I’m definitely in the best physical shape of my life. So I’m happy even if every day still has its challenges and I get those weird thoughts of “come on, dude, your brain is reset. Just DO it.”

I (31f) am on day 47 and really proud of my self.

But I realize more and more that my close friendship groups mostly do activities centred around drinking. And even though I can master not drinking and choosing non-alcohol beverages when I am with them, it still makes me sade that we don't do other activities like a gaming night with boards games and tea drinking or whatever. 

So I will plan to make a game night and see how it goes - but I feel almost like it is not allowed to not drink a thursday, friday or saturday night? Like ""why waste one of these evenings being sober?"", ""weekends are for partying/drinking"". Maybe it is all in my head - but I come from an extreme drinking culture, and alchohol has a strong grip around what adults do for fun activities together.

There was always a good reason- a fight with my spouse, it’s Monday, it’s Friday, just need to steady my nerves for a presentation….you know how it goes. Finally realized I was on a dangerous path around the holidays when I was actively struggling to go a few days without booze and buying my own stash to drink. I also hate how I feel in my body because I’ve gained over 15 lbs. Anyway, I’ve been white-knuckling it trying to quit and kept slipping, but I’ve recommitted to my yoga practice and it’s kept me distracted and feeling good enough to not even miss it that much and I’m on day 6!

A dinosaur's perspective...,"First: a disclaimer, This is my experience and it applies to me - possibly to some others, maybe you, but maybe not.

What I did not know when getting sober - just about everything - but especially that it would not end up being about alcohol and drugs.  Sure, in the beginning it was; the struggle to not pick up a drink was very real (and many times I gave in).

But once through that - and it was a process where I would realize I'm not craving a drink right now - haven't for a couple of hours..and then the time frames extended, a whole evening, a day, days....

Once through that - the real work began.  The good news is the work is kind of fun in a going to the gym way.  You see others doing the same thing and you start to feel the effects and see the growth and that feels good.  And it the very beginnings of this work that I believe facilitate the elimination of the cravings.

I had to face several truths I did not want to - the first was dishonesty.  I would have sworn I was an honest person, and believed it.  And I was in some ways, but when it came to alcohol/drugs and excuses/rationalizations/justifications  I was anything but...  My inner addict could sell me that I 'deserved' a drink because I was a willing and eager buyer.  I said that the things I did while drunk didn't really count, because drunk.

And this brings me to the core of the core of what I was trying to self-medicate or stuff with my drinking and which was, if not dishonest, just plain wrong...  and that was my self-esteem.

Looking at me you never saw this, even drinking I never admitted it, but under the facade, beneath the costume and masks, my self esteem was made of sand.  It shifted, it sifted out holes, it was the source of my fears, and the attempts at grandiosity I tried to shore it up with.

My path to sobriety/recovery was AA (obligatory there are other paths now, try one try em all) And I had a lot going against me, agnostic, loner, shy, insecure, distrustful, unable to ask for help...just like most of the people there it turned out.

So there I was at the end of an AA meeting, my head spinning a bit, wanting to - not wanting to - talk to someone and this really pretty woman comes up to me, puts her hands on my shoulders and says, ""Let us love you, until you can learn to love yourself,"" I was dumbstruck. Was still searching for a word when she turned, ""Hey Marge, let's go for coffee"" and was gone.  Poof.  Leaving me trying to get my head around that really radical concept - one that years of therapy while drinking had never occurred to me.

That event was enough to keep me coming back.  And eventually the brain fog, the denial and other resistances faded, and I was able to do exactly that. And it worked.

That was just one of numerous moments when I was able to connect, and through those connections, begin to change my self awareness, eliminating my self destructive negative thoughts and becoming able to accept my self worth - and then begin to nurture it...

Sometimes digging out the truths has been a bit painful, but fairly early on I learned that beating myself up was a behavior I needed to get rid of too.  Mostly it has allowed me to go forward learning from my mistakes and not repeating them...  One of my mistake is trying to explain everything in one sitting - this post is getting into that territory, so I'll end with this:

Fasten your seatbelt, you're in for a hell of a ride, but it can be amazingly rewarding and even fun.  (and the people you will meet are amazing)",95,1

I felt lonely and ended up there and I shouldn’t have. 

I didn’t even enjoy it. As soon as it hit me I immediately wished I could take it back but I couldn’t reverse time so I leaned into it. I couldn’t believe that feeling this out of control used to make me feel good…

Started drinking alcohol about 1 year into my marriage because of new friends.  Was never really a big drinker.  Would have some wine here or there; a beer maybe.   Quickly progressed over the next 12 years to full blown alcoholism… but everyone around me is “drinking too.”   It became a serious problem and was affecting every aspect of my life.  Work,  children (3), relationship, everything.   Every day was drinking and every night was terror (night sweats, guilt, shakes, prayers).   I knew I needed to quit but it took over a year to finally put it down with multiple tries.  Went 94 days one time;  relapsed into worse.  Went 34 days; relapsed into even worse.   This time I had decided to go 100 days and see how I felt.  I hit 100 days and couldn’t stop the “streak”.  So here I am at 180 days and I have never felt better in my life.  My EVERYTHING has improved!  Relationship and marriage never better and going on 14 years like newly weds.  I am present for my kids.  I enjoy my life.  I enjoy my work.  I’ve lost weight.  I sleep like a champion.   If you’re contemplating quitting but having a hard time-  I have a hard time too, there are days I want to drink.   I can tell you this with an absolute certainty, you will not regret the decision to quit.  The only decision you keep regretting is drinking.  You know it, I know it, we all know it.   At 180 days- I’m going at least to 200 and probably more.   Will I ever drink again?  Maybe, maybe not but for today I’m not, I feel to good and have come too far.   Look at the reason you’ve come to this page, use the stories you read to make today the day you finally commit.  Really commit, go through the withdrawals (medically if necessary),  get support you need, and focus on the goal you want-  sobriety.  It’s worth every challenge and stress to stop.   Everything in your life will thank you for it.  And today 180 days later- I am loving life and living proof that we can do this!  I hope this gives someone the encouragement and motivating they need to change their lives.  Thank you everyone for all your posts that have kept me on the road.",27,0

 Our keynote is 
“Courtesy“.
 Today’s Meditation suggests trusting God as a little child trusts its mother in handing her a tangled ball of yarn. 
 I remember being that child. I had no doubt that Mama would straighten out my mess and there was no reluctance to turn it over to her. She was my loving mother and, in my child’s mind, could and would do anything for me.
 However, she couldn’t help until I accepted the mess as being beyond my abilities and took the action of bringing it to her. It is the same with turning my grownup messes over to God. I don’t turn things over to God by merely saying, “God, it is yours. “. They are turned over by my persistent, faithful action or not at all.
 The only way to turn a toothache over to God is by going to a dentist.
 When I️ fail or refuse to behave as the Divine Spark directs, I create, keep, or take back my tangled messes. 
 So much of God’s Magic flows from coming as a little child!
 I love you all.",3,0

What kills me is that when he got home he didn’t tell me. I went to get groceries and called him to ask if we needed lettuce and THEN he told me, but said he didn’t want to talk about it. 

When I got home he decided to just go to bed at 5:30, I had to feed, bath, and get both kids ready for bed. Afterwards I had two drinks. 

It’s not terrible, It’s still amazing progress even if a set back. I’m just… I have no one to talk to.

My friends and family all have their own shit to deal with. I can just tell that this would be overwhelming for them. I can’t talk to my husband, he’s dissociative, and unloading my frustration on him isn’t going to help him. He’s already overwhelmed, trying to manage my emotions on top of his won’t help either of us. 

I guess this is just me yelling into the void that I’m frustrated, I fell onto my crutch yesterday, and I wanted to tell someone about it.

Yesterday I had to attend a friend’s funeral. This person was a great guy, although I was not that close to him, I knew him for over 10 years. He was also a bar regular at my old spot. The service was lovely. After the service everyone was invited by his family to meet up at a bar ( the one we used to go to closed down ,that’s actually a pretty good story too lol). I had every reason to drink yesterday. I didn’t. I’m so very grateful for this. I was able to talk and grieve and remember everything which is amazing. I will say that I was there at the bar for 4 hours sober while everyone got completely wasted and it was quite interesting to observe from a sober perspective.  I also was completely exhausted by the time I got home and felt just overstimulated. I still feel this way right now as I’m typing this at 4 am wide awake but tired.  Anyways, I’m just proud of myself for making it through this. The first time I attempted to quit drinking I made it 54 days but did not socialize whatsoever.

Thursdays someone always brings in a 30-rack and we hang out in the shop after the work is all done and everyone has a few. We got finished early tonight and everyone gathered up as usual around 2230. I strolled in from finishing some paperwork and plopped down, and was immediately offered a beer. I politely declined, and said I was still ""drying out"" for a while.

There is an immense amount of pressure to drink in this line of work. To the point where those who don't partake are viewed with some suspicion as to why they don't. And we have pretty strict rules on the books that govern how long we have to wait after our last drink to even touch an aircraft (10 hours). Yes, the most strict skilled maintenance field in the world has a drinking culture. With that in mind, I was poo-pooed by my coworkers for not having a beer. Even my supervisor made a joke about how he's drying out too, ""that's why I'm drinking Coors light instead of whiskey."" I like these guys, I genuinely do, but nothing about me wanted to sit there and listen to the usual bitch fest and shop talk.

So I got up after a minute of fidgeting with my phone and said I was going to work out. I didn't feel like sucking down a few hundred calories with everyone else, so I decided to burn some instead. It was short and sweet, about 35 minutes, by which time people were starting to filter out. I walked back into the shop and, again, was offered a beer. I just smiled and said ""still drying out."" 

This is at least my 4th or 5th time at the one month mark. Milestones, while rewarding, are also a time of vulnerability for me. ""I made it this far, that's pretty good, right? What's one beer?"" Deciding to workout instead of drinking ensured that I could wake up tomorrow past that mark and looking on to month two. And that's not an enormous amount of time. I haven't saved an enormous amount of money, I haven't lost any weight at all. I still eat snacks late at night, sleep too late, make mountains out of molehills sometimes.

The first thing is being invalidated by my best friend. She has continued to be negative about almost everything and it really does bring me down. If she can’t be supportive then All she has to do is keep her mouth shut but she can’t do that. She’s used the word “fad” three times now. This makes me angry. But it doesn’t make me want to drink but more determined to succeed. 

The second trigger made me want to drink. My youngest son flipped out and called me for emotional support. They say you’re only as happy as your saddest child and for me this has been true. I sorted myself out by pouring a NA drink with ice and slice of lemon at 4pm and got my sketchbook out to draw. I then had a few more over the evening (maybe 5?). I felt good to recognise and meet my need to lift up a glass. my adult sons do not drink (prefer weed) and they are proud of my progress.

The fact is that whatever I have to do to stay the course to achieve my priorities I will do. I will not drink alcohol. I will aim for a healthier life by using common sense, eating better, sleeping better. I will give my body the time it needs to heal and recover. I will also be there for my family and I am better able to support them. I am growing, becoming a better kinder person and changing my life. 

I’m sorry this is rambling. I was think about changing my name from MrsStop to something more positive because I’m doing so much more than “stopping”. I feel I’m trail blazing.

I’m going to try and remain humble and not get all evangelical but it is difficult when people I care about are openly judgmental. I’m going to try hard not to ruminate about her and hopefully see the solution to my anger is in my hands and I’ve got to just let it go,",11,0

My story isn't new, I have fallen into heavy binge drinking in my late thirties and now at 42 I have to stop. 

January was a disaster with nearly daily heavy drinking (1-2 bottles of wine in a session). I would black out routinely and become belligerent. I even ended up picking a fight with my partner and taking a whole bunch of sleeping tablets whilst drunk in early January. 

Despite a trip to the ER in an ambulance, I continued to drink. 

Up until Tuesday this week, I had been drinking 1.5 bottles a night and my (diagnosed, medicated) anxiety was off the charts. 

I decided to reach out to a private treatment centre (my insurance covers it) and got so much out of the intake session with the clinic psychologist. 

Whilst I do qualify for inpatient detox, there's a 2-3 week wait for admission.  So, we decided I would do at home detox starting today. 

I've started my regime of valium for 6 days (which will taper), had my thiamine injection today and have oral B1 tablets to continue with. 

I'll see the clinic's psychiatrist next week to be assessed for underlying mental health conditions (I was assessed for PTSD in December and the clinic will review that report, they also suspect adhd).

I'm so relieved to be starting this process. The plan is to detox, then begin a 9 week intensive relapse prevention course. Whilst I'm detoxing at home, the option of being admitted to detox at hospital is always on the table too. 

I've tried everything this past 4 years. Naltrexone thrice (twice with the sinclair method), antabuse a few times, therapy, hypnotherapy, apps, SMART recovery meetings, AA. Nothing stuck. 

This is my first attempt at seeking out an addiction clinic and doing an at home detox.

We may be a world apart, but  we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding  what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily  commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to  inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender  or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a  sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*.  It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes  impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person  can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again.  And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not  drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that  they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and  participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at  /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed  introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.  You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

A link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar.

It’s funny how my conversations with friends about our mental and  emotional health have changed over the years.  Early on, when we were  all in our 30s, we mused over whether or not a person (but of course we  were talking about ourselves) could change their basic nature. Could we  truly re-do our beliefs and our behaviors and become changed for the  better, or would we always revert to the same flawed ways of being?

Fortunately over the years I can say that I have been able to change  some of my basic beliefs. Education, experience, and daily practice  likely contributed. Here’s an example of change I’m happy about that has  nothing to do with drinking: I know most of the rules of traditional  English grammar that I learned by third grade, when my teacher once  smacked my knuckles with a ruler for ending a sentence with a  preposition. Eventually I got to be one of those totally obnoxious  people who might have reminded you that the word “lie” means “to rest or  recline,” and you should never say, “I’m going to lay down.” But now I  can say that I truly believe that each of us owns our language and that  how we use it is neither correct nor incorrect—it just IS—and that  eventually we will dispense with either “lie” or “lay” and survive quite  nicely.  I can tell I’ve truly changed, because I rarely notice—and  never make judgments about—others’ use of language.

I still believe that I’m an addict, but I’ve changed my belief to the  absolute certainty that if I use the tools available to me, led by my  one-day-at-a-time commitment, I am building a changed, alcohol-free  life. 

A year ago, I never thought I’d volunteer to host this Daily  Check-in, but here I am, having a ball, writing stuff and communicating  with the best people on the planet. If you’re interested in this  terrific experience and have 30 days sobriety, let me know.

I’ve luckily been able to flat out avoid them due to their infrequency in the last 2 years with COVID, me doing remote work most of the time, and the occasional excuse I come up with.

Though I haven’t felt like it’s held me back in my career, I do occasionally feel like by avoiding them I might give my coworkers a bad impression that I don’t want to spend time with them. Personally, I’d rather just get lunch/coffee with coworkers as a substitute, but I get some folks prefer the happy hour setting. 

I would just feel awkward ordering something NA as it would immediately, whether they vocalized it or not, cause them to wonder “why” I don’t drink. I’d sure hate to paint the picture of my past drunken behavior to my supervisors.",6,1

Today is day 40 of sobriety for me and it feels awesome. I had a little moment of joy today that I wanted to share, it's cool how our mindsets start to shift. There was a big-ish snowstorm moving in today that was forecast to leave us with icy conditions and super high winds for the next couple of days. After realizing I was low on eggs, I decided to walk to the store to pick up a few things. 41+ days ago I would have come home with as much wine as I could possibly carry and probably would have left the eggs behind so I could maximize the amount of booze I could buy. I would have probably spent $50+ on that shopping trip with all or most of it being booze. But not today! Today I got my eggs, butter, and fizzy water and that was it. I boogied out of the store spending less than $15 and have zero regrets. I'm counting that as a win!

On another note, because I'm sharing, I found a great AA online group to join every day and I've really been enjoying it. I tried some other AA meetings when I first quit and I was sure it wasn't for me, I'm not a religious person at all. I took the first step this week to find a sponsor and met a very kind woman who lives in my town. It's been awesome having someone in the program to talk to. I know AA isn't for everyone, but I've certainly come around to it. 

Thank you all so much for all of the support. This group is seriously awesome!

I'm learning how to be alone because I was in a couple relationships that were hurting me, and I them. When I was drinking, I had no self esteem so I thought I deserved the abuse and apathy. And even then, I knew nobody deserved that so it would come out as resentment and angry venom when I was drunk. I don't want to be like that anymore. So I'm learning how to entertain, validate, comfort, compassionately discipline, and like myself because I didn't learn those things as a kid. I've found that the saying ""how others treat you is a reflection on how they see themselves"" is true, and I want to be able to treat others with respect and kindness. How can I do that if I can't treat myself the same way?

I'm going for a holistic approach: mind, body, soul. I started reading books on subjects I'm interested in, picking Spanish back up, started writing and got through half the journal. The community center I bike to has a pool I've started going to, and I try to stretch and dance everyday while keeping my food portions smaller and healthier. I limited my caffeine intake because I was in denial about how anxious it made me, same with the cannabis vape. I've been setting my intentions for the day when I wake up and try to be present, even for the day to day minutia. Picked up a nice deck of cards that I started reading and have kept a journal of it all; last night I did a 2 hour reading that really helped me process some things and set intentions for the future.

I still have a lot of things I want to work on, like emotional regulation and feeling more comfortable in my body. Dealing with feelings of guilt from my past transgressions has been hard, stomach churning at times, but I know I need to deal with it all with compassion and patience. Every day that I stay sober and work towards being a healthier person is a day I am not hurting others or myself. The past can't be changed, but I can make sure it doesn't happen again.

As soon as I start drinking I get a massive mood boost and when I stop I get the opposite, a massive mood decrease. The only way to counter this is time being tired enough to fall asleep once that starts to happen. im Just wondering if normal people feel this way or if there's something wrong with me. it seems like people I drink with dont get the same level of mood boost /enthusiasm about everything when they start drinking like I do and alternatively dont get noticeably down after they stop like I do..... wondering if there's ever hope to drink in moderation like a normal person.",3,0

These last days I thrown away garbage and donated lots of clothes, finished organizing stuff that were in boxes since I moved, exercised and bought some essential items I was neglecting.

But today I made an important decision to look for a doctor for a surgery that I need for more than 10 years. It isn't urgent, but it's a condition that can become really dangerous.

But the overwhelming utter horror and objection my subconscious (or maybe conscious or both?) felt was staggering to me when I woke up. At first I felt nothing but guilt and then remembered it had been a dream. And I then I felt...hopeful? If my sleep self reacted like that, maybe I really am on the right path today.",3,0

The day prior, I’d gone to the liquor store, spending time carefully considering which bottles of wine to buy. I bought several. “This one’s new. A cool climate chardonnay. I bet I’ll like that. I’ll buy two, in case one isn’t enough. And a couple of cans of IPA. Why not. Nice artwork. And it’s 7%. It’ll taste good.”

I come home. Make dinner for the family. Open an IPA. I drink the new wine. It’s okay. Not what I’d been hoping. I finish the bottle anyway. I debate opening the second but have another IPA instead. If I’d had a bottle of red I’d have opened that. But I didn’t.

Went to sleep. Snored as usual. Woke up with a dry mouth. Drank water. Went back to sleep. Woke up to find my wife had gone to the spare bedroom again.

Drank tea. Skipped breakfast, because I mostly don’t eat until dinner. Also, I’m still kinda full from yesterday’s late night chips, bread, chocolate frozen yoghurt with kailua poured over it, and spoonfuls of peanut butter.

I put in a bit of work — I’m a writer, so I’m working from home. But I don’t get much done because my head is too fuzzy to solve problems. I play Fortnite instead. I have a better chance of winning when all the kids are at school.

Midday, I go upstairs, sit in that blue chair. I think about the second bottle of chardonnay in the fridge. I hadn’t really enjoyed the first. Maybe I should go back to the liquor store and get something else. But like what? Nothing I’ve tried over the last few months seems to scratch the itch. Seems to taste much like anything.

And I realize it’s because I can’t taste any more. I can only drink. 

I can’t plot scripts. I can only plot the next glass of wine.

I can’t connect with my family. They stand in the way of my time with the bottle.

And so… I put the second bottle of chardonnay in the garage. I decide not to drink that day. And FUCK. It’s hard. It’s hard that night. It’s hard the next day. It’s hard all week. And then… it’s a little less hard. Six months later, I give the bottle of Chardonnay away.

Today?

I woke up well-rested. I ate fruit, toast, and took my vitamins, like the Doc suggested. (I have a doctor now because in April I had the courage to get a physical after 15 years.)  I take my blood pressure. It’s 110/70, down from 145/90. 

I have a nice, tidy poop, quite unlike the shatterings of a year ago. I walk for 90 minutes, at a good pace, because I’m 50 pounds lighter. My pants are the same size I wore in high school.

I sit down and I write. I’m putting the finishing touches on a couple of new scripts and a series bible, getting ready to shop them around.

The fog has lifted from my brain, from my life.  

I’m going to go to bed at the same time as my wife. She’s not going to need to leave.  

It hasn’t been easy. I don’t know where the road goes from here.

My friend suggested another Mexican place down the street so we could have margaritas, and I replied “I’m actually steering clear of alcohol now, but we can go there so you can have one!”

Spoiler alert: nothing happened. She didn’t badger me about why I’m not drinking, she didn’t cancel plans, and she didn’t get upset. She just said “okay, no big deal!” and we went on to confirm the time and other details.

I also have trouble picking up new hobbies. \*blinks\* I'm sure it relates to the ADHD but I usually pick up hobbies by, say, spending an entire weekend obsessed with something, then deciding I'm not getting good at it fast enough or getting distracted, and abandoning soon afterwards.

I've wanted to get back into sketching for ages, but to me that looks like spending hours on a really nice picture that I also expect to be perfect even though I haven't sketched in decades. Also it means not starting until I have hours available to get started. So, that wasn't going to work out.

I started thinking about how I've picked up other habits since I quit drinking - things I don't consider ""hobbies"" per se, but new things I'm doing like exercise and meditation. I started off only spending 10-15 minutes a day but making sure to do them daily for at least 30 days. With exercise I'm up to an hour a day all on my own now. Meditation is probably only maybe 20 minutes, and I skip some days if I run out of time, but I'm still doing it and enjoying it a few months in.

I decided to cut back my art expectations and spend a month drawing for just 15 minutes a day, only more if I feel like it. One night I drew a cartoon hamburger. The next night I drew cartoon fries. There's less pressure than trying to do a whole piece, if I suck at a cartoon hamburger who cares? And it's easier to fit into my day regularly enough to really get used to it again and find my joy again.

But here we go. I have been drinking in excess for some time, like I had my first drink when I was 18 and I’m 25 now.

I’ve done 100 days dry in the past and loved it. Like at that point a part of my brain which is usually working towards getting the next drink got freed up for more productive things to think about. But somehow, social pressure had me start again. Or maybe just the convenience of feeling the buzz?

Let me tell you a little bit about myself. I grew up in a Muslim household, with a violent dad who was mainly unemployed. And I kind of just took the position of being the victim. Alcohol does its part to that. I can’t have one drink, I have to have several. I can refuse to drink though and be fine.

I’m unemployed and I don’t even know how to start looking for a job. Like, I don’t know. I have a masters degree but the prospect of sending out job applications massively scares me. Lucky me there’s alcohol for me to procrastinate on that. 

The fiancé confronted me about the drinking and we agreed on having the same amount of alcohol when going out. However, no one said anything about what happens when we don’t go out together.

Well, i went out for a drink with a friend last night and the fiancé tried calling, but me being drunk, I didn’t pick up. I did text him though to tell him everything is okay. Now the fiancé is super hurt and angry, telling me that I broke his trust by not picking up the phone and of course, by drinking.

People, he took off the ring. That set me off. I’m very angry at him. I’m an alcoholic. Of course the first chance I get I‘d drink.

I think what scares me more than the drinking is how I went from a normally functioning adult to an unemployed masters graduate with a drinking problem in like <6months.

Basically, instead of giving up drinking, I’ve given up being drunk.

Sometimes that one beverage may be alcoholic enough to constitute two CDC standard “drinks” (like a bottle of 10% abv beer or a martini or whatever) but that still keeps me under the legal limit. I won’t let myself have two standard “drinks” if they’re not in the same beverage.

I make wine for a living.  Been at it for quite some time.  I started drinking hard in college and never stopped.  Grapes come in all at once during harvest.  7 day work weeks were made easy by constant drinking.  ""It takes a lot of beer to make good wine"" is still endlessly repeated in this industry.  For the most part I stayed sober at work.  There's a lot on the line when making wine so the fear of making a mistake beat my desire to drink.  Once I got home though it was go time.  I got married, had a couple of amazing kids, and still drank every night.  COVID hit and the world started drinking more.  The increase in demand was unheard of.  I got busier than ever and coped by drinking more.  Depression started creeping in and eventually every day was met with dread.  My main priority in life had become drinking. 

One year and a day ago I ruined a family vacation by drinking too much.  The next day was Ash Wednesday.  Seemed like a good day to quit something so I decided to quit drinking.  I used this sub as my blueprint.  I checked in daily.  Just the knowledge that I'm not alone would make not drinking that day easier.  One of my best friends died.  I didn't drink.

He is usually very supportive, but I can tell he’s getting tired of dealing with it. We’ve been together 3 years this September. I’m terrified of losing him, and that’s a big part of the reason I’m fighting so hard to stop drinking. He married me knowing I had these issues. When I asked him why, he said he wanted to help me get better. I AM doing a lot better. I’ve cut my drinking down to once or twice a month. At my worst I was binge drinking every single night.

I have an appointment with a psychiatrist tomorrow. Maybe he can help me find a medication that works for me and helps with the depression.

Yesterday was my (millionth) Day 1. Last night my 12 year old 7th grader asked me to hang out with him while he did his homework. Little did I know that his assignment for Health class was to complete a worksheet entitled ""Protecting Your Health Against Alcohol"". He had to read a rather lengthy article and told me they also watched a documentary in class that was ""pretty tough to watch"" about addiction and even had a storyline about babies that were born addicted that  ""had to go through withdrawal symptoms"" :( I had no idea my son even knew the phrase ""withdrawal symptoms"". He said he thinks maybe he and his friends should not have had to watch that, because it was so upsetting. I told him that his school must think they are very mature to handle this information and must care about them very much to teach them this tough information. I also told him I wish I had learned all of this when I was his age -- they didn't do this back then and I'm still learning about the dangers of alcohol at my age. Here were some of the questions on the worksheet: 

\- During the teenage years, the brain is ""renovated"". What is meant by ""pruning""? 

\- What is the job of the brain's frontal lobes? 

\- What does the hypothalamus do? 

\- How are blackouts related to the hippocampus? <---- Blackouts!! My kid knows the word blackout. If he only knew how many hundreds of times I have blacked out :( 

\- If you suspect someone you know has a drinking problem, write three suggestions of what to do. 

On and on. 

So my real purpose in posting this is to say: As I was sitting there looking at my beautiful boy -- if this were ANY other night -- I would have been sitting there buzzed, drunk - trying to hold it together so that he wouldn't notice - or even blacked out as he was doing THIS assignment. But I wasn't because it was my Day 1. So sad and so proud at the same time :( :)

Like a lot of people, I would lurk on here and think “Wish I could do it.” After another weekend at the bar, I finally decided it was time.

I’ve had a hard time quitting before because to my loved ones and friends, I probably looked like I was drinking in “moderation”, so no one knew that it was actually a problem for me. But I would always end up feeling guilty or sick. I don’t have an off button, and one drink is never just one drink. I’ve also had a hard time because I always felt like I would be “missing out”. 

When I first turned 21, I didn’t drink very often. But around 23 I started hanging out with a friend who drank a lot more than me. Over a few years of hanging out, it became my habit too and we got into many embarrassing or dangerous situations due to alcohol. 

We don’t really hang out anymore, but I still carried on drinking. Now I’ve realized that there are more important things to me than getting drunk, and I shouldn’t feel like I have to drink to be around someone.

Anyway, glad to be starting a new chapter.",30,0

Luckily I just landed a new job doing something that’s way more fun and making significantly more money, but my old job says I OWE THEM 500 dollars for quitting under 6 months “for the investment of training me” even though training was two days in front of a computer. They didn’t say it when they hired me but they hid it in the contract. My boyfriend is really supportive and he thinks we can fight it but I don’t think so, since they have it in writing. I barely make 500 in a paycheck from my old place. And my new job is a biweekly pay schedule so I may be without income for a whole month. Once again my bf says it’ll be okay and he can support me financially and it’s no problem but I don’t want to do that. I feel like such an idiot and a failure and all I want is to open the bottle of bourbon i bought my boyfriend for Christmas and drink myself to sleep.

I’m here to gas you up. Every Thursday I’m going to try to make it back here, on arguably the dumbest day of the week, to share with you JUST how I feel about you and your spirit. Let’s refill.

Outside of the temple, an anxious queue formed sometime around dusk. The people appear to enter and exit one at a time. I don’t really know what to expect, but it’s been whispered that you are strong as fuck. I’ve heard that you’ve transcended the busy world around you and discovered the means to rise above anxiety—and see it for what it truly is. And rumor has it, too, that you can in fact levitate. My guess is that during an astonishing display of complete physical and mental fortitude, you share the secret of well-being. My guess is that I’m correct, because the person that just exited the temple flew back to Atlanta via Telekinetic Airline. The smile on their face could write its own book. I can’t wait to speak with you.

There is not a collection of cells in the universe with your experiences and stories. You are so beautifully you.

So I’ve been sober for three weeks now. I am enjoying it but I have started to feel the temptation to drink again.

I have been drinking for 12 years I used to be a daily drinker in my early 20’s but over the past few years it has turned into binge drinking one a week.

This is a problem as when I drink I don’t stop, I stop caring if I have work or any kind of commitments.

Will sometimes drink close to a bottle of rum.

I wake up with the craziest depression that last for days. Thus a viscous cycle is created of feeing shit and drinking to feel better.

In this three weeks I have start fasting, dieting, working and that about it really.

I’m not finding much to do that doesn’t involve alcohol.

However I love to socialise.

Little lost here trying to build an alcohol free life that will give me a sense of being fulfilled socially.

I have a torn ligament in my wrist so sports and gym etc is relatively out the window.

I have been running a bit.

I did go to a comedy night however this was not something I would enjoy more than twice a month.

There’s a massive party next wee and I’ve started to feel justifiable to go there and drink.

Any encouragement or ideas/tips will be much appreciated!

Then, evening comes and I get irritated. Evening is when I typically drink. Sometimes I’ll cave and have a drink to make myself feel less irritable. 

The issue in both situations is that I’m using my emotions as a way to justify drinking. Irritable? A drink will solve that. Great mood? A drink will make it even better. 

I’m tired of it. I recognize the cycle. The perhaps odd thing is the feeling of goodness lends itself to justification to drink. Isn’t that kind of stupid?

A few observations:
- things got worse before they got better, then they got truly bad (deep, dark, and miserable) then, suddenly, euphoric.
- what you eat matters
- there were many moments with my kids I would have either not remembered, ruined, or not been there for that I’ll always treasure. The regret here is the most difficult part.
- alcohol is everywhere and your reputation for being a drinker doesn’t just disappear. I quickly learned to order a NA drink to keep people from commenting on me NOT drinking. It’s soda water and lime btw.
- I have 5 near future celebratory events on my calendar where I’ll be EXPECTED to drink and I feel like I’m headed to war.
- the few who know I’m dry assume this is temporary. They don’t know what I know about my drinking, what you all know. Some of them have a switch that I just don’t have. They can stop. They have this weird sensor that tells them “when”. I must have missed the recall

1750,2022-02-17 06:51:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/sun05w/relationships_during_transition/,Relationships During Transition,"Hi all. 

You won’t remember but I posted on Sunday about finally stopping drinking openly and with the knowledge of my partner. I said then that, as far as I could see, it may be too late for us. This position hasn’t changed but it is now Thursday and we are working on stuff with me (actually, us both but she does not have the same issues) sober. 

Last night though, after an afternoon in which my partner actually touched me and kissed me for the first time in quite a long time (we have not had a physical relationship for many months) and said she loved me - and then after me dropping my daughter off to her mother’s house after she visited in the evening, the mood had drastically changed to stony silence and disinterest.

She said she thought I had secretly had a drink as I had smelled of aniseed earlier. I hadn’t. End of. I showed her a packet of jelly beans that my daughter had been sharing with me and she gave me all the aniseed ones as she cannot stand them. This was true.

I told her that I totally understand her questioning, her worry and her distrust. It was however misplaced. I told the truth: I will never jeopardise us and our future which I hope we have together like this ever again. I choose her and us over secretly drinking any day.

This lead to a much more detailed and very long conversation about how she generally she thinks that, whether I drink or not, we are fundamentally different people and she thinks we have no future. She wants someone different, more spontaneous, who earns more, who is not any sort of burden on us. We are both 50 and she doesn’t want to waste her time on something she thinks is already doomed.

I explained how excited and interested I was for us discovering an entirely new dynamic together as we move forwards. How our evenings and days will feel different and how I looked forward to the challenge.

She remained resolute and, although she said she believed I hadn’t drunk anything, I am not convinced she did.

It is, in short, hard.

All I can do I guess is keep going and trying to get through the distrust. Either way, whether things are irrevocably damaged or not, I will do so open eyed and sober.

Thanks for getting through a very long post!

All the best,",15,0

I drank the beer, felt no affects, and had no need for more (I’ve been taking Arrowroot powder that has been studied to curb drinking significantly if you take a small dose of it a day) thanks to the powder (I usually want even more afterwards). And then I just felt…furious and guilty? I broke a 5 day streak for basically nothing. A stupid beer.

The longest I had was about 3 weeks continuous in December. I remember actually getting some decent sleep after the first two days or so.

Now I'm 3 days sober, last time I drank was Sunday, and I had three days sober before that as well, so basically drank one day out of the last week.

I just cannot get a normal nights' sleep right now. I feel like I've had just a couple hours in the past...week? I don't even know. I had 20 3mg pills of Bromazepam from my doctor which seemed to work a treat to get me to sleep, but since I ran out of those I just can't sleep. It was only a low dose and I even halved that in the week before. Don't know if my current insomnia is withdrawals from that, the alcohol, or just my worrying mind.

Ugh, I know I've only got a small amount of real sobriety under my belt and I should give it more time. I've dealt with insomnia on and off for years and years but I also was a daily drinker for years and years. I figured I'd at least want to know how much the alcohol was contributing so wanted to see if my sleep would improve if I quit.

But fuck me, a string of virtually no sleep nights like this is probably some of the worst insomnia I've had in a long time and it's really hard to stay motivated right now.

I've been trying to make positive changes in my life after getting into a depression due to a breakup but I find it hard to make anything stick, especially when I get this fucking insomnia thrown at me. How am I supposed to function like this? I go to therapy, I exercise quite a lot, even started weightlifting recently, I eat normally, I try to get up at a normal time and go to bed at a normal time, only drink coffee in the morning, I meditate (not every day but still) and though I'm still struggling with alcohol, I've drank a good deal less in the past months than I have in years.

Feeling grateful is a skill we can develop. This is an opportunity for us to practice.**

———

Happy Thursday! 

At the moment I’m particularly grateful for family; last weekend we got together for the first time in a very long time. Spending time with my siblings in particular is always restorative since we were all subjected to the same upbringing (for better or worse) and so there’s just an inherent understanding of one anothers’ particular flavour of ‘fucked up’... and of course we all have the same twisted sense of humour, so we laugh together a lot. 

I’m thankful for expanding my ways of thinking, I started a philosophy course on weekends and my partner very thoughtfully surprised me with a copy of Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. Anyone read it? I could do with a bit of Stoicism in my life - since getting sober I’ve recently been reconnecting with anger. It’s an emotion I was not allowed as a child and as an adult I would drink to disconnect from it. I am a very black and white thinker, which is not good when I get stressed or face life’s challenges. My idea is that by exploring different philosophies I can find more nuanced ways to make sense of the world and not erode inside when someone acts poorly, or when something goes wrong. I’ll keep you all posted on any epiphanies that may arise from my new studies, heh.

Finally, I’m thankful I’m keeping up with the yoga, and I love my [gorgeous new mat!](https://i.imgur.com/W6Dv3VHh.jpg). 

Before I got sober I was isolated from my family and my mind was closed to new ways of thinking, new music, and it was certainly closed to the idea of getting exercise. I ultimately have sobriety to thank for all of the above being open to me. I am so grateful for every element of sobriety every day, simply waking up without feeling like dying is truly a miracle that never gets old.

What are you all thankful for lately?

So I (35m) joined the Army when I was 18. Ended up going to Iraq for about a year and a half not too long after. I was a medic for a cavalry unit. I won't get into the details but I saw and did some really horrible things. It left me with pretty severe PTSD and depression problems. After I got back I started drinking very heavily, first because I was like 22 and in party mode and then after a while to deal with all my mental health problems and then kinda just to function. Anyway fast forward a little over a decade my mental health went to shit, I was drinking at least 10+ drinks a day min and had a few suicidal episodes. 
The last straw was during a company Christmas party where I got loaded, lost my shit and told everyone who would listen I was gonna go home and shoot myself which I almost did. I ended up getting tossed in a VA psych ward for a while, detoxed and got mental health treatment. 
I haven't drank or smoked since then (I was a 3 pack a day smoker) and though I still have a long road ahead of me, I know I'm going in the right direction. My depressions still really bad but it's nice to be working on it instead of just blacking myself out every night. Thanks for listening/reading. I hope everyone's doing ok",74,0

I keep having gallbladder attacks and I have a radiology appt for a ultrasound to see how it looks. 

My dr told me I should get my tubes tied because I have 3 children (12,9 and 2) and since I have anxiety and depression she doesn’t think it’d go over well to have another one. Even though generally speaking, my mental health has gotten so much better and I feel so much better. 

Another thing on my mind is, when am I going to talk to my husband about drinking every night without him getting pissed at me. 

My chest is currently hurting and my heart rate is up to 140 but next week I’m supposed to goto the cardiologist for different test and to discuss what she thinks is wrong. 

Then through all that I sit here and think about all the times I’ve drank in the past and just have this terrible feeling of guilt and shame. I want so much better for my kids.
I don’t want them to grow up and think drinking the way their dad does is normal/okay or how I was drinking (even though I drank when they went to bed) I just want them to want and do better!

I learned early (at the age of about 21) that drink can ""help"" with forgetting - and so, for the longest time I just kept on forgetting about all of the above. 

Now it's difficult to stay off booze while I still accumulate emotions I don't know how to deal with. I try to get myself to a healthier place, sticking to working only 8 h a day (I used to work for 10+ hours mitigating exhaustion with wine), walking long walks to calm down from work-related stress and reading, self-reflecting and attending meetings. 

It's difficult. I got severely anxious at the valentines day dinner at a restaurant, because there were people everywhere and I couldn't just put on my noise-cancelling headphones (which I usually do practically every day I leave home, because everything is just too loud for me).

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*.  It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes  impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person  can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again.  And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not  drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that  they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and  participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at  /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed  introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.  You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

My friend of 50 years and I have never lived in the same city, but  we’ve traveled together, exchanged visits, and talked on the phone every  week or two all these years.  There isn’t much variety in our  conversations, which we once dubbed “Family, Fabric, and Fat.”  The  latter topic is because we’ve been trying to lose the same 15 pounds for  all these years. Lately though, we’ve been much more successful in  doing that, which we attribute to finally achieving a bit of maturity  around the diet culture and to calling a halt when we get into “Diet  Mentality.” defined as “I’ll do this for exactly six weeks, lose the 15  pounds, and then I can eat whatever I want.”

I had the same problem when I thought about trying to stop drinking.   I had little trouble doing Dry January, as long as I kept my focus  sharply on February 1, when surely I would enjoy just two tiny glasses  of wine. I was barely aware that January existed, so focused was I on  February 1.

That brings me to the most important truth I’ve learned from you, my  wonderful friends on SD: I have only today to focus on—this day, this  hour, this moment. There is no February First until February First.   That doesn’t mean I can’t plan, or work on my goals. But I can break  projects down into each day’s work. And today’s work is this: I will not  drink with you on Thursday, February 17, 2022.",345,0

Forward to this week, after work all I want is to buy two bottles of wine and tuck in for the day.  I had a zoom call with the boyfriend, but he was at work and the setting wasn’t right for me to tell him how I was feeling.  We talked lightheartedly but even thinking about discussing my craving forms a lump in my throat.

In the end I didn’t buy alcohol. I used one of my avoidance tactics which is “do not leave the house for any reason”.  Now the stores are closed and I’m certain I will not drink today.

But my inability to bring the topic up with my supportive boyfriend is troubling me.  Any advice is appreciated.",21,0

There I hit the theater bar for a Diet Coke and some peanut M&Ms (the king size). Couldn’t take them in, but that’s okay. I downed the candy and then sat down to watch the first professional theater production I’d been 100% sober and present for…probably since HS. Every other time, I’ve always had at least a glass of wine going in “for the mood.”

Hell, I was out of the country for a funeral of a loved family member, while at the same time dealing with major family issues and was stuck at a hotel room alone at one point with a mini fridge stuffed full of booze... I cant say that I wanted any of that crap. I looked at it when I was getting a bottle of water, but I didn't want it.

It's good to remember that it's easier to have none than it is to have one, once I realized that it just sort of disolved the struggles.

It definitely gets easier.

Day One,"i was always a drinker and started at a very young age, eventually became a bartender and spent ages 19-26 making a tons of excuses for my excessive drinking. then i went down an extremely dangerous path during the pandemic with booze and my drinking was absolutely out of control-- however i was confined to my bedroom so the only reason anyone noticed were the very unhinged shit i was posting on social media and my roommates noticing the bottles piling up in the recycling... obviously eventually i hit an emotional rock bottom and surprisingly made a lot of changes without any external support (just the fear instilled by one too many terrifying withdrawals). i started working out, eating well, drinking less but still having an occasional cider.

fast forward to 2021-2022 where i feel as though i have rehabilitated my relationship with alcohol, only consuming in moderation, consuming a few days a week but no more than 2-3 drinks at a time and as a bartender i thought this was a huge accomplishment compared to the blacked out mess i had been for so long. however... something extremely emotionally overwhelming happened recently and it sent me *spiraling*. in the past two weeks i have blacked out multiple times, lost cards, lost my phone, showed up late and very hungover to work, humiliated myself in my local bar in front of a friend, fell and scraped my knees, fell behind on my chores so my apartment was wrecked-- just a whole mess. 

as i sit here picking up the pieces of my life, doing my apology tour, cleaning my apartment, stewing in anxiety and shame for the fucking 100th time after essentially a two week long episode/bender... i'm just so upset. and i dont want to talk to my friends about it because they've heard it all before. i have an idea of what i want my life to look like and this is NOT it. i found a group online and a sober community (an A/A and 12 step alternative) that i think will help a lot but i just needed a outlet to write all this down and get it all out. i'm so done with this version of myself.",24,1

He doesn't count the days, or the weeks, or at this point the years. But he shared his anniversary date, or as he called it, his ""retirement"" date, with me today. Said he noticed it while preparing for surgery he's having tomorrow, when he recognized a prescription in his med history from detox.

He's been sober every day since, and while life isn't perfect (in fact, its been rough lately) he has handled things with a confidence and strength and communication that was hard to find for a while.

I call him every day now, just to talk. And he's there, on the phone, able to talk. Not slurring or forgetting what we talked about, no, these days he's just going about his evening and sparing a minute to chat. And it feels so good to know that he'll be there when I call.

I'm really proud of him. I was proud of him on day 1 and I'm proud of him now too.  It wasn't his first day 1, but that doesn't make a difference. He got back up and tried again, and here we are today, 1231 days. Going into surgery and recovery, it's such a relief that he's healthier today because of that decision made so many days ago.

I am now on day 4 without a drink, having had hypnotherapy 4 days ago. (Don't get too excited yet)

My wife (was) a pack a day smoker, and I have been putting away about 1/2 a bottle of whiskey a night, every night. I've been drinking heavily for over 10 years, but it has escalated after rounds of lockdowns. I have successfully taken breaks before (I had done a dry January, but have always ended up drinking again).

We both decided enough is enough, and sought out a hypno recommended by friends. We've both had one session now, and my wife has quit smoking with no regrets, no second thoughts.

The therapist warned me that quitting drinking was harder, and I have a second session booked a fortnight after the first one to reinforce the experience.

As I said, I'm 4 days without a drink, but I'm sorry to say that so far it's been through plain old willpower. I'm still thinking about drinking regularly, but I'm holding on for dear life until the second session, and hoping the extra reinforcement will help break the cravings. If that doesn't work, I'm truly scared as I've never made it longer than a month so far.

I never expected to stop drinking honestly, sometimes less than other days. But I honestly feel liked God reached out to me today. He reached out to me 5½ years ago, when I stupidly decided to drive drunk. Not the first time. I took the life of an 18 yr old girl. I watched her bf jump out of the car, screaming to make sure his gf was ok....OK.... never thought it would have been that. He rode in the ambulance with me that night when a helicopter came for her. He was in the same room when I gave my statement. 

I get locked up, and in the 2 months before I was bonded out I had somebody speak The Lord into my life. I studied 1John over and over again. It was the first connection with him, at least deep one, not just surface acknowledgement. Anyway, I get bonded out, get a job to pay for my lawyer, working at McDonald's, and after about 6 to 8 months I was a manager. 

Right around that time I learned that the guy I was working elbow to elbow with for the last 7ish months was the guy that fell out of the car that night screaming. He made the realization just weeks before me....but we had already became friends, we were close, always joking, loved the same music(biggie). We stayed pretty close, even hung out at a couple social events together. Now how is that such a huge coincidence i thought. ..that has to be God reminding me. Anyways...one particular day, the 2 year anniversary of his fiancès death, he walks into work pouring tears....I ask if he's OK and he tells me his dad died that morning. If that isn't the biggest fucking eye opening thing to make me realize how deeply my lack of concern and good decision making affect other people so deeply...I don't want to see the worse side of it. 

So, I held that man for 10 minutes hugging the shit out of him and just pouring tears. He never even wrote a character statement against me, which he totally had the right to do, I would not have been offended by it. But he didn't want to. So, it was almost 3 years between the time I got bonded out and actually incarcerated. 

In that time I got married and bought a house, drinking the whole time, albeit much less, but still drinking, with occasional benders. And I didn't make the correlation til yesterday that the times I drank less were times when I was praying more often, having a stronger connection with God. Funny how that worked. 

Soooo, I get out, start drinking again, and actually, it's kind of ironic how many times I just decided to stay sober for no reason, and ended up driving someone home who was drunk, but that's the only exception I ever made. Anyway, to make an already long story a little less lengthy, I made my mind up after months of mistreatment and less praying, that I had to leave my wife. 

Moved in with a buddy, cue constant binge drinking. Continues for months, and in December my grandmother(who I consider to be my mother) died. I couldn't fucking handle it. Still can't process it fully, it's too painful. So about 2 weeks after that happens...my buddy tells me his wife is having a baby in 4 months, which I knew, but I was just gonna take the spare room, and that I have to leave shortly. 

Spend a couple weeks getting a bunch of interviews, and I take the job I thought was the best fit for me. Construction, remodeling some of his 180 apartments.  I started monday.Monday. in the interview I was up front about my felony, and his response was 'do you still struggle with substance abuse?'. Odd question I thought, I've told every employer or potential employer right up front and never gotten that response. I told him yea, I like to have a couple beers after work, which is very true, usually I'm so tired I only have time for like 6 or 8. But I wasn't working for 2 months at the time due to an injury, so I was putting down 20 to 30 a day. Jeez...just writing that makes me want one currently. That's fucked up.

 But anyway, I take this job, he gets a ride for me, tells me I'm on my own finding a ride after that, ok, cool, some nice guy offers right away and I'm like sweet! Got this figured out! But the foreman comes in early everyday. I need money. You start two hours early?I'm down bro. He's gotta run it by the boss but he said that usually doesn't fly til I'm around at least a month and show good work ethic. I got approved so day #2 I get to start making OT! Eff yeah!!!

so he picks me up and he's listening to sermons, says I have to bear through it, cause he starts everyday that way, it helps keep him sober from math and coke. I listened to it for 30 minutes, and when we were getting out I felt this compelling urge to tell him that he just became the vessel through which God used to contact me directly. Like....because I was willing to work hard, He offered me a hand, or comfort that he was there. So I told him. He comes up 20 minutes later, and asks me to go to AA. He, lemme think about it. I'd be a hypocrite, I was drinking last night, and planned on continuing. But here I just told this guy God spoke to my soul through him, how dumb could I be to close that door?! 

I took the opportunity. Went deadbeat tired after 2 hrs of sleep followed by an 11½ hr workday. I'm so glad I did. I didn't understand it at first, but they were talking about alcoholism being a 3 fold disease, but by the end of the meeting understood, if I don't have mind, body and spirit, all aligned, if one is weak, I need to work that part out and make it stronger. My mind didn't wanna change cause it didn't have his spirit backing me, my body just wanted beer, where did I have time for the lord? So I go back home and start drinking, explain the day to my friend, and all of a sudden it clicks. I feel God spoke to me that morning because I was willing to work. I went to AA that day and was willing to accept him.

 My boss is sober and goes to AA, so since he is so personally invested in AA, he's gonna want that from an employee/prospective tenant. God wants me to work hard, and if I do I'll have money, and a place to call my own. But if I'm gonna do it at all. I have to do it sober. That's what God is telling me. I've spent all day thinking, well, it's AA, I can still get chips if I just smoke weed....but I felt His response deep down, NO. 

So here I am, almost through day one. Man, I've been on this subreddit for so long, almost unsubbed so many times, cause it made me feel guilty while I had a beer in my hand. I'm glad I didn't.

I don't get it.,"Last night was horrible. Didn't sleep a wink. Horrible anxiety, shakes, hallucinations, just dreadful. But today, for some reason, I feel pretty much normal. Pretty decent, actually. What happened? 

I took my librium after getting home from hospital last night, then again before bed. Didn't work worth shit. I've taken two pills today, so I have a theory. Maybe librium isn't supposed to work acutely? Maybe it's like an antidepressant, it has to build up in your system over several doses. I'm taking it as recommended, not abusing it at all. 

I read up on it (cause I'm a drug nerd and always research my psychoactive drugs), and one article mentioned that it has a half life of something like 10-30 hours. Meaning one dose can last in your system for up to over a day. So maybe each dose has slowly built up to a point that it's actually working the way it's supposed to now that I've been taking it as prescribed? I had a similar experience with phenibut, another very long-acting anxiolytic. 

But yeah, little anxiety, no shakes, still hallucinating but I'm not as freaked out by it. Has anyone else been prescribed librium and had this experience? 

Btw I'm not inpatient right now, I'm supposed to follow up with a detox center tomorrow so who knows what they'll do with me. If I'm correct in my assumption, id be totally down to just keep going like this outpatient. But who knows they might commit me anyway just to be safe. 

Regardless, glad to be back to feeling somewhat normal. No desires to relapse at all right now. Hope everyone here is doing well.",18,0

I have been dealing with extreme irritability and aggression the last month or so and I literally cannot function anymore. I seldom have any moments of happiness, I never leave the house - other than the gym and food sometimes, and I am in constant pain near my liver that is at best mild, usually moderate and sometimes terrible.

My bowel movements are ok for the most part since removing a giant polyp 20mm and my sleep has been horrendous, other than a night or two here and there.

I literally feel like I want to rip my head off or break something all the time, this never happened to me in the 1st few months of sobriety, never, never, never.

I have had virtually every test done that is non-invasive for my liver and body and it is all normal.

They keep telling me it likely leftover liver swelling, but really? it's been 6 months, and I don't feel anything like I used to feel. I am extremely angry most of the time, I have the shortest fuse, and I cannot relax no matter how good I sleep or not. This body pain is driving me insane, even when it isn't even that bad.

I feel like I am slowly dying and nobody is listening. I have had terrible thoughts of dying, not wanting to live, and this is consuming almost all of my time. Idk how I am even still here.

I literally do nothing all day, don't want to do nothing, try to do things, doesn't work at all. I do something for awhile and I quit it, I pick something new up and I quit it, I have been this way my whole life but these last few months have made me even more aware of how miserable I am.

I can't watch movies, play video games, nothing anymore because I get no enjoyment, I cannot even engage in focusing on any aspect of it. I am going to end up killing myself at some point and idk how I have even got this far without doing it. Death is on my mind all the time.

I cannot think of anything but every body sensation, my body is in legit pain, I am nauseas often, my moodiness is through the roof, Yesterday I flipped over a coffee table in my living room for no reason just listening to my mother talk about random things and I snapped at her.

I am 26 years old, a loser, 2 college degrees, I don't understand what the point of anything is anymore, literally anything!!! What is the point. We get old we die, we work, come home, sleep repeat. WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS. I don't understand why I exist, why anything exists, and I cannot make sense of a damn thing.

I cannot eat without body pain near liver, cannot sleep without pain near liver, cannot focus without pain near liver, cannot think of anything positive or even focus on anything remotely helpful without pain pulling me back in. THESE TESTS ARE ALL NORMAL AND I FEEL LIKE I AM DYING. WTF am I supposed to do???

I swear I am literally slowly dying of cancer or liver disease/failure and no test is spotting it and nobody cares.

So what should I do? Go to a doctor for the 10th time? I cannot even express myself because as soon as I am in a room or around others I suddenly cannot express all this, suddenly it goes away, or the pain is something I can suddenly power through, despite the fact that it is still here, it never goes away, and I go home and it just gets worse and worse and worse.

Idc what these tests say, I am in more pain routinely now than I was when I quit and all they keep saying is there is not much we can do for you if its your liver causing pain or your tests are completely normal and its maybe leftover swelling at most.

IDGAF anymore, fuck me, fuck life, fuck everything. I am going to die young and I can literally feel it getting worse constantly. FUCK IT ALL.",27,0

I know it’s my brain (not so) subconsciously purging and my body is so used to the poison that of course it will appear in dreams. Years ago when I quit cigarettes it happened then too. I’d see the yellow or blue box and the flare of a drag. 

Well last night I had a very happy moment. I was at some amazing taco bar kind of deal with a friend and as we’re leaving he bought me a super fancy drink. He had already paid and stepped out and the bartender brought me this GIANT bucket/margarita glass filled with a beautiful, purple, bubbly cocktail garnished with berries on the rim. It was effervescent and calling like a siren song but I told the bartender that I was trying to be sober and she dumped it out. 

I can’t say I have dumped a lot down the sink and not my mouth in the past. I’m trying, I’m not ‘new’ to this but I’m new in so far as how seriously I’m finally taking it. I’m proud of my subconscious and dream-redheadareninjas for saying nope. That’s all.

I'm not in a place where I can give a good concise summary of what my timeline is right now, but fuck this is so difficult :( I already quit smoking weed 5 weeks ago and I still get those cravings, but I guess it was easier for me to quit that since it actually made me paranoid and lose touch which reality. I started drinking when I was 15. It was the hug my parents never gave me. The courage I wish I had when I got bullied. The potion I took to slip into my cool girl internet persona. The comforter that temporarily took away the blanket of guilt and shame. I felt free when I was under the influence. Normal. My authentic self. But I also did and said things I would normally never do or say, and I'd be embarrassed the next day. After drinking for 10 years, I honestly don't know who I am anymore. Because who I am during the day, this anxious, awkward little girl, that can't be it right? So am I the outgoing but borderline callous bitch I can be when I drink? 

It feels like I'm saying goodbye to a long time companion that I love very much, but is bringing me more harm than good. It's my soulmate, just like how I thought my mom was. Now that I'm older, I've realized she's a gaslighting bitch and that we're not really soulmates, just trauma bonded. I cut her off, so I don't need my vices anymore. Because the only reason I picked those up was because I couldn't deal with the situation I was in when I lived at home. I have my own place now, and I'm done with running from past demons and by doing so wasting the present. 

I tried doing the moderation thing, and if doesn't work for me. It's like, instead of breaking up with your toxic ex, you booty call them every time you're feeling low. It reminds you of how it tastes and fucks with your mental.

I’m relatively new here, started out dry January, a couple days in I stumbled but I’ve been along for the hike. Hanging in there right now and trudging along. 

I started something last week that I thought may be helpful to my plant lovers out there. I bought a basic, cute houseplant. I purchased a pot from a local hardware shop and took time putting in nice potting soil and making this plant a happy home. I have it in my kitchen where I see it daily. When I have the urge to drink, even a tiny one, I imagine pouring the drink onto my plant. 

I used to be a fan of vodka and got to the point where it was easier to drink than water. When I have that initial gut compulsion to want vodka I imagine pouring the glass onto my plant and what it would do to it. Obviously harm it. I relate that to my own body and the effects of vodka or any alcohol in my life. For me hangovers were worth the immediate relief I felt when drinking but viewing my past actions now 6+ weeks sober has been eye opening.

Have quit several times, even once for over a year and a half. Must say that quitting gets harder every time. What always seems to bite me in the a$$, though, is my ego. I'm still having challenges admitting I have a problem. Goes way back to high school, when I realized all the adult males in my family had pretty serious drinking problems. Naturally, I promised myself I'd be sure and die of something else. In doing so, I cast the mental framework that I cannot and will not have a problem. Right. 

At any rate, I'm now 8 months into psychotherapy and have recently had my wife join in for couples therapy. Alcohol isn't our only issue, but I've used it and other tools to avoid feeling and dealing with other issues. Which makes it a complex mess to unravel. Especially so long as I'm in denial. 

Currently taking Naltrexone per the Sinclair Method and that seems to be helping. Just the same, the sooner I acknowledge I have a real problem and stay with solving it, the sooner we can work our way through our mutual issues and wend our way through life. 

Pretty confident I'll get through this, as I've got a shit ton of resources helping me. Biggest boost has been my wife joining into the couples therapy. Having someone hold your hand through this, even if they don't really understand, is huge. Doctor, wife, and two therapists are all on this as long as I'm fighting the good fight. And I don't intend to stop. It's really a fight for a healthy, engaged, and self-aware life.

For the first weeks, I'll drink very little and only few days a week. Only when my team plays or while I cook one special meal. I'll buy the exact amount of booze I'll have and feel proud and confident after I prove myself that I can and only want to drink moderately. The days of abuse are behind me. 

Then the pandemics are better, I take my 3rd jab, feel more safe to go out, meet people, hang with friends. It's so good to drink beer when you REALLY want. It's not like when I was abusing, like when I drank without savoring the moment. Now I'm chosing the right moments to drink.

Then I'm stressed with work. Then my mother is in the hospital. Then I'm feeling frustrated with my life. Then it's better to drink all the booze I bought and leave no more for tomorrow. Then I'll just take a walk drinking some beer, I always loved it, it relaxes me. Look how the city is beautiful, look how I'm connected with the world, tomorrow I'll do so many great things that I've been avoiding. 

Then anxiety, hair of the dog, day-drinking, buying beer bottles instead of cans to make less noise when I open them Tuesday 3am, keeping a scotch bottle on the nightstand to drink occasionally and drinking it in one night. Walking like a bum, carrying baby wipe and hipoglos ointment in my backpack because I'm 10 hours walking drunk and using public toilets.

I became a bad alcoholic, withdrawals, drinking in the morning, and a bad liver and all that, and sought help and have been 11 days sober. My partner, who I have 2 kids with (big reason for me quitting) drinks almost every night. She doesn't have the same crippling problems I had like having to drink to curb nasty withdrawals, or liver or health issues, however she still continues to drink. During the waiting period for the detox program I did I was so anxious, worried, depressed, ashamed, etc. and she told me she would stop drinking on weeknights at home with me. She has failed to do so and is trying to hide booze and its really easy to tell when she is drinking. I don't like her when shes drinking and I am sober, and I feel so alone in my home. I shouldn't feel that way when it comes to a significant other.  
Anyway, I just wanted to vent. I feel really disappointed, not necessarily in her, but with the situation in general. I kinda had a feeling it would be this way, and it just sucks. As a newly sober person, its quite a shitty feeling. I don't have much hope for her at the moment. I need to attend AA meetings, and meet sober people.

So recently I came across a podcast called LifeSpan with David Sinclair, who is a researcher at Harvard.  It was about his decades long research into aging, what it is, what affects it, what speeds it up, slows it down, and even reverses it.  He also wrote a [book](https://lifespanbook.com) about his findings and they include things he has done in his own life and people he knows and the effects it's had.  The guy is also 52 and he looks like he's in his early 30s.

I'm 40 and got sober a little over 2 years ago so it definitely has gone through my head that not young anymore and I spent a lot of time hurting/damaging my body.  After hearing about this and reading the book I am very interested in things I can do now to life much better.  The key takeaway from most of the research is that biological adversity and things that signal it cause our bodies to go into a repair mode and largely reduce what we think of as ""aging"".  The big thing I started in the last week was intermittent fasting, because being hungry for longer periods signals our bodies that it's a good time to go into defense mode, fix things, and prepare for adversity.  Given that I quit drinking, learned how to change my life from the ground up to deal with it, and have gone through alcohol withdrawal at least a hundred times; the transition to only eating a hearty dinner at night and not eating the rest of the day wasn't too tough.  The results are very exciting so far, I'm much more engaged and energetic and I am really feeling good about this.

I figured I'd post about it here, because this has been a really nice new step to take in my sober journey of living healthier and better and what I have already learned to do through getting sober made things recommended by the book pretty easy to do.",11,0

We also talked about moving in together and I mentioned that I would prefer if she didn’t come home plastered. She broke up with me and said she wanted the option to do so.

I am worried about future romantic partners. I don’t know how to date sober and the idea of meeting up at a bar or dating drinkers gives me anxiety.

I always do this. I have always gone a certain period without drinking, often months at a time, before some “special”occasion will arise and I hear the siren call of “just this once.” I want to change this pattern but it’s so fucking hard.

I am not at all giving advice, but just sharing some vacation tips that have helped me alleviate the nervousness/cravings surrounding drinking while I have been vacationing. I know my list will grow as I continue to do this (only have 43 days), but these have been integral to my success so far!

1) Have an activity in mind every day- whether it be “I’m going to read for 3 hours” or “I am going to walk and explore _____.” Having this informal outline to incorporate intentional movement and/or activity blocks out a chunk of time in my mind and marks it as “occupied” in my brain. I feel like when I have unlimited time to just sit and ponder I end up wanting to drink to fill the time. 

2) A tropical vibe/environment has been very helpful for me this early on in sobriety. A plethora of fruit juices are available, as well as smoothies, and other tropical drinks that don’t necessitate alcohol being involved. While it’s hotter than Hades and an ice cold beer sounds freakin’ incredible and timely, an ice cold ginger ale, fruit juice, or even just ice cold water has been equally thirst-quenching for me. 

3) HIGH QUALITY FOOD! The food experience for me has helped the most. I am reward myself in food-related ways instead! When I drank on vacations, often I ended up too full from alcohol or my appetite was too suppressed to be able to fully enjoy and be present during these amazing meals. 

4) Having WiFi has helped me because I have needed to turn to /stopdrinking to remind me that I just need to keep on keepin’ on. While I’m VERY much an unplugged type of gal, the WiFi accessibility 70-90% of the time has been key for using the supports I needy his early on in sobriety. 

5) A great partner and/or understanding travel buddy! My partner drinks, but doesn’t get wasted and/or very drunk. He respects my decisions, and never asks me if I’m sure I don’t want one, because he knows I DO WANT ONE, and having to consciously say “No, I don’t” makes it just that much harder. He always asks what juice or drinks I would like instead.

  You can set it up to send you a motivational notification when you know you are more prone to succumb to your addiction, mine is at night and you earn “trophies” at certain milestones. It’s self-moderating and if you fall off, it’s up to you to be honest and reset. I refuse to allow myself a trophy for something I didn’t do, so I feel compelled to be honest with myself.

This is what I wanted. I was in such a dark place, I thought, ""Oh, they will give me medicine and share our stories, and 21 days I would be cured.""

Boy, was I wrong! They structured our days with classes and therapy. We had chores. We washed our own clothes. We had play time that consisted of volleyball and corn hole. 

This was the best thing I've ever done, and let me tell you why.

The structure helped tremendously when I got home. I had a 4-year-old, and my son was turning 1. (No, I did not drink while pregnant). I learned to structure my days. It made my life ALOT easier and also helped my family tremendously! 

The classes taught us that while it is possible to relapse, it's also possible not to. They taught us to take accountability. They taught us life without that demon is possible, and it's AMAZING! We went to meetings outside of the facility and had guest speakers (which I'm going to ask if I can speak soon). We bonded with each other and our teachers. We went briefly through the 12-step program and had homework to turn in.

The last and very best thing that I needed was THERAPY!!!!!!!! OMG, you guys!!! I didn't know how bad I needed it! I realized I never processed my sister's murder and I just internalized everything. Which made me want to numb myself. Alcohol was my drug of choice. I didn't feel anything until I realized I was in the darkest place in my life. I was a shell. I would drink a bottle or two of vodka a day. I would take sleeping pills and essentially played Russian roulette. Therapy taught me about confronting everything I internalized, self care, setting boundaries, and my life matters. I matter. I lost myself, but with therapy (which I am still in) and the rehab facility, I got a second chance at life and let me tell you, it's freaking an amazing feeling. I learned I have an addictive personality and with all of the alcohol weight I gained, I decided to walk (self care) I lost 80 lbs in a year just from walking daily. I actually enjoy walking and working out. It's my me time and actually helps with my mental state. 

If I can do this, you can. Don't be afraid to ask for help. I never thought almost 5 years ago, I would be here, writing this, happiest I've been. It could be you too. 💝💝💝💯",23,0

I am not one of you. 

Both the pandemic and new sobriety have been really hard on me. I needed to build new neural pathways and I couldn't go out for drinks with anyone and just get something alcohol-free in the beginning. I didn't trust myself and had to prioritize my sobriety. But as I pushed through the first 2-3 months, the following helped:

* Scheduling activities with friends in the morning (and not brunch). Coffee and a hike, etc.
* Zoom trivia with friends who live in other places - I am building bonds with friends who have moved away, and even if they drink during trivia I felt safe because they're not in the room with me
* Working in a job where I get lots of good social interaction and I'm not seeking it out after work during a time where most people meet over drinks
* Finding ways to plug in and help people - harnessing my people-power for good instead of draining it away with repetitive conversation over beer
* Hobbies! I have a few good ones I can do with other people, but community colleges often offer affordable 6-8 week classes in every skill known to man if you don't know where to start. In very early sobriety I did three back-to-back dog training classes with my youngest dog to get her first little obedience title and it felt great to see the same people once a week and work towards a goal. 
* Letting your friends know you want to be invited to things even if you might not be comfortable coming yet. I had friends try to ""keep me safe"" when they found out I wasn't drinking and not exclude me out of their own discomfort, but genuine love. I had to spell it out for them that I wanted to be able to decide and to please extend the invitations to things even if I decline a lot. Some people just don't know what to do with that first sober friend and they may unintentionally be hurtful because they are scared to do the wrong thing. It's okay to spell it out for them. I now very often would like to meet for an early drink with friends at a place that has food/good drink options for me.

I am also more protective of my energy, even though I still love people. Some people just drain me of life or fry my nervous system and I had no idea before I got sober. I was in a state of numbness, so it was hard to tell if people were filling or draining the proverbial cup. Now if I get the itch to make plans when I need connection, I pause and check my gut - is this who I really want to spend time with? Will this actually stress me out? And now that I feel safer having people over at my house periodically, is this the kind of person that will have me scrambling to bleach my grout before they come over, and do I want that kind of stress in my personal bubble?

2 days ago I had a nice sober streak going, living a productive life, making progress. My morning was good, I got a lot done. By mid-afternoon, a strong craving to drink appeared out of nowhere.

The ""better half"" of my brain immediately said ""don't do it, it's not a good idea!""  But the more frivolous side of my brain says ""oh live a little! It's just one night! Come on!""

Then my better self says ""it's a work night... do you want to go to work tomorrow exhausted and anxious and hangover?""   Then the other voice in my head says ""fine, just buy a half sized bottle of whiskey then, not full size.""

That was my compromise. That was my justification. That was how I talked myself into buying whiskey, especially knowing I had to go to work the next morning. You guys know what I'm talking about here: that inner debate in our head... trying to say no, then searching for any excuse to say yes.

As I walked to the liquor store, my brain wasn't done. ""Well, a half sized bottle means 2 hours of fun, then what?""  .....  ""you'll probably head back out anyway to buy a second bottle once this half sized bottle is finished, so you might as well buy the full sized bottle.""

Yes, I ended up purchasing the full sized bottle of whiskey. Yes, I went to work the next day hungover, with bloodshot eyes, and very poor sleep.

I'm on Day 2, I feel alright now, but I just wanted to highlight how sometimes part of our brain is willing to justify and lie and trick and cheat, and learning not to fall for that deception is so critical.

I ""justified"" buying whiskey on a work night by tricking myself into thinking I would just get a half sized bottle, enjoy a strong buzz for 2 hours, then be done with it. And yet, I ended up getting the full sized bottle, I couldn't even stick to my ""justification.""

This means that I need to fully recognize and admit and come to terms with the fact that part of my brain is going to lie to me and trick me and deceive me just to come up with an excuse to throw clarity and caution and maturity out the window.",12,0

Alcohol is really insidious. It will use your struggles against you to tempt you in to taking the first drink. Don't believe a word it fucking says.

I did quit years ago and was almost, *almost*, one year sober. But I worked in a bar at the time, and my fiancé convinced me that I don’t have a drinking problem. He drinks every single day but insists he doesn’t have a problem. And maybe it just doesn’t affect him the way it affects me. 

But I’m coming off an intense 3 day drinking period. I’m not sure if it constitutes a bender or not, but I’ve had over 5 drinks every single day, even when I begin the day thinking “I won’t drink today”. Something happens and that glass of wine finds its way back to my hands. If I finish the bottle, I’m distraught until I open another one. I feel totally out of control. I’m a small person, so 2 drinks usually gives me a decent hangover. 5 or more demolishes me. Yet i can’t stop once I’ve started. 

I felt so good for that year of sobriety. I’m tired of sleepless nights and being constantly embarrassed about what I said or did while I was drunk. I’m so tired of the anxiety and feeling so ill all the time. I’m getting older and my body doesn’t feel the same anymore, it feels like I’ve damaged myself. That really scares me. 

A lot of changes are happening in my life. I’m moving and need to prepare for the move but I’ve been putting it off and drinking, watching trash tv instead. I have a new job that I’ll be starting that isn’t in a bar or around alcohol, so that will be easier. 

My fiancé will support me, but again, he will also question why I even stopped when I “don’t have a problem”. I don’t really know how to navigate that. It’s hard, cause I think it’s time to quit but then I think - what about at our wedding? During our honeymoon? Seems like there’s always a time that it feels like I should drink. But I hate it and I’m so tired of feeling this way. 

Don’t know what the point of all of this really is. I’m really sad that I’ve lost control over my decisions. I feel so dependent on alcohol and it feels hopeless and pathetic. But I want to at least try to gain that control again.",9,0

I don’t always love the way I drink but 90% of the time I’m ok with it. It peaked though during some trauma + pandemic stuff and was an issue. If you go back in my post history it’ll be apparent it was problematic (and probably will slip back to spiking if I keep chugging along moderately for now). 

Now I’m back to a glass or two most evenings, and the occasional “splurge” here and there aka getting tipsy or drunk.

But, the thing is, I’m more tired. I’m more cranky. I’m more angsty. And my body actually feels just like … yucky.

And I’d like to stop. It isn’t quite as simple as stopping, which I know so many here know. There is of course chemical dependency, social dependency, and that weird concept of alcohol as a suitable end of day treat, as an escape, as something “fun”, a vacation from life. 

But. Anyway. I’m starting to put the pieces together, I guess. 

I’d love reading suggestions around things that changed the way folks associated alcohol - ie. I think for me it won’t just be “wanting” to stop, but actually reframing what alcohol corresponds with in my head. 

I have a copy of This Naked Mind and have read David Carr. Interested in others. I think the science of impact psychologically and physically is for whatever reason a big motivator in any life habits I’ve changed. 

I’m coming to terms that that glass of wine is not the thing helping me unwind in the evening after work. It’s the thing screwing with my sleep and leaving me groggy in the morning fucking my food intake making my pants tight leaving my face puffy upping anxiety and bringing me down. 

But I am hungry to truly rewire the way I think about the drink, change what drinking means to me, and shift my understanding of how it impacts mood and body and brain. 

I’m the kind of person where changing my internal narrative / association leads to longest term change in any area of my life. 

Cause I love my glass of wine or three, but am also kind of over it? And I’d like to start internalizing why I’m over it - if someone handed me a glass and said hey do you want some poison, I’d be like hell no. But an aged bottle of red - my brain goes ooh delicacy!

We may be a world apart, but  we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding  what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily  commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to  inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender  or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a  sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*.  It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes  impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person  can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again.  And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not  drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that  they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and  participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at  /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed  introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.  You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

A link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar.

About the fourth time my adult son asked me, “Do you miss the booze?”  I started to think maybe I should come up with an honest response to  the question.

I worked in the advertising agency business for the first twenty  years of my career, and I tried to utilize every trendy new behavior  that might help my company succeed and make my employers love me. One  workshop idea I remember embracing was the one about “Visioning.” That  is, I was to close my eyes and see myself in a situation where I was  successful: A winner! The star of the show!  Like this: my team makes a  new business pitch and starts to get on the elevator, but the  prospective client runs up to us and says, “That was brilliant! You blew  it out of the water! The account is yours and we need Wilbursmall!  Start billing us on Monday!”

Of course the vision was never the reality, and this struck me when  my son asked me that question. Finally, I said, “No, but I miss the  vision—the idea—of it.”  I’ve already noted here some of those visions:  after a long day of productive work, I sit down with a magazine and a  single glass of wine. Or I work six hours straight on a piece of  writing, stand up from my computer, pour a single shot of brandy, and  sigh with satisfaction. Or my husband and I finally sell the house, and  treat ourselves to an expensive lunch out with a glass of red wine. 

Those visions, though, never, ever matched the reality.  I never stopped at one drink.

So now I’m on a long journey to stop visioning and just, well, do.   It’s so easy for me to have a vision, and so hard to execute the  behavior that’s absolutely necessary to get there.  But every day I get  better. And THIS is no vision; it is reality: I will not drink with you  today, Wednesday, February 16, 2022.",340,0

Terry Gross: Can you share some of your favorite comments from your readers that you’ve gotten over the years?

Maurice Sendak: Oh, there’s so many. Can I give you just one that I really like? It was from a little boy. He sent me a charming card with a little drawing. I loved it. I answer all my children’s letters – sometimes very hastily – but this one I lingered over. I sent him a postcard and I drew a picture of a Wild Thing on it. I wrote, “Dear Jim, I loved your card.” Then I got a letter back from his mother and she said, “Jim loved your card so much he ate it.” That to me was one of the highest compliments I’ve ever received.

Suicidal ideation has been top of mind for me and I’m just so fed up with everything. My motivation to get work done is terrible and now I’ve got a slight buildup of papers to mark plus my regular job. Which is ironic given I used to do way more when I was drinking and hungover most days, but somehow I got it done. 

Feeling very frustrated, angry, upset and to be honest, afraid about what’s happening in Canada at the moment. I’ve been considering re-locating to the US for a while now partly for career opportunity, partly for warmer weather and partly for a fresh start, and as of late, to just be done with this covid stuff. I know it has caused loss and pain for many, but IMHO and what I’ve seen bc of the nature of my job, the toll of the government reaction to it has been and continues to be far worse for the population as a whole. 

Today was just a big stress ball, i was stress eating thru the day, I finally got my stuff done for job #1, got myself ready to walk in the freezing cold to go to the gym bc my car is being fixed, went to the gym, I could even tell how on edge I am bc every little thing pissed me off. It took so much effort not to turn around and yell at the dude behind me who kept slamming weights. Like if you can’t control the lift and retract, do a SMALLER amount, ughhhh! I didn’t, I kept my mouth shut and tried to focus on myself. Felt like garbage so then decided to try on the bridesmaids dress for a destination wedding in 4 weeks that at this point I don’t even want to go to, still doesn’t fit, I’m too fat. So I get to go sink more money into this trip. (Was supposed to go March 2020- but covid, and the company wouldn’t give refunds and the couple booked at a more expensive resort this time and I have to take unpaid vacation to go because I’m now at a different job). 

Anyways, held off until 8 min to closing, said fuck it I’ve had enough, started getting dressed to go buy wine and that stupid counter popped into my head. And 1- I don’t want to reset it, 2- I think it’s still broken and it’ll kill me if it isn’t reset and I’m looking at the wrong number knowing I messed it up. So I picked up my dog cuddled with him and just had a crying meltdown. Made dinner, ate, watched a show and now I’m in bed. 

I’m still really upset and I need to figure stuff out. But at least I won’t be hungover tomorrow when I take another try at it.

I started drinking heavily at the age of 15. While most kids my age did it for social reasons, I drank to cope from years of childhood trauma. I experienced several other traumatic events later in life that made my drinking worse. I lost everything several times was in jail and homeless.More than once. My own mother had a restraining order on me at one point. I started working in the kitchen industry which was  great for a functional alcoholic. I would drink during my shifts but never enough to loose my composure. As soon as shifts were over I was getting blackout drunk pissing myself. I was completely content drinking myself to death. Alcohol was number 1 in my life. I worked to drink. despite I became a successful chef running my own kitchen. This Was the first time I was anyone besides a drunk. Until I met a female bartender one thing led to another and we started hooking up. She soon became aware of my alcoholism. I fell hard for her she soon refused to see me if I was drinking. This was a turning point. I started not drinking while we were together. I started staying with her for weeks. I went through withdrawal while she held me but I was staying sober. I started to believe I could stop drinking.One day on my way to work I received a phone call my best friend had passed away. From an alcohol and pill overdose. It crushed me. We were more than drinking buddies we were brothers. I was his paul bearer. It was open casket.As I stared at his lifeless body I wept. After the funeral me and my other Buddies were going drinking ""for jason"". So I did what I always did to cope we got fucked up. My now girlfriend wasn't mad at me in fact she understood why. I told her I was done and fully committed to it. I didn't want to end up like my father or Jason dead from drinking. So I stayed sober. I soon had a 2 year long court battle to get custody of my kids which would have never been possible without sobriety.  I ran two more restaurants in mean time. My girlfriend supported me through it all. So I made her my wife. I got to make my mother proud. my family proud. My kids could actually depend on they're dad to handle shit. I went through so many experiences just to be sober. More people I knew died and ended up with life in prison. I mourned the loss of my ""friends"". Plus the overwhelming reality of facing you're trauma and learning to live without alcohol and drugs. I dove into hobbies I focused on natural experiences things you get a natural high from. I went back to school.I now work for my city. Im married have a wife kids everything I could ask for and more. The key was to  stop drinking. I still struggle ,and miss drinking. When I think I'm bulletproof it rears it's ugly head. I'm forever vigilant. I refuse to let everyone down I refuse to let myself down!For those of you just starting your journey be patient with yourself forgive yourself when you fuck up. Do things that you're scared to do. make it a habit. Surround yourself with the right people. Take control. Thank you for letting me vent ive been lurking on this sub for awhile.

I know I can stay sober if I really want to, but I’m just nervous that my urge to drink will overcome that on vacation. Especially since it’s right after my one year and it will be my birthday, I feel like I may try to rationalize it or tell myself ‘it doesn’t count if you’re on vacation’.

Today was the first bit of craving I have had since I decided I was well and truly done this time- I can remember it so clearly in my minds eye when all other sleepless, shitty nights seemed to fade into amnesia. 

I remember sitting up at 3am, my body wracked by the horrible ill feelings of a hangover. I was dizzy, exhausted, hardly able to move. My body felt like it was be shoved into a drawer from every side. Like I was going to molt out of my skin. I just laid there next to my beautiful wife and silently sobbed. 

I told myself in the darknesss ""I am done."" Words I had not uttered before on my journey. I had countless times said ""god this sucks"" ""never again"" ""wow I hate alcohol"" ""this is so stupid, why am I do this to myself?"" but none of it resonated so deeply into my core. ""I am done. I am done. I am done."" and then I laid back in bed and willed myself not to fall off the edge of the world as it spun.

I view it as poison. I see it now for what it is- and I dont want to be drunk. I dont want to be mean. I don't want to wake up at 3am horrifically wracked in guilt and feeling like the lowest of the low. Hopeless. Scared. ill. 

And yet my damn body still craves it. It still tries to pull the strings. It makes me sick. When do those cravings ever leave?

They’re doing us a huge favour by letting us stay here. And they haven’t said anything yet, but they know. I don’t imagine they will say anything. They’re kind people, but I’m really taking the piss by behaving like this in their home.

I used to drink excessively every weekend in my early twenties until I had my daughter. Then binge drinking became a rare thing…but STILL a thing. I didn’t need it everyday, but I DID feel like I needed alcohol to have fun and be social at events on occasion. 

Some of my lowest points? Well… I’ll name a few: 

Sleeping with too many people I didn’t really want to, but convinced myself at the time that it was a good idea. 

Throwing up or peeing on myself in public. 

Saying stupid shit, or shit that doesn’t make sense, slurring my words, being generally annoying, texting/calling people at random times in the night. 

Self-harm, trying to jump out of a moving vehicle…. The only time I’ve ever thought of hurting myself….or worse…was when I was extremely intoxicated and depressed.

Alcohol brings out so much darkness in me. It makes me want to just cut it out completely. Even though I CAN stop at one (for example, a glass of wine with dinner at a restaurant) …thinking about all those moments I overdid it…makes me want to never have a single drop again. I want to be a woman my daughter can look up to. I also want to have respect for myself. I want to be mentally present, and not numb to my feelings.

One year ago I was finishing off a pretty good 3 day bender. And before that I was drinking 5-10 drinks (sometimes more) almost every night. It had become my default setting. I was miserable and sick and was slowly killing myself. 

I tried to quit so many times. Every Monday morning basically. But by Monday night I’d find a reason to drink. I remember so many nights finding an excuse to run out at 8:55 just before my local liquor store closed because I just couldn’t take a night off. But all that’s over now. 

One year later I can tell you that my life is not perfect by any stretch. But it is infinitely better. My health is better. My marriage and family are stronger. My finances are better. My career is in a better position. I sleep better. I’m genuinely happier. 

After getting through a week of withdrawals, every day got a little easier as my body and mind got used to not drinking. But honestly I think it took most of the last year to begin to feel like my old self. Seriously just in the last couple of months I’ve noticed that I’m just generally happier and more fulfilled in life. And I think that’s from finally working through some of the shame and depression that accompanied my addiction. I feel free. 

To anyone out there who has tried and failed, keep going. Tell a friend. Find support. Message me. Just know that you can do it and life is so much better on the other side. The most important thing I can tell you is this: You are loved and you are worth it.

Along the way, I wrote down thoughts and insights as they came up and figured I would share them. For added perspective, I was drinking 5 or 6 nights a week (because if you take a day off you're not an alcoholic, right?) and a total of about 50 drinks a week. I've held down a well paying job and maintained a good relationship with my wife, and been a decent father to my kids the entire time I was drinking. My rock bottom was the physical and, more damaging, mental health issues drinking was causing me.


-I need less sleep. I was definitely an 8hr+ a night guy if I wanted to function the next day. Now I only need about 6.5 and maybe a 10 minute nap after work to feel rested throughout the day.

-Sugar sugar sugar. One of the 2 things I learned on to get me through cravings, the other being NA beer. Sometimes I'd crush 800cals of ice cream, but I would've put more than that in beer down the hatch then ate doubke the ice cream when the drunk munchies hit.

-Coffee doesn't cause a system purge (or probably more accurately, drinking was giving me the shits). I thought it was normal to have a cup of coffee hit instantly and exit like a shotgun blast. This pretty much hasn't happened since I stopped drinking.

-I notice a lot more things. This may just be me but it may because I'm actually feeling bored and my brain wants things to look at. Either way it's a noticeable difference. Tangently related, my hobbies don't feel like work and my actual work is a lot more tolerable.

-I stopped missing beer after a week or so. Cravings still hit when emotional stressors trigger me, but I'm no longer pining for stouts and porters the way I was in that first week, and lamenting the fact I can never have one again. Any desire to drink pretty much comes as a stress response at this point.

-My emotional range seems to have a resting point more to the right. I've still had a few pretty low days and some pretty high ones, but on average I feel like my resting point is a 6 or 7 as opposed to a 3 or 4, and things that used to feel like 1s now usually feel like those 3s. (But I still have a 1 day now and again, just not as often)

-AA for atheists and Agnostics exists. I basically wouldn't have gone to AA if this wasn't an option, and going to AA has been helpful. I am not a spiritual person, and my group uses a different version of the big book 12 steps, found in Staying Sober Without God. Plus AA gives you a token every month you have sober through the first year and this sort of gamification is pretty motivating for my lizard brain.

-Assholes will find a reason to invalidate your sobriety. This is largely related to the above stated atheism and my enjoyment of NA beers. I've never seen it in /r/stopdrinking fortunately, but some people I've encountered on other platforms will invalidate your sobriety if you're not religious/spiritual, and some claim drinking NA beer or mocktails is a relapse. I don't think I could've made it the month without Run Wild and Bud Zero to be honest. My sobriety is my business and yours is yours.


That's it, nothing groundbreaking that hasn't been posted before in some fashion, but I figured I'd share and celebrate my 30 days sober here 😊

My husband was mad because, he thinks I should be focused on the terrible things I did to him while drinking in the past, and not so much on just the last episode.  I laugh but, I kind of see his point.  He's taken it on chin for me.

Just so ready to be feeling better.  Right now I just feel like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Thanks for reading.

I felt beautiful and powerful every day. Heath, fitness, and improving myself were everything to me. I never thought much about drinking. Sometimes I would have a glass of wine on a holiday but in general I considered myself a non-drinker and I didn’t understand the appeal. Then COVID came along and closed the gym. I filled the anxiety of losing what was my outlet with getting drunk.

I have drastically cut back on my drinking the last couple of weeks but I’m still drinking a couple of bottles of wine on the weekends. The craving to “have a good time” and “relax” is so intense. I want this to be my first sober weekend in 2 years. Obviously this feels like a monumentous task since I’m already concerned about it and Friday is 3 days away from now. Hopefully looking at the title of this post will remind me what I’m fighting for.

100 days have gone by since I relied on alcohol to get to know and attempt to connect with men in my life.

100 days have gone by since I relied on alcohol to falsely get me through the uncomfortable feelings of anxiety, apathy, confusion, depression, fatigue, isolation, and overwhelmedness. (I’ve learned those feelings are still there once you come to, whatever vice you may choose.)

100 days have gone by since I allowed alcohol to put myself in situations that may have not been physically or emotionally safe for myself or others.

100 days have gone by since I felt alcohol had to be involved in any “fun,” leisure plans as an adult.

As someone who has never felt _________ enough for others’ company, alcohol was my frenemy in times of social anxiety induced by shyness, introversion, and fear of the unknown. I could “keep up” with the crowd in more ways than one, but moderation was not my modus operandi, and the post-overindulging anxiety eventually caught up to my 30-something self.

Do I still get sweaty in crowds of familiar faces and with meeting new people? Yes x a lot of numbers. Can it be hard when folks are drinking and I’m not? Most definitely. Am I in control of what I put in my hand and do my loves still enjoy my presence, whether or not I’m imbibing? Absolutely.

Self-discovery is a term I probably would have rolled my eyes at in high school. It’s difficult, it can be messy, it can feel like the walls are caving in around you. On the other hand, though, it can be beautifully freeing to prioritize your values, your desires, and your strengths without comparing them to anyone else’s. Focusing on who you are is not selfish; it allows you to show up fully and authentically for those dearest in your life.

Focusing on decisions made while drinking in the past and what I will do if I ever travel to the aesthetically stunning land of Guinness and Jameson is not important to me right now, nor will it help me today. Whatever it is you may be attempting or working through, try your damndest to be genuinely present. Everyone, regardless of journey, could learn a lot by taking life one day at a time.

Almost no withdrawal symptoms except feeling very tired and exhausted I hope this gets better. On the positive side I just feel better in almost every way. I sleep better, I am calmer and less sad every day. The guilt I felt after every morning after drinking the night before is no longer there, I never realized how heavy that weighed on me and how processing it was killing me.

I can better handle normal day to day life with all of its ups and downs. I am much less ashamed of myself then I had been for years. I am more confident and happier. I am more optimistic about the future, music has become more important to me like it was many years ago, it means more, I feel it more, it is important again and better.

I have my moments but can deal with them. Most important of all to me at least is I crave and love all the real emotions I can now feel. I am starting to feel more empathy and respect for people. I am much less angry and more 'real'.

I feel like I am becoming the person I was a long time ago and the person I was meant to be all these years :)

I am changing, I feel like I am becoming better in some way. I feel more human.

After about a year sober, a year of being in bars but no drinking, after a year of being surrounded by folks drinking, I feel so confident in my decision. I feel better, look better, think better, I feel all around better. 

Here is where I don't feel better: I resent my friends when they are drinking.

I can tell when they are intoxicated. And I don't mean falling down wrecks, I mean just 2 drinks and I notice the changes in their personality. I don't like it at all. It's like one minute their my friends and then it's the uncanny valley. I am looking at the same person but they have shifted gears to a point where I do not feel comfortable. 

I feel a bit guilty about it. I avoided going to a gathering last night because I did not want to deal with anyone under any amount of influence.

Then, I started thinking about the guilt and shame I’d feel if I didn’t tell my partner or if I didn’t take this as seriously as it has become. I set it back down and walked out.

For this reason, I’m not counting yesterday as a relapse. I still consider myself 6 days sober.

I am a server and it has been a long, long week at work due to Valentines Day. People were….not nice last night and I really wanted a glass of wine when I finally got off from my 9 hour shift. I even went as far as to browse the wine aisle at Safeway but I couldn’t find anything that I really wanted. Luckily, my boyfriend pulled me away before I bought anything and I went home and had my tart cherry juice/black tea concoction I’ve been calling “wine.” 

I woke up today after having my first drinking nightmare of this go around of trying to quit. In my nightmare, I didn’t have just one glass of wine and I blacked out and made questionable decisions which affected my relationships negatively. I woke up this morning grateful that I had not actually drank. 

The first 60 days or so of quitting were so fun this time. I have felt inspired and powerful choosing not to drink. However, the last 20 or so days have been so much harder. In the beginning, there was so much excitement surrounding sobriety and all the things I could do with all of my newly found free time. I am trying to remember and remind myself that all of that is still there, it has just been a busy week. And that just because I have been getting off late at night and decompressing with an alcoholic beverage sounds appealing, that doesn’t mean that I can’t find other ways to relax. 

This week is also going to be tough. It is my partners birthday. And though he is supportive of my not drinking, he is typically very intoxicated on and surrounding my birthday. We have plans with our friends, some I haven’t seen and don’t know I have stopped drinking and it is giving me anxiety.

Wise advice needed.,"I got sober at 24, after many failed attempts. I have an alcoholic mother and all the women in my family struggle with alcoholism, so it’s not surprising that I developed a toxic relationship with alcohol.

I’ve never been a daily drinker, never drank in the morning, and despite binging with booze and drugs throughout my college and uni years, I somehow managed to get top grades and hold down a job. But my emotional and personal life was destroyed by it. I drank to self medicate years of untreated childhood trauma and untreated depression. Drinking and partying became my escape, my favourite form of dissociation from a reality that I felt too uncomfortable with. It is an absolute miracle that in those years of heavy drinking and drug experimentation, I wasn’t accidentally killed or didn’t commit suicide (I made a failed attempt under the influence) or gained a criminal record, as drunk me would get arrested or fight people. It’s a miracle I didn’t come out with a severe, life long injury from all the dangerous scenarios I was in. 

So I got sober. I changed my entire life. I moved to a city I loved, cut ties with all drinking contacts, got on medication to treat my depression, got into therapy, re-connected with my parents, began training as a counsellor as it’s something I was always curious about but couldn’t do in my never-sober state, I picked up new hobbies, overcame social anxiety and became confident.

Then all of a sudden, just a few weeks after hitting 2 years sober, my brain goes, “You’ve done your time, you’ve sorted your life out, you’re only young, you deserve to kick back and have fun. You can have a few drinks now!”

And this is where it gets fucking tricky. I go out one night, have some ciders and dance the night away. All good! I’m clearly not the person I used to be! I have overcome my problem with alcohol! 
So a few weeks later I drink again. And it’s fun - until it’s not. Until I get home, too drunk, and have a huge emotional outburst in front of 2 friends and lose my shit because, alas, drunk brains can’t think clearly or regulate emotions.

I spend 2 days hungover, reaching out to people about slipping and how it’s not worth it. Drinking for me is a game of Russian roulette - I might get hit, I might not. Sometimes I drink and it’s all fun and games. Sometimes I can just have a few. But then there’s always a time when I drink, and it’s a complete shit show. Scary stuff happens. Really scary. 

I’m now 26, and because I don’t drink everyday, don’t have a physical dependence and there ARE times I can just have a few or have really fun drinking nights, my brain keeps trying to argue back. I also feel like if everyone my age is always getting drunk and making mistakes anyway, then why shouldn’t I? Why do they get to check out, numb out, binge and get crazy and I can’t? Why can’t I have this vice?
Sober me is a very hardworking, Type A, perfectionist person, and I think the need to have a vice or lose control is linked to that.
When I’m sober I do everything right. I’m responsible, kind, loyal. And yet it puts me under too much pressure to be “good. When I drink, I’m allowed to do it all wrong, and I feel a sense of rebellion and freedom in it. It’s like I can finally shout, “FUCK OFF AND FUCK YOU”. It’s liberating. 

Sometimes my brain goes, “Just get sober at 30. No one has their shit together in their 20s. You’re allowed to be irresponsible, you’re only young once!” 
And yet I fucking BET if I asked any of you older folk if you wish you got sober sooner or younger, you’d all say YES. 
Would 30 year old me genuinely go, “I’m so glad I spent the last 4 years of my 20s getting drunk instead of dealing with my problems sooner. What a laugh!”

It’s a gamble. I might drink and be alright. I might drink and by 30, be in terrible shape, in debt, potentially have a criminal record, ruin all relationships, and ruin my chances of being a therapist or achieving my career goals. Or I might be dead cause a night of drinking went very wrong. 

To the oldies and goldies, the future me, the wiser ones, the ones with more perspective.  Am I getting sober too young? What would you tell 26 year old you if you had the chance? What ways could I find that sense of rebellion and liberation whilst sober? 

Much love to people I know will understand. x",46,0

 Good morning. 
 Our keynote is, “Pray to seek to love, comfort and understand,…“. 
 The Meditation and Prayer for the Day  urge us to be instruments of the Divine Power and the forces for good.
 Interestingly, they tell us that God needs “supernatural” people.
 That statement assumes selfishness to be human nature. My first sponsor called self-centeredness, which is at the core of my alcoholism, the disease of all humankind.
 At least at first, obeying the Divine Spark while my brain and ego scream that it is against my self interest is not natural.
 The only way I have found to be lifted above my nature and ego is by trying to take correct stitches in spite of it feeling unnatural. Magically the more supernatural stitches I take, the more natural they begin to feel.
 If my selfish nature is to be overcome, I must, persistently behave better than my instincts, which allows God to slowly transform my nature.

But I haven’t told anyone I’ve stopped drinking.  When we went to a super bowl party this weekend I did confide in a friend that I’m not drinking “right now”. And that when my husband asked if I wanted to open a bottle of wine the other day I said, sure you can but I probably won’t have much.  He poured me a glass which I ended up just having sitting next to me most of the night before finally pouring it back in the bottle. 

I’m not sure exactly why I’m not admitting sobriety to anyone except you all.  People *know* but I phrase it as more of a break instead of what I am hoping is a permanent or at least long term thing.  Its not because I’m afraid of the relapse or people judging if I do go back…. More like I’m doing it to protect their own drinking. That if I tell my friends I feel like my drinking got out of hand and I had a problem, then they will start having to justify their own drinking,  comparing their behavior to the girl with the “problem” to prove they don’t have one as well.  Does that make sense at all?  And I’m sure some of it does come from the inevitable judgement when you admit you have a drinking problem.  Funny thing is, I had the drinking problem before I admitted to it, but no one judges until you actually say the words

Anyhow, just wondering if anyone else feels like that and holds back on telling people they don’t drink anymore

I’ve realized that although I went weeks without drinking before, the nights where I would only have 2 drinks were very little compared to the nights where I’d have 6 drinks. Although it sucks to admit it, I may have a self control problem. I think my life/health would be better off without me trying to trick myself into trying to moderate.

It's also the only time that I smoke cigarettes so it's a double whammy. If I say no to the first beer on weekends I'll have a much happier and healthier life. My only saving grace to this point is most days I don't drink. My Constitution is never allowed me to go more than a couple times a week with alcohol in my system because I know what happens every time. I'll stop down as many beers as I can get at a a bar and then I'll crave a cigarette. And hey I might as well pick up a 12-pack right who cares if I feel like s*** tomorrow. Oh and I'll probably send some embarrassing texts that I'll have to walk back tomorrow. Hell I might even kill a friendship or two. I definitely won't get anything done on my to do list and I'll likely just lounge around in bed eating greasy food and I hate myself more and more. That has been a common cycle for me over the last several years. I blame childhood trauma and the feeling of being stuck in the dark alone that initially got me on the cycle of addiction. I was doing better but then I lost a couple close friends tragically and I seemed to spiral sense then. My career has always done really really well meaning I'm a high achiever and other phases of my life but on the rare occasion that I call in sick I'm almost always extremely hungover. Fortunately I only do this once or twice a year but the rest of the times I just suffer through the day but do very little work. This time feels better like something is different this time. You'll have to excuse the voice to text if the grammar is a little poor. My best friend growing up is also an alcoholic likewise with a lot of people in my core group of friends. I feel awful saying this but watching him lose his family and house and and virtually everything else has really been eye-opening to me. One thing mutual friends at point it out is how red his skin is and how bloated he looks. Is clearly the consequence of daily drinking for 20 years and endless cigarettes each day. I'm not entirely sure he's going to be with us in 10 years. I actually think I need a new group of friends or at least every associate with people who don't have drinking problems.

For *so many* years I always thought I had it under control (And did somewhat; but the bandages add up unknowingly.) I realized it fully took over after multiple very traumatic life events/deaths. Full blown dependency is the worst ever. Even worse when you are depressed, stressed, and grieving as well. It has been a long fought journey but I am breathing some fresh air of relief slowly and hoping it still gets better. My thoughts and emotions have been dulled down by alcohol for so long that I am still attempting to work with them. Even though they are always still on overdrive with my current life situations right now. My dopamine is still fried and I am working my best to create healthy ways to reshape it and have normal fun again.

Anyways sharing this just incase anybody is going through what I was at that point. After I quit it was extremely difficult to deal with the mood swings. They were so SO awful and I sympathize with anyone going through what I was going through back then.   


Since that post I drank once in August and all it did was confirm to me that alcohol is something that I don't need. I didn't get completely drunk like I used to but it just made me feel like I was... half living? I can't drink like I used to ever again. I just simply won't. I remember when I made that post I wanted to end everything.  


It gets better. I still have mood issues but I think that is something that will never change. I am able to stay on top of my mood changes so much better after quitting. I thought that alcohol helped me deal with the stress, helped me deal with the depression. If anything alcohol was the single greatest contributor to my downfall mentally. Life is not easy but alcohol is stacking the deck against yourself if you're like me. I used to love blacking out, I thought I got the best sleep after blacking out.  


I will never drink again and I guess I could say I'm proud but it's not even that. I needed to do it to live a happy life. We all have seen alcoholics in our life age. We know how that goes. While I can't say I'm happy, when I die, I can look back on this moment in my life and be proud. I just hope that anybody going through what I was going through sticks to it. it will get better",33,0

It hit hard, but I did not drink. Well that was until Friday night... I just had to get a quarter bottle. That turned into, crap I have to walk in the below freezing temps to the gas station to get beer, oh I should just stop in the bar to warm up after... 

Which bled into the morning and day. I bought another quarter that night and took two sips and got violently ill. Not eating for two days and drinking can do that I guess? Well I ended up in the hospital for some fluids and anti nausea meds. 

The worst part is I didn't even WANT to drink. It was a compulsion. Lizard brain is sad, this will make me happy! And in that brief relapse I said nasty things to my ex, myself, and was just SO angry. I came to a realization that I don't allow myself to be angry unless I'm drinking. I thought I never was angry before picking up drinking. And I was, but I hid it because that's what felt safe. Love those good ol hangover reflections, eh? 

So I spent my valentines feeling gross, single, and pathetic but I was happy because I didn't want to drink!

I have been drinking pretty much every day since I was 22(aside from 2 pregnancies and 18months of breastfeeding), and I am now 44yo. My drinking used to be only beer, then it upped to liquor and beer. I used to only drink at night after the kids went to bed, but now it's all day,  from 11am, until evening. I don't drink to get drunk, I never black-out, and I work from home and maintain a somewhat normal life. However, I'm in what could be considered an abusive marriage with a man who drinks heavily as well, and is a mean drunk(he does get wasted and blacks out sometimes, which is why i don't...somebody has to keep the household going). I only mention that because me quitting drinking, with the crippling anxiety that comes with it on the first few days, causes problems for me with him. I can't get away with not being the same, even keeled person I always am, without him verbally attacking me.

However,  I don't care anymore. This is killing me, and I know it's a big  part of the reason I am unable to safely get away from my situation. I can't keep my mind focused long enough, or my anxiety down enough, to make it happen.  I think that the combination of heavy drinking and emotional abuse has turned me into a person that I'm not proud of.

Nsfw mark for possible trigger warnings)This time I hit rock bottom like never before. I finally came clean to my immediate family, and let me just go ahead and tell you something. If you think you’re hiding it, you’re not. They know they’re just not telling you out of respect. Mine told me they’d know for sometime, but because of how much trauma I’ve experienced the last few years they decided to turn a blind eye. 

Friday morning I went to my grandparents in tears begging for help with detox. My grandmother is a retired nurse and I trust her judgment. She sent my grandfather to get me a pint when the liquor store opened with intentions on monitoring my vitals while she tapered me. Well, let’s just say going from an entire fifth every day for months on end to that isn’t a good idea. 

Eventually I got to the point where I couldn’t even hold the liquor down. Every sip of water or powerade came right back up, my heart was pounding out of my chest and I was shaking. My blood pressure got sky high, I don’t remember the numbers, but it was in the 200’s. Aka stroke level, and my heart rate got up to around 170. Eventually my grandmother wouldn’t let me refuse the hospital anymore and called an ambulance. If it wasn’t for that decision on her part I’m not sure I would have made it. 

In the ambulance they gave me fluids and zofran for nausea. Overall the emt’s were very kind, but the first nurse I had at the hospital came across judgmental. Which, in retrospect I’m grateful for. Surprisingly they didn’t keep me for a 3 days stay this go around, though I suspect that’s because they were at overcapacity. After some more fluids, ativan and observing me for about 6 hours the doctor came into talk. My livers not in the best shape, and my enzymes are fairly elevated (as to be expected). Basically she told me I had to quit drinking know before I got to the point beyond return. She gave me a script for librium and nausea medication and released me.

Basically I wanted to post this to tell you if you think you have a problem, you do, and if you want to quit get medical help. Don’t be like me. I’m 25 years old and worried about what kind of irreparable damage I’ve done to my body. I won’t know for sure until I go back for a follow up on my blood work, but right now I’m terrified. Even if you’re young, you’re not invincible and it will catch up to you. Eventually there’s no more putting it off and you’re going to have to face the consequences. I started drinking as a way to cope with the trauma, to numb my pain, and escape the prison that my head felt like, but in the end I’ve realized I was just putting off facing the inevitable. I thought it was a better alternative to suicide, but in all actuality I was merely talking alternate more painful route.

I use to binge drink over weekends, a bottle of brandy a night, this would entail me either passing out at my pc at 5am the next morning or stumbling to bed and waking the missus up. Before I got to bed I would ""hide"" my empty bottle in the office cupboard, the main reason was because I was ashamed of how much I drank.   


Anyways, fast forward to last night, 3 weeks sober, I was putting my dumbbells' back in the cupboard after a great workout as well as looking for my tub of protein mix when I spotted them, two bottles of brandy. I had completely forgotten about my ""secret"" until last night. Immediately I was overtaken by a huge amount of shame and anger. How could I have let myself become a slave to such a horrible substance? I immediately threw the bottles in the bin and carried on making my protein shake. After which I sat down with the missus and thanked her for sticking by my side and putting up with everything I had put her and us through.   


From that moment on I swore to myself that I would never let that evil substance entwine its vines around my heart and poison my thoughts again. I cannot moderate so therefore I would rather not drink again. I don't feel like I am missing out on anything to be honest, and I know its going to take time to accept myself for who I am, but last night shook something deep within me and reaffirmed my already strong beliefs, that alcohol no longer has control over me.

We may be a world apart, but  we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding  what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily  commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to  inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender  or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a  sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*.  It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes  impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person  can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again.  And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not  drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that  they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and  participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at  /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed  introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.  You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

A link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar.

As a child, I overheard conversations between my mother and other  women, following the all-too-frequent early deaths of their husbands. I  eventually noticed a fair amount of repetition in the advice given to  the newly widowed: “Don’t make any major changes the first year,” or  “Make yourself go out with people right away, even though you don’t feel  up to it,” or this, which I remember most clearly: “The worst part is  all the things you’ll have to do alone for the first time.”

Then, when I joined SD, I saw that the “doing things alone for the  first time” had become “doing it without booze for the first time.” I  saw it applied to the first wedding, the first camping trip, the first  office party, the first family event, and dozens more situations for  which we’ve relied on alcohol in the past. So I made a mental list of  the things I’d have to endure for the first time if I wanted to be (and  stay, one day at a time) alcohol-free. Of course you might laugh at my  list—I certainly did—because there were no weddings, no trips to Las  Vegas, no noisy pubs with friends. No, my list included going to my  women’s book group, folding the laundry when I’m tired, and reading  Martha Stewart magazine after a busy day. Doing those things without a  couple (or several) glasses of white wine were my firsts to get through.   But I did, all the way through the first alcohol-free flights I took  last week.  And your stories—no matter what your “firsts” were, helped  me immensely.

But you know what? I still keep a list, and it’s headed by one event:  the commitment I make every morning that I will not drink that day.   Someone with 30+ years of sobriety once told a person with one day that  they had everything in common, because, they said, “Neither of us has  been sober yet today.”

I will not drink with you today, Tuesday, February 15, 2022.",371,0

I thought I'd be able to get my shit together in 5 years but no. Every year it's the same thing ""another year sober, still a low wage sack of shit barely treading water"". I work as a chef and I fucking hate it. I've hated it since day one but I have no skills elsewhere (that are useful) and any manual labor job is right out the window because I've had this fucking hernia since just after I quit drinking. My job leaves me so mentally and physically exhausted I can't do much besides come home and lay in bed. I have anxiety and sensory issues, and busy days I just cry and have panic attacks all day. I want to go to school and make something of myself, but I can't even focus on a fucking cartoon most days. I failed my way thru high school and barely graduated. And not because I'm stupid, but because depression convinced me I'd kill myself soon so nothing mattered. I've lost all my friends, dating is virtually non existent.

What the fuck was the point of any of this. I do fuck all with my life. It's like I quit drinking and life just stopped. It's almost as bad as drinking my life away, the days just blur together all the same. Only now I do no socializing, or basically anything outside. Everything feels so alcohol centered, and I don't like being around drunk people. I'm saving a bit of money but basically just enough that if I lose my job I won't starve for a couple weeks. And it's not like I'm not trying, I quit smoking cigarettes, I barely smoke a gram of weed a month anymore, I cook all my own meals.

I hate this feeling. I can't connect with anyone because sober people actually have their shit together and alcoholics bug the shit out of me. And I'm just fucking stuck in this industry where drug and alcohol abuse is rampant.

I'm gonna try to go to school but I'm struggling to even afford a laptop. I'm sick of everything. Quitting drinking was still the right move, but I still feel just as stuck as I did before. Even more so sometimes, because I just cancel everything not wanting to spend my free time surrounded by alcohol that I know will be at 90% of social things

I probably wont drink, tho. And the funniest part is why, or maybe it's the saddest part. I'm not going to drink not because I don't want to disappoint my family, not because of some spiritual awakening or enlightenment, not because I've even changed that much. I'm not gonna drink even tho I really want to because I'm 45 years old and those three day hangovers are beyond shitty and approaching hell. Maybe even is hell.

Partly because the work load is and has been heavy, but very much because I could have been cherishing a second day with a very special someone. But I let alcohol steal that away from me.

He was sober when we met, he still is, I think. At least I hope so. I don't know much about his life anymore. And that hurts. I often wonder where he is, what he's doing. Is he okay? I know he doesn't want to talk to me and I don't blame him. I would have given up on me too.

...

Going back to the title and original concept for this post, it felt like treason making beautiful things for happy couples eager to show their love for one another. I smiled as warmly and hopefully as genuinely as I could, but the sinking feeling kept creeping in. How could I have let this happen?

I have no car, so I had to ride my bike and listen to music after work until the liquor store closed. Sometimes I have to keep pushing to get past the intense cravings that my sadness brings. I was so glad when I knew that the window of possibility was closed and that, if only for a night, I was safe again.

If you have the love of your partner, of the person who you cherish more than anything else in this troubled, complicated, tempting world; please do me a favor and stay sober to be the person you're supposed to be to them. To live the truth you knew before you became accustomed to the seductive embrace of the lie that the colored glass bottle sold to you.

I have been on a few sober girls trip some when pregnant and some during my previous attempts of sobriety. I know that I feel ok to not drinking on vacations now. That drinking doesn’t add to the fun it takes away from it. I guess I’m just most nervous to be out of my routine.

This trip I will be prepared. For the first time I’m taking anti anxiety meds and nalextrone for alcohol cravings. I have a therapist and addictions counsellor. My doctor knows about my struggle with alcohol. All my friends know and family. My sister is my support person if I need help on this trip. I have never had so many people in my corner. The friends I’m going on the trip will keep me accountable. In previous attempts I thought it is not my friends job to keep me sober but now I know it’s ok to ask for help.

I’m F25 and trying to convince myself to go to a an AA meeting for my first time by myself on Valentine’s Day and reminding myself every second the liquor store closes in 49 minutes and I absolutely do not want to go. I don’t want to go right? The AA meeting is in 1 hour and 49 minutes so that’s brutal brutal lemon brutal. Making it less than an hour to make it through today without drinking is not that hard though right? It feels overwhelmingly difficult at times, this time for example. 

I’ve made such a colossal mess of my life recently. I have been so horrifyingly unhealthy and toxic to quite a few people close to me. Im on such on an apology tour right now it’s shameful. I’m staring at two bouquets of flowers that I received today and I just don’t even deserve them. I spent 20 minutes telling my mom this morning how I need to end things with these two guys I have been casually seeing because I don’t think I should be dating for a while. And then that. 

I just feel like I want to start a new life. Just pack what I can fit in my car. Shut my phone off and disappear for a month. 

I’m going to go to therapy and try not to isolate though. 

Ooh for horrible news, the liquor store closes at 10 not 7 as I originally believed. But the cravings have kind of passed. 

Also. For other horrible news I’m talking to one of the guys and wow I do not dig him. I honestly think this is our first time talking when I’ve been sober. His mom told me he’s in love with me. Ive always told him I didn’t want anything remotely resembling serious. What a mess. Also he was drinking on the phone and the one who told me about the liquor store closing later. 

Okay I’d like to remind myself back to Sunday. When I absolutely gave myself alcohol poisoning after going through three bottles of vodka in as many days. 

How much more productive I was today just by not drinking yesterday. Sunday I literally did not get out of bed. 

How my life is falling apart from every direction and I feel like I’m drowning.

That I haven’t hit rock bottom yet. But ooh I’m close. I still have a home, supportive family, friends (who might all drink so I don’t know about that..). I am blessed. I’d love to remember what it feels like to remember that. 

I don’t want to run or hide anymore. I want to be proud of myself again. I want to be a person who has drive and cares about helping others again. I’m so ashamed of who I’ve become and I don’t want to feel that way anymore. 

No liquor store tonight. 

So this meeting thing.. how will I know where to park? It’s at a   Presbyterian Church. Do you think there will be a bunch of cars in front of like one door? How on earth will I know what room it’s in? What if I accidentally walk into like a secret church thing? What if I’m the only one who goes to an Aa meeting on Valentine’s Day? I was going to get there 15 early and like scout the parking lot. But it’s not like church people and aa people look that different I can’t imagine.

I’ve got a high ACE score, poor regulation skills, PTSD, and chronic depression and anxiety. In the past five years or so though, I’ve come to an understanding of the trouble alcohol has caused in my life and have tried to start healing the wounds that I used to drown in whiskey.

I’m newly (3 weeks) sober, and noticed I’ve questioned my romantic relationship a LOT since. Wondering if I’m with the wrong person, wanting to “change” my gf, feeling more sensitive & inpatient than before. We have our differences, ex she’s more cynical about people & I’m the optimist, but she’s willing to work on our relationship & supports my sobriety amazingly. Can’t tell if this is sober clarity or sober craziness! 

I’m not looking for advice persay, only time will tell. But I’m curious as to whether y’all felt this way in early sobriety and how it eventually panned out?

Whenever I drink it seems like a coin toss if I can regulate myself. Well, this weekend I lost the coin toss and I just said every little thought that popped into my head, of course at full volume. I said a couple of things that made people really uncomfortable, and I shared one thing that somebody had said about their SO in the past. It wasn’t anything bad, just a something they said in passing when venting about a communication mishap. Sober me would have realized there was NO reason to share that, but drunk me needs to say every single thought that enters my head. Foot. In. Mouth. 


I want to bang my head against a wall. I see these people every single day. I’m so afraid I came off as too touchy or flirty. I think I really pissed off one girl, and my boyfriend keeps saying he’s not mad at me. But I keep playing this up in my head.


When I drink, 50% of the time the next day I wish I could take it all back. But when I stay sober that night, I never regret my decision.

Rationalizing each night with an “I’ll start tomorrow, I deserve this.” mindset and downing about a third of a vodka bottle each night. Guess what? Tomorrow comes and then it’s pushed off for tomorrow’s tomorrow. Three weeks later I find myself cleaning my room and placing about 8 empty 750mL bottles of Tito’s into the bottom of a trashbag so my roommate doesn’t see them. I can feel my body reeling from the detox effects, and I want so badly to be drunk tonight and binge hot wings and fries. But I’m trying to focus on the positives. I have a gym class at 5am tomorrow that I don’t want to be hungover at. The inflammation that drinking causes leaves me bloated and gasping for breath at the slightest exertion of energy (not to mention how much sweatier I get than everyone else in the class). The last time I quit drinking for a couple days my coworker said I looked like I was “glowing”. My appearance is something I’ve always struggled with and it was so nice of her to say that. I cannot ignore the correlation between her comment and not having gotten drunk for a few days before.

My personal life took a turn for the worst and I was using alcohol to cope. I knew it wouldn’t help in the long run, but it felt like it was helping in the moment. But I am wrong. Waking up at 2am dehydrated with a raging headache isn’t helping in the moment. Waking up to texts I don’t remember sending before I passed out isn’t helping in the moment. I do myself a disservice getting drunk. I think a lot of the times those of us with a hidden alcohol dependency rationalize it if we’re keeping it a secret and saying “if my loved ones don’t know, it doesn’t hurt them.” But what about yourself? Don’t you deserve to be happy and healthy?

I have had several (precious few) stints of sobriety between now and then (I am now 30) - these stints never lasted more than a week. 

When I was 20 years old I had my first panic attack. I can’t remember for certain but I seem to recall it happened the morning after a night of heavy drinking. I was driving on the interstate when it happened and it was absolutely terrifying - I thought I was having a heart attack or dying, hands were sweating and shaking too bad to properly grasp the steering wheel, tunnel vision, the whole 9 yards. I wrenched the car across 3 lanes of traffic and almost hit another car in doing so trying to reach an off-ramp, then rode out the rest of it in a McDonald’s parking lot. I had to call my then-boyfriend to come meet me and drive my car home for me. 

As those who suffer from panic attacks are likely aware, the worst part about them is the fear or having another one and currently my worst fear is having one at work (I currently work from home in healthcare administration but my job requires me to talk on the phone all day and one of my most prominent symptoms when I have an attack is that my voice starts to shake/tremble badly). I currently have a small amount of a low-dose benzo that I take at work when this occurs but my prescription will run out in June and will not be renewed. I’m also still drinking - to the tune of a 6-pack a night typically.

During my earlier week-long sobriety stints in my mid-20s I noticed a marked improvement in my anxiety levels even after only several days alcohol-free. However, during my most recent alcohol-free week last year, I felt just as anxious as ever. Is my brain too broken to bounce back at 30 or something?

I’ve read in many posts on this sub that the first month of sobriety can be rife with anxiety. To those here who also suffer from anxiety (specifically panic attacks) and have experienced at least a month or two sober, did alcohol cessation improve your anxiety/frequency of panic attacks and how long did that take? Was anyone else taking benzos for panic attacks while drinking and were you able to stop taking them after you quit drinking? I want to quit drinking and I want off the benzos, but I’m deathly afraid of having recurring panic attacks at work and losing my job if the benzos are taken out of the picture (which they will be in June). 
 
I apologize for the rambling post but if anyone has found themselves in a similar predicament with booze, benzos, and panic disorder and emerged sober and with either reduced or eliminated panic attacks after quitting I would love to hear your story.

It is hard, considering I don't drink too much, maybe 5 litres of wine per day maximum. I know it is dangerous to withdraw alone, however I have done that the last 10 times I visited my mom.

Some background: My Dad (who died when I was only 18) was the worst alcoholic I have ever known, yet I was oblivious to that when young. I realized slowly and later on that what he did was wrong. Thinking about those times we were alone, times I cherished as me-and-dad-time. I constantly did shopping for him, he was in no shape. I'd even drive miles to find a store with his favorite liquor.

6 years later.
I am a raging alcoholic. I drink anoit 5-6 litres lf wine a day. Like my dad. My mom told me about the gravity of his drinking after the funeral.

My mom is also an alcoholic, she was phisically abusive and whatnot. She did therapy for half a year and stopped. Never drank since. She said she wanted to make up for the years she wasn't there. I admire her and she has my utmost respect. I wish I could quit drinking like her. 

Now, I can't function in my job without several litres of wine in me. I don't drink spirits, they fuck you up differently.

I don't want to be like my dad. I really dont. 

I decided to be done. 

I battled Meth addiction successfully. 
I can't get past booze.

But I wanna win this battle. I had countless detoxes, I won before. Those were tumultuos times but they ultimately were good. I don't know why I can't acknowledge I'm better off sober.

So last night was Super Bowl Sunday and I drank all day long while smoking some meat. I didn’t do anything crazy and nothing was really out of the ordinary. Everyone had a great time at the party we hosted. But today, around lunch I started getting the shakes pretty bad and after I started reading about the shakes, I got terrified and basically now understand that I’m definitely addicted to alcohol. 

You see yesterday wasn’t out of the ordinary because I drink every day. Every. Day. Like 5 or 6 or 7 drinks every day. As soon as 5:00 PM hits, I’m drinking and don’t stop until 11:00 PM or later sometimes. My drinking heavily intensified during the pandemic (like a lot of folks I’ve read about here) and it’s been like this for the past 2 years. I just want to stop. I have a great wife and 2 young kids relying on me, but I’m relying on alcohol. I’m super scared to admit to her that I have a problem (because on the outside it really doesn’t look like I do) and I’m honestly just petrified thinking about the first couple of nights without a drink if I’m already shaking this bad after just one day after moderately heavier (for me) drinking. 

What I’m curious about is how bad is it going to be? Can I do it without going in for special treatment? How can I stay motivated to stay off the sauce? Can I do this discretely? I still have work during the day and have to talk to people that are much more important than me in the corporate world. 

I’m more than likely writing this just to scream it into the void and letting myself know that I’ve come to this conclusion that I need to stop for the well being of myself and the example I need to set for my kids. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Is there a better day of the week to really start not drinking? Should I wane myself off by limiting myself to 5 beers, then 4, then 3 so I don’t freak out too bad or do I have to go cold Turkey like so many others on this sub. 

Would love to get some thoughts on this from someone that has successfully done this and tips on staying motived.

Maybe that’s made it all harder, I don’t know. I took a run-up to August and tried to quit cold-turkey. Moral of that story is this: if you can, do rehab. Do IOP. Do whatever but don’t try to do it alone. It’s not a willpower test. If you really wanna show your willpower swallow your pride and get help.

Been on and off the wagon probably fifty times since then. Seriously, one day at a time. Avoid big promises—even if you know you need to quit for good, just quit for today: otherwise you’re just putting yourself on a rollercoaster you don’t need. Concentrate on today, always.

It’s been over a month now of online meetings. Mostly RR, some RD, dabbled in a little AA. Some better than others—but I guess I’ve been lucky because the best therapists I’ve seen don’t hold a candle to the worst meetings. SD is a great support—but the faces and voices are so powerful. Find a good group… and it’s amazing. And with online meetings you can be just as anonymous as on here.

Trust the dinosaurs. Sometimes that’s all that’s kept me going. How many times does it take? As many times as it takes. Just keep showing up. They can’t all be lying—and they all say the same things, reliably. Have faith in that. Thousands of dinosaurs, in chorus, saying the same things—because they’re TRUE.

Threw out the last of my most recent relapse (kept 3 oz for mitigating the withdrawals). Been here before. Might be again. But I might not—sooner or later, it sticks. Just keep showing up for yourself.

In bed, feel like crap, but… tomorrow’s gonna be better. I know that. And I trust that… it could be the last time.",3,0

It wasn’t like the emotional withdrawal of quitting alcohol and because coffee isn’t actually destroying me I’ve transitioned to tapering down, something I don’t believe I could do with alcohol. 

To clarify, when I eliminated alcohol I soon realized that my coffee intake was too much and was contributing to continued high levels of anxiety (not nearly as debilitating as alcohol but fuck anxiety…). 

My coffee of choice is Folgers Instant so I got a jar of decaf and mixed half half reg and decaf. One cup of that mix in the morning and the rest of the day just decaf to satiate the desire for drinking coffee, which I do enjoy. 

So far so good. Anxiety is non existent. No headaches. Feel really calm and mellow after just 6 days. 

But the depression is present. I don’t know a solution to this as it ultimately stems from having a partner that I love more then life itself but I don’t believe is capable of being what I want and need from someone. And I’m not sure if that’s because of my drinking or just one of the (many) triggers I have. So fuck depression as well. (The depression is a continuous loop of me saying this “I want my wife. But she doesn’t want the same things as me. And even if she could, she physically can’t. So what’s the point.” Repeat….over and fucking over) 

Fuck alcohol. Fuck anxiety. Fuck depression.

I quit drinking a couple weeks ago, and it’s actually been fairly easy so far. I’ve had a few intrusive-style thoughts like “there’s the liquor store! Let’s stop!” that I’ve been able to easily banish. I haven’t had a real craving until today.

Valentine’s Day has always been a weakness for me. I’m a celebrator - I love to celebrate. Holidays, achievements both minor and big, nice weather, my cats birthday, anything. I’m sure you all are familiar with using any excuse to celebrate. Because celebrating means alcohol. I’m a romantic at heart, and vday is a favorite of mine, even though I’ve always been single. My plans have always been to drink a whole bottle of wine. That’s something I used to do multiple times a week, but I would always feel guilty about it. Valentines Day was an excuse not to feel guilty. “It’s fine to drink a whole bottle of wine - it’s expected. I’m single!” 

I don’t know what I’m gonna do tonight, or how I’m gonna celebrate. This is the first time since quitting I’m experiencing serious cravings, but I have a few weeks under my belt, and a better support system than I’ve had on previous attempts.

So I message both an apology, the college dude doesn't get back to me, I understand that, neither does the long time friend, that too I also get (maybe he just doesn't check Snapchat, or maybe its because I told him his aunt has cancer when his whole family kept it a secret from him, possibly, definitely)

Slowly I started to have a drink here and there during the week to the point my fiancée reminded me that I’m starting to drink daily again.

Well, here I am on Monday on day two of my hangover because I was away for a friends bachelor weekend. My stomach burned and hurt all day yesterday - never before had it been that bad. Barely ate, ruined my day again.

Alcohol isn’t worth being ruined for days after drinking. I’m tired of it and I’m tired of all the negative effects that comes with it. I look weathered, gained a ton of weight and feel like a broken old man. I’m 38.

So last night we went to Chili’s. My total was $14, but ordinarily there would have been $40-$50 in presidente margaritas. So I tipped the server that $50 I would have spent anyway.

This time I hung out with the quieter crowd that were mostly not drinking or drinking very little. I had a great time. Actually enjoyed the game, excellent conversation, appreciated food so much more than usual. The “fun crowd” was in the basement and would come up and talk to us occasionally. We all get quiet and politely nod while they rambled on or laughed at their own dumb jokes and when they left we’d go back to having a great time. I had no idea the quiet crowd was the place to be. I’m sure this won’t always be the case but I’ll know I’ll be searching out this group at parties from now on. Was honestly by far the most fun super bowl of my life.

While I am happy about that, I am struggling hard. Not with wanting to drink, but many other issues.

I found out in my 30's that I am autistic, and it has been one of the craziest things that has ever happened to me. I am starting over....AGAIN.... and my life could have been so different had I known sooner.

I am dealing with grief, I am seeing how my brain issues played a huge role in my addiction issues, and I am dealing with the world as an autistic person. I have to change literally everything.

It's a lot and I have to accept that I will never have the life I wanted. Having a long term relationship might not be in the cards for me and I have had to accept that I will probably not have children. I know that anything can happen, but I have to be realistic about what would be best for my life and fair to potential kids--- my heart is just broken.

This world is so intense and we all go through things that I will never understand---I also just can't do any spiritual stuff right now- I am bitter and jaded and the moment. So my view of the world and why we are here has also been ripped out from under me.

I am in a fucking free fall and I thought I would never have to go through a period like this again!

I know that's silly to say now...but I already did over ten years of therapy and everything you could imagine to ""fix"" myself...I supposedly did all the healing! It's a scam and life will always be hard no matter what. I put in over 10 years and an ungodly amount of money into doctors and therapists who didn't have a CLUE what they were talking about- and it's really hard to not be super bitter.

I also haven't been working out because of some random injuries and I think that is what is really just putting me over the edge right now.

I am so proud to have made it through three nights of partying without taking a single sip- and during one of the very few weekends of the year where it is socially acceptable to drink on a sunday night. This is the first weekend during the past four years where I haven’t blacked out and woken up sunday morning in an anxious mess trying to piece together what I did and who I need to apologize to. This weekend has helped me to see that being in college is not an excuse to put off getting sober. I can still have fun and participate in social events without drinking. Yes it was hard, yes I felt tempted and defeated at times, and yes I had to leave some events early to clear my head and walk it off- but I made it through.

Like so many here, I was a professional-level drinker from my late teens and had plenty of sad mornings where I would ring around to apologise to whoever I pissed off the night before. I dabbled with quitting for the last decade, but my hand was forced 4 months ago by long covid. I literally couldn't stomach a single drink without getting very ill. To be honest, it's been fantastic as I now feel physically better than I have in a long time. 

BUT ... I'm also experiencing a 'flatness' that I don't know how to get out of. Not depression really - just the feeling of ""Is this all there is for me now?"". Once the initial excitement and pride of quitting wore off, what was left felt really empty.

For my entire life, alcohol has equalled fun, celebration, release, relaxation and reward. Like all of you, my oldest friendships, including with my direct family, are built around drinking. Every lunch, dinner, birthday and sporting event has drinking at its core. I'm doing okay at navigating the inevitable push back from friends who question my decision, and the experience of being at gatherings where everyone is drunk and I'm not. But i can't shake this constant sense of dread that I'm never going to have any fun again. That I'll never laugh like I did before, or connect with people in that way that only loose, drunk idiots can. 

My wife asked me where I wanted to go for my birthday and I didn't really care because all of my favourite places are built around drinking - tequila at the favourite Mexican, Retsina wine at the Greek place. I'm about to land a big win at work and I'm not that excited because I can't use it as an excuse to go for a 10 hour boozey lunch. I have a friend's wedding coming up and I'm dreading it because I don't know how to celebrate without drinking.

I assume this is a common problem but I don't know what to do about it. How long do people get stuck in this rut? Is it akin to being a dry drunk? How do people who stop find their mojo again? How do they have fun and look forward to things? 

Any recommendations on books, podcasts or magic spells in the comments will be greatly appreciated - thanks.",17,1

I do have chronic anxiety/depression and am on medication for it. I've been hiding my relapse from my significant other. I'm very surprised I haven't gotten caught yet. Hiding it gives me sort of a thrill and makes me feel in control, even though I know logically that that feeling is a lie. I know that it's alcohol that is controlling me and that it's detrimental to my mental health.

2020 graduated college, student athlete. 

Right after I graduated I went into a depressive state and began to numb myself with alcohol. I stayed physically active but wasn’t the best version of myself. Constantly moody, agitated, annoyed, and all of my relationships suffered. Addiction and alcoholism run throughout both sides of my family, multiple people have passed away because of it. 

Fast forward to January 13th, 2022. 

My auntie allowed me to stay at her house (by myself because my family had COVID), and that was the last day I drank. 
I drank a bottle of wine and woke up the next day with the worst hang over ever. I looked in the mirror, as shitty as I felt and asked myself is this really what I want to do? So I decided to stop. This is the longest I have gone without drinking and I feel grateful. I still struggle with anxiety, but this is a good first step. To all those out there going through it, just know you can do it. It’s all a matter of choice, and prioritizing your well-being over immediate gratification. If you want to talk about it, let me know.

We may be a world apart, but  we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding  what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily  commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to  inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender  or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a  sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*.  It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes  impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person  can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again.  And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not  drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that  they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and  participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at  /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed  introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.  You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

How lucky am I? Hosting the DCI on St. Valentine’s Day!  Actually  it’s a little confusing to try to understand which Saint Valentine the  day is named for. But did you know that Medieval England’s own Geoffrey  Chaucer is credited with linking the tradition of courtly love with the  celebration of St. Valentine’s feast day? His poem “Parliament of  Foules,” written in 1375, refers to February 14 as the day birds and  humans come together to find a mate. Love is in the air today!

And as long as your host is an English major, this bit of weirdness: 

A language trend of the last few years has us responding in  conversation with “I love that you . . .” Examples include statements  such as, “I love that you bought those shoes,” or “I love that you were  finally able to confront X.” Now, the linguists might opine that this  is a soft, non-committal way of expressing feeling.  That is, instead of expressing  love for the person, we express love only for the behavior.  But  if it’s not too syrupy to say one loves a bratwurst, or a color, or a  book, why not say we love each without the qualification?  

The first time someone outside my immediate family ever said, “I love  you” to me was at the end of a 12-step meeting. I shared that feeling,  too, and it seemed right to say it.

What to say now? I don’t want to embarrass anyone or make anyone feel  uncomfortable.  So I’ll just say this: I love being here, I love what  you say, and I love making a commitment every day to not drink with you,  which I am doing right now.  Happy Valentine’s Day.",406,0

I’m constantly uneasy. I’m tired all the time. I’m fearful about whether I’ve already messed up too much with my new job to save it, even though I’m trying, and I’ve gotten reassurance from my supervisor that I’m doing ok… but I’m constantly insecure about it, and I know part of that may be kind of a dysphoria withdrawal side effect, but I’m also not sure my fears are totally irrational. I’m fearful about the future. I don’t find much joy in anything. 

I quit (again) 9 days ago because I was waking up with panic attacks every morning scared to death of the day of work in front of me, and the people I’d have to talk to and convince I knew what I was doing. I would wake up at five and hyperventilate for an hour before dragging myself out of bed. It got so bad I scared my pregnant girlfriend into sleeping in the other bedroom… and of course doing this to myself and her and our baby made me feel even worse and more anxious. I should be the rock right now. I shouldn’t be the one crying to her about the stresses of my job and my drinking.

Nine days ago I went to the ER because I didn’t know what else to do. It was a Saturday, so I didn’t have to work, and I was to afraid to miss more work going to an appointment mid-week. They tapered me on Librium for a few days and it did help a lot.

The acute sense of anxiety from the first few days has passed but I’m still frequently shook with anxiety, and I’m still uncertain if it’s too late to save my job. I’m worried about providing for my family.

The confusing part is I’ve been googling dysphoria, and I think I’ve been dealing with rejection sensitive dysphoria my entire life, even as a kid. I’ve always feared rejection. I’ve always been overly concerned of what other people think of me. I’ve always been afraid I’m failing or letting people down. I honestly think it’s part of what led to my drinking problem, because it allowed me to worry less… until it made it worse.

I’m hoping it will pass or at least minimize and get to a point where I can recognize it for what it is and gain some self-confidence… but I don’t know. I’m trying to get in with my psychiatrist, but it’s Kaiser and I don’t know how soon they can get me in. I just know I need to do something.

Anyway, I don’t really have a question. I just wanted to vent. IWNDWYT",13,0

I was meeting up with a good friend and a bunch of her friends and previous boss who now owns the restaurant we were at, for dinner, drinks and the game. I got there a little late because I opted to squeeze in the gym after having been in the car for 5 hours today because I was away visiting my mom this weekend, so some people were already several drinks in. 
Seeing people sloppy was enough for me to say nope, I’ll stick with club soda. The bar owners kept sending out free rounds of shots for our group and thoughtfully brought me one when he realized I got missed bc I had just gotten there. I said thanks so much for the offer but I’m all set with club soda. He said no worries, let me know if I can get you anything. 
Instead of kind of zoning out or over doing it, I was present the whole night, enjoyed catching up with my friend, met new people, hot dayum that halftime show was awesome, had some awesome food and at the end of the night the restaurant owner said since I wasn’t drinking, not to worry about my bill, that it was on the house! Plus, I just hopped in my car and drove home, and it was -17’C out, so waiting for an Uber with some of the others would’ve sucked! 
I’m all tucked into bed with my dog writing this, will wake-up fresh tomorrow (maybe a little tired cause it is passed my bed time lol), but no hangover and it was literally a free night out! So much fun too!

I'm currently 114 days sober, but this past week has been particularly difficult for me. I'm not sure what has brought on these recent bought of white knuckling, but It has me wondering if anyone could answer a few questions for me.

The first is the jealousy factor. As I'm sure most of us do. I find myself in social situations where the people around me are drinking. For the most part this is fine, but there are times where I experience an extreme amount of jealousy. I try not to let that bubble out in order to not make people uncomfortable, so I'll just wait until the moment is right and Irish goodbye. Does this get easier with time? Will I always have moments where I feel like this? 

The 2nd question I have is for those of us who like myself have a partner who drinks on a regular basis. When it's just us it doesn't bother me much. She likes tequila and doesn't often get drunk, but will have a drink or two a few nights a week after work. Which I feel like is what normal should be. (I can't do this. If I could stop at two I wouldn't be writing this now)

I hate tequila, so I don't get itchy about it ever. But there are times when my partner might go a bit hard and the sloppiness can get me going. Like, I just wish I could be on the same level. It makes me feel disconnected and I was curious if anyone had any tips on how to manage my feelings about this? 

I phrase it this way because I have a hesitation to ask her to quite with me because I don't feel like she has a problem and  this is my journey. So trying to bring her into it I feel could cause resentment down the line, and it's just not fair too her.

I had a moment today where I thought. If I have too feel this way for the rest of my life everytime I'm with people I'd rather just drink. Which I know is just the demon in the back of my skull playing it's tune.

Anyways, if you're reading this and feel like you might have some constructive input I'd like to hear it. So thanks in advance for taking the time.

Cheers,

I'm sitting on the couch at my mother’s house with a fractured clavicle and a stitched-up knee after coming off my bicycle while trying to ride home extremely intoxicated a few days ago. This experience feels like it has been one of many rock bottoms for me and most of them have ended up with me in the emergency department after trying to do something stupid (or normal) whilst drunk. However, it's given me a lot of time to reflect on the decisions I've made, and why I've been making them, that have led me to my current predicament. 

I've had to take time off work because I work a somewhat physically demanding job and I can't currently lift anything. I don't get sick pay or anything to make up for this due to the nature of my employment, which is frustrating but ultimately how I chose to be employed. I sometimes wonder if my work is partly to blame for some of my behaviour, not that I'm trying to shirk responsibility, but my workplace enables my drinking. I work in a liquor store that's attached to a pub (Australia, for reference), that's relatively boutique and we get a lot of samples at work. My boss will sometimes pour me a glass of wine while we're working or a beer which is relatively harmless but when there are samples lying around at night and I'm bored, I'll often indulge to make the night more interesting or go quicker. It's become less about tasting the samples and analysing them and more about drinking them to get a buzz and relieve boredom. I've been through stints of not drinking before, I normally do ""Dry July"", and my boss is supportive, but I find it difficult to maintain my sobriety in that environment. It's also stressful occasionally when there are thefts and people steal stuff or dealing with people not abiding by Covid safe practices and stress is a bit of a trigger for me when I'm at work because I know that I can just have a beer.

However, apart from all of that, I'm about to start a master’s degree and part of me knows that I won't be able to complete it if I don't stop drinking and improve my mental health to be able to manage the course load while working and looking after my dog. I've long known that I would never be able to reach a level of self fulfillment while indulging in alcohol but now that I'm taking the time to properly acknowledge that and accept it as a fact, I think that I will be able to live a sober life. I'll be checking in here frequently to read others' stories and to really get involved with the community, even if the time difference makes it hard.

I'm extremely fortunate and grateful that there was someone there who called an ambulance for me and who looked after my bike until I was able to collect it. I'm extremely grateful to my mother for basically collecting me and my dog to care for us while I mend up before I head back to work.

My spouse is seriously a God send because he just really understands how hard this is. I don’t think I’d have a chance of being sober if I were in a relationship with a drinker.

So...some crying, mental fighting, spousal support, two borrittos, two tacos and a brownie later...I’m laying in bed sober.

To preface, I believe we should be open and honest *with those that care and that we trust*. I think that’s a crucial step in recovery.

However, beyond that, never feel obligated to tell everyone your story or feel the need to provide an honest excuse behind your sobriety.

That one drama-fueled work colleague that asks why you’re not partaking in happy hour? Tell them you’re on meds.  A nosy extended relative who noticed you didn’t bring a case of beer to Christmas this year? Tell them you’re becoming a nun. That semi-annual neighborhood get together for beers? Pour a non-alcoholic beer into a glass and push through, or say you have a work obligation and can’t attend.

Obviously none of those solutions are ideal. I’m sure we’d all prefer to be able to just say “I don’t drink” without getting questioned for it. But unfortunately A.) we live in an alcohol-fueled society where sobriety isn’t the norm and B.) some people gossip. Sometimes it gets exhausting having to constantly explain/defend ourselves to people.

Realistically, it’s not really anyone’s business. And not everyone deserves the privilege of knowing your story, or to be included in the next chapter. 

If it helps you to share everything, more power to y’a.

Do what protects you and works for your journey, and leave the rest behind.

Edit: This post is fairly personal to me since, while at a work event, I had told a gossipy work colleague that I don’t drink anymore (nothing more or less, literally just that). She took it upon herself to speculate the reasons why with all my other colleagues (apparently her reasoning ranged from I was pregnant to I was about to check into rehab). Luckily my colleagues know she’s a gossip-hound, so they let me know what was going on. But since then, I’ve learned to protect this part of me fiercely and not allow other to create false narratives about my choices.",245,0

Something different is happening this time though. After about two weeks sober I started feeling exhausted all day. Like on the verge of passing out type tired. This eventually escalated in to exhaustion with some anxiety mixed in. Soon, it was all out depression/anxiety/exhaustion. REAL bad. 

This blindsided me. I’ve had anxiety before and days of feeling depressed but this has been full blown and I can barely function. I never expected to feel like this especially after every other time I quit it’s felt amazing. 

I was a binge drinker (not daily) and drinking always made me feel sort of manic. It was clear my drinking was giving my brain some big ass shots of dopamine. Now without those, it feels like my brain is just off and it needs time to rebalance. 

I fully plan on getting through this. I know my brain can heal and rebalance. I’ve also reached out to some therapists to help me on my way. If this isn’t the time where it finally clicks for me once and for all, I don’t know what will be.

'I must not drink.

Alcohol is the mind killer.

It is a little pleasure that brings total obliteration.

I will face my urge to drink.

I will permit it to pass over me and through me.

And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.

Where the urge has gone there will be nothing.

Only I will remain.'

I’m posting this as a reminder to myself and as a marker of sorts. My blood sugar has been elevated and my doctor told me to cut back on drinking. Psychiatric nurse today told me if I’m feeling  depressed I *need* to stop drinking, because it’s a depressant, depleting my gaba and serotonin levels. My fiance and I got into a fight last night about alcohol. We just had a long talk, and I explained to him that I cannot moderate. He’s like “have a glass or two of wine, not the whole bottle” but it’s like…..I physically can’t. And we agreed (not that it’s his decision, just his support means a lot) that it’s best if I just cut it out of my life. He said “you’re a great person, an even greater mother, and mentally you’re stronger than you think you are”. And dude it meant the world to me to know I’m not gonna struggle thru this alone and that the person closest to me believes in me. I know there will be temptations and the FOMO feelings occasionally, but I want to move on with my life so badly. I’m ready for this! 💪🏽",8,0

2292,2022-02-13 14:33:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/srquey/two_weeks_in/,Two Weeks In,"I officially haven’t had a drink in two weeks. Two whole weeks. 14 nights of sober sleep. This is the longest I’ve been sober since a 6 week sober period I had around November 2018.

**The benefits?**

**I love going to bed sober.** Snuggled up in bed at 7pm, watching a TV show and remembering the plot, the names of the characters and thoroughly enjoying the entire experience.

**I love waking up sober.** No regret, no anxiety, no waking up at 3am with a racing heart and struggling to sleep. Even if I wake up at 5.30 in the morning, I am good to go for the day.

**I’ve finished a novel.** I don’t think I’ve read an entire book - from start to finish - in almost a year. Reading while drunk consisted of mindlessly scrolling on the Internet, which of course I still do and enjoy, but finishing an entire novel in a couple of days was truly rewarding.

**My skin is looking a whole lot better.** I’m managing my skincare properly and my skin looks a lot better, too. I actually have the discipline to do my skincare every night and every morning, which is something I’ve always enjoyed doing as a form of selfcare, but something that has gone out the window the past 6 months heavily drinking.

**I’m constantly hydrated.** No more amber urine in the morning - gross - but I’m sure every drinker has experienced this. After I’d woken up with a hangover, I drank a few cups of water and thought I’d really performed some quality self love by the time my urine was clear, but I am magically hydrated all day now.

**My anxiety has reduced significantly.** As a disclaimer, I am taking SSRIs and have done so for the past 7 months which have also helped quite drastically, however my entire body feels a lot calmer. The residual stress inside my body from the constant poison, fear and worry brought on by alcohol is slowly depleting. I still have ways to go with this, but I’m only two weeks in.

**Everything just feels so much easier.** Managing my work, relationships, my household, my pets, bills and commitments. These things feel so much easier with the extra time I have to dedicated to these important aspects of my life; without the background noise of alcohol induced anxiety, days of hangover recovery or hours spent getting obliterated.

**The challenges?**

**Withdrawals.** I’ll be honest that my withdrawals weren’t too debilitating. For reference, I am 26 years old and I was drinking around 44 standard drinks per week. I am quite surprised that the only real “withdrawal” I felt was struggling to get sleep the first couple of nights, followed by a fuzzy headed feeling for around a week. I’ve also been slightly fatigued for a short period, but only slightly.

**The mental game.** I think this is my biggest challenge and it’s not really even current, only a “future” anxiety. I am due to vacation to a tropical part of my country in two weeks. I have never, ever been sober on a vacation. It’s usually time to let loose, drink as much as I want and lay in bed hungover. So this week-long vacation represents a true challenge in mind; especially since it’s so early on in my journey.

**The questions.** ""can I really be sober forever?"", ""wont one beer at the airport help with the pre-flight nerves?"", ""am I really going to be that person who can't have a beer/wine/champagne to celebrate life's most precious moments?"", ""am I missing out on something special by choosing to abstain?"". Of course, this is simply my alcohol addicted brain playing tricks, but the questions are certainly there.

In many ways, the sobriety almost feels too good. I’m scared I’ll start to feel so good and think “hey, why can’t I just have one beer or glass of wine with dinner?”, and well, I think we all know how that pans out.

As I come into the next couple of weeks, and then my vacation, I foresee my largest challenge being the mental one. I need to keep reminding myself of the positive benefits, which is largely why I’ve posted these here, this post represents something that I can come back to and cement the positives in my mind.

I am excited to see how I progress and I’ll continue to post my updates here.

Watching the change in my bathroom habits has been one of the more fascinating aspects of cutting back.

I never got to the bleeding stage but it couldn't have been far off.

And now, as I accumulate more days of sobriety (even with intermittent lapses) it's been wonderful to see a very tangible (er, let's just call it visible OK? ""tangible"" would imply touching it…) improvement in my health. I'm still not back to normal, per se, but I'm seeing lots of small changes for the better.

Just because something ”feels good” doesn’t mean that it’s good if you think of it rationally. What the thing is matters more than the feeling.

An example of that is bipolar disorder. The mania they experience is basically just dopamine being too high, the subconscious mind then thinks that something is interesting and the result is manic behaviour towards something.

Raising dopamine with alcohol is a manic state, the mania is directed into more alcohol, emotions overrun rational thinking and too much money is spent and all sorts of messes are made.

Mania is not a good thing, others treat it with medicine, while others cause it intentionally and screw up their life in constant dipsomania.",16,0

I’ve been blacking out from drinking somewhat regularly for the last 15 years. The hangxiety that follows from being sure I made a complete ass out of myself or pissed people off is what gets to me. Not to mention how terrible I’m being to my body and brain, and how unsafe it is to be blacked out and bar hopping around town. I’m usually fairly quiet and anxious in social situations, but when I drink (too much) I get loud and overly confident and honestly probably pretty annoying, and I just feel so much embarrassment after. Over the last 3 years I’ve been going through this cycle of blacking out, and either thinking I’m finally going to learn how to moderate, or deciding I’m not ever going to drink again and actually thinking I will go through with it, and then folding as soon as I’m offered a drink. Part of the problem is I keep thinking I can moderate. I’m not a daily drinker, I spend most of my time alone and I don’t drink alone, so it’s easy for me to go without for a week or two here and there. Sometimes I’ll be successful for a while and just have a drink or two and call it a night, but I always end up blacking out again at some point and ending up right back here. I think the other problem is I’m making the decision quietly without telling anyone, so there’s no accountability.

I’m also just looking for advice on how to navigate this and stories from anyone who’s been here on how you finally stopped drinking. Thanks!",13,0

I don't want to keep spending thousands of dollars every year funding this addiction. 
I've drank every day since I moved out at 18, I'm only 24 but I need to break this cycle now. It's embarrassing and fills me with anxiety that I may be in a situation where I do not have access or it is inappropriate to drink someplace. That I'll need to sneak a 6 pack of tall boys or a pint of whiskey to help me sleep.

 I keep telling myself it's not that much, but it is and it's everyday. I keep telling myself I can keep it under control, but I can't. I quit hard drugs 2 years ago and I thought that was enough, but it's not. When I was quitting those I thought I needed the alcohol to keep my mind off of them, but now i realize I've just replaced my addiction with another. 

I told myself I didn't want to be controlled by forcing myself not to drink, but myself and my addiction convinced me that being controlled by drink was better than being controlled by not letting myself drink, if that makes any sense. I thought I needed alcohol to have fun, to be social and to make friends. I've made more friends and been more social in the last 3 months when I was  sober than I have in the last 6 years. 

My father drank everyday, and it killed him. Everyone in my family excluding my mother does too and it's become so normalized I really never saw it as that much of an issue, and since I'm young I'm given a pass. I've met a wonderful woman and I don't want to lose her to this bullshit, to my bullshit. I've wanted to stop for a long time, but this is that last thing I need to help me get over it.

I am realizing that I am a problem drinker, probably an alcoholic. I know it's not as much as others but I can easily do maybe 24-30 beers a week. I only like to do my old habits when I'm drinking because it makes them more fun, and sometimes I have cravings. I go one or two days without drinking then drink again. Been like this for maybe 1.5 years (thank fuck I can't stand liquor, lol)

Trouble is I really quite like the taste of beer. I'd like to cut back or just straight up stop and use NA beer to help ... but it is pretty expensive and I can't justify the cost of it for just the taste. I don't mind spending $10, $15 on a sixer of alcoholic beer because I know I will get drunk. Is NA beer even worth it - can it make cravings worse? Are there some decent affordable options out there?

I've also heard Kava and bubbly water are decent alternatives. I am a vaper so I think part of it is related to oral fixation. On days I don't drink, I drink a shit load of water. Have any of you tried these strategies in the early days of abstinence? 

I also tried using Delta-8 to help curb that ""dont wanna be sober"" feeling (in my teens I used marijuana very often; I have an addictive personality) which worked great for a while but now my tolerance for that is so high I don't even feel it.

Craft beer has been my long term excuse to drink daily. For whatever reason, it helped me justify the fact that I drink every single day. Pretending to be a beer connoisseur and support local breweries put on the facade that it’s a hobby, not an addiction. The problem is, I don’t just sip on and enjoy a beer. No. It turns into a four pack of high content beer. Or a variety twelve pack from a favorite local brewery. Or both. Nightly. 

It’s become such a considerable part of my life since reaching legal drinking age about 10 years ago. Not to even mention the binge drinking in my younger years. I guess that should’ve been a warning to myself but I missed that boat.

Over the years, it’s led to embarrassing blackouts, painfully hungover days, drained bank accounts, high credit usage, weight gain, poor mental health, and bad relationships. I quit cannabis over a month ago which was a good step towards being in control of my life again but realizing now this is a bigger and more important step albeit more difficult. Fortunately, another Reddit group helped keep me accountable for quitting smoking. I’m joining this community in hopes that it will help me reach the same outcome. 

Putting this into writing is difficult but helps solidify my conclusion that I need to change. I don’t expect anyone here to personally hold my accountable by any means but by me taking the time to post this it will help motivate me to stick to my words and thoughts and just move forward.

So, as I said in the subject, IWNDWYT. Or tomorrow. Or the day after. 

I’m done.

And I'm glad that I did tell the bf at the start that I don't want wine etc. in the house, so I didn't have to act excited about that part or have any awkwardness.

Top vodka off with a beer or drink some vodka after finishing wine.
It has had a substantial effect on my body. I often have upset stomach, my stool is very liquid and weird color. Either very dark or very light. I’m 42 years old, but I look much older and like somebody who has not slept for a week.

Little while ago, my 6 y/o kid found me passed out on the living-room floor on top of my work documents. That has been the final straw, I have never been so ashamed, he will always remember what he saw. He thought I had died.
So, I have given up alcohol.

I’m looking for suggestions, that what could help my body to start recovering from the abuse I have put it through. I know, my gut from the inside is probably very messed up. My liver is larger than normal etc.

The problem is that even if I did somehow deserve it, it would then turn into at minimum 2 days of drinking or a week or more.

Looking for the good…,"Some days I see it clear as could be with much hope, and other days I can’t get out of the shithole. 19yo M on day 26

The positive, good days: I know and understand my disease very well, I know I have a very tough time with control of my drinks and what happens when I consume. The skirting of death, arrest, and the guilt, anger, and shame that follows. I know and understand my daily life habits of working and than going home and doing absolutely nothing have to change. On these days, I see the light, I have to conquer the negative thoughts that come to mind not just in ways when it comes to alcohol, but in other ways as well. I tell myself I need to do something to make myself proud, to push away the person that has been controlling my entire life. I need to workout and run BECAUSE i don’t want to, for the person I am tells me the opposite of what i should and shouldn’t do. I want to prove myself wrong, i want to prove everyone around me wrong, i want to unleash the inner hood that I have yet to commence. On days like these, I can make it happen. I attend meetings and read on my disease and it makes me feel better knowing that others have the same daily struggle, and how I do need to conquer the negative thoughts with the tools I have.

The negative/ bad days:
Here I am, 19 years old. Everyone my age is out getting fucked up all the time, and i see it constantly thanks to social media. They are out having fun without a goddamn care in the world, their boosted, boozed egos go a long way. It gets them talking to girls, it gets them having fun unleashing that inner confidence to do whatever the fuck they want. and here I am, constantly battling that. I don’t go to college (thank fuck) however it really has its downs. I work in a trade, I am never around people my age at all whatsoever, i’m with 50 year old dudes all day who talk about getting fucked up around me all the time telling me how much they miss getting fucked up at my age and all the fun they had. Than, my only release ever is going to meetings, more 30-50 year old people who found out later in life of their problems. 

I constantly feel like an outcast, wherever I go. I can’t relate to anybody who has tried to put themselves through this at my age while in a constant environment of drugs and alcohol. The only way I ever fit in was when I was drinking, and with kids my age. I’m dying, wrapped in anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, and find it so fucking hard to function in social environments, no confidence, low self esteem, and find myself highlighting everything I say and beating myself up for it afterwards.

I find myself with 2 options and one pertains to me better than most. I could try to be lonely and work on myself hanging out with older sober alcoholics on fridays that I feel an outcast to, and work/hope towards finding my inner confidence and self esteem without alcohol being a part of my life.

Or, I could be a fucking kid and enjoy myself and my life with everyone else my age, not a care in the world, not a constant mental battle against myself (just occasionally) and hopefully find that moderation I am looking for. To make mistakes and learn, and have fun. To feel included like I so want to be.

It’s taken me a long time to admit that to myself and actually write that sentence— to a subreddit of all places. But I do have a problem. In the past 2-3 years, I’ve gone 100 days or so without drinking a few times. I always feel better, sleep better, and lose weight. And I think, “I’m so much better now. I can safely have a drink or two every so often.” 

And just like that….

…one drink every so often becomes two a day and then two a day becomes a six-pack a day. The six pack becomes as many drinks as it takes for me to pass out. And soon my wife starts questioning how much I’m drinking. And  I say “you’re right. I need to cut back. I’ll only have a couple or so.” And then I go off “running errands” when really I’m buying tall boys of beer to augment the beer at home because I “limit myself”. And then I’m hiding beer outside and having a quick drink when I’m outside “doing yard work”.  

You see, It’s a problem. 

However, I always had an instant justification whoever  I let myself contemplate how much I’m drinking. I’d always think,” hey..I’m not doing so bad. What’s a six pack of beer a night compared to my father who downs 2 bottles of rum a day? I’m mean compared to that I’m just a moderate drinker, right?“ 

But I know in my heart I’m not a moderate drinker. I can’t moderate. That ship sailed years ago and the funny thing is I never saw it depart. 

I’ve been lurking on this sub and it’s great knowing I’m not the only one. 

So I’m going to go in a different direction, and I’ll just start saying no to that first drink (that becomes 10).

I get to be the person that remembers everything, like the wedding with wedding crashers and how everyone reacted. I get to eat all the food and not regret its combination with whatever I drank. I get to dance sober, which is way more fun and carefree than drunk dancing. And the best part, I wake up without a hangover. Without a doubt, weddings are now my favorite, former drinking event.

Don’t get me wrong, that shit was FUN. I can honestly say that it was never a bad time for me. The next day though, today, dear god would I be a wreck. With most of my calories coming from beer and thirty to forty miles on my legs, today and maybe even tomorrow would be dedicated to hydrating and nourishing my beleaguered body. 

I used to think that there would be a day I would win this race. With my prodigious beer chugging capacity and reckless speed, it may have happened one day. Looking back on it now, what a silly goal that was. 

Being able to ride forty miles, chug 10-15 beers during the race, and at least 5-10 more after was not an indication of skill or badassery or whatever I used to think it was. A woman my size who can put away 15-20 beers and not fall off my bike into a snowdrift to freeze to death isn’t someone with healthy relationship to alcohol.

Just want to say all of you have helped me more than you know during my almost 15 months without a drink, and I finally have a story to share.

This morning, I woke up and walked into the living room, where my daughter ran up to me and insisted I pick her up. I squatted down to pick her up, which is when all the squats I did last night came back to haunt my quads. “Ooh, I may have gone a little too hard with the kettlebells last night.”

My son replied from across the room, “Yeah, that sounds like you.” I almost cried.

You see, I’ve heard “That sounds like you” many times in my life, and it’s been almost universally negative. I drank too much, I did/said something stupid, I can’t remember anything past X event. “Yep, that sounds like you.” And it did. Far too often, and for far too long, that sounded like me. I’d even said it about myself when people told me stories of what I’d done the night before. That was me. I thought it always would be.

Up until a year ago, I never worked out. Too sad, too drunk, too hungover, too many empty booze calories for it to make a difference. But I decided quitting drinking was as good a reason as any to get in shape. I started bodyweight workouts (shoutout r/bodyweightfitness) three times a week before getting some kettlebells for Christmas and falling in love. I’ve been hard at it ever since, working out religiously and getting in the best shape of my life. So to hear “that sounds like you” in the context of exercise, vs. the way I’ve always heard it, was a shock. *Does* that sound like me? Is that who I am?

Yes. Yes it is. I’ve changed. It’s possible. And I’d much rather be known as the guy who pushes it a little too hard in a workout than the guy who drinks too much and has to be told the next day exactly how his night went.

It’s Super Bowl Sunday. I’m going to air fry some chicken wings, pound at least a 12-pack of Topo Chico, and actually watch and enjoy the game with my family. And also probably work out again, because that sounds like me. But, most importantly, IWNDWYT.

I endeavored to never yell at her like that again. I wanted to be a better father. I knew the only way to definitively stop it was to stop drinking. So I did. I stopped for 16 months. 

I remember why I started again. I was so depressed that year. I was suffering from an undiagnosed dysthymia and was in the midst of a double depression. Life was *painful.* I was so upset the second year seemed even harder than the first. So I drank again.

I immediately made an ass of myself. But I didn't quit. I wanted to feel like I was normal. I didn't want to miss out on the ""fun"" drinkers were having. Nevermind that I drank the night before Hamilton and was so hungover I could barely enjoy the show.

Why did I think that would be fun? I was 35. I had then and have now a good job. I have two beautiful boys. What more could I need?

 Good afternoon. 
 Our keynote is “Honesty“. 
 Today’s Meditation and Prayer never mention the word “persistence”, but it is the heart of their message.
 We are warned against giving up when things appear hopeless. This is critical in my life. I believe the most lethal weapon in the arsenal of my alcoholic ego is  convincing me that there is no longer any use in trying. It tells me I am so far off track there is no longer a next right stitch.
 That is a lie. There is always a next right thing to do, even in the middle of robbing a bank! I can’t get far enough from God’s will that the Divine Spark is inaccessible.
 In both the spiritual and material realms, my most ultimately successful endeavors have frequently, at some point, felt completely hopeless.
 Human weakness and failure are part of God’s will, and persistently returning to the right action, in spite of them, leads to The Magic!

I view it as a poison I never want to ingest ever again because it only takes things without giving anything valuable back to me. I don't really have cravings and I don't often think about the option of drinking again.
What absolutely scares me though are the stories of people who went years and years or even decades without drinking and fall back into their addiction after such a long time. 
What led me into drinking in the first place was me having no direction in life and feeling hopeless without any ambitions. I am scared of scenarios in the future I may or may not have control over, which could lead to a similar situation. Tragedies, big financial or social problems, failing in general.
And I already feel side effects of this fear of mine. I am often uneasy and restless because in my head everything needs to be perfect in order to avoid failing. While this mindset has its benefits because i am more productive, it is also stressful and always tied to this irrational fear of losing the ground under my feet again. I also catch myself thinking about all the things that are not done yet instead of being proud of the things I managed to do.

I am always trying to progress and make myself better. A bad habit I have is often having several beers after a stressful day at work (this is most days), which I’m trying to understand and correct. On the contrary, I often don’t crave alcohol on the weekend, but may take a few drinks socially even though I don’t have that strong crave to drink like I do during the week. I was curious if this had to do with stress and caffeine. During the week, I often start working at 5AM and may go until 8-9PM, looking at numbers on a screen all day. After running around all day, the craving for a crispy tall boy is strong. I ONLY crave beer. Not booze. Not wine. Nothing else. I don’t necessarily see a problem with this, but I find that when I have a drink early in the week, I will want to keep drinking each successive night until I’ve become so sick of booze that I eventually get hungover, probably from sleeping badly and being over tired. This usually hits me by Saturday AM. What can I do to cut this mid week craving? I have no problem drinking starting say Thursday night, but the Tuesday, Wednesday etc. that needs to stop. I’m usually too tired to work out. How do you wind down at the end of a hard day without booze? Do I need to replace the routine with something else? I find watching tv simply too passive and boring.

""Whenever you get an impression of some pleasure, as with any impression guard yourself from being carried away by it, let it await your action, give yourself a pause.

Then compare to those the joy and satisfaction you'd feel for abstaining altogether. However, if a seemingly appropriate time arises to act on it, don't be overcome by its comfort, pleasantness, and allure- but against all of this, how much better the consciousness of conquering it.""

Several times over the last hour and a half I thought I would have drank through this.  And then what?  I would’ve been hung over telling my kids tomorrow?  Absolutely not.  Life is painful but I am not going to hide from it.  I loved Molly so much and she has a piece of my heart with her.

Thank you, SD, for all of your love and support. ❤️❤️❤️🌈",34,0

I have a niggling resentment for a friend's sobriety. She's been ""sober"" for nearly 10 months, although she's occasionally had the odd drink (I'd say a couple glasses of wine over 4/5 occasions) and celebrates being sober. It really bothers me as I'm an alcoholic and don't have the privilege of enjoying drinks. I get that people have their own version of sobriety, but whenever she brings it up I always want to point out that she's broken sobriety on many occasions but don't want to start a war. For substance, she's the type that does everything incredibly - she'll learn a language if she's visiting another country, she'll take up a hobby and take it to professional levels. I admire her to bits, but as an alcoholic I don't see it fair for her to have this. Is this just typical resentment I need to block out and let her do her thing? Maybe I should tell her alone that it bothers me and it would bother other alcoholics struggling with sobriety? I'm at a loose end.

Anyway, I turned 100 days sober on Friday and went out for the first time. It was really good and I'm so glad and happy I've turned my life around. I won't drink with you today!",22,0

It's funny. I don't think about booze anymore. Not in the sense of drinking it anyways. I've become hyper-aware of how often booze is marketed, advertised, and basically shoved down our thoats.

I still haven't sworn that I'll never drink again. I may well do so in future. I may not. Time will only tell. 

All I know right now is the thought of an alcoholic drink makes me feel nauseated. I cannot imagine anything worse. Let alone the hangover. 

I've been fortunate and haven't lost any friends in the process. Hell, I even ended up at an acquaintance's home post-party on Friday night. The host's were listing everything they had to drink, then looked at me and rattled off everything non-alcoholic as if it were the most normal thing on earth. 

Cheers to all of you on the wagon. Thanks for the support in getting me this far.

I love all of you strangers.

I used to think of myself as a “grey area drinker” - in that I don’t have a rock bottom but I also don’t just drink a few times a year. I drink almost daily, usually a glass of wine a night. But, then I realize that my  “much needed” evening glass of wine (or two or three) (or 5 or 6…) is not a grey area - its an addiction.

I’ve always had a complicated relationship with alcohol. Like many I suffer from anxiety and depression, and alcohol has always been the way to mask that. In college I wouldn’t drink at all until the weekend, and then it would be a black out binge drinking. After college I worked in art non-profits, they sustained that alcohol dependent mentality. We drank lots at company meetings. Events were booze parties. After leaving my non-profit life, I went into a factory job, and found myself limiting everything to a beer max per night. Working on your feet for 11 hours makes being hungover quite unappealing.

Then in 2019 I entered grad school, then the pandemic hit, and I found myself drinking heavily, more than 5-7 drinks a night, itching for a drink by noon. I realized this was unsustainable, I went sober for a month, then returned to drinking a “normal” (not) amount. But still, 2 glasses of wine each night takes a major toll on the body. Higher blood pressure, weight gain, bags around the eyes, acne, wrinkles, the list goes on. Not to mention the way alcohol affects my depression and ADHD. I can’t teach at 9am if I’m hungover from one glass of wine. 

Now I’m on some new medication, and drinking alcohol is a big no-no. They do NOT mix well. But quitting is hard. I knew I had to stop, but I didn’t. I couldn’t bring myself to. I had a glass of wine every night this week. But they made me feel like crap.  Even after one glass of wine, I felt like I was black out drunk. 

Last night for Shabbat (the jewish sabbath), I poured myself a glass of wine. Only halfway through it I realized how unsustainable it is. I had to lay down I was so dizzy, and I told my partner “this is it, I can’t do this anymore.” It was then and there that I realized it was time to do this for real and be sober. 

I told my partner. Now I’m telling strangers on the internet because I need to feel accountable. I know it’s a problem, not just for my physical health but for my mental health.
There’s alcohol in the house, but it’s not mine anymore. Just like there’s lots of food in the house that isn’t mine that I can’t eat (my partner’s, my roommate’s, my dog’s lol).
I know this is an uphill battle and I don’t know if I can do it alone. I’m working towards finding a support group (and have some sober friends), and reading people’s posts on here has really helped me see a light outside of this narrow tunnel of drinking myself to an early grave.

Short-and-sweet, but very-very true.

I consciously decided to abstain from alcohol this weekend, and I am going to try and abstain for as long as I possibly can.
I attended a soccer game yesterday in a game that was regarded as a must-win game, without drinking. Which I would consider as a rarity and the atmosphere and performance were second-to-none. 
I thoroughly enjoyed it, it was a special day. I honestly think that I would not have enjoyed it half as much if I had been drinking. The emotional aspect of it all still seems vivid, which would be different as alcohol renders you emotionally numb.

I'm 36 and I wondering how long I will live in terms of my lifespan.

We may be a world apart, but  we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding  what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily  commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to  inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender  or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a  sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*.  It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes  impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person  can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again.  And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not  drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that  they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and  participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at  /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed  introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.  You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I’m Wilbursmall, and I am overwhelmed with gratitude that I am hosting the DCI this week!

I am a female and a senior citizen.  I’ve been blessed, but always a  corner of my psyche has had to deal with needing too much of something,  whether it was food, alcohol, work, shopping, dependency, or something  else.  With retirement, I came to realize that alcohol was the thing I was fixed upon—I couldn’t get through an hour without looking forward  to and planning and visioning a glass of wine or a couple shots of  brandy.  And you know the drill—it never stopped at that. Finally, on  February 2, 2021, I spent a day without any alcohol, and got through  it—and every day since, but only with the help of this wonderful SD  support group. Reading your stories has been the true blessing of my  last few years.

Today, February 13, 2021, somewhere around 117 million people will go  crazy watching a football game taking place in Los Angeles. Among the players, there  will be individuals called heroes, or most valuable players, or stars.  And one player may be said to have saved the day. And while I know it’s  important to recognize great individual efforts, I try to remember that  football is, after all, a team sport.  I’m not exactly NFL material, but  I feel the same about stopping drinking: I have to do it for myself,  every day, but I have a team with me every minute of every day. That’s  you, and I will not drink with you today.",359,0

My husband went on a vacation with his brother and I stayed home to manage my shop (plus health and finances). Since most of my memories of life without him revolve around trauma and alcohol, I was really nervous to be on my own again. I’ve just been convinced that I’m just no good on my own. That if I’m left to my own devices, my boredom will lead me into trouble. That without his accountability, I would slip back into old habits. 
You’d think he was gone for like, a year. Nope. Five days. FIVE DAYS. Count em: one two three four five. That’s it! 
And here I am on day three, still sober, properly medicated, fed, watered, and washed. 
I sure as hell didn’t do it alone, though. I swear, I’ve told EVERYONE: “I think I’m terrible on my own, and I don’t WANT to fuck up.” And you know what? They all helped! I’ve never experienced that before, and I must say…it’s kind of amazing. No judgement, no lectures, no guilt tripping or threats. Just, you know, help. 
I always thought I’d have to do things by myself, PERFECTLY, in order for me to start trusting myself again. Turns out I was wrong: you build off the small victories to bigger and bigger ones with less and less help.

Bot is on break, let's pretend that's my excuse.  I've been on a whole journey the last month and I'm starting to understand the pink cloud argument.  When you're at your highest, it's easy to hit your lowest.

I met someone a month ago.  Still sober and honestly it's the first time I've entered a situationship as such in 10 years.  I'm not even that old, I just started young.  I thought it would be so difficult, but we hit it off like weirdly well.  We spent 12+ hours together the first date and I really, really felt something.

Fast forward a few weeks, we've been on multiple fantastic dates.  I thought we were really getting somewhere.  He wont talk to me.  I mean he will, but he thinks I used him for physical reasons and I dont even want to get into that mess.  It's been less than a month and I'm heartbroken over someone I've barely met.

On top of this fiasco, I've been finally getting my own place after 3 years of crutching on people.  It was such a mess to get everything sorted, but I finally got my keys on Thursday night, got other things sorted Friday and this morning my sister stopped by for some things aswell.

I drank from Thursday night all until today.  I've been on the phone with my ex for more hours than I can count and sent countless messages I regret.  Everything was falling into place and now I'm just falling into the same routine after 6 almost 7 months sober.

I have to be up in about 6 hrs for work and I hate everything right now.  I should be feeling good, accomplished.  Even when I drink, I get things done.  I hate that I'm functional, the come down is horrendous and I hide it so well, it just eats me up.

I'm sorry for ranting.  I was doing so well and I think hopefully I've left enough context for anyone to leave some encouragement.  I dont like how I am right now.  I'm sober again, I just feel like I have some internal mending to do.",2,0

Today I am down to 190 lbs.  I just got my blood test results from my liver tests this week: **EVERYTHING IS NORMAL**.  Like, holy fuck, I can't even process this right now.  Don't get me wrong though, I'm not normal.  I still have cirrhosis and it is like having this awful sword dangling above my head 24/7.  But 15 moths ago I was given a snowball's chance in hell of living, and somehow I managed to cling to life in a hospital.  Once I got out, I decided I was never ever going to put myself back in that position from drinking again.  It was horrific to watch my wife's face as she visited me in the hospital every day and every doctor and nurse were saying that I didn't have very good odds.  I'm still devastated I put her in the position to make the medical decision to stop treatment because I wasn't going to make it and I wasn't conscious enough to make that decision on my own.  It's crazy that one year ago from now I could barely walk up a flight of stairs.  I walked 5 miles today just being an active adult.  I sincerely appreciate life more right now since I got so close to losing it.

I really hope everyone out there who may read this can take a piece of advice if you are struggling with sobriety.  It is simply to leave no stone unturned in fighting this disease and fight it with everything you have.  Believe me, you do NOT want to go through what I went through.  My months in the hospital were worse than most people can possibly even imagine.  Thinking of drinking to me conjures up thoughts that are worse than death itself.  The pain was unimaginable at times. 

I got so incredibly lucky to live through what I did and to recover without a transplant.  But there's literally thousands of people who go through what I went through and don't live to tell the tale.  Do your future self a favor and not drink with me today.",403,0

Since then I’ve drank semi-regularly, but much less than when I was at my lowest point. I only told two people that I relapsed (one of which was my therapist). Because I only drink alone it is tempting to think I’m not hurting anyone else. I quit for the first time several years ago because it was hurting the people closest to me. Now it’s time for me to quit for ME. 

I’ve struggled with motivation to quit despite having so many reasons to. Even what would be “normal” amounts of alcohol for a non-alcoholic are very destructive given my current health issues which began during my sobriety. I’m tired of feeling ashamed and knowing I’m hurting myself.

The ""no alcohol"" part stuck, and just sort of became my lifestyle - I liked it so much I just decided not to go back to drinking, and have now since doubled my initial plan of not drinking for a year. I wouldn't say I necessarily had a full-blown problem before, but I didn't love my relationship with alcohol, and I'm glad I cut it out and don't see myself going back. 

The ""no men"" part, on the other hand, I broke about 10 months in. I started dating someone I met when I went back to school. It was my first serious relationship in over three years, and goddammit, I thought we were going to make it. We decided to move in together after eight months (we were inseparable, in between COVID/quarantine bubble and our school schedules), and we signed for an apartment last summer. In September, we talked about getting engaged, and he was browsing rings. I felt like I finally found someone who really got me, and who loved me and accepted me for me, and I felt the same about him. 

And then, over the last few months, things started to change. Living together changed things. We stopped communicating effectively, and it snowballed into relationship doubts, combined with the pressure of us both being in school and working full-time and in this super serious relationship where we were both living together too, and I guess it became too much for him.

I wanted to make it work, because I believed we were in an adjustment period, and that we would get past it - but then he told me he realized I wasn't ""the one,"" and that's not something we can really come back from. At least I can't.

So, after a year and a half, I lost my boyfriend and my apartment in one fell swoop. Neither of us drink, so I can't even blame it on that - and goddammit, I haven't wanted a drink this badly in I can't even tell you how long. But I know I need to sit with this, and grieve, and find the space to heal in a way that is safe and productive.

I haven’t had a real craving in probably 10-14 days. I had a good one today after aforementioned hike. I sat with it and gutted it out. It sucked for a good hour, but I made it.

Day 1 after a lapse for me, and on a Saturday. I had the ""So um, why is abstinence so important for this one night?"" loop going on in my head around 4:00. Frankly if I were alone, I probably would have given in. But I was at home, with my wife, so I told her what I was thinking. Initially she thought I was trying to plead with her for her permission, which isn't what I was going for; rather, just that I'm really annoyed at having to sit it out for the night, and it would make it a lot easier to say no if I could clearly remember why it's so important. Long-term downsides take a long time to play out, and it's hard to see them in the short term.

At least part of it was that the kids (ages 7, 5, and 1) were being overwhelmingly intense (they get bored on the weekends, and get very inventive about finding ways to misbehave), and I knew it would continue through the night. I was looking ahead to a tense and completely unenjoyable dinner. I thought about just asking my wife to take them to a restaurant, and leave me at home to just work through it… but I knew full well that if I did that, I'd be heading right down to the liquor store as soon as they left the driveway.

So I picked myself up and packed the kids in the car to go to dinner. We hadn't made reservations at the place we were planning to go, and they had a 3.5-hour wait, so we ended up going to a BBQ joint next door instead. Specifically, it's a BBQ joint with a great selection of beers, including some made in-house, along with an extensive whisky selection, and deals on whiskey/beer pairings. One of my favorite places to get smashed, in fact. Not a great place for me right now. I managed to have 7 large Diet Cokes while my wife had her 2 glasses of wine, and it was interesting how well it worked.

While I was there, I went from annoyed at having Diet Coke in my glass instead of beer, and at having 3 kids all screaming and pushing the table all over the place, to feeling sort of OK… and after awhile I kind of forgot that I wasn't drinking. It was fine. I got to actually *taste* some of this place's absolutely amazing cooking. And then after dinner, it felt rather nice to just be awake and aware. I don't even want to drink right now.

We're about to put the kids to bed, and after that my wife and I are going to enjoy a movie together. I'm thinking I might manage to stay awake for this one; if I do, it will be the first one in a long time. I'm hoping to hold on to the memory of how completely fine it can feel to be totally clear-headed, and to actually enjoy the time I'm spending with family.",8,0

It makes them even harder to stop. I thought I had to do it all at once or certainly fail. And each one has been getting worse.

With some advice from a therapist, I decided I’d set aside the quit all or nothing mentality, and just focus on one. She asked me which and just to answer without thinking. I said drinking. I thought I said it because it would be easiest, but maybe something in me knew it was the key.

Now, on the night of day 2 sober, I’m feeling the start of the clarity I need to get back control, perspective, and hope. As much as the withdraw sucks (hello anxiety attacks), I’m feeling like I can heal. That I can imagine it.

No plans with friends and too late to make them. I decided to treat myself to some take out at home and stop at BBQ joint on the way home from a long bike ride. I get there and the guy behind the counter takes my order and invites me to wait in the bar - makes sure to remind me that it’s craft beer week all over the city so it’s $2 off drafts, half off craft beer cans, and “by the way, same deal goes for take-home cans.” 

Old Me would have gotten a draft draft pint while I was waiting and a 6 of the highest ABV IPA they had to take home and get drunk off of while watching a movie. Would have woken up at 11, hung over, dehydrated, and feeling like shit. 

Instead New Me sat and looked at the beer list on the wall, then took my BBQ home, cracked a cold NA IPA and am bingeing a TV show while housing these ribs and brisket. Might still sleep in tomorrow if I choose to, but will wake up feeling healthy and properly sore from this ride today. I’ll wake up ready to take on Sunday and be productive, alert, energized and positive about life. 

The fact that it crossed my mind to go back to my old ways, and the ease with which I was able to just enjoy a sober night alone makes me feel like I’ve made it. I’m no longer held back by the compulsion to drink. I feel empowered, free, and just fucking great.

For those that are tempted - make a list of all the good things that come with sobriety and visit it in these moments. Sobriety is so damn worth it.

I have gained confidence I didn’t know I could have. I have more energy. I have attended 30 AA meetings, mostly local ones on Zoom. I have been mediating three times a day and have become a much better Buddhist. I’ve found a great support/help group for women in recovery of all kinds. And I’ve completely fallen in love with being a Dog Mom. Who knew? 

However, my health problems continue to get worse. The stress has caused flairs. If I were to drink now, it wouldn’t end well for me. And I’m very vulnerable. I’ve had many 30 + day stretches in the last several years, and they all end the same way. I’ve been running and homeless for years now, running from parents who used my vulnerabilities after my divorce to try and destroy me. And I’m facing not having a roof over my head; with my roommate dead and not being on the lease, I knew I had to leave soon. The apartment complex decided not to honor their original agreement to let me stay here while they legally end my roommate’s tenancy and they informed me in a traumatic (to me) way

There has been too much trauma in my life but with my sobriety and newfound confidence, I am ready to face it but I need massive help. I found (well, was recommended) a great program which will provide inpatient care and then transition me to sober housing. I can get the care I need while building my case for disability. Three serious autoimmune diseases have left me unable to work without massive accommodations, and while we may be able to stop the progression, the damage from the psoriatic arthritis has been extensive and debilitating to my back and neck especially. I am only 41; I need help dealing with this too.

My stuff (of which a lot was my roommate’s) is all in storage. What I’m not keeping will be set outside to find new homes in this struggling community. My dog - his dog - will be going to friends a few states away until I can get back on my feet.  And Monday morning I begin treatment for trauma and addiction. I drank because my traumatic brain couldn’t function normally and the addicted brain could keep it in that state. I don’t need either anymore. 

So that’s my Saturday night update, fellow Sobernauts. Thanks for all your support and I’ll be back to posting soon enough.",5,1
2422,2022-02-12 22:06:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/sr8kjb/the_4_big_scary_words/,"The 4 big, scary words.","I was on a ski trip this past weekend when I had an(other) incident of getting blackout drunk and ended up shattering the glass I was drinking from, crying/yelling at my partner, then passing out (resulting in him having to carry me to bed). I woke up in the morning with puffy eyes, crippling anxiety and violently intrusive thoughts of self-hatred and guilt.

I thought to myself, *“do I have a problem?”*

Deep down, I knew I did. I was still in denial that I was struggling, though, because I was highly functional. I regularly binge drank on the weekends and would sneak in a drink or two during a weekday, yet I still managed to perform well at my fancy corporate job, keep the apartment clean, go on runs, read books, and cook/eat healthily all while dealing with long-standing anxiety issues. Needless to say, I am not your stereotypical image of someone with alcohol problems.

My partner came back to the room after avoiding me all morning at a coffee shop and eventually let me know that if I did something like that again, he would want to take a break. In the last four years, he has never brought up the desire to split. Knowing he is the love of my life who I have many-a-time discussed marriage and family plans with, it absolutely shattered me. After all those times of saying “I’ll be better, I just had one too many this time” and thinking I had another chance to make things right, this time hit differently.

*“Should I tell him?”*

I thought of all the times he was sad and hurt when I would drink and turn into someone he no longer knew, and yet he would remain patient and calm, never yelling or laying a hand on me. The constant disappointment that would loom from his words when he would tell me the next morning how he wants me to take better care of myself. How he would never call me an alcoholic nor restrict me from alcohol, because I would have a streak of “good” weeks and when I had a bad one, I’d tell him “I was just so stressed about work” or “I was sad about \_\_\_” and he would continue to believe in me. I'm really lucky to have a partner as patient and understanding as he is, but how could he truly know I feel that way about him if my actions kept giving off the message that I don't care about his feelings, advice, or concerns?

*“Maybe I can fix this after all. I’m not as out of control as I used to be...”*

I thought of all the times my family and friends also had to deal with my drunken, disastrous self. I remembered I had been doing this for far too long, beyond the 4 years with my current partner. I ruined my last relationship because of it, but I didn’t really register it like that because he was toxic in his own way - so I used that to cover up my side of the wrongdoings. I’ve embarrassed myself countless times, made an infinite number of terrible decisions against my body and my safety, and have suffered scary and sometimes traumatizing consequences as a result of my drinking. I’ve hurt my sister, made my mother cry, and both physically and emotionally pushed my father away when I was blackout drunk, and yet they all love me and and have forgiven me. But who knows for how long that forgiveness would last. After all, my steadfast partner was showing strong signs of doubt.

*“I need to say it.”*

After 7 years of spiraling, denying, lying, and trying to fix things on my own, the four big, scary words came out, this time—out loud:

“I am an alcoholic.”

I sobbed as I explained the obsessive and intrusive thoughts about alcohol I had hidden from him. I told him that I didn’t want to face this for so long because it would just be another thing on my plate to add to how “fucked up” I am. I told him everything. And I apologized for everything. He listened attentively before hugging me and saying, “thank you for telling me. I love you.”

So I am on day 4 of sobriety now. I truly feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Literally the moment I said it. It was hard as **hell**, but once it was out—what a relief. I told my parents, sister, and best friend what I had told my partner. Firstly, because I needed to before the devil on my shoulder convinced me not to, but mostly because I knew it was what I had to do to get the help I needed. They all responded so kindly that I cried (again), but it was a good cry I had been needing to let out. What seemed so scary and hard suddenly doesn’t anymore now that my loved ones know. I don't know where this issue stems from - genetics, self-groomed, or whatever - but that doesn't matter. My system is simply wired in a way that does not guarantee responsible alcohol consumption 100% of the time and I just have to face that fact. But I don’t have to face it alone, and when I fall into temptation my loved ones will be there to hold me accountable. Most importantly, I feel ready to be free. To live the life I’m meant to live and to regain the time, energy, health, and money I have lost. It’s not going to be easy but I can face it one day at a time, especially knowing each day is another day I am no longer hurting those I love. And that is what I will do.

I ended up getting arrested and put into drug court and juvenile detention at 13, and probation had me clean for a little bit (I was still doing pills and drinking when I could because it didn’t really show up on my drug tests, but it slowed me down). When I was 17, I got pregnant with my son and got completely clean for the nine month span, but it was completely for him and not for me at all. 

After his birth I smoked weed daily, binge drank pretty often, smoked cigarettes (which turned into vaping about three years ago), and did a few other things on and off. Drinking made me occasionally very violent towards others and myself. It made me sick and tired. It made my PCOS 100x worse because the poison was messing up my hormones even more than they  already were.

A month ago I started attending celebrate recovery at a church in my city full of absolutely amazing people and I’m now celebrating my first complete month sober since I had my son! I even quit vaping :)

I personally don’t have a problem being around other people that are drinking, but it feels weird sometimes being in an environment where the main focus is drinking.

Is there like a level of alcoholism someone has to have experienced before going? 

In October 2020, my partner and I completely stopped drinking. We didn't drink daily but we would binge pretty regularly prior to that. After a particularly bad night of drinking we decided not to for a while and kept each other accountable on that. 

Recently she's expressed that she finds herself craving a drink really bad in the evenings and I suggested she try going to to a support group like AA but she mentioned feeling like she wasn't truly an alcoholic since we had always kept it to weekends and it hadn't interfered with work. I countered that it had interfered with friends and her personal life generally at points and that once she started drinking she (and I) found it hard to stop. 

So I just thought I'd ask for others experiences with AA and whether meetings have been open to folks with mild-moderate alcohol issues too.",18,0

I’ve been having a really hard time with my sobriety lately. Going through a divorce, moving out of my home, not seeing my daughter every morning or kissing her goodnight every night. Life did a 180 in the span of a week. Shits really tough. 

But I’m fucking sober. And I’m going to remain sober. Like a lot of you here, This isn’t the first traumatic experience I’ve gone through, but it is the first one since I was 14 that I’ve gone through sober. Genuinely, from the bottom of my soul, fighting the urge to drink every single moment of every single day for the last 4 weeks…… and winning…… feels as good to my soul as my current circumstances feel bad. It’s truly as heroic as I think I’ve ever felt. That momentum makes the next moment easier. 

So. To anyone of you beautiful fighters going through a hard time, I’m with you. It sucks. It hurts. It feels fuckin empty and scary and lonely. I lost a part of my identity. But I promise, whatever you’re going through, It’ll suck a hell of a lot more if We wake up tomorrow morning hungover and ashamed that we gave up on the fight. 

Good little tidbit of love I received from a very close, 23 year sober friend: “ you gotta learn to live life on life’s terms. Not your terms. Not boozes’ terms. Life’s terms. This is your opportunity to really learn how to do that”.

A big motivation for me to go to AA was because my best friend wanted nothing to do with me anymore, and my bottom was this. Not the fact that I was baker acted for a failed suicide attempt, my bottom at the time was just the loneliness. 

This January I played a gig at a bar. By this point I had stopped going to meetings during December, and so I thought “fuck it, I’ll just have one beer.” Then I learned the venue was going to pick up my tab, so obviously one beer turned into 8 and I kept going the whole night. That one night was enough to trigger many more drunk nights, and it ended with me drinking wine at 7am last Wednesday, and then later that night me screaming and freaking out that I would be arrested for something I had done earlier, while my friend held me down while I was kicking a wooden table and bleeding from my toes, screaming I’ll kill myself “for real this time.” I was back in AA the next day. 

This past week I went to as many meetings as I could. I got a sponsor, I’m feeling better..
Now I’m just plain angry. Angry that I have to surround myself with alcoholics all the time. Pissed that I have to go to fucking meetings all the time, while the theme is pounded into my head that many people don’t make it. Pissed that I’m 27, and that maybe I haven’t really learned my lesson yet. 

I just walked out of a speaker meeting tonight because I was feeling so angry. 

I don’t want to drink. I know where it leads to. I know when the drinking gets bad I also think about suicide when I’m drunk. But for now, I’m very irritable. And something about going to AA meetings lately puts me in a really bad mood.

I always ran to it when I had a bad day, to celebrate a good day, because I was bored, because it was available at social gatherings, because it was a rainy day outside and I had nothing better to do, whatever. 

&#x200B;

I met my now-ex about 3 years ago. It was fairy tale type shit. We loved each other so much and so deeply. One night we went out to the bars and I got drunk. I insisted I was fine and I could drive us home. She said absolutely not, you already have a DUI from a few years ago and it's not safe. I got belligerent and rude with her in the parking lot and she ended up calling all of us an uber. That was our first fight. I woke up ashamed and embarrassed. So guess what I did? You guessed it. Over time we had occasional fights and disagreements. Over more time I started to convince myself that I didn't deserve her. She is the sweetest most loving person I had ever met, always looking out for me and trying to do things for me and for us, and all she wanted in return was to be appreciated. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to our last few months... I got my dream job with a small company and they are very laid back. We have a full bar in the kitchen area and it was pretty usual that around 4 we'd all start having cocktails together. From there I would go home and because I started at work I HAD to keep going. I would have a couple white claws, bottle or two of wine, maybe a couple shots, when I had vodka at home a handle of that would last maybe three days, whatever I felt like before it was time for bed. That became my nightly routine...To sit outside and drink all night. As a result when she came home from work I was either too drunk and silly to have a serious conversation with her about her day, hadn't done any of my duties around the house, was too broke to help with grocery bills because I spent it all on wine, didn't want to take the time to talk to her about her problems, could only focus on my own, and worst of all, I projected my problems and insecurities on her. We would fight and she would become so upset because this wasn't working but I didn't see that. All I saw was someone yelling at me and I was just trying to run and self medicate and have a good time and didn't want to hear it. One time when we fought I told her she was a bitch, a cunt, I degraded her job, I ultimately made her feel worthless. Eventually she had enough. We broke up. 

&#x200B;

She stayed at her moms for a week and I convinced her to come back and that I would change. I didn't change. I knew deep down how much I cared for her and loved her and the guilt and feeling that I didn't deserve her piled on, so I keep going and drinking and if anything things were worse than before. She asked me to AT LEAST try to cut back, and banned liquor in the house. This of course was taken as an affront and not a desperate plea to stay together. I kept drinking. I ignored her, and a couple weeks later she sat me down and said ""I can't do this anymore, we need to break up."" 

&#x200B;

That was about 2.5 weeks ago. I have been an emotional mess since. I moved out of our place together super fast and left her place as clean as possible, left her flowers among other things and a long heartfelt note and explanation. Explained that I was going to work on becoming completely sober and that deep down I'm still the person she fell in love with but I've got some work to do and that I would give her some time to heal and hoped to hear from her if she was ever ready to AT LEAST be friends. 

&#x200B;

I have no idea if she'll ever want to see me again right now. But our breakup was very civil at least. 

&#x200B;

But right now I am on day two of no alcohol. Day one sucked but today I woke up and immediately wanted a glass of wine. I've been thinking about it all day. I'm already an anxious person to begin with, but feel like my anxiety has gone through the roof and I am starting to feel a bit hopeless. I've had a few panic attacks each day recently, but I think that's more just because I have cut down the last week to just one or two drinks before going to nothing. So I don't know how much of that if any is alcohol withdrawal or just the fact that I now have to face all these emotions and demons sober.

Yes, obviously I want to get sober and for her to come back. That's a huge motivator. But also it took losing her to fully admit to myself that this is real, I have a problem, and I know I need to do it for my own mental health, overall health, and clearly I have no balance and need to get it under control. I feel like the best way to do that is to stop completely. I'm also starting to see it as my enemy, all alcohol has ever done is make me lose interest in things I love doing, and lose people that I love so dearly. 

&#x200B;

So I want to ask... What mental effects can I expect as my body craves it? As my brain chemicals change? How did you do it, what helped you? How long might these cravings last? What was your experience?

This can be something that is incredibly useful if I’m looking for a specific set of tweezers after accidentally stepping in glass the night before. What we aren’t talking about is the detrimental side of this specific advertising for those suffering with addiction.

I became acutely aware of these advertising techniques when I came to the conclusion that alcohol was something I needed to abstain from as I had an unhealthy relationship with it. Funnily enough, as I reduced my spending on alcoholic products, I found the adverts I was receiving were suddenly all based around alcohol. Understanding the effects of confirmation bias, I reviewed my settings to try and limit the types of adverts I received. Funnily enough, there is no function to turn off a certain type of advertisement. So, regardless of good intent, I was now being bombarded with the latest deal on the cheapest form of liquor. I was being shown endless adverts of how fun and carefree everyone can be if they just buy this 6-pack of surgery alcoholic drinks. The images of people who engaged in drinking were care-free, showing them relaxing by the ocean as they sipped on daiquiris or Pina coladas. There was elements of sophistication for the more extreme liquors - dry martini’s, whiskey on the rocks. It was glamourised and it was sexy to drink. There was no mention of the poor sleep, immense hangovers, disruption to your cortisol levels, imbalances of your gut microbiomes, weight gain and all the other awful things alcohol does to your health and wellbeing. These adverts made it look like alcohol was the fucking best thing that had happened to society. And the worst part? I can’t restrict it. Hours that would normally be spent drinking wine that I was trying to redirect all of a sudden had a boom in alcohol related adverts. Apps that can deliver to your house - it’s never been so convenient to drink!

In a philosophical view, I became acutely aware that I was the product. The data showed that I was a consumer who gave this industry an immense amount of money that they were now risking losing. So they upped the ante with their adverts to lure me back in.

I guess I write this with the intention of highlighting how end-stage capitalism profits off of addicts, and how it is designed to keep you there regardless of the effects it may be having on your life. There needs to be consideration of the way we sell harmful products to people.",10,0
2454,2022-02-12 18:37:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/sr4gqh/its_time_to_stop/,It’s time to stop,"I started drinking when I was 14 and curbed a nasty habit where I would drink in school to get through the day. I wouldn’t do it all the time which was good-ish but the fact still remained that sometimes I’d be hammered during English class or laying in grass during lunch to feel the sun on my face. 
I never really told anyone at first. I didn’t want to be judged or treated any differently, but as time went by my friends would ask why the liquid in my juice bottle didn’t match completely (Rookie mistake). 
They would tell me years later that whenever I carried a juice bottle instead of my regular water bottle they assumed I was drinking. They thought I was hardcore and probably little bit nuts that I would casually be getting drunk during p.e. They were only right about 50% of the time though. 


I remember one day senior year where a bunch of us skipped class to go hangout. The people who knew me but weren’t close friends were surprised to see me. They all thought I was too innocent to do anything “bad” like skip school. By the end of the day they found out just how “bad” and “wild” I really was (lol). 


University rolled around the corner and my drinking had only increased tenfold. Clubbing every weekend, all weekend long, going to parties any chance I got. It was madness and I loved it. Things took a turn when I started doing drugs on a regular basis. Just like with alcohol I didn’t know when to stop but unfortunately unlike alcohol, drugs weren’t going to play nice. Eventually I fell and I fell hard. It made me do a whole 180 on drugs. I would still do them but only a select few, a minimal dose, and only once in a while. It made me realize that my drinking was a even bigger problem.


People started telling me but not outwardly telling me if you know what I mean that I drink too much years ago but I always pushed it off because I didn’t think I had a problem. I thought in order to be an alcoholic you had to be drinking everyday to get drunk. I wasn’t doing that so in my mind I was in the clear. You don’t need to drink every day to be considered an alcoholic. I would go weeks without drinking to prove that I wasn’t “addicted” but I was. I have a problem controlling how much I drink in one sitting. For the first time in my life I decided to slow it down a little and drink less. I was doing better for a little while. Still drank but I didn’t get drunk all the time and would go to party sober. I considered it a step in the right direction. 


And then the pandemic happened and much like everyone else it left me reeling. I wasn’t going to school in person anymore, I couldn’t party, couldn’t do anything. 


I spiralled out of control. I started getting drunk almost everyday, smoking so much weed all the time, putting myself in risky situations,etc. It was the worst my drinking has ever been. 


A year ago I got my first ever hangover. It was an eye opener. It made me realize how bad everything had gotten again and I drank a little less here and there. About 9-10 months ago I had an accident. I found out the hard way why you don’t drink when you have a head injury. It put me fully off of alcohol for a while but when I did drink I never got more than tipsy (save for a few special occasions). I’ve been doing it like that since. 


I went to a party last night and I got hammered for the first time since nye. I woke up with a hangover this morning and while it wasn’t my worst one by far but I didn’t enjoy it. 


I love drinking I really do (slushie drinks own a piece of my heart) but it’s a toxic relationship. I don’t know when to stop sometimes. I have serious medical conditions now and the fact still remains that I shouldn’t even be drinking in the first place. I could die. 


I don’t know if I want to quit completely yet but I know I need a break so I can build a healthier outlook and be able to say: no, one drink is enough, whenever I want.

I just feel like the only things I want to do are sit at home, go to work, go to the gym and get early nights! 

I used to love being around a load of people I don't know that well (most of the parties are my housemate's friends as most of mine don't live in the same city) and would always have a really good time, but since I've stopped drinking I just don't enjoy it at all.

A huge trigger for me is micromanaging coworkers and I have one on my team who was having a week of it. I just have a lot of trouble not taking certain comments personally like what if I really AM fucking everything up and what if everyone else thinks so too and just aren't telling me? I was also running on sleep dep for a lot of it. In the old days, that would have made this a harder-than-normal drinking week for me as well. Easiest way to shut up that voice.

Today work was busy, but the coworker I struggle with wasn't there. And I was able to breathe and be reminded that the ONLY DIFFERENCE is them not being there - so all my Bad Feels this week are just about my reaction to that person, not about how anyone else feels about my work or about the actual quality of my work. It's all in my head about letting them get to me. Doesn't change the feelings in the moment, but feelings aren't always right. I wasn't hungover and stuck in such a bad headspace that it lingered into a day that actually went well.

Came home and when the bf ran out for groceries he also picked up dinner and got me flowers (he is not a flower giving person). I did NOT get cranky with him at home this week which I absolutely would have if I was drinking, even if I'd tried not to, so I was able to come home to a good relationship and good vibes. 

I also mostly got my personal stuff done this week instead of stewing over my drinks, so I can feel good about heading into my weekend on top of things (well, as much as I ever am, lol) instead of already running behind.

Not-drinking doesn't solve everything. I will still have shitty weeks. And sometimes shitty coworkers. But not-drinking is the base that lets me keep the majority of my life on track, so when bad weeks happen I can recover instead of sinking even deeper. I don't have to end a shitty week with even more shit to shovel through, I can end it on a better note than it started bc the rest of my shit is pretty well in order.

And that is some valuable shit.

Yes I drink a lot, but it’s not affecting me. I’m failing at work because I have a bad memory. I’m irritable and forgetful at home because I’m not sleeping well or it’s been a long day at work, not because I haven’t drank in a couple hours or even a couple days. 

I’m not an alcoholic, my life isn’t in shambles. I didn’t get fired for drinking at work, hell I beat the system by making drinking my work!

It's a friend's birthday today, she asked if I wanted to go out for drinks with friends. This was the first domino. On my way home, I started to feel depressed and anxious. I then began to justify going out for beers. After all, I have beaten my previous streak (only by one day lol) of sobriety that I achieved after doing dry January last year. All I wanted was some time out of my mind. Not a relaxing drink, I wanted to get hammered to the point where I would forget that I am anxious, or that I am sad. 

I then thought about the logistics of the situation. If I drank now, I couldn't have wine as i would drink it too quickly (it's now been 42 days since I've had a drink) and be too drunk before I arrived. I could order in some nose beers? No, I have commitments tomorrow, meeting other friends. Okay, well I could just get some drinks in. Two bottles of wine? No, three to be 'safe'. 

I then made a deal with myself. I can go back and get drinks, but I'll go home first and eat. I did so, had a catch up call with a friend and then watched some TV. I scrolled through this subreddit. My craving subsided and I felt fine again. 

This has been by far the closest I've been to having a drink this calendar year. I've found that it's all well and good considering what you would do when craving when comfortable in sobriety, but it's a different kettle of fish when in the midst of it.

I‘ve always been someone who enjoys alcohol.  People know I’m usually the guy who’s always up for a party, but even more than that.  If there was a new bar opening, I had tickets.  I’d always know which restaurants had the best wine lists, I can make a killer Manhattan.  Long story short, it was a pretty big part of my life.

I’ve never been a daily drinker though.  I thought I was OK because my drinking would just be Friday or Saturday.  Hell even then I’d have a few beers and that was that, no harm done (I thought).  No my problem was binging.  Maybe a couple of times a year, I just lost all sense of control and would drink and drink until I couldn’t stand.  I’ve put myself in some really bad situations, and really inflicted myself on my partner and friends.  I’ve made my poor girlfriend pick me up from the floor too many times, even after my most recent episode needing a trip to the emergency room. 

I thought as I aged it would be something I grew out of, but as I sit here typing this out a few weeks short of my 30th, I just don’t think it is.  I always thought I could be a “moderate” drinker, but as I’ve recently and very painfully learned, even if it’s “just” that 1-50 time where I do lose control, it’s just not sustainable and this is no way to go on, not for myself and not for the people I care about.

I suspect I’ve already pushed our relationship past the point of no return.  Nothing hurts me as much as driving away the one I love, but that’s the effect alcohol has on me.  It takes away my rational decision making and sometimes I can’t control it.

If you’re still reading at this point, thanks and I apologise for taking up too much of your time.  I feel I’m at rock bottom with my relationship, I’ve hurt someone i care for more than anything, but the one positive I can take away from this, sometime I’ve really wish I could’ve said the other night.

I've known that my relationship with alcohol is toxic for years now, not even because of how much I drank and continue to drink, but because of the psychological grip it holds over me. I've struggled with an eating disorder for years, and while I wouldn't wish that anguish on anyone, it did give me the awareness to recognize the beginnings of an addiction because it unfolded in the exact same way - gradually using (or restricting) more frequently, the intrusive thoughts growing louder until they're constantly on the mind, finally getting to a point where the thought of changing behavior seems impossible.

I'd consider my consumption of alcohol to have hit a dangerous level for about a year or year and a half. That's where it got to the point of drinking just about every day (and feeling accomplished if I skipped a day) and knowing that I would need three or so drinks at least to do it for me. The thing is, I haven't had the type of low points that force a reckoning, and the fact that I can live as a high functioning alcoholic is the most insidious aspect of my illness. Sure I've had dark moments. Getting blackout drunk at a family New Years party in front of my parents and childhood friends, crying episodes in the hallways of college dorms I don't remember, even ending up in the hospital one night are among my greatest hits. Reading over those they certainly sound like lows, but I suppose they never really registered as such because they didn't seem to have a lasting impact on my life. I mostly drink alone, and in fact I've come to dislike drinking around other people because I'm afraid of not being able to control myself. It's easy to delude myself into seeing no consequences because I've structured my drinking to prey upon myself in isolation, first and foremost.  


I'm posting now because I'm fucking scared. Scared that it can only get worse, scared that I will permanently damage myself, scared that I'll reach a point where intervention is my only salvation because I know from my experience with anorexia that my family won't fucking step in. I've realized in recent months that I have been isolating more and more so that I could indulge in my addiction, even at the expense of losing time with my family and friends. I'm so tired of clandestinely disposing of my bottles, feeling like I have to go to different liquor shops so they don't recognize me as a regular, waking up and checking with trepidation how much lower that line on the bottle has fallen since the night before. So fucking tired.  


2022 has been better for me so far, mostly fueled by this fear. I've drunk less than half the days this year, but I'm going to have to do better. I know that any long term healing isn't going to be so simple as cutting alcohol out of my life. I need to find something healthy to take its place, which to me seems like the most daunting part of recovery. Not sure if anyone will even read through this long post, but I could really use advice on how fill the emptiness without alcohol. Hell if anything writing this has given me some clarity.

I’m getting right back on the train today though. Felt a little off leading up to 4 weeks and so this was just supposed to serve as a reminder. Definitely don’t try at home, but it reenforced my purpose for quitting for sure. Just hope I don’t have to go back a few spaces in my progress because of this. IWNDWYT ✌🏻",77,0

I know it was a Tuesday because my housekeeper was here. I'd gotten pretty good at matching her scheduling by that point. Tuesday was my recovery from the recovery day. I was never *that bad* on Tuesdays because on Monday I had sweated, shit, Youtubed, Postmated, and slept out the consequences of my 30-hour binge the weekend prior. No, Tuesday was a bit quieter as I tried to pull myself together for the start of my work week the following afternoon.

But what had started to happen is that my peaceful Tuesdays weren't so peaceful anymore. I'd fucked everything up about six weeks prior. That's when, on a Tuesday, I was still feeling the crushing waves of anxiety and guilt pouring from my waxy skin. I hadn't slept in about three full days and needed to crash to have any hope of being ready for work the next day. So, I theorized, what if I just had *a little more liquor?* I'd monitor it. I'd control it.

I had desperately tried to monitor it and had desperately failed to control it. And now it was Tuesday, and my housekeeper was here again. I had about an hour before she'd text me that I could come back in. It was now time for me to dawn my sandals and gym shorts and walk 400 feet to the Mountain View Safeway to buy the finest Smirnoff Ice SMASH tallboy the Silicon Valley had to offer. I preferred the Strawberry Lemonade tincture, but I had already purchased and drank all of those, so Peach + Mango + Dead Skunk would have to suffice. I would wear one of my larger face-cover masks again, so maybe the cute girl at the checkout wouldn't know it was me.

Or would I? I knew I was crashing. Some aspects of my life had already crashed. But it was hard to pinpoint which ones or by how hard. I wasn't speaking to my mom; she was still mad about the time she tried to call for my help on a Monday afternoon and I screamed at her while blackout drunk that I wasn't her bitch. Friends were all AWOL as well; I wasn't too sure why. Any potential girlfriend was long gone by this point. Work was…happening, but that was mostly due to me putting absolutely 100% of my sober energy into keeping it going. That didn't leave much time for anything else of value, short of vodka mixed with cheap juice or malt liquor brewed in cheap juice.

So I stood there, outside my apartment in the central lounging area. Actually, I paced. I weighed my options and ran through scenarios as specific as they were outlandish. Then the voice.

*No. This isn't working. It has to end now.*

Took about **Four Seconds**.

It really was a voice in my head. And that's verbatim what it said. And it spoke in italics just like that. It sounded kind of like my voice, but it wasn't me. I talk in my head all Goddamn day long no matter what, so for someone or something else to bust in and drop such a compelling argument left me no choice but to concede to their persuasive argument.

So I didn't leave my apartment building. I didn't walk to the Safeway, and I didn't buy cat urine mixed with tropical mango. I didn't hurriedly bring the cans home and chug them out of a brown bag so I could trash them outside just in time for my cleaner to leave. I didn't then go back to that same fucking Safeway four hours later to get, like, wine miniatures even though I hate wine. 

Nope. I just kinda paced there. Because I didn't know what else to do.

*Tue, Oct 12, 5:52 PM*

OK all clean Mattie thank you

—- 

I clearly remember the **Four Minutes** as soon as I got back into my apartment. I tend to be a man of action, and so I made two moves. The first was to round up the remnants of half-filled liquor bottles from my freezer + some bottle of Crown Royal I had for some reason, bag them, and then chuck them down the mystery garbage shoot to parts unknown. My cleaner had taken out the regular trash already, so I wouldn't have to worry about salvaging the bottom 4% of any days-old Bud Light Seltzer cans this time. I felt a great wave of relief as I valiantly yeeted my liquid demons to a far-off plane.

The second is I took an anti-convulsant so I wouldn't die. I had been given this medication many years before for a different ailment and tolerated it fine. I'd chatted with my substance abuse counselor about it, and she had said it was OK to try. I had tried it while in some alcohol withdrawal the week before and it…took the edge off? The worst aspects of my withdrawal are anxiety, restlessness, and insomnia. The med then had made those symptoms certainly not vanish but quiet down to the point that I could at least relax and fall asleep. But then I had woken up the next day and drank as much as ever. It was obvious that they were an escape hatch, not a panic room.

But knowing that I had them there helped a lot. I didn't know what would happen if I didn't drink, so having something to make that unknown seem less threatening was the final push I needed. I was feeling pretty damn bad, and the added stress of what I was finally attempting had me on the verge of panic. So, I hastily cut open the pill, poured the powder into a glass of water, and downed the whole thing.

And then that anti-convulsant didn't do a single Goddamn motherfucking Goddamn thing. For the next **Four Hours.**

I mean, I didn't convulse and am relatively certain I didn't die. But there was no removal of any edge whatsoever. I tried to be patient for it to kick in, but the test run that past week had provided relief in mere minutes. Instead, there I was, sweating through my shirt, wondering what the hell I was even doing.

A fun fact about me is that I have an unbelievable tolerance for misery. World-Class. A lot of it stems from my 20s, in which I faced unimaginable chronic pain and illness over several years. I began to compare my agony to a fire alarm that won't turn off. At first, it's so loud and jarring and it scares your cat. You hop up and panic and gotta escape, both because of the fire alarm and *because of the fire alarm.* It's actively designed to make you desperate to GTFO.

But have you ever, like, just kept sitting there during a fire alarm? It's still loud, and you still hate it. But the brain is fascinating, and somehow a blasting foghorn noise slowly but surely becomes inconvenient white noise to maneuver around. 

So that's where I was. All circuits of my mind and body blasting **BRAYNNK BRAYYNNK BRAYYNNK BRAYYNNK** *Attention, please exit the building via the emergency exits* **BRAYYNNK BRAYYNNK BRAYYNNK BRAYYNNK** 

My reaction was to download a stupid app on my phone. It's called *I am Sober.* It's OK but suffers from feature creep and a lack of sustainable freemium monetization strategy. But what I wanted it for was a time counter. I wasn't drinking now. You bet your ass I was checking in sober ASAP to start collecting my hours like a degenerate Pokemon trainer.

It asked me to set a sobriety time. Technically the last drink I had had was late Sunday night or early Monday morning before I passed out. I supposed I could put that and bank some hours, but even on the verge of psychosis due to mental anguish, I was like come on brah that's clown show who you trying to fool.

So I settled on 5PM that day. That's when, for the first time, I didn't drink when I would have had I not been sober. Because I was sober. I put in the info, and it regaled me with the fact that I had officially been sober for one hour, 17 minutes, and 43,44,45,46,47 sec-  

**BRAYYNNK BRAYYNNK BRAYYNNK BRAYYNNK** *Attention, what the fuck is wrong with you dipshit get the fuck over to Safeway it's fine you need to get some sleep for work tomorrow and then you can figure it out when you're thinking more clearly. You only have like three more months of work left you should do this once you have time off. Maybe with some Xanax or something because what you took isn't doing shit* **BRAYYNNK BRAYYNNK BRAYYNNK BRAYYNNK** 

But nah. Fuck that alarm. I had made a choice, and now I wasn't gonna drink. I believe I could replay that day over 1,000 times, and there's not one I break down and drink. It's just who I am. I had made a choice. I had set a dumb timer that now was at one hour and 19 minutes. It was on now. It was on now.

But I was still a damn junkie, so maybe I should take more of that anti-convulsant? Shit wasn't poisonous at 2x dose, I presumed. Maybe I just needed a bigger dose to make it work?

But even that seemed wrong. Maybe it was helping? I wasn't hallucinating, I think. And I had totally made it longer than this while not drinking before, pill or not. I was also exhausted but knew if I tried to sleep while it was light out, I would wake back up at like 1 AM and be up all night and feel just as bad. The Safeway sold liquor until 2 AM. I decided then and there that I would wait until 10 PM to take another one. If that still didn't help…

I took a couple of Tylenol as an OTC form of Antabuse. 

Now it was past 6:30. I suddenly remembered The San Francisco Giants game was on. They had won the NL West by one game over the hated Dodgers and led them two games to one in a best of five. A win tonight would send them to the NLCS. I found it startling how insanely much I had cared about this game just this morning but now could not possibly give less of a shit about sportsball. I turned it on anyway. 

Goddamnit I was miserable. I want to get all writery and *show not tell* the feelings that I felt that night. But ""misery"" explains it better than I can. I remember lying on my back in my bed and staring blankly at the ceiling, the whirling rabble of terrible TBS playoff announcers the only distraction from the brayynnk inside my mind.

But, somehow, I did make it through those few hours. And I did take another pill. And it did seem to take the edge off this time slightly. And I immediately crumpled into bed and slept for 14 hours straight.  

—-

Work went fine the next day. I knew it would. If anything, I was thrilled at the prospect of having the **Four Days** in front of me to distract myself from everything else that was going on. I mentioned before my weekend binge into recovery period, but that was only part of the weekly arrangement. What it really was was a weekly cycle, a weekly **system** I had manufactured to balance work and drinking the best I could. So there was crippling-anxiety-oh-god-why-can't-I stop-I'm-gonna-order-Jersey-Mikes Monday. And then ""chill"" Tuesday. But then Wed I had a good amount of work with clients but would still be sleep-deprived after, so I would crash.

That then took me to Thursday, in which I would rarely take clients but usually spent it more working on my business itself and taking care of IRL chores. I'd also speak to my therapist (and then my substance abuse counselor after my therapist deservingly fired me) around 3 PM, which was the point I started to ""feel like myself."" Sometimes I'd exercise.

Then Friday was another big workday. I usually felt a ton better by that point, and maybe this drinking stuff wasn't so bad. But then came the fourth day, Saturday.

Saturday is my busiest day. I work with students, so I work when they don't have school. These kids are busy, so often Saturday is the only time they can meet. That means that most Saturdays I'm up by eight and gogogo until as late as six or seven. Saturday is my ""big day,"" and in a lot of ways, I like it. I'm the big college career writer man, and this is the type of shit BCCWM does. I can always go longer and work harder on Saturdays than I can on any other day. I revel in it.

But then work on Sat would end. And it would be late. And I'd be hungry and sleep-deprived. And I'd be suddenly swept up in a haze of just how *lonely I was.* I'd feel empty and hollow. I'd completed another week of work, and now I had nothing and no one to pivot to.

So I'd start to drink. Alone. And that drinking would continue until my body actively failed me and I went down. That usually meant 20-30 hours later, some point after Sunday Night Football ended. And that then brought me back to Monday.

It's a sad thing to reflect on. But what makes it worse is that what I just described was the plan \*as fully operational\*. Like, I built it that way because it theoretically kept me going. But the walls had started to collapse. The neat confines of my weekly program had begun to blur, and suddenly the lines between ready-for-work Wednesday and blackout Saturday weren't so clear.

So what I'm saying is that Saturday night I went to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting instead.

—- 

I plan to keep writing here about other stuff. But in general, I'll keep the AA talk to a minimum. My official take on it is somewhere between ""It's aight"" and ""you get out of it what you put in."" 

I also knew the program would be important to my sobriety. Important in the same way it had been important eight years prior when I got sober as a college senior in New Orleans. That ride had made it about 1.5 years until the aforementioned health issues threw my life into the garbage, and I decided self-destructive behavior made a lot more sense. But there was no path to sobriety that makes any sense to me besides complete abstinence and going back to meetings.

Side note: if anyone is reading this on their first go of sobriety, a great reason to keep going is that if you do relapse and then resober, it makes your overall journey way less cohesive and narratively satisfying. Just a heads up.

But there I was at a meeting—my first in nearly a decade. And there was a speaker. And he mentioned drinking alone and also being pissed that the Giants lost (the Giants lost). So I found him after and asked him to be my sponsor. 

Then I drove nearly an hour to my mom's house. Once I got there, I checked in for a bit and then went and used their sauna. Partly because I figured it would help me sweat out some evil. But mostly because I had run the mental math that if I got my parents around 10, saunaed at 11, and then drove home around 1:15, I would get back to my apartment just after 2AM, and Safeway wouldn't be able to sell me booze.

So would be the strategy for the next **Four Weeks** as I delicately altered my life to keep alcohol as far away from it as possible. 

And…it wasn't too hard? I don't think I ""pink clouded,"" as they call it. Life was not a miracle of joy and sobriety, no. But what it was is **all the fucking bullshit stopped.** I stopped having to go into Zoom calls with students sweating and delirious. I stopped sending crackhead Emails about how I wanted to change plans or why I couldn't be somewhere on time. I stopped waking up with knee bruises and broken glass everywhere. *I liked my job again*. My once-crippling physical anxiety vanished into the night, and suddenly I was back to…well, I was just an isolated workaholic who went to AA meetings three nights a week. My therapist let me come back. My mom forgave me. I exercised more.

Saturdays were hard. They still are. Every Saturday, I would finish up my long day and very much look forward to my meeting and then going to my mom's. But often, there were a couple of dead hours beforehand. Those periods I wasn't so much miserable as I was transient. I had no idea what to do or how to feel. I remember one time I literally stared at a wall for nearly two hours. I'd still manage to be seven minutes late to the meeting.

(Oh. Fuck. The sugar. I craved sugar like a motherfucker for like 60 days. I don't even like sugar. I like carbs which sometimes I get via sugar. But 3-6 times a week, I would feel kinda terrible and, independently, crave sugar. In one to file under ""God has a sense of humor,"" I would again dawn my sandals, shorts, and mask and wander to the Safeway at all hours of the day and night. Only instead of dropping $13 on cheap malt liquor, it would be $13 on fucking candy. My favorite were these Nerds gummy balls things. Elite. Kinda wholesome in hindsight. The problem is that I would then get back and eat all this candy and wouldn't even feel better! I still felt like shit! Only I didn't crave sugar anymore. I instead felt sick from eating 1,500 calories worth of candy. I made myself nearly vomit while writing this paragraph.)

(Less repulsive but also memorable was the brain fog, which also stuck around for about 60 days. I'd randomly have bouts of extreme mental withdrawal that made it difficult to talk, let alone help teenagers craft brand narratives to get into Stanford. This was actually my number one fear going into sobriety, as I (ironically!) very clearly remembered being a braindead headcase for months the first time I sobered up in 2012. That experience was so ungodly horrible and nearly made me fail out of school. But this go-around wasn't nearly as bad, thanks to two changes I made. The first is I kept taking that anti-convulsant for about three days after I stopped drinking, and doing so helped me sleep and not convulse. I feel like I overall ""shocked my system"" less this time, meaning the after-waves to my body and mind were less severe. It's the major reason I recommend medical detox even if you ""don't need it."" The other is that I took a B-Complex supplement every day. If you're reading this at literally any point in your sobriety journey—including while still drinking—that is the one piece of advice I have for you. Head to the CVS and pick up B-complex + a multi-vitamin with the remaining Bs. Make sure you're getting all the Bs, particularly 1, 3, 5, and 12. My mix is the Nature's Bounty Sublingual liquid so it hits faster + a multivitamin with B1 in it because the liquid doesn't have B1 and I want all the Bs. Absolutely changed the game. I swear I would go from drooling mess to near-competent within 5 minutes of remembering to take it. There. That's literally the only concrete advice I have for you within this 5,500-word tome no one asked for.)

(I hope I helped!)

I stopped going to my mom's after the Saturday meeting around a month in. Half because I didn't want to drive there and half because she didn't want me getting her towels dirty. Instead, I would return to my apartment, and it would be really hard. My sleep schedule has never been anything close to healthy, and if anything, sobriety seems to make it worse. My Saturday night into Sunday morning into Sunday night experience thus remained quite similar, except I wasn't drinking.

Those 30-hour blocks wavered from uncomfortable to agonizing. I felt like a prisoner at times, trapped in a Mountain View cell I pay $4200/month for. It was less I wanted to drink, and more I wanted something—anything—to relieve me from the overall restlessness and discontent I felt. I found myself trying out other vices like hats. I spent one Saturday losing an embarrassing amount of money online gambling. Another I considered hiring an escort, only to be dissuaded because Bay Area escorts are shockingly unsexy. I just kept exercising one time, for like six hours. I figured if I exhausted myself enough, it would somehow dull the pain I felt. Didn't. Throwing up $27 worth of Taco Bell the following weekend didn't, either.

I never did find that miracle replacement. I was never going to. Instead, I gained some perspective. I was sober all night Saturday and all day Sunday enough times to at least know what it felt like. To know that I could. I also knew that I would crash like an absolute bitch come Sunday night, sleep until Monday afternoon, eat something, then play video games instead of wanting to die. Then I'd wake up Tuesday feeling pretty much fine. So fine that I started taking on clients on Tuesday like I used to. Then I'd get to bed at a reasonable hour, and then I'd wake up excited to work on Wednesday and usually have a really great time.

Those positive work changes were more than enough to get me to December 31st. My work season runs from July 1 to New Years. Right after that, everything we’ve worked on is due, which means I stop meeting with students almost entirely. It's a weird system, but I basically work constantly half the year and then have the other half off. I'm aware that I have a very strange perception of what a ""workaholic"" is.

I was always going to make it to December 31st. From the seconds I heard that voice in my head, there was not one scenario I break before that date. I would find myself laughing about it! *Man, I'd like a drink. Heh, ya. I'm going to relapse here on a Thursday in late November and fuck up everything. Lol go eat some more chocolate, goofball.* My students, and by extension my job, have always had an ability to keep me going and making the correct choices in life. They motivate me in ways that nothing else in the world—including myself—can.

And maybe by emphasizing how integral my work was to keeping me sober initially, it will make more sense to both of us when I explain why this past January was one of the hardest months of my life.

—- 

I can best explain how things have been in two ways.

1) I am now feeling many things I probably would and should have felt initially had I not buried them under work.

2) Every day is Saturday.

The two tend to commiserate a lot. I'm legally required to mention I have ADHD in everything I write, and a core aspect of that is that I need structure to survive. My work gives me that. My meetings with students are my anchor; I no.matter.what. make those appointments. And doing so forces me to wake up before noon, and take a shower, and brush my teeth, and not drink vodka. And then after my work is done I exercise, and call my mom, and head to AA meetings, and go on dates, and not drink vodka. 

But remove those 18 must-have anchor hours a week, and my life becomes chaos. I revert to a 30-hours awake, 14-hours asleep cycle. I stop bathing and exercising. I start blowing off engagements…I want to drink vodka.

Instead, I find myself feeling like shit a lot more. I have the time now. It's less a general unease and more a small series of mistakes I made while messed up that haunt me. What makes it worse is the ones that stick tend to be ones that I either don't know how or won't be ever able to reconcile. It makes me sick. Like this was all for nothing.

January 26th was my 31st birthday. I tend to melt down on my birthday. This one was going along well enough until around 7 PM. That's when a buddy called me and asked if I was up to anything.

""Not really. Want to do something?""

""I'm not sure what we could do. You don't drink.""

And then I melted down. The following 36 hours were an assault on my soul. Every bit as bad as that first night, only longer and without the ability to prepare or brace myself. Sleep was impossible, and if I could, I wouldn't have felt worthy of it. I have very little memory of what I did, but an incredible amount regarding what I thought. 

Imagine a dog in a fenced-in pen. The dog doesn't want to be there. He doesn't know where he wants to be, exactly. But it is absolutely not in that pen. The dog paws frantically around the circular inclusion, checking every crevice for a place to dig. He scrapes and he scrapes, not even looking for a way out but instead trying to identify the spot where he needs to scrape harder.

**BRAYYNNK BRAYYNNK BRAYYNNK BRAYYNNK** *Attention, look man. It's been a good run. But this is obviously bullshit. You're done working. You don't need to torture yourself anymore. We both know this is going to end at some point. Your dad got sick. You didn't handle the stress well. It caused you to act irrationally and devolve into a version of you that was not normal. You're in a better place now. You know you'll be able to get people to buy it. Just like you did last time. Cut yourself a break for now and see how drinking like not a moron goes. If the problems start back up you can just stop again around when work starts.* **BRAYYNNK BRAYYNNK BRAYYNNK BRAYYNNK** 

Google would go on to describe my predicament as a ""war within my mind."" And it is the most common mental state before a drug or alcohol relapse. And damn. They crushed it with the name. I've gotten to play faux-writer-tough-guy twice now with the ""I run this scenario 1,000 times and I never break"" schtick. But it's just not true here. If there was booze in my house, I would have drank it. If a friend brought over a six-pack, I'd have drank it. If I was on a first date with a cute girl and she ordered wine, I would ha—-

Three days later, I was on a first date with a cute girl. She ordered a glass of wine. I got the same. I spent four minutes staring at it in terror. She noticed I wasn't drinking it. I panickly told her I don't drink and only ordered it because she was cute and I was nervous. She took my glass and added it to hers. The remaining hour was awkward. 

I didn't drink that wine because she wasn't worth it. I had horrid nightmares, live, of breaking my sobriety on some shitty Tinder date for a girl who then still didn't want to see me again. 

I didn't drink the night of my birthday because I worried doing so would only make me feel worse. The shame would cause me to devolve into the really sad yet seemingly really common stereotype of the guy who ODs after long-term sobriety because his body can't handle the same workload. I didn't want to die. Also, if I drank, I would be letting a lot of really wonderful people I'd met in Alcoholics Anonymous down. Those were my last stands. 

For the first few months of sobriety, I used my first go-around in 2012 as a guide map of what to expect. I expected sugar cravings and insomnia. I expected to be ornery and for my work to suffer. I expected the brain fog to lift around 60 days in, and when it did, I was more resolute than ever that I could make it.

But my memories of sobriety tail off after those first few months from when I was in college. The year+ afterward is a blur, but one I don't remember hating. Instead, I have brief thoughts from that period that have stuck with me all this time, even if I could no longer understand what I meant by them. There are two of them that finally make sense again:

*Most of the time, sobriety isn't that bad. It leads to me being a lot happier and causing way fewer problems for myself and others. But the way sobriety works is that when it's bad, it can be really bad. And no matter how long you are sober, those bad times can be just as bad as when you first tried to stop. But, those bad times become less and less frequent. And through experience alone, you come to understand that sometimes you just need to ride out the storm. It always gets better.*

and

*The fact that merely not consuming alcohol causes me so much grief, destruction, and chaos is a very good sign that I should continue not doing so.*

—-

So that's my story. At least so far.

Now, why did I write it? As is the case with nearly all my writing, the answer is self-serving.

The first reason is that this is the type of work I wish I could have read as far back as six months ago. I've spent a good amount of time on this board, but when I read it most, it was in August and September, as I was still drinking but starting to accept that I had to make a change. I mentioned above that my greatest reservation in ending my drinking wasn't necessarily that I wouldn't be able to drink anymore. Instead, I was *afraid* of early sobriety and whatever havoc it would bring into my already difficult life.

There's a notable lack of stories like mine online. What does exist is that people in early sobriety give quick updates or ask questions. Those are great but rarely expose too deeply how they're doing. Then there are those much later in the process, often happy with their lives but also so much further in the process that their promises of serenity seem out of reach. Then there are like 500 faux-inspirational blogposts on Google by a 23yo socialite who lost alcohol for 30 days and **found herself instead.**

One of my notable talents is that I'm really good at getting people to try stuff. At my worst, it's been to secure a companion on whatever path to self-defeat I find myself on. But when I'm at my best, it's to help others make difficult leaps towards self-improvement that they know deep down that they should do but are afraid to commit to.

And how I tend to convince people to jump is by first doing it myself and then reporting back with as much honesty, clarity, and insight as I can. That's what I hope I have done with you. I got sober, and this is what it was really like. It was often difficult and at times actively miserable. But I was also a lot happier most of the time and better able to engage with the aspects of my life that matter to me. I survived to this point, do not regret my decision, am proud of myself, and intend to keep going. What you do with all this information is entirely up to you.

And then the other reason I wrote this is super self-serving. I've been working on this piece for the past month. Every Saturday night. It turns out there is something I can do when I don't know what else to do that makes the hole inside me not feel quite so dark. For the first three months of sobriety, I was too busy and too brain-melted to craft or publish a damn thing. It scared me more than I care to admit that alongside those liquor bottles I had possibly also yeeted the one skill of mine that makes me feel special. 

But nah. I think the fastball still has its cut. Thank you for reading. I love writing, and I love sharing my words with people who give a shit about them. If at least a few people here give enough of a shit to read them, I'll happily bring more.

And what else can I do? This story isn't over. But it has reached a robust checkpoint. IWNDWYT. Because that is all I need to do to ensure that as the clock here on February 12th strikes 5PM PST, I will have officially been sober for

It's a very small chance, but I decided to not drink until the ten day course was done just to be safe.  It's been about a week since I finished the prescribed course and still haven't gone back to drinking because those ten days of ""forced"" sobriety made me realize just how much better I feel when I'm not drinking every other day.  My depression isn't as bad, I'm not tired all the time, I'm not sleeping through half the day because of a hangover, and I have a lot more energy.  Not to mention I felt like I was having fun drinking by myself, but being sober has also made me realize it wasn't nearly as much fun as I thought.

Just last night about 10:00 PM my friend invited me out to a late showing of No Way Home and I was able to just get dressed and go.  A couple weeks or so ago I would have had to decline because I would have been drunk already and wouldn't have been able to drive.  It was nice.  Got to hang out with friends and see a fantastic film for the second time.  Two things that wouldn't have happened if I had been drinking.",14,0
2491,2022-02-12 14:06:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/sqyosp/im_ready/,I’m ready :),"I apologize if parts are a bit vague. I’m trying to keep this at least semi-unidentifying. 


I had my first drink at 18 at a childhood friend’s house party. My friends wanted to get me smashed because I’d never had a drink before, a normal right of passage in all our minds. I think I had about 9 drinks that night, and got extremely sick, but I loved it. I wanted to do it again. I had been a “goody two-shoes” in high school. Didn’t drink, smoke, never went to a single party or snuck out, straight A student, etc. I loved cutting loose and getting wild. I partied hard, and often. I was trying to drink away some mental health problems, but I didn’t know it then. 


I dropped out and partied less. Still drank a lot every weekend, but socially, so it was fine. Right? I lived on this comfortable plateau for quite some time.


Not anymore. I’ve been getting slowly worse, and the past year or two not as slowly. But the past 6 months have been frightening.


A lot of bad things out of my control have happened. My psychiatrist retired and due to a mix up in the process I ran out of my meds (venlafaxine and oxcarbazepine). The withdrawals were unreal, thought I was going to die. Had to be rushed to the ER for unrelated emergency surgery, insurance covered nothing. Very scary experience, once again thought I was going to die. A very close relative passed away suddenly in his 20s, absolutely wrecked me and my whole family. My car broke down and is totaled. Both my pets passed away.


And how have I coped? I just drink it all away. Currently I drink, at a minimum, 10 beers a night. Every night. I barely talk to my wonderful loving friends, my sweet boyfriend of many years, my family who would do anything for me. I don’t want them to see me like this. I’m flat broke because of how much I spend on alcohol. So far, that hasn’t stopped me. I just keep drinking, alone in my apartment, secretly so the people that love me don’t find out and worry. 


I’m 25 years old. I have my whole life ahead of me and I’m ruining it. Shortening it, too.


I’ve been bargaining with myself for months. You all know how it goes. I want to stop. But… just tonight, one more night… work was so stressful, I earned it… etc. At this point its been years and years since I went a week without. In the past year I think my longest stint was 2 days, not counting my time in the hospital.


I think this time I’m ready. I don’t know why. Nothing happened. I simply feel different.


Technically I cannot accept a chip— yet. I did not drink Thursday. Last night my boyfriend and I got an invite to a milestone party for a family member of his. It had been a very secretive surprise party, few were given prior notice, so the invite was “come over right now!!” Of course, when we arrived everyone was drinking and I felt that socially I could not refuse as I would get questioned (silly, I know). I had a small cup of champagne and one beer. My boyfriend drove me home and I planned to buy beer as soon as he left. I wanted to *so badly.* I NEEDED it. Had to have it.


I didn’t. I’ve never been that strong before.


I don’t know if this will last. I hope so. But that doesn’t really matter. All I have to handle is today.

Everybody kept repeating it takes time and approx. at least one year clear to get to know oneself and learn to experience and live with various emotions that would resurface once the booze stops. 

I felt accepted and supported. I cried like a baby when I tried to say something and stayed on the verge of tears for the remaining time.

The only saving grace is I did it alone and no one witnessed it so I don’t feel the familiar “what did I say” anxiety. 

All this is to say, if you were considering going back to alcohol, ask yourself what you want to get out of doing that. My bet is you won’t find what you’re looking for in the bottle. I know I didn’t. And whatever you do find will be followed by a pretty awful headache.

 Good morning. 
 Our keynote is “Humility“.
The Meditation and Prayer for the Day are completely devoted to the importance of persistent awareness of God.
  In the course of many annual trips through the 24 Hour Book, I have noticed that the same themes are repeated over and over. The two most frequently emphasized are remaining conscious of God and helping others.
 The reason they are so often the heart of the daily reading is no mystery. If I maintain God consciousness and stay focused on what I can do for others, it’s not necessary to complicate things beyond that. 
 Just to the extent that I do those two things, I will be useful, efficient, have peace and not be dominated by fear.
 That straightforward, but often difficult to maintain, approach IS the spiritual life.
 Magically, the key to it all really is that simple.
 I love you all.",4,0

I (38 m) don’t plan my life around alcohol anymore.  I don’t feel angry, unhappy, miserably hung over, anxious, worried, paranoid, bitter, or any of the other unpleasant feelings that come along with being an alcoholic.  I don’t stop at the gas station to and from work anymore.  I don’t get angry and irritated when there is no booze involved with whatever I am doing. I had to make sacrifices and cut away a lot of my life that I thought defined me. But I had to and I wanted to. One year ago today, after dozens of “last chances” with my wife and almost losing it all, as i layed drunk and miserable on the floor of the bathroom, I vaguely remember asking her to call the rehab facility. She had done all the research in finding the place was ready, and until then I wasn’t. 

Hardest thing i ever did was walk into that place but it saved my life.  I tried soo many times to stop but would always spiral down again.

It's been a rollercoaster. I fought back intense cravings in the first 2-3 weeks. I was proud of my achievement. It felt as though I'd conquered something in my psyche, whatever it was that compelled me to hide in blackouts. 

Then came the benefits of sobriety. I woke up one morning with a feeling of pure optimism. A sense of childlike carefree, of Saturday mornings and cartoons. It was a feeling I thought gone to memories of childhood. 

I didn't think I could feel so happy again...

Anxiety lost its grip on me. Having no reason to feel shame or guilt, liberated my conscience and allowed me to focus on my goals. I walked with serenity for the first time in a long time. I felt comfortable in my skin. I've lost weight. I'm more present with my loved ones. Sleep is infinitely better.

I thought I'd spiritually grown a little and earned some wisdom about myself.

For me, sobriety had a heartbeat. It pulsed with optimism but that has now flatlined. I'm bored. Frustrated that I can't relax with one or two on the weekends. But I know I've got an unquenchable thirst. That I'm susceptible to bad habits. 

I'm worried for the first time on this path. My old mindset is creeping into this healthy headspace that I've build for the past 2 and a half months. I'm justifying my cravings. Convincing myself that what I've learned in 72 days of sobriety has forever changed me as a drinker. I CAN drink in moderation and even if I can't, well 72 days still count for something, don't they? You can just start again...

I live 2000 miles from my family and only get to see them once or twice a year. 

My father came to terms with his alcoholism three years ago. We had no idea whatsoever. Turns out he’s as good at acting normal after five shots as I am. 

My mother isn’t an alcoholic (I don’t think), she usually just has a glass of wine with dinner or a single Manhattan while cooking. My father has NA Chardonnay but usually just drinks water with dinner these days.

Whenever I’ve come back to visit, my mom seems excited to have someone to dish and drink with. I’m really worried that going to see them will make me cheat. I want to hang out with my mom and a lot of our best conversations happened after a couple glasses of wine. My family is in Maine and I currently live in Texas so I want to make the most of my time with my mom. 

I don’t really want to bring alcoholism up while I’m back home since a week is such a short amount of time and I don’t want to sour it with my parents worrying about me. I’m worried I’ll accept a glass of Chardonnay with the meal my mother is planning for my first day back and that it’ll be a slippery slope.

After they left, I hulked out and trashed our living room. Still finding broken glass and game pieces under furniture, furniture that I *overturned* in a drunken rage. 


I had thought rock bottom was not a thing I would ever reach. I never drink at work. I drink a night or two a week. But occasionally I get blackout drunk and have to piece together the night before like a really shitty detective. 

*Nothing in my call history, thank god*
*Hm, this shirt is wadded up in the hamper and…. is that vomit?*
*“Did I hurt you last night when I hulked out and trashed the living room?”*


The escalation terrifies me. I told my husband that I should quit drinking and he agreed immediately. Told me that some people just can’t drink. I had never thought that would be me. I am just so embarrassed and many other emotions.

Later in the day edit

I spent most of the day either crying or trying not to cry, overwhelmed with shock and disbelief. It's very difficult to face myself and know I'm an out-of-control drunk and not the fun drunk I purported myself to be. I did something I never imagined I would do: I went to an AA meeting. I left while my husband was in the shower and didn't tell him I was going. I drove there thinking I might just sit in the parking lot and see who goes in and go home. When I pulled in, I saw a cute guy go in and thought 'fuck it' I'll go in. Walking in was fucking terrifying. I walked past several tables, just drowning in self-consciousness, until a nice gentleman said hello to me and I asked to sit next to him. Everyone at my table introduced themselves. During the meeting one woman said her husband left her because of her drinking and he just passed away. I don't want that to be me. I didn't introduce myself in the meeting and I could barely open my mouth without ugly crying. I ran away as soon as it was over, and a nice man caught me on the way to the door and introduced himself and his friends. It seems like a nice group and I'm glad I went. I don't know if I'm ready yet to say I'm an alcoholic, but I want to go back tomorrow. Walking in will be less scary since I've already done it once. I told my husband where I went when I got home and he didn't make a big deal out of it, which was good. Just asked how it went. He is a good man.",491,0

It was great advice--the mood passed, but it started a mindset that I carry to this day.    It made me realize that not drinking was my most important task, and within that task, self-care was critical.  The delicious selfishness of taking care of myself has become so critical to my journey.

My self-care includes celebrating every milestone (I missed 6-7-8...drat!).  On my one-year mark, I took myself out for lunch, got a massage, and bought a big fabulous tv.  This year, I've blocked my upcoming ""day"" so I get noon onward off, and am already plotting what wonderful self-care is in my future.  It's truly like having two birthdays!

What we are doing isn't easy.  Often, if you're like me, there is no one to really celebrate or truly understand these milestones and achievements so it's up to me to carry my own torch and pat my own self on the back--a LOT.  Every chance I get, I selfishly celebrate ME and the amazing journey I'm on.

Here's to all the wonderful, selfish, healthy, sober celebrations--of US!",100,0

Just wanted to share with everyone as encouragement not to drink. You never know what is around the corner. Had I not decided to sober up now, it may have impacted these final family moments around the holidays.

Stay strong, stay sober, you aren’t alone. I love you all and am grateful for this community.

Physically I am seeing and feeling nothing but stark benefits from not drinking. I look great and I'm sleeping so much better. No more sweatiness, gastrointestinal stuff or puffiness. If I keep up this level of eating right and fitness, I'll be in true athlete form in no time.

My brain and mood are a bit of another story however. I've got low grade anhedonia almost always with dips of anxious irritability once or twice a day that can be difficult for me to pull myself out of if I've already exercised that day or my schedule won't allow me to (35 single dad of 2 with 50/50 custody). I've coined a new term called crankxiety for these dip times. 

What I've reeeeeally noticed about the most uncomfortable times currently are the times of the week where I would reward myself for my hard work by getting really buzzed. Holy shit like clockwork 630 pm on Thursday, 430 pm on Friday and 1 pm on Saturday are TOUGH. I get visceral phantom limb pains and nerve cravings accompanied by strong crankxiety where my brain is screaming at me ""why aren't you accompanying whatever activity you are doing with a drink???!!!!????"" It's like I can visualize the neural pathway in my brain that I've worn so deeply at those specific times of the week. 

Also (dis)honorable mention goes to 4 pm on Sunday. My brain is still going into a cycle of not necessarily craving but existential dread as if I had a bad hangover even though I'm a month sober. What the hell? It is truly shocking how much I have Pavloved myself with alcohol use. What a large amount of time and energy spent to get into this habit. 

Silver lining is that noticing this makes me feel stubborn and angry at alcohol for making me feel like I need it to be a badass. I'm a badass and I don't need alcohol to know that.",38,0

We've been on and off again for years, and I love her dearly but we both have our issues we need to work on and maybe we're not good for each other but I just can't walk away from her.

Anyway we had a fight. Over something stupid and I was deep in, four bottles of wine deep, and I lost my cool, she walked out, or threatened to, then went to sleep in the spare room. I overreacted and tried to set my house on fire while we were both in it. Splashed some accelerant around, dropped a match on it, thank God I was too drunk to make a good job of it and it didn't catch. I sort of came to my senses and cleaned up the mess as best I could but she came out from the spare room and left properly this time.

I dove into despair. Here was this precious thing that I had ruined, purely my fault because I couldn't control my emotions. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts in the past so selfishly I told her that's what I would do that night. I tied myself a noose and headed off to a bridge nearby, intent on lashing one end to the rail and throwing myself over. I cooled off on the walk there and ended up just walking around the park. Starting to sober up and realise the immensity of how badly I'd fucked up. 

She called the police, as she was right to do, and they found me. Took me to hospital and had me assessed by a psychiatric team, I was released six hours later.

This isn't the first time we've fought while drinking, although it's rare, but this was by far the worst. I was done twice for DUI in the last twelve months (both times under 0.08 but the limit here is 0.05). It's out of control. I felt like a totally different person and I don't like that person. I was psycho, manipulative, aggressive, and scary. I've been carrying this boulder of regret and fear and shame inside me since then. I don't drink every day, don't feel like I need to drink every day, I'm not that sort of alcoholic, but I do drink to excess. Far, far to excess. Thirty, forty standard drinks in a session. Two bottles of whiskey or rum or gin.

She came and saw me the next evening. We talked a little bit and she spent the night, it felt like maybe she'd forgive me but she left to go to work on Wednesday and hasn't spoken to me since. I can't blame her. Even if she does forgive me and agrees to work past it, it's a lot for her to think about and a lot to process. I can't ask her to, but with God as my witness I will never put myself, or her, or anyone in that position again. She must have been terrified, and I hate that a place and a person that should make her feel safe turned into a place of fear. 

It's been five days.

I pray I can salvage something from this. Monday morning I'm calling the doctor to ask for psychiatric help, medication, therapy, whatever it takes. And just for now, no drinking.

So obviously that means my problem isn't problematic enough that I need to stop. (I know that's not true, but I'm very good at believing it anyway.) 

I mean it's obvious that I have a problem. I drink every day, I drink alone, I drink straight out of the bottle, I lie about how much I'm drinking, I don't fulfil obligations because I'm too busy drinking, I've put myself in danger attempting to get alcohol, and when I tell myself I'm going to stop, I drink before I've even got to one day sober. I literally snorted alcohol the other day in an attempt to get drunk without feeling so sick.

I'm several days in on the latest attempt to stop drinking (it's embarrassing to see how many times I've requested a badge reset). Last night I thought I'd take a look at how much I spent in 2021. I logged into Ally Bank, and downloaded all of 2021's transactions from my primary debit account (I have three accounts). 
I filtered out my top 3 liquor stores...

$4,278,48

That doesn't include the random liquor stores, happy hours, restaurants, etc. I'm estimating I spent >$6,000 in 2021 alone. 

That's the new HVAC my house desperately needs.

I went 28 days alcohol free in January, I felt so fucking good it's unbelievable. I was working out dropping weight and just feeling really well in myself, yeah I had cravings for alcohol but I was fine.

Then comes 2 weeks holiday off work, I was getting drunk(black out drunk) every 2 days and on the day I was hung over I would order takeaway and binge on that. I gained all the weight I lost in the 28 days I stayed sober I just feel so defeated but I'm starting again (well started 2 days ago).

I just think when it comes to alcohol, I just can't have a cheeky beer or 2, it becomes 3, 4, 5 and then half a bottle of JD later I'm on my arse.

I can say that i think doing this through the colder months has made it much easier...The sping and summer months will be hard for me, I love being outdoors (I work in an office), I relate being outside in the nice weather, poolside throwing back beers with friends, having drinks at places with outdoor seating, having good coversation and letting loose on the wknds.

I’m angry at myself, but mostly I’m just scared. I’ve been binge drinking and wrecking my body. I don’t want to do this anymore. 

The pattern is the same each time. Give it up for good- do well for a few days, enough for me to forget what this feels like and justify it. Telling myself it’s not really that unhealthy. That I’m not an alcoholic. And then boom- a full bottle of wine later I’m back to square one. 

I should be thankful. I went from hard liq down to wine and beer. At most I’m drinking a bottle of wine as my binge- it could be worse. But it’s still enough for me to see this ISNT normal.

On my days that I’ve stopped drinking I’m happier but SO BORED and that has been my biggest weakness. 1pm-7pm is my craving hours.

I’ve been doing all the recommended things, I do various forms of exercise 5 times a week, meditate daily, journal, eat well, but I’m having a hard time for sure. I do have a few traumas that occurred both in my childhood and adult life and the next step is to get therapy to help work through these. 

It’s the stress that is the biggest factor at the moment, it’s really impacting my sleep and subsequently my mood and I guess I just wanted to see it anyone can relate to this time in recovery and am I just to be more patient in giving the space for the healing to happen? 

I feel like most of my adult life I’ve been running away from who I really am by abusing alcohol and drugs and now I want to come back to my true self, but with these extremely intrusive emotions I feel like I’m running away again. It’s tough, that’s all.

This self realization that for so long that I tried desperately to hide from myself that I forgot I don't really know who I am. At least who I am without alcohol. 

It's so odd that alcohol really does make you forget that as a person I have no clue how to behave. I understand the social requirements that I must observe to continue to play, I just don't really care anymore to keep up the act.

I wanted to share some helpful tips!","**There are two kinds of people in this world. People who drink and people who don’t:**
When you’re trying to transition into a non-drinking lifestyle, allow yourself to become a part of that community. Allow yourself to feel prideful rather than shameful. This is something to be very proud of, and the community is very uplifting and supportive. You are going against the grain. You are, as Robert Frost said, taking the road less traveled by. This is a HUGE accomplishment. Don’t feel ashamed, revel in the doors you’ll open for yourself. Read through forums and stories of peoples journeys to a non-drinking lifestyle. Reach out and talk to them about their successes on this journey, or merely encourage them and recognize their successes. They will do the same for you! A good place to start is this community right here!

**Envision the future without alcohol:**
When you truly decide to make this commitment, think of yourself in a situation where you’d normally drink, but instead of ordering an alcoholic drink you’re ordering a water, a mock-tail, or something non-alcoholic. In fact, don’t just think of one scenario, think of many scenarios even outside of your typical bar/outing scene. Do you feel the need to have a glass of wine on the beach? A beer while you’re golfing? It can be literally anytime you’ve got a drink in your hand. Examine your own behaviors with alcohol in your life and envision those times without it instead. Get really real with yourself. This is going to be your future, get familiar with it in your head first.

**Mourn your loss:**
As I mentioned envisioning scenarios you usually drink in, and imagining yourself without alcohol in said scenarios, I can almost guarantee that this is going to bring up feelings you don’t want to feel. It feels like a hard loss, don’t think that there is something wrong with you for feeling this way. It’s quite common. It’s a big change in your behavior that comes nearly second nature to you. Feelings of uncertainty, and maybe even sadness will arise. Sometimes we feel that alcohol is a part of us and that we will be losing out. It has a way of tricking us like that. We aren’t losing anything. There was never anything there to lose by drinking in the first place. By cutting out what is just ethanol/poison at the end of the day, you don’t lose, you only gain. You gain better mental clarity, better health overall, your relationships improve, the list goes on. 

**Set boundaries for yourself:**
Understand what you can and cannot be around initially at first. I’m to a point where I can sit at a bar with someone and not think twice about ordering alcohol. If it’s too much for me, because after all I’m human, then I get up and I leave. Learn what is comfortable for you and what you can and cannot tolerate. 
Envision, and be real with yourself on how you feel that people in your life will react. We shouldn’t have to explain ourselves or stand our ground, but unfortunately with how normalized this is in society, some people will look at you like you have three heads and they won’t respect your boundaries. Maybe not even on purpose, it’s just so ingrained in us as a society that drinking truly has become second nature. And, you may even be pleasantly surprised to experience the opposite from certain people you were sure you’d get push back from. Those people may be more supportive than you anticipated. If at any point, someone refuses to understand a choice you’ve made for yourself in this journey, it is okay to distance yourself for a while until they get the hint. Regardless, set those boundaries in your head so when/if you are faced with them, you’ll be better prepared. It helps you to really talk yourself into this decision and be certain that it’s the right choice for you. 

**You are making room for more:**
By cutting out this thing that has the potential to ruin your life, your health, your happiness, and a whole laundry list of other things, you truly make room to bring more in. Just as you envisioned the future without alcohol, envision achieving a life long goal you have. It can be anything you have your desires set towards. Think of how much easier it’s going to be getting there without this thing that slows you down and holds you back. 

**Focus on the positives of quitting, not the negatives:**
Everyone makes quitting a negative thing, so see the positives instead. Focus on the benefits. Consume videos of the benefits that stopping will have on your brain and your body. Read up on the benefits of how your skin, hair, financial status and a plethora of other things will improve. Keep filling your mind with the benefits of quitting, rather than trying to convince yourself there are any that come from drinking. Alcohol is the problem, not you. Your confidence will improve and you’ll notice that it’s actually a lot easier to be happier for others in their successes in life because you yourself are making a huge commitment to something. Not to mention the mental clarity will only help aid in that frame of mind. 

**Even though you are making a life long commitment, take it one day at a time:**

Today I realized that my emotions were wildly out of wack. Up and down to extremes I’ve never felt before. My first thoughts ran to promises coming true as I’ve been working hard on myself both personally and professionally. 

Today I made the mistake of calling people I haven’t spoken to in years due to my alcoholism. As a result of these calls I am now an agnostic instead of an atheist. I also realized I’m sleep deprived a bit, pretty hungry, and most profound to me; I have forgotten my decades long low dose SSRI prescription for weeks. 

I sincerely think if things were different I’d be drunk right now. My apartment is free of alcohol and benzodiazepines. My honest and correct choice for now is to stay with my parents. They have alcohol and benzodiazepines I can take right now and for the next 12 hours. I do not have any urges. 

I’m wildly fucked up. And I haven’t had a drop since my badge date. 

I asked a sober human if in their sobriety their happiness was generally up, down, or constant. Trying to ask how it fluctuates thinking maybe I didn’t understand a new curve ball of life without alcohol. 

I sincerely hope it is the SSRI. Very important meeting Monday with my boss and very high level individuals. Thankfully my higher power had already thought ahead. The meeting is so important it can shape his future financially for years to come. He has instructed me to keep my mouth shut. At the time I wasn’t happy but thankfully agreed and said, “all I want is you to introduce me. I won’t say anything else.”

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This post goes up at:

* US - Night/Early Morning
* Europe - Morning
* Asia and Australia - Evening/Night

A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar.

**Friends!  Look at us!  It’s Saturday!  We made it!**  Let’s talk today about **FUN**. Because we deserve it. We’ve earned it. We’ve been showing up for ourselves and one another and for many of us (though, believe me I know firsthand not ALL of us) it’s a day off. What are you doing today that you hope will be fun?  Saturdays are a day I get in my long(er) runs, so I’ll be doing that, through slush, and I will enjoy it. Scrabble with my SO tonight. I’ll play with my cat. I’ll call my BFF. That’ll be my fun for today. Know what else is fun?  NOT DRINKING. So I will not drink with you, dear SD community and I’ll leave you with the wise words of Coolio:

**""Life is too short to not have fun; we are only here for a short time compared to the sun and the moon and all that.""**

Thank you for being here, thank you for being you, thank you for being the community we all need.

As a friendly reminder, please reach out to u/sainthomer if you have 30 days of not drinking under that sparkly belt, and are interested in hosting the DCI!  The sub is always looking for hosts and I can’t recommend getting involved in this way enough. Simply be in touch directly for more details.",332,0

I want a community and to meet people who don’t drink everyday but i also don’t wanna join “mens” meetings because even though I’m a straight guy, i don’t trust most straight men. 

Most my problems stem from insecurities especially with women because all the times I’ve regretted drinking was cuz i get depressed I’m lonely. If it’s not alcohol I’ll smoke weed or right now I’m drinking Kava, kratom, antidepressants and going to therapy and i have no desire to drink.

Are there alternatives? Talking to people in AA i feel like they’ll judge me if I try to be sober without it. Yet I realized my intentions aren’t gonna change, i just wanna meet women and i don’t wanna go to a place like this to do that when I don’t really have any intention of finishing the steps.

TLDR conflicted because I’ve gone only few AA meetings cuz my friends said it was good but when I go there I realize I just wanna talk to the cute girls, I’m not really worried about soberity.

Tomorrow morning I will be 400 days sober. I made the right decision and I choose to make that same decision every morning. My life has improved immensely, it’s not perfect and it never will be.

I've had a problem with alcohol and drugs for about 6 years now. My addiction has taken different forms over the years. I've gone through non-stop, withdrawal psychosis inducing drinking, but over the past 2 years or so I've been a small margin more functional - I went back to university after dropping out for 3 years because of my addiction, I've managed to somehow hold down the same job for 2.5 years. 

Because I'm better than I used to be, I've convinced myself that I'm fine and that my life isn't slowly falling apart. I can go several days without drinking, but eventually I can't take it anymore and I still end up drinking at least 2-3 days a week, regardless if I have class or work the next day. I tell myself I'm just going out for two drinks to ease my anxiety, but as soon as I get a sip of alcohol in me I can't stop, I end up getting hammered, craving cocaine, and once I get that first line in me I ignore my responsibilities, and keep railing cocaine until I drain my bank account. Im so fucking behind on my bills because of this pattern. 

On Monday I fell into one of the worst depressive episodes I've had in a long time (I have unmedicated bipolar and bpd, I quit taking medication in 2020), and on Tuesday I needed something to ease the pain I was feeling. I blacked out and next thing I know I'm at a random man's apartment smoking meth, crack, and railing lines of cocaine. I had to call in to work, I couldn't study for an important midterm, and my depressive episode got so much worse I ended up hurting myself pretty bad.

I realized I can't do this alone. I'm smart in a difficult area of study, I'm driven, I've been through helland back all while living on my own since the age of 16 and I've managed to get myself out of a heroin addiction 3 years ago, but I'm completely wasting my potential. Every week I can feel the effects of this pattern on my mind, and I get closer to losing everything I've worked so hard to achieve. Every time I try to reeally quit I make it a month then relapse worse than I was before.

I’ve settled into a healthy routine that fits better with who i want to be. 

When I’m going about my days, i rarely if ever even think about drinking anymore. The cravings have disappeared.  The only times that they do return are in moments during which i previously would have drank, purely out of peer pressure or a desire to fit in.

A couple weeks ago i went to a friend’s birthday party- a rare occurrence since the pandemic.  I hadn’t spent real time with her nor all the others in attendance in many months.  I never told any of them when i quit drinking, and the subject just hasn’t come up since i did.  I’m glad i never made any big announcements about it- it was then and remains now, my business.  

At the party though, i had a nagging urge to have a drink- a remnant social coping skill.  When i arrived, i almost immediately regretted going, and told myself to just have a drink, that it would loosen me up.  I was never going to drink, and i didn’t take the urge seriously- this is just what my brain does when confronted with a dozen or more impending, unavoidable conversations.   Then i remembered that that’s exactly the process i went through in every social situation in the years that i drank- except that before, it was without reservation that i was always going to drink.  The experience reminded me how truly helpful alcohol was to me in my early twenties.  It helped me open up, kick the shyness, be myself.  

Alcohol did do those things for me, at a time in my life when i really needed the help.  Though, I’ve reached the point now  where i find little value in a forced or nice-weather conversation.  I’m comfortable alone, even in a crowded room.  So, at the party, i exchanged hellos and how’ve-you-beens for a while, politely declined beers and shots when offered, and, when i found my window, i snuck out the back and through the yard to my car, and went home.  

When i was younger, that kind of decision wouldn’t really have been a good one for me to make.  I once really needed human interactions, to get out of my own head and to challenge myself to stifle the anxiety.  While i wish I’d found a better way to do that, I’m still glad i went through what i did to get where i am now.  These days, if i think i need a drink to get through any situation, i know I’m better off just not putting myself through it in the first place.",39,1

Having dinner with them means my mom will pester me, ""just have a beer!"" It's all in the name of ""fun"" to them... 
I can proudly say I sat through that dinner and refused all alcohol, and decided I wanted to wake up in the morning and live my life not hung over, so I didn't get any alcohol on the way home! For me, it was a huge milestone. 
It's been about 7 weeks since I had any alcohol, I've also been exercising and dieting but I've lost probably 13 lbs, and I haven't had any of the sleeping issues I thought I might otherwise.

Day 11, again.","Mostly this is just me needing to vent about my relationship with alcohol, trying to quit (again) and the pain symptoms and concerns I have. I've read pretty much everything the internet and Reddit has to offer about ""liver pain"", so I'm not looking for medical advice so much as I'm just looking to bend the proverbial ear.  


I've been working on admitting that I'm an alcoholic and sobriety in fits and starts for the last two years. I guess I'm more comfortable with ""alcohol use disorder"", if I'm being honest. The last four and a half years, I've been having on and off upper right quadrant pain. I've had countless blood tests, two CT scans, two ultrasounds and they've never been able to nail down a cause. It appeared that my liver, gallbladder, pancreas, etc. were all functioning and looked normal on imaging. I kept on drinking.   


I first drank at 14, but didn't really start drinking until I was 19. Through my 20s, pretty regular binge drinking, but mostly on weekends. Bad times would happen and drinking slowly became my coping mechanism. It made good times better, and the bad times more manageable, until it didn't. After my Mom died, my drinking increased. I always justified it because other people in my life drank more heavily. I've only day drank three times (that I can recall!) and have always had some rules in place. I rarely would drink before 9 pm, one beer on the half an hour for a six pack. While I've had binges where I drank significantly more than that in a sitting, most of my drinking was limited to a sixer of Blue Moon. Rarely drank hard liquor, although I know now that there really isn't a difference as far as the body is concerned.   


In the last ten years I've seen my drinking escalate. Where I used to drink primarily on Fridays in my 20s, slowly it went to twice a week, then to benders where I would drink most nights of the week. I'd get it back under control or quit, but I'd backslide and ended up back to drinking most nights within a few months. It would start with once a week again, then a couple weeks later, twice, then a couple weeks later, more. I'd go through the this cycle over and over again.   


The last two years, I've had up to five months of sobriety at a time. The pain in my abdomen would dissipate, but it never really went away completely. Tests over and over revealed nothing until this January.   


In November on the 16th, I lost someone very, very close to me. After five months of sobriety, I picked up a bottle of fireball and drank most of it. The next day I got another bottle, but told my wife and dumped it after a few shots. Since then, my drinking, which I've been hiding from my wife, has escalated from once a week, to twice and so on. I just couldn't find a reason to want to quit. I have bipolar disorder and suffer from major depressive episodes. Drinking always ""helped"" while simultaneously making things worse. Finally I decided I'd try to get back on the wagon, and a few days later, got the results from my physical. My ALT was ""borderline"" according to the Doctor at 57. Not much over the limit which I believe is 55 or 56. But the pain, which was already slowly increasing, has gotten worse.   


There could be a psychosomatic element to this. My Doctor said he could put in an ultrasound, but he would recommend abstaining from alcohol and retesting in 6 months. Considering the tests I've already had in the last five years, and with me being ""mostly"" sober over the last two years (moreso than any time before), and not having insurance right now, my wife doesn't want me to have the ultrasound due to the cost. She feels I've had enough tests and that the pain is musculoskeletal, as the doctors have previously determined. I guess I just feel that its increased since I've started drinking again, and coupled with the higher ALT, it would be worth getting to at least ease my mind.   


She feels I should just take the Dr's advice and just recheck in six months. I mean, as long as I'm not drinking until then (and never again if I can manage), eating healthy and exercising as much as I can realistically, perhaps she's right. I'm also prediabetic and my triglycerides are through the roof.  So I should probably be worrying more about that than I am this stubborn ""rib pain"".  


Either way, 11 days back on the wagon. IWDWYT!",17,0

I still have anxiety & depression, but MUCH lower levels. Im more patient, kind, have more energy, & I feel like im finally able to concentrate more. 

Sobriety is a wonderful thing & im so glad im doing it.

I've killed a 12-pack a day for 4-5 months now.
I drink 2-3 beers before work, basically what I didn't finish last night, and I'm starting work around 5-6 am most days.
When I get off work I get the cheapest beer and drive the backroads while drinking.
I know I'm jeopardizing my life and other's, which is why I drive backroads.
I've had to move back to my folks after my children's mother left me 6 months ago.
That's also about the time I got a hip replacement, my original having been crushed in a drinking-related car wreck with a pepper tree in 2005, so I should know fucking better.
I know I'm being an absolute dumbfuck but I can't stop.
I'll find motivation, stop for a bit, then just pick right back up.


I'm there for my kids and my ex (who I met in AA 10 years ago), I try to keep the kids on my days off, my work schedule is not fixed.
I'll go over to their place, 30 miles round-trip, bring some groceries, cook a meal, do the dishes, maybe spend the night, and then when I have to go back to my place because of my work obligations and their school obligations, the depression just washes over me.


I started drinking more  two years ago when I got laid off both my jobs due to the 'rona.
I never drank around her or the kids, I'd drink and toke on the apartment porch after everyone went to bed.
I don't care about myself at all, evident by all the tobacco, weed, booze, and dangerous behavior.
I'm heavy into this depression, I have very, very few friends.
I've been a family man for the last 10 years, now I'm mostly just a loser living with his folks.
I just found this subreddit recently and I think it's worth a shot.

The family and I all came down with COVID. Everyone was sick and the in-laws (who I love and admire) weren't able to come in from out of state to celebrate Christmas and spend time with their grandchildren. So my wife, children and I all stayed isolated in our home and had a sickly Christmas.

There wasn't much to do and appetites were non-existent so a lot of time was spent doing a lot of nothing. Watching whatever was on TV, some movies, some just sitting around on the couch. One afternoon I found myself sitting on the couch, the TV is on and I'm not paying attention to it while I mindlessly scroll Facebook. And Facebook had long since become the same thing over and over and over and over again. I finally took stock and realized I had gained absolutely nothing for the past half hour (or years, for that matter). Without really thinking about it, I closed the Facebook app and never opened it again.

I think that was on December 26th. Maybe it was the 28th. I don't remember.

Thankfully COVID curbed my alcoholic tendencies and I miraculously had no desire or inclination to drink. I mean, I really wanted to, but I was too sick to pour booze down my gullet. Thinking about that in retrospect is baffling. I'm thankful that I was sick and felt so terrible so it would keep me from purposely making myself feel so sick and terrible.

Once I kicked COVID I naturally went back to my daily pounding of booze in full force. Probably more so to make up for lost time.

I had my last drink on January 2nd.

No social media and no booze has been great and amazing.

Today an acquaintance sent me a message via Facebook messenger. So I read the message. And for shits and grins I hopped over to Facebook to see if I'd missed anything (fully knowing that I hadn't).

I kid you not, the first post that I saw was from my neighborhood Facebook group. Someone posted a meme that said something like: ""Remember when you were 16-years-old and your parents thought you were spending the night at your friend's house, but you were really dying of alcohol poisoning in a cornfield?""

And all of the replies were ""LOLOLOL"" and ""teehee"" and ""so true"" and ""OMG right?!?""

If only they knew.....

I got angry to the point where my ears got hot. Y'all know the feeling. So I closed Facebook. See, I knew there was nothing good going on there. 

Life's been much better without alcohol and social media (except for this group).

Happy Friday, everyone. Have some kombucha, bubbly water, tea, taffy, cookies, or whatever makes you happy and keeps you sober just for today. I will not drink with you today.",17,3

If they say We should get together  
say why?

Trees. The monastery bell at twilight.  
Tell them you have a new project.

Im 30 (f). I’m a social drinker. I go out 3 or so days a week, or have a drink at home with my husband. Generally I drink 3-4 days a week. I rarely have more than 3 drinks, I’d say I usually have 2. On rare occasion I’ll binge drink and have 5 or 6 while out. These days, If that happens I’ll be completely useless and chained to the toilet the next day. 

I generally feel in control with my drinking. I crave drinking some days after work but if I’m not going out I can easily ignore those cravings. it’s really hard for me to be out without drinking though. It’s not the amount or frequency that I’m drinking that I’m stressing about.It’s the side effects and how it’s impacting my life. 

- drinking is playing hangover roulette. Sometimes 2 drinks gives me a hangover, a pounding headache that lasts all day. Sometimes I feel perfectly fine. It’s a risk I take every time I take a sip. For some reason I like to gamble. 

- my face looks bloated. Sometimes I barely recognize who I am any more. My eyes look tiny because of how puffy I am 

- back to the unpredictable hangovers. When I have them I am bummed about life in general and have such a negative outlook. I have awful focus and productivity at work. I’m irritable and snappy with my kind husband. I have such a beautiful life and feel like every moment I’m hungover I’m just wasting it . I wish I didn’t get hangovers so badly (from 2 drinks!!) but i guess it’s my genes and the hand I was dealt. I also know I am damaging my teeth and stomach from throwing up often :( 

- weight gain. I eat pretty clean, I’ve been vegan for 12 years and load up on vegetables. I am active. Obviously hangover days I eat like crap. I’ve gained 20 lbs in the last 2 years and it’s super upsetting to me. I can barely look at my wedding photos without tearing up because I don’t recognize this person. 

- I struggle with social interactions without drinking. Moving to a new city right before Covid didn’t help and it also didn’t help that I didn’t do tons of socializing for a while. Drinking makes me feel more comfortable interacting. I just feel like an awkward person in general (always have) and drinking helps! 

I’m not sure what I wanted to accomplish from this post. I’m not sure what action I’m going to take. But I think I need to have a serious talk with myself about how much further I want to keep digging myself in this hole. How much longer will drinking serve a purpose in my life when right now it seems to be causing more harm than good? I need to choose my own rock bottom. In a perfect world I would only drink once or twice a week, but again, I’ll be playing roulette with the quality of my life.

I am dealing with a major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety at the moment. And the past two weeks i feel like i just threw the towel on myself. i have been talking to my friends, and It just clicked that I have accepted I'm an addict and I abuse substances like alcohol and weed. But what i hadn't accepted or owned that I'm different to my friends. 

I feel like maybe owning the fact that I have a tendency to abuse shit and that things are different for us (are they? I think they are.) Could be a way of liberating myself from this shit prison that doesn't let me live my life (whatever that means cuz apparently idk how to do that without abusing shit).

It was a massive wake up call. I almost lost my highly paid consulting job. I had to admit it to my wife, my new boss, my old boss (now a close friend who I need a letter for court from), spent $1700 on a lawyer, and it generally scared the shit out of me how much this one thing could have fucked my career and my life in general. Soon after I stopped drinking and good things followed. I got promoted at work, I went on a health kick and lost 12 kgs and got fairly shredded. I started meditating daily and went on retreats. I also stopped a bunch of other Addictive and self destructive behaviours. Basically I just felt like I was living my best life.

After the pandemic hit I changed jobs and approx 1 year ago was offered a promotion at a big company to run a team.  I remember thinking at the time that I knew this job would be fucking hard and I needed to stay strong to keep from relapsing. A year later I have been drinking regularly. Let my health go to shit, I've put on 17kgs, started smoking both weed and tobacco again. My appearance has changed significantly. I always had a baby face and people thought I was much younger than I am. Now my hair is Gray and thinning and I see an overweight middle aged man when I look back in the mirror. Although I've been pretty successful in my new job, I have alienated a bunch of people by being a 'know it all' and sometimes a hard ass which has probably been career limiting too. 

I just returned to Australia after 7 weeks in the UK working nights where my drinking was getting out of hand. I was polishing off a few beers and wines every night and generally eating terribly. 

Today I've decided it needs to stop. I feel like I'm at a cross roads where if I don't rein this shit in I'll regret it forever. The hardest thing in Australia is the social aspect of drinking. Literally everybody drinks at social events and its a lot of temptation. I'm going to a BBQ with friends today and will just knock back a bunch of diet cokes or Kombucha to get through it I guess.

I wanted to have a record of my feelings right now. Exactly 20 days ago I went out with friends thinking I could drink just a little bit since I'd been so good during the holidays. That didn't happen, I ended up drinking way too much. Next day my friends started sharing videos and pictures of the previous day. It felt so wrong to look at myself in those pictures & don't remember taking them. This is the first time this has happened to me. There is no evidence whatsoever of my many years of alcohol abuse since the trend of taking pictures for every and any event is something relatively recent. Nowadays there's always the mandatory picture at some point of the event but is usually at the beginning when everyone is pretty much sober. But not this time, this time those pictures were taken at the end of the night when I was pretty much gone and 'drunk me' had taken the wheel.

I look so happy in these pictures but it feels like I'm looking at someone else. It really freaked me out seeing me like that. This time drunk me didn't do much other than pass out on the ride home, but in the past she fought with people that love her & made them worry, she hurt herself and left scars all over.

I finally started some steps to address my drinking. I talked to my psychiatrist, they referred me to an Alcohol Abuse Program and I have my first appointment next week. I also joined this amazing community. I really hope this time sticks.",14,0

I started chronic binge drinking at the start of the pandemic, it got to the point where I was drinking anywhere from 1 to 2 pints of rum/whiskey a day. I really wanted to quit. January 1st I did quit. This last weekend I relapse and drank just under 2 pints in 2 days. Woke up Monday hung over which would be expected, just kept guzzling water and going back to sleep. After noon I began vomiting and couldn’t keep water down but I still just treated it like a bad hangover, no big deal. I tried spacing out my vomiting and water consumption hoping just taking smaller sips would help. I thought it did. I went to sleep, woke up still feeling bad, puked again an hour after getting up, then commenced the nonstop vomiting and desperate need for water. By the time I got to the ER late in the morning Tuesday I was taking a very bad turn. I couldn’t sit up or catch my breath, my whole body hurt and I couldn’t describe to you how desperate I was for water. It was pure misery. I was hospitalized 3 days trying to recover. My electrolytes were very bad, my bloody was very acidic, I lost 6 lbs in just those 3 days. My Anion Gap was 31 mmol/L a normal range is 3-10 mmol/L.

It was very scary how in a matter of a day and a half after my last drink I was in the hospital fighting for my life for a moment there. The doctors and nurses took very good care of me and put me back together. I’m doing much better though still feeling tired and sore. 

I knew relapsing could be dangerous but I really had no idea that this could happen. I had been drinking so heavy without this happening before. I’m thankful I got the help I needed and recovered. It could have gone very differently for me.

This experience makes me feel like I can’t ever let myself get relax with alcohol again. I got with my doctors and psychiatrists and am going to make sure I give myself the best support I can to recover from my AUD and be sober life-long.

The hallucinations were so vivid he thought the police were kidnapping him when they were called because he was so hard to restrain. How can a 88 year old be so strong.

Alone the second night at the house because my fiance is helping at the g-parents house I couldn't stop myself. I just needed to be numbed from the helplessness I feel towards the situation, what a stupid excuse.


Bought a 10$ bottle of white wine, I was never even a wine guy I just knew what would happen with a fifth of vodka. I down the bottle in about a hour and all of those days dry for nothing. Almost two years of no drinking for some half ass little buzz I hated.


The question is has anyone slipped up and honestly hated the feeling? Is this healing?

Not the guilt and emotional part that is expected, the physical feeling of it. The feeling of peace and numbness I was craving to deal with stress can come with meditation and hobbies, two things alcohol never let me do.

What other steps do you do when family stress can be too much?

After doing a Detox December, I realized how much better I feel, act and decision make when not drinking. I have slowly been slipping back into drinking, but I know with strong will and remembering those Saturday mornings not being hungover, that I can achieve it.

One idea I had was having monetary rewards for not drinking and blowing money at the bar. For example, I would love to start collecting vinyl records, and could treat myself to 1-2 a week with the money I save from not drinking.

I was curious if anyone else did anything like this as a way to get the ball rolling, and if so how you handled it and how it made you feel. I have tons of other questions but figured I would start here.

But three years ago today was the last time I took a drink of alcohol. I told myself at the time afterwards, ""That was the last one. You have to stop"".

A year earlier, at one of my lowest points, I'd stopped cold turkey (not knowing the dangers of that). 3 days later I had a grand mal seizure in front of a bunch of people I work with. Ambulance came. Was in the ER with my confused wife. The worst feeling ever. For months afterwards, I would see an ambulance driving down the road with its lights on or I'd see an empty stretcher while at the hospital and I would have PTSD-related panic.

Even after that insane incident it took me another year to finally be done with booze forever (I hope).

It was the best decision I've ever made. My life is much better for it. My relationship with my wife is better than ever. My kids never have to see me drunk again.

It's still really hard. I hope it gets easier, but I'm not counting on it. I'm ok with the struggle as long as I don't get back to where I used to be.

I have basically fully resumed the normal social lifestyle with everyone who drinks. I was worried it’s gonna be tough, but at this point it really is a cakewalk. 

Also got an echocardiogram of the heart — no structural abnormalities, so the PVCs are due to anxiety/nervous system issues. They no longer really worry me and annoy me less and less.

It was a terrible night resulting in me becoming fueled with rage and smashing a glass picture frame across my knee while screaming angrily at my partner. What did she do to upset me so? I think it had something to do with her making an assumption. 

That's not me. My friends wouldn't describe me as being an angry person, or one who violently snaps. 

Alcohol fucked up my brain chemistry, big time. 

Yesterday I was frolicking around Manhattan with a close friend from college. The energy of the City was great. It was a beautiful warm day. 

We sat in a hole-in-the-wall sushi spot chatting after spending hours looking at art. 

Before I got sober, I would drink in moderation with her while we were together, as she's not a big drinker and I wouldn't want her to know. Maybe a beer or a sake. Sip it slowly. But, when she got on her train to go, I would've met up with other friends at our favorite Irish bar, and drank more. Eventually I would've gotten on my train, not before stopping at a spot in Grand Central to pick up a road drink. Open carry is allowed on Metro-North. 

I would've rolled into my station, most likely not safe to drive, but ""I'm fine"" I'd insist to myself, I know these roads. I would stop at a gas station and get a big bottle of smart water and some gum. Chug the water and chew the gum, make it home and try and convince my partner that I wasn't nearly as drunk as I was. 

We would've opened a bottle/can together and I would've continued until inevitable blackout. 

Instead, I hugged my friend and got on my train and met my lady for a delicious dinner. 

On the train I was thinking about how I wanted to drink, but not really, it's like I wanted to WANT to drink, and I think that strange weird urge/but not urge is because: yesterday I broke a pattern. How many times did that exact scenario play out in my life? So many fun days/nights spent in the City but always with alcohol at the helm. 

Now, it was me in control. It was ME who was enjoying herself, enjoying the connection, enjoying the laughter with an old friend. It wasn't alcohol controlling me. I'm still ME.

 Good morning. 
 Our keynote is “Gratitude”.
 Today’s reading stresses the importance of waiting patiently for God‘s guidance. It warns that too much unguided and frantic activity will mar our work and spiritually hobble us.
 I need to be mindful of the difference between activity and action.
 Activity is speaking and acting (often rashly and frantically) without sufficient aforethought or consciousness of God.
In so acting, I am usually motivated by fear or some other manifestation of self.
My mind is clouded and my soul diminished. I am robbed of effectiveness, peace and the ability to properly consider the impact of my behavior on others.
 Action, on the other hand, is patiently seeking to do the right thing, as guided by the Divine Spark. With that angle of approach, I am moved toward effectiveness, peace, harmony with my fellows and awareness of God’s Magic.
 I pray today to take quiet, prayerful action and avoid frantic and/or aimless activity which corrodes my soul.

Today marks 41 days for me, the longest stretch for me.  I read posts every day and it helps, so thank you everyone.  I drink a ton of coffee, tea (mostly herbal), and sparkling water.  The tea specifically in the evenings keeps me busy (have to get up and make another cup - just like I used to mix another drink).  

Benefits are beginning to pile up.  I have lost about 15 lbs, but also haven't really exercised much.  Would like to get that started soon.  I had lost more but then my body finally started hydrating!  My skin is much better, less dry. I am less bloated.  I am still fluctuating through bursts of energy and being extremely exhausted.  I really hope to see continued improvement.  Next demon to tackle is smoking cigs but that belongs to a different sub haha.  Then I will focus on diet and exercise, but for right now IWNDWYT!

One of the annoying things right now are the relapse dreams. I’ve also read others posting about these.

The first time I had a relapse dream I started dumping booze out in the dream. I was elated to wake up and realize it was only a dream. 

This past night I had another dream where the relapse wasn’t even the center of the dream (I won’t go into details as the dream was strange and random, as dreams often are). Anyway, this time the dream ended and I was in that semi conscious state and remember thinking literally to myself, “you did it this time, that wasn’t a dream”. Then I realized it was! I felt a bit of relief, but also a little bit of unease. 

Truly dreams don’t define our actions, but I feel like this happens every night. I sometimes have small cravings, but NA drinks have really helped me limit those. Not sure why my unconscious mind always has me drinking. Maybe it was always that way and I just didn’t think anything of it before. 

Anyways, felt like getting that out of my brain. So appreciate the space to do it. Whether my dreams are visages of a past self, or continued reminders and warnings from my self conscious (or both), I do know one thing for sure. My waking self will not be drinking today. 

I appreciate each and every one of you for helping me along the way.

I’d been feeling a little down and yucky and unhealthy.. It’s been good that I wasn’t drinking, but to compensate and kill the cravings I was eating a little too much and waking up with stomach aches, smoking more weed, and I haven’t been able to bring myself to get into an exercise routine yet so I’ve been a bit sedentary. I was in a place where I needed to focus on not drinking and only that, and it was working, but I was being a bit hard on myself about the other, less-than-healthy things I’ve been doing lately. So I said fuck it, and was drinking and vaping for hours last night. And let me tell you, I feel worse and more unhealthy this morning than I did every morning I was sober combined. Suddenly, eating a bit too much and being a lazy bum if I need to doesn’t seem so bad. I know someday I’ll need to make all of my habits healthier, but last night reminded me that alcohol is BY FAR the most unhealthy and harmful thing for me, and that it’s okay to only focus on not drinking for now. I now see that I was actually taking good strides with my health before, even if I have to do it in baby steps and a little slower than everyone else. Eating better and exercising will just have to come with time for me, and that is a-okay. One thing at a time, one day at a time.

She was saying that she was home sick and scared.
I called an ambulance, the police would more likely have locked her up and she was paranoid and scared of ""being taken away"". I know what it is like to be locked up in the midst of a breakdown and I didn't want that for my mate.
I made here a sweet caramel latte and sat with her, I reassured her that she was safe and in no trouble and I managed to calm her down. The Ambulance service arrived and I explained calmly what was going on.

Yesterday I almost relapsed because of all of the stress and other deep shit that is going on, I am proud and calm today and I thank God I was in a fit position to help my friend, she is going to need alot of love and support.
The male paramedic was gorgeous and we seemed to click over our shared ""crazy"" an ""meds"" he knew the score. we had a good laugh in the end and I told my mate off for leaving her bloody false eyelashes laying all over the place, I told her that she is not mental, ( like she kept saying)..
I told her she was ""crazy"" like the rest of the human race and that she is safe and very loved.

The housing management and Ambulance crew thanked me as they left and I am glad I have my first Aid training.
I plan on starting my next course in pediatric first Aid and I will book that next week.

I don't know if it's a good thing or not.,"To be very clear: I recognize and accept that I can never go back to alcohol. Every time I have tried to moderate, I have failed. By and large, I believe that my excessive drinking damaged my career, my relationship, and my ability to live a healthy, happy, and fulfilling life. 

Regardless, I am having a very difficult time negotiating life without alcohol. In some respects, I no longer recognize myself. 

For context: I'm from the United States, but I live in India. My fiancée is Indian, and we're planning to stay here until she applies for and gets into a doctoral program in America. 

I've spent a substantial portion of my life here in India, even though I am not ethnically Indian. I genuinely love this country: I studied Hindi in university, won a fully-funded Hindi-language fellowship,   and did limited graduate-level research on social discord in east-central India. 

Since I've stopped drinking, I've lost much of my interest in being here. I've barely gone outside in the past two months. I have limited interest in interacting with strangers, traveling to new places, and do many of the things I used to enjoy. By and large, I have contented myself by focusing on work, playing video games, and reading. 

Coming here used to be the highlight of my every year. Now, I actively fantasize about being back in the United States, away from the non-stop noise pollution, rubbish, and endless staring. 

I guess all this might sound silly. However, these are things that never used to bother me before. I have spent *years* of my life here in India; at this point, I'm just as Indian as I am American (barring my skin color and ancestry lol). 

I just... don't understand what's going on. I don't think I'm depressed. My relationship is great; we're getting married in a matter of weeks. 

I'm not sure what advice I want, or what help /r/stopdrinkig can give. I've certainly been tempted to resume drinking, but my fiancée has been supportive and I feel like my cravings are under control. 

I just can't recognize myself or make sense of my behavior and sudden shift in interest and priorities. For fuck's sake: I make good money writing copy in my underwear, yet here I am, contemplating whether I should go to fucking law school. 

Maybe I just needed to vent, lol.

I’ve been drinking since my junior year of high school. I started drinking heavily at 18 and kept it up in to my early 30’s. My normal weeknight was a bottle of wine and half a bottle of whiskey after work, weekends would start much earlier. But for the grace of God or just plain dumb luck I didn’t end up getting a DUI or wrapped around a tree or worse. I starting slowing down a little as I got older and for the last couple years I’d have a couple drinks maybe a couple nights a week.

I turned alcohol into a career, first as a liquor store manger, then a bartender, then working sales for a distributor. 

My wife started commenting on how often I forget things. Picking up groceries, which kid I’m picking up, what our plans are for the weekend, etc. I was more and more irritable, angry, and had a short temper with my kids especially.

We discussed my medical history, and I was honest with him about my drinking. The doctor said, “I don’t think you’re bipolar. Did you know that alcohol abuse can cause mania? Yes I think you’re depressed, and you are an alcoholic.” That hit me hard. A heavy drinker yes, but I never considered myself an alcoholic. But… he’s right. 

I changed careers shorter after. I was tired of working in food and beverage after 20 years of it. 

I also started to notice that I would have more memory problems when I drank more. I tested it. A week sober and things would get better. Drink a bottle of wine with our friends Saturday night and I’d be lost for half of the next week, longer if I kept going. So I cut back more. One beer, maybe two. One glass of wine instead of a bottle. No dice, still felt like crap and still couldn’t remember anything. 

So… I decided to stop with the start of 2022. To see what would happen. To see if memory comes back. To see if my mind comes back. My patience for my kids comes back. My ability to be an active member my family and partner with my wife in our life. 

The cravings started about two weeks ago, most acutely in the morning of all things. I want a beer, badly, on the way to work. I’m ok at night so far. 

I’ve turned down my first offered drink at a friends house last weekend. My sleep has been messed up for about the same amount of time. 

But I’m thinking more clearly. I’m remembering things more at home, and processing tasks better at work. 

So here I am, 41 days, sober. I want to see where this goes.",17,1

Monday hit and I decided not to. Let me run it down first, I have some other posts here and haven't been on here for uhh a year? Maybe less. 2020 I had it bad, I was drinking at one point 18 shots a day + beers. Getting sick everyday, waiting for that 4-5pm timeslot to hit to take the edge off. I was hooked in bad. Barely could go from midnight to 5pm the next day after work to hit it. Every morning, in the backyard behind the shed throwing up feeling like trash. Every damn day. I cut back, I cut more, had some f'd up times during thanksgiving 2020 where I didn't drink at all until 1 beer at dinner and that set it off. I got sick as hell that night into friday into saturday with stupid rooster going off at a farm down the road. Then I went sober for 12 days. I'm sure similar cycles for people are familiar. 

2021 hit - I got better, then I got worse, and better and worse. I barely could go a day, and if I did I'd 'make up for it' the next day. Well, I stopped that too. I got it under 8 drinks a day for a long while. Recently within last part of 2021 I increased and realized - wait this feels like 2020 if I don't knock this crap off! Thanksgiving hit, no issues, xmas hit no issues, no trouble with in laws or family or anything like that. I started throwing in more sober days in January, every other day type stuff. Then started doing more and more and so far that's been pretty good. 

I've been sober since monday feb 7th. I don't know how or why either, it was wierd - I just didn't do my normal thing. Mondays are hardest because everyone leaves house for a few hours, so I usually use that as an excuse to prepare dinner using wine to get it on my breath so I can drink later. I didn't do that this time. Instead, I cooked dinner, everyone got home and we ate. Next day, same thing, same thing same thing until now. Now it's 4th day and actually day 5 friday and that's where things usually get off the rails. 

However, I'm ok with it. I went from addicted physically getting sick to cutting way back and feel comfortable as I decided what I'm going to do now. I know I can be sober if I want to and I don't have the physical part holding me back so I guess ok this is weird. 

I guess if I can do such things, if you got something similar going on, you'd be surprised how strong you can be when you are ready to be.",4,0

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This post goes up at:

* US - Night/Early Morning
* Europe - Morning
* Asia and Australia - Evening/Night

**“No” is a complete sentence.”  - lots of people**

**Boundaries! They’re complicated-- largely when they don’t exist.** I can’t claim to be any kind of expert on setting and maintaining boundaries, as I’ve only just really started to exercise the use of boundaries in the past couple of years. I’ll say this though: I surely didn’t have as many when I was drinking. I thought I owed my job everything I could give, because I felt guilty about drinking. Wake up with a hangover? Obviously work a 10 hour day and take on a weekend professional event. To say nothing of the lack of boundaries and limits I’ve had in past relationships of all stripes - familial, romantic, platonic. To make up for my shame, you see. Yeah. That shit is not sustainable. 

I like to fall back on the “walls keep everyone out; boundaries show people where the door is.” I can think of no metaphor more apt than this. The clear-headedness of sobriety can really wallop us with the realization that perhaps we lacked some boundaries in our professional, personal, and family lives. I can’t speak for any of you, of course, but if I wasn’t taking care of my needs and my body, I couldn’t possibly have had healthy boundaries with those around me. So over the past few years, boundaries for me have looked like: not responding to work texts when they’re not truly urgent and certainly not sending any when it’s a day off; giving myself space from a friend when the balance of give/get is upset; going to bed early and when I need to and not just staying up late because my partner is a freakish night owl (bless); saying NO to stuff I really don’t want to attend. Just, “no.”

**What do some healthy boundaries look like for you?  What’s been easy about maintaining them? What’s been tough? How have they supported you on your alcohol-free journey?**

I think I’m gonna wait till my 9th step and I’ll do an amend for him but I see him a lot and I’m not sure if I should say something now and possibly make it awkward/cross boundaries or wait till I’m sober longer and do amends.

Something that was interesting that I was able to look up on myself was this one gene variant he mentioned that greatly turns on the bodies defenses against disease and aging (or in other words, repair) and I was able to look it up on myself since I'd done 23andme.  The gene variant is FOXO3 (rs2764264) and having 1 C is good, 2 Cs is really good and the latter has good odds of reaching 95 if they live well.  Turns out I have two Cs, which of course I felt great about.

Then it got me thinking, all the things this book is about is how our bodies have a number of internal things that repair us and ways in which they get turned on and off and how that affects how we age.  One part of addiction is very high tolerance for substances and misery, makes me wonder if one part of being an addict is having these repair genes on high that give us such high tolerances and keep us going through what average people shouldn't be able to do.",2,0

I finished it just as I hit two weeks clean time after six years of active addiction. That thesis is 72,000 words, 247 pages and 5 years of my life. Those five years were very unpleasant. These two weeks have been good. 

The fact that I completed it this evening, sober as a judge, is as satisfying as finishing up the work itself. 

My first week sober was a mess and my productivity was at 0. But around day 7/8, my mind sharpened and my mood improved, and I found a new lease of patience and energy I hadn’t experienced in a long time. I’ve been working so hard this last week to hit my deadline and I did it. So many people, including my parents and my PhD supervisor, thought I didn’t have the chops for it but fuck, it seems I do! Well, sober me does. I don’t blame anyone for doubting me, in active addiction I was a shell of my former self. 

That I even managed to finish after years and years of depression, sadness, unhappiness.. you know, all that stuff that goes with addiction. I feel really empowered right now. And spurred on to stay sober. It’s such a good association for my brain to have: stay sober and complete your biggest goal to date.

I have gone a month or two at a time totally sober, but mostly my work has left me from drinking a ton of whiskey every night to a few beers a week, not drinking at all most days and not touching liquor at all.

I felt healthier sober, but my job is very good but very stressful and I have a family with young kids who I love more than anything, but also add to my daily stress toll. And sober I felt like there was no release valve and the stress built up. Tried running, meditation, playing music, joining groups, and it all helped ... a bit, but not enough and the building stress makes them feel low priority.

A bit more than 2 weeks ago had a huge fight with my wife, said fuck it and bought a bottle of whiskey my first in nearly a year. That led to 4 bottles total over 2 weeks having a few drinks a night, not drinking like a psycho like I used to. I thought of it as a sabbatical and cut it back out when I hit the two week mark. Back to sober living.

Here is the thing, the stress had been building and making me uncharacteristically fragile and irritable. I was having trouble focusing on my demanding job and young family. Those two weeks I was on it. Killing it at work, more patient and attentive with my family. Knocking out projects and keeping up with the house (no mean feat with a 4 and 1 year old). No one noticed I was drinking again, but I got a lot of comments about how much better I seemed and happier and productive. My kids wanted to play more and I was up for it. I was funny and affable again.

Now I am right back. Crumbling under the pressure, annoyed at the kids for being wild and unruly after I had a hard day at work. Irritated that my wife isn't helping with them or the house. Literally just laid down and cried at how much today defeated me, and I never cry.

I'm obviously posting here because I still think I need to hear how much worse it is drinking, because it doesn't fucking seem like it is worse right now. I don't know. 

It's like I can kick the bottle, but I can't find anything else that lets me release the day knowing I have to do it again tomorrow. I don't think I could maintain my more casual drinking pace from that two weeks long term, but the instinct to do what is working until life slows down is strong.",12,0

Turns out I’ve had Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis for 8 years (lesions on my spine and brain via MRI showed this) 

My neurologist said I was self medicating and that alcohol was helping my symptoms of MS. I was angry bc how could a poison help me? Naturally I fell off the wagon after my diagnosis, this didn’t go well. I’m sober now but I refuse to believe alcohol eased my symptoms with MS. 

I don’t know how to reconcile the fact that I self medicated and now the medication I take makes me so sick. It almost seems like alcohol is better than IVS, steroids, and pain meds. I know I’m just justifying but how do you deal with a disease that alcohol helps the symptoms?? Sorry if this post is triggering",15,0

I’m VERY freshly sober.. my last drink was 5 days ago. This is the most serious I’ve been about quitting. It’s the worst my mental and physical health has ever been. (You can read my previous post for all of that).

I usually cave around this time. The cravings today were hellacious. Like so intense I almost called off work tomorrow morning and went to the liquor store so i could party all night tonight. 

I’ve had 2 people invite me out to “get margs” and another to hang out and drunk study. None of these people know about my alcoholism and I don’t want to just say “sorry, but I’m a raging alcoholic and I will destroy my life if I continue to drink with you.” These are people I’ve partied with before heavily, so they KNOW I drink and they know I can drink hard… I’m embarrassed to tell them I’m really done from now on. 

How would you word it? I don’t want them to stop asking me to hang out, but I DO want them to stop asking me to drink because it’s INSANELY tempting to me and I spend all day thinking about it. Like seriously, I spent all. day. long. fighting to not say “screw it, I’ll try again another time.” I obsess over it, and think of excuses i could use to call in, to get out of seeing my parents, or what to tell my other friends who know I’m trying to get sober if they were to see me out “getting margs”. It’s sick and obsessive. 

I’m very determined to get it right this time. I desperately want to. This part is hard though, what do you/did you say when people invited you out??

Edit: I also just wanted to say thank you in advance for your responses. I’m going to sleep because I AM going to work tomorrow. I chose not to drink today, and tomorrow will be day 6. It’s not much but it’s the first time I’ve made it to 6 days in a while and this group has helped so much. I’ve looked at it every single day. Thank you for all of your words. Goodnight!!",5,0

This is my fifth attempt at getting fully sober, and I’m hoping that this time I can stick with it. 

Alcohol has totally ruined my life ever since I began go drink at 18. I’m now 24 and it still continues to ruin everything. 

On average I drink around 5-8 bottles of wine a week, and a couple of spirits with mixers, but lately I feel my productivity at work dwindling and I’m beginning to have a lot of pain in my abdomen after drinking which is freaking me out big time. I’m also getting into a lot of arguments with my partner and displaying a lot of behaviour I regret. So i’m determined to give sobriety another go. 

I’ve had to be honest with myself, and realise that moderation isn’t something that I am capable of doing. It’s either nothing or it’s drinking till I pass out, no in between. 

Does anyone have any recommendations on how to make this process any easier? Books, podcasts etc? I’m currently on day 3 and struggling with the insomnia and stomach issues.

I’ve had to hit the reset button a few times. I always seem to reset it after going 5 or 6 days without alcohol. I feel motivated to stay sober during the week, but I cave during the weekend. It seems better than drinking almost everyday (which is what I used to do), but I realize life without alcohol would be so much better. I’m wondering if I should try moderating for awhile before quitting altogether, but I realize that’s kind of a pipe dream.",21,0

Have posted in this sub before, but using a throwaway account because I believe some of my friends and colleagues know my main username. 

Been struggling for a long while. Last night I reached a new low. 

Yesterday was hard. I had a panic attack in the morning, tried to power through. By the afternoon I was still shaky and really struggling to hold it together (I work from home) so I had a few glasses of wine to take the edge off, which is (sadly) nothing new for me. Ran out of wine, had a heavy pour of whiskey. Felt fine, light buzz, nothing too intense. 

I had plans with a friend in the evening, so after work I headed out, bought a bottle of wine, and headed to her place. After being there for about an hour I noticed I was seeing double vision... I didn't want to bail on her so early in the night, so I stuck around for another hour and a bit, and then headed out. I barely remember leaving. I vaguely remember getting into an Uber, and I have zero recollection of the car ride or arriving home. 

The next thing I remember... I've fallen down the stairs, and my poor partner is rushing down to make sure I'm okay. Somehow made it back to bed. Woke up at 5am sweating in a panic... and deeply sore, but no coherent memories of what transpired. Tried to go back to sleep. 

Woke up at 8am and with the help of my *unbelievably patient* partner who I *absolutely don't deserve*, and my phone records, I pieced it together: I got home at 10pm, and she said it's the most drunk she's ever seen me (which is saying something). She said I was completely unresponsive, couldn't talk or answer questions. I came in and passed out in her lap on the couch for a few hours. Around midnight I got up and tried to use the bathroom, which is when I fell down the stairs. 

Today I'm ashamed, apologetic, sheepish, hungover as fuck, and unbelievably sore. I have a bruise the size of Texas on my hip, where I guess I landed when I fell down the stairs. My shoulder and one of my fingers are also fucked up, black and blue. I'm extremely lucky and grateful I didn't break a bone, or break my neck. 

I've somehow (barely) lasted through a work day... one shaky Zoom meeting at a time... but my god you guys. I'm so mad at myself, and so ashamed. 

Fuck alcohol. Just a few weeks ago my partner broke down crying, and told me she didn't like being around me when I was drunk... I said I'd do better, and I didn't. I'm unbelievably lucky she's still supportive. 

The silver lining? A renewed and intense reason to get sober, stay sober. 

Again, fuck alcohol. IWNDWYT.",25,0

Funny how some of they lyrics in this song are actually relevant to so many of us....

Something about 'it' being someone else's fault, having a new tattoo, limping due to injuries... Then resonating it's his (own) own damn fault... hm.

***THAT BEING SAID***

I am 40 days sober. I decided 2 weeks ago to make the impulsive decision to book an all inclusive tropical vacation. I had booked with the intention of maintaining my very fragile early sobriety just shy of 4 weeks. I was also planning for grace if I was unable to maintain but not to allow the devil on the shoulder speak too loudly.

And by Jimmy Buffet, **I DID IT**. Well, I did cave to ordering a glass of wine (Off resort...why the fudge would I pay for it?) to watch the last day's sunset. (I have a story regarding that location and the sunsets are cliche yet poignant for me.) In the moment, I felt that it was what I needed to complete the imagined perfection. Three sips in and I tossed it, it wasn't as good as I remembered and the taste actually took away from the experience. I will not reset my badge for half a glass of crappy wine that negatively affected my moment. I will also not allow the choices to order and subsequently toss the wine dictate my success. I will also not allow a learning experience take away from an (almost) perfect sunset.

I made it 6 days in an environment saturated with the acceptance of drunken debauchery and I've resumed the streak immediately after I tossed the remainder. Here is to the 41st day and most importantly, to today.

As the girl who partakes in the 9 am mimosas and 3 am tequilas, if I can do it - anyone can. It's hard. It's real flipping difficult but holy smokes is it worth it.

“No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.”

I’ve never traced it back but want to say if you’re here and especially if you’re very young, I hope you get to see how strong (and also how smart and how charismatic) you’ll be if you let yourself naturally develop. My youngest days were pretty badly disrupted at home and in my 20s, I drank a fair amount to cope. In my 30s, I found out I was much smarter, for example, than I thought I was because I actually seriously focused on skills like math without disruption for the first time.

Blacked out for a few days most recently this week. Had a seizure, thought I was going to die. Got myself involved with some really bad stuff with a really bad tweaker guy because I was lonely I guess, will need to get tested as I have very few memories and woke up naked in bed. My good friends had to give up on me which I completely understand. My car is gone.

But I'd like to get there. I've been subscribed to this sub for a while now, as seeing the posts enter my feed randomly is little hits of positive re-enforcement that I need. 

I've managed a few steps so far:

1) Go to a party, and only have 2 drinks.  
2) Go to a party and have zero drinks. (Twice now!)  
3) Stop having drinks at home without company. (It's been almost 2 months!)

Step number 3 specifically is tricky. I can have wine or liquor standing by without temptation, but if there's any beer or cider in the fridge, I cannot help myself. I've been buying packs of kombucha from Costco, and I find having 1 every two days sort of stomps that craving. I tried NA beer, but that didn't work for me sadly, it didn't quite hit the same.

I've just learned it's really easy to make at home, so I'm going to hopefully start home brewing kombucha soon!

Also, a big thank you to everyone sharing their stories and progress. I'm not a cold turkey kind of person, but the little snippets of positive re-enforcement from you all has gotten my farther than I'd ever have thought. Here's to more progress!

My life had become me working through the week just so I could go out and drink and spend my hard earned money on booze and be social. 
I associated drinking with having a good time or getting laid. Eventually I got into other drugs that go hand-in-hand with alcohol and found myself partying from Friday night to Sunday night in one go. 
I’d consider myself to have a pretty decent job and considered myself to be doing something everyone does. 
This whole idea of “work hard, play hard”. This New Years rolled around and I just decided to stop drinking for a while. 
I told myself “not today”. Anytime someone offers me a drink, I just says “not today”. People ask me if I’ve quit drinking and I just say “ not drinking today”. 
Over the last month and change I found so much free time to focus on myself. Alcohol was the reason I would be drained until Wednesday of every week but now I feel so energized all the time.

I went 32 days in August of 2021, tried to convince myself I could moderate, and by November I was drinking every day again.  I was tired, bloated, irritable, and exhausted by the constant mental balancing act that is inherent in the moderation process:   
\-Is it too early to have a drink?  I wouldn't want to drink before 5 (or noon on the weekends!), because that's what alcoholics do.    
\-Is it too late to have a drink?  I can't drink past 8 or I'll feel like shit tomorrow.  (and that's what alcoholics do)   
\-Have I drank liquor more than two days in a row?   I need to switch to wine.  Because only alcoholics drink liquor consistently.   
\-What did I do to do deserve a drink today?  Work hard?  Exercise?  Celebrating something?  I need a reason because only alcoholics drink without a good reason.    


I, like many elder millenials, committed to doing dry January.  Not having to have that constant internal dialogue around moderating was such a relief I decided to keep going.  It occurred to me today that this is the longest I've been without a drink in 10 years, and 39 days, while commendable, is not a long time in the grand scheme.  I think I'm ready to admit that I am, while not a stereotypical ""drunk"", an alcoholic.  It's what I've been afraid of saying for a long time, but it's relief to see it spelled out.

I grew up with a mentally ill, emotionally abusive mother, and unfortunately I've been living with her again temporarily (which will soon change) and it brings up a lot of shit for me. I was abused during a four-year relationship. I had to get out of there or I knew he would seriously hurt me one day. I have never felt like I was worth anything. The things I've gone through made me bitter, resentful and self-pitying and I have been stuck in that mindset for so long. And alcohol keeps me in that mindset.

I'm so scared of what lies at the end of that dark tunnel if I keep drinking. I want to be hopeful again, the way I used to be.

I’ve been (almost perfectly) dry for six weeks. I was drinking pretty heavily in the months before — averaging perhaps a bottle of wine a day. To be honest. Which I wasn’t. When I stopped I did not have withdrawals, but I was not going well.

Some nights since have not been easy. This post is not about that. It’s about why it’s worth it.

The feeling after not drinking for six weeks for me is absolutely incredible. Instead of drinking at night, I do things: I read, I write, most importantly I sit with myself and discover what I have been trying to avoid.

I’ve lost fifteen pounds. That’s partly just literally not having the calories, partly because I am now not too hungover to run in the morning, and partly because I actually enjoy food: I eat well,  I cook for myself, not too much. My clothes fit.

My friends notice. I drank pretty secretly, so the only real signs were stupid text messages I sent. But what they notice (I think) is that I’m more alert and alive.

My social life has gotten much better. Because I’m dealing with my self, I have more depth. I’m not constantly seeking a high of approval from others. I’m not as sensitive to little things.

My work life has gotten better. I’m better at making difficult decisions. When I make a bad decision, I’m able to reflect on it. I don’t rush to have a drink, I sit with it, face it, try to understand what was really going on.

I also understand more about why others are struggling. A few friends have told me they’re severely depressed, but also that they drink every night—maybe they can go a day or two without, but that’s as far as they try. I think they would discover a lot of they stopped.

It was a long time coming for me. I read a lot here about people months in who aren’t seeing real results (although the weight loss and physical health—that happens without fail). I’ve been in therapy for years with someone good, and it’s finally making a dent, maybe that helps.

I have a lot of struggles. Honestly the thing I’m most worried about is getting too over confident, feeling like it’s all great and I can “go back”. I almost did last night. But I didn’t, and I was working today and thought wow, it’s 11 am and I’m totally clear headed and firing on all cylinders. I’m really glad I “procrastinated” drinking the night before (I just said oh I’ll get off the couch later, but I’ll just watch this movie first).

I know the sub description says that this is a community for stopping or controlling drinking, and right now I’m more in the “controlling” bucket. But then the rules say only to post while sober, and I can’t tell if that means immediately sober or long-term sober.  Like “being sober” can mean “currently in a state of sobriety” or “currently not planning to drink ever again.”

I would very much like to be able to share my attempts to significantly reduce and control my drinking with people who understand, but I absolutely don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable, so I would love guidance on this. 



If it is okay, here’s my story:

I (F26) have always liked drinking a little too much. I remember being 17, when I first started drinking, and taking a shot of vodka that I’d stolen from my parents liquor cabinet before going to a very sober party. Even then I thought “well, this isn’t healthy”

In college I began binge drinking, but only on weekends. I had always been the weird, nerdy kid, and when I drank I felt like I fit in. It became the way I bonded with pretty much everyone. 

Thankfully, schoolwork and a strong commitment to sports kept my drinking somewhat check in college. I would get WAY too drunk on a regular basis (blacking out, throwing up, falling down) but I only really drank two days a week. 

I did notice that as my friends started getting more responsible about their drinking, we started drifting apart. 

After college I eventually learned to stop drinking as heavily, but I started drinking a lot more often. My ex-girlfriend and I dated for three months before we ever hung out sober. We got in the habit of each finishing a bottle of wine pretty much every night. 

That girlfriend and I dated for 2.5 years and we definitely encouraged each other’s drinking. We broke up at the beginning of quarantine and I started dating someone new. We’ll call her “Emily.” She was my wake up call. 

Emily was an alcoholic. I found bottles of vodka in her car. She regularly passed out from drinking. And she even got put on probation at work for having alcohol in her system. But because I liked drinking so much, I didn’t say anything. I saw how it was hurting her, but I felt like a hypocrite “criticizing” it. 

My drinking had gotten worse too. I drank every night from when work ended onward. I was often too hungover to do my job. I craved alcohol all the time. 

Emily and I broke up in November 2020 and thankfully, her parents stepped in and got her to go to rehab. She’s now been sober for over a year and is one of my best friends. I am so incredibly proud of her.

Meanwhile, I’ve spent the last year trying to figure out my own drinking. I’ve tried not drinking on weekdays, only drinking a certain amount each week, and other “tricks.” I’m currently on my last attempt, which is never having more than one drink. If I can’t do that, I’m quitting drinking altogether. 

I want to be a part of this community to hold myself accountable. To remind myself how many times I’ve tried to control my drinking and how it hasn’t worked. And to remind myself that I can be a normal, happy, social human without alcohol. 

Drinking hasn’t ruined my life - yet. But it has forced me to compromise my values, my work ethic, and my mental health. I know that I can’t continue this way, so something has to change.

Benefits are popping day by day!,"It's been officially 1 month since I had my last drink, technically 32 days. It's the longest streak since I was 15 years old. I am so proud of myself, really I can't believe that I made it!

I do not have anyone with whom I can share this small but at the same time huge personal success. The people around me wouldn't understand so I am sharing this with you. And frankly this community is trully amazing, I am there litterally every day to get boost of courage and read the success stories from others in a similar situation as me. I am so grateful that you guys are here, it would be much harder without you guys!

I honestly didn't think I could do it, I used to be a heavy weekend drinker mostly, I used to wait for Friday night to drink heavily and party until morning and often start the same cycle on Saturday. A few beers on Sunday because it's still a day off so why shouldn't I drink right.
Then it was very common to get drinks with colleagues and friends a couple of time a week and then have some beer here and there watching Netflix.

I always thought that I wasn't that bad, I would almost never blackout except on rare occasions. But drinking had a huge impact on me, it was driving my life, it was harming me so much, it was preventing me to have a REAL life. 

It's only the first month but I already feel some real benefits that never happened in my whole life, I wish that next months will be even better. 

To summarize this was my situation BEFORE:
- 30 years old, no hobbies, only bar and club hopping. Drinking was my hobby. I was even proud of that... 
- overweight (and I took more than 10kg in the past 3years) 
- unhealthy eating habits, fast food every day, not cooking at all
- no exercise, no real friends (only drinking buddies), high blod pressure and heart rate 
- bloated constantly, feeling like a zombie every morning, bowel issues and burning stools 
- toxic relationship that I was too afraid to stop. Prefered to drink and numb the bad feelings rather than facing the problems. 

But 1 month ago I decided to turn my life around, to stop escaping my issues with alcohol, to take care of myself, I wanted to become someone that I can be proud of and respect. This is still in progress but I am proud of my actions so far. 

So this is my situation AFTER one month sober:
- I lost almost 4kg already!!! (along with a proper diet too) 
- cooking every day, I actually love cooking so much it is probably the most surprising thing for me who used to eat burgers everyday. 
- started to read some book everyday instead of Netflix in the bed 
- doing some light exercise at home everyday
- left my toxic relationship to focus on improving my life 
- meditation every day, it's a great way to learn how to control my emotions. I was in a hard place mentally for the first 2 weeks but meditation really helped me to control my thoughts. 
- learning something new every day, I try to grow my skills to change job for a better one.  
- my skin looks better, no more dark eyes 
- no more bowel issues!!! 
- blood pressure and heart rate in normal range 
- my appartment has never been this clean and organised
- I spend way much less time on Netflix and video games
- I feel refreshed after a night of sleep, no more zombie morning. 
- I now tend to avoid escaping the hard things and try to accomplish them no matter what. 
- saved so much money in 1 month, I always knew that I spent a lot in booze and party but realising it on my bank account is really eye opening. 

The downsides:
- no more social life, feeling alone most days but plan to work on that soon. 
- I am still struggling to maintain discipline to stay away from alcohol. I have a beer in my fridge and sometimes feel like drinking it. So far I managed to control myself. 
- it is still difficult to not go out at night, especially on weekends like I used to do. I still experience FOMO but lately it's less strong, I feel like the benefits of not drinking are worth missing out the parties.
- still no major hobby but I am working on it. 

This whole thing is still an ongoing process. I am not sure what the futur will bring, the idea of stopping for life is daunting still. But at least today I will not drink. One day at a time. 

I hope this message can bring hope to someone who was in the same situation as mine before I stopped. Next update in 1 month!",35,0

Jumping in to talk about something that has been massively helping me. I am still fumbling along, I still fuck up and have a drink now and then...but much lesser of an extent than daily drinking of 6 packs!

The one thing that really struck me in my sobriety was missing the community around alcohol. The hunting for pricey, rare whiskeys, mixing and such for the perfect drink and, of course, the act of drinking itself. Needing something ""fancy"" to sip on in the evenings is still by far my largest hurtle. Bubbly water wasn't cutting it for me- I wanted that ""I am so aloof and rich and mysterious by sipping this"" feeling back. (I know...I know. sue me. It's nice to submerse yourself in a fantasy!)

That is...until I found r/tea. HOLY SHIT. For those of us who got deep into the flavor profiles of our drinks, the history, etc etc like I did- tea is so similar its insane. The complexity. The hoarding and shopping for it. The learning of its rich history and the PLETHORA of flavors and new things to try. The community!

I am SO excited to make tea drinking and collecting a new hobby of mine. I didnt even know tea collecting WAS a hobby- but dammit its gonna be mine now! I bought Oolong tea a few days ago and have been in love with the flavor and drinking 4-5 cups of it a day- which is hydrating my body WAY more than I usually do, and its got tons of health benefits. I scoped out a nearby loose leaf tea store and had a field day going through and asking tons of questions. The shop keeper probably hates me for taking up her time but BOY did I want some info.

There is teapot collecting, tea set collecting, rare or common tea collecting, figuring out the right temperature for the right teas, the process of tea etiquette around the world (already dreaming up a Japanese tea corner in my apartment with all the money ill be saving not drinking...), and getting to make the perfect cup.

HIGHLY recommend you check it out. Its been so refreshing to find a drink that I can start deep diving into like I used to with my whiskeys...only this time its healthy and no hangovers! AND I GET A COOL TEA COLLECTION!",109,0

Well I'm not going to die that way- today or ever. I had one stint in inpatient rehab but I'm an absolute idiot. I had decided I wouldn't live a full sober life even before I checked out. Things were better for a while but as I'm sure most of you know, they don't stay better.

Ive been a heavy drinker since 18, and on and off daily blackout. Since getting together with my wife I've had a bit more control and a lot of days have 4 or less drinks. I've been lucky enough to not let it interfere with work and just start at it when I finish my job and get home. But it's usually close to the first thing I reach for.

It's gotten to the point now that being married and kid around the corner that stuff has been stressing me out like crazy and when I do drink, there's no moderation, I get drunk fast and starting to do dumb stuff. I avoid my wife, I forget about the baby, driving before I have too many doesn't phase me, with my work being seasonal I'm off right now and the urge is getting earlier and earlier throught the day.

My wife and I have overall a good relationship, we've known each other since kids, moved really fast though when we fell in love and our living situation the last while brings up a lot of arguments. It's scaring me because when an argument gets frustrating and neither of us are understanding the other (when I drink) in my head I want to yell at her like at the guys on the field during a game. I know it's wrong and would never hurt her like that, but we end up going round and round in these arguments till we both are exausted and feel hopeless. When I calm down and/or sober the next day we make up and understand where we're each coming from. It's not daily but fairly frequent.

This isn't healthy and I know it's not sustainable. Also the money spent on alcohol is unjustifiable (especially with a kid coming). I've decided to test myself to see if I can do at least a week sober, on day 4. It's been 3 years since I've gone that long. It honestly feels good, but it's really hard, I feel more anxious, more depressed, and looking at life ahead seems like a mountain to deal with. I also smoke and tried quitting when I heard about the baby. I fell back into it but have gone from a pack + a day to less than half a pack a day. I used to be a stoner, but found I don't like the high since being married. I dabbled in coke and pain killers but never addicted (also been a couple years since partaking). All this to say, I never thought much of my alcohol intake because I caught myself in other substances.

I don't think it's at the point of never being able to drink again, but I know I have to smarten the fuck up and get some discipline in my life.

So the last drink I had was on New Year’s Eve.  I committed to at least doing dry January, which I managed to make it through without much difficulty.  And I haven’t yet had a drink in February.

 Good morning. 
 Our keynote is “Courtesy”.
The Meditation for the Day compares us to trees which must be pruned of dead branches in order to bear good fruit. It goes on to assure that we are in the hands of a Master Gardener who makes no mistakes in pruning.
 I am reminded of my inability to change myself. I can, and must, change my behavior, but it is God who must change who and what I am.
 I don’t even know which branches need to be pruned, much less when or how.
 As always, I️ must come as a little child, stumbling along while holding the Divine Hand and trying to take the next stitch as directed.
  If I persistently and faithfully stitch, God’s grace and power will  gradually grow me into something closer to the Divine Vision of who and what I should be. 
 The Magic is never in my self determined objectives. It is always in God‘s perfect objectives, which I am never able to see or comprehend.

That's not to say I have a huge drinking community of friends who are just out to get sloshed, but beers are usually assumed and once I've begun, I usually get more for at home.

Arkansas interests me since it seems to be one of the driest states and has a bunch of mountain biking, something I used to prioritize before starting drinking. That seems to have been reversed in the past 5 years or so.

I've been trying to quit for years without much luck, I'd be running to the shop just before it closed when I was trying and therefore hungover for work the next day as I'd be drinking later into the night because of getting it so late. I performed better during the day when I was not trying to quit because I'd be wasted by 9 and asleep for ten hours.

The truth is I don't actually know why I'm stopping drinking, i prefer being drunk a lot of the time and then feeling shit the rest of the time to not being drunk. I just feel like I should stop.

I'm using weed gummies this time around, weed is a drug that I can't seem to be addicted to and it takes the edge off. The idea is to take one a night for two months then hopefully the worst of the depressive / impulsive shit will be over and I can head on from there. I don't know if that is even a thing but I can drop weed easily so if after the two months I drop it and it doesn't stick I will willpower through the next time, it's just something I wanted to try.

I am posting this here because I've been lurking in this community throughout many other attempts at sobriety. I am posting this to be honest and I am posting because I am scared. Scared enough to never drink again.

They feel sad because a lot of our good times together have happened over drinks etc... That has bothered me ever since, like I can't get their words out of my mind. That whole talk made me feel dumb about trying to go sober.

I know that I'm an alcoholic and trying to moderate is not at all pleasant for me. I know myself but they just made me feel like I'm taking this all too seriously. So yeah I'm just feeling so stupid and lost right now but IWNDWYT (day 12 for me).",6,0

I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital at one point...

What a fucked up perspective, but I will take it. Our pain tolerances are pretty high when you have walked through hell a billion times.

To know that in 2022 I actually have support and something that is working---ALL OF YOU---and to think about not going through that middle of the night hell bc of booze makes me so happy.

I just stumbled on this community as the pandemic hasn’t been all that kind to me and I’ve spend 85% of it drinking.  

I can’t figure out if I actually have a problem because the drinks are always in social settings with flatmates and when things opened up with friends, hardly ever on my own. 

However recently every time I drink I don’t seem to know when to stop and it’s making me incredibly sad and anxious.

But the one thing I can tell myself is that I'm sober and at the end of the day that does make me feel somewhat better. I know drinking would just make me feel worse.

The drink stunts you, prevents you from walking through the kinds of fearful life experiences that bring you from point A to point B on the maturity scale. When you drink in order to transform yourself, when you drink and become someone you're not, when you do this over and over and over, your relationship to the world becomes muddied and unclear. You lose your bearings, the ground underneath you begins to feel shaky. After a while you don't know even the most basic things about yourself—what you're afraid of, what feels good and bad, what you need in order to feel comforted and calm—because you've never given yourself a chance, a clear, sober chance, to find out. 

Alcohol offers protection from all that, protection from the pain of self-discovery, a wonderful, cocooning protection that's enormously insidious because it's utterly false but it feels so real, so real and necessary. 

And then, tragically, the protection stops working. The mathematics of transformation change. This is inevitable. You drink long and hard enough and your life gets messy. Your relationships (with nondrinkers, with yourself) become strained. Your work suffers. You run into financial trouble, or legal trouble, or trouble with the police. Rack up enough pain and the old math—Discomfort+Drink=No Discomfort—ceases to suffice; feeling ""comfortable"" isn't good enough anymore. You're after something deeper than a respite from shyness, or a break from private fears and anger. So after a while you alter the equation, make it stronger and more complete. Pain+Drink=Self-Obliteration. ‘

That must have come from having been athletic all my life. Over the years, as the drinking worsened, i also increased my running and it became a sort of self-punishment. At the same time I was cutting out my dinner when I knew I was gonna drink at night (to keep down the calories). 

I wonder if anyone else has done similar things and how long that lasted or how it worked out?
For me, when I realized I drank 4 times a week, I couldnt keep up with ‘punishing myself’ and I knew that I was spiraling down and I needed to change or I’ll enter a stage that I will certainly not get out by myself.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar.

**“Most of us have spent our whole lives being taught to believe everyone else's opinions about our bodies, rather than to believe what our own bodies are trying to tell us. For some of us, it's been so long since we listened to our bodies, we hardly know how to start understanding what they're trying to tell us, much less how to trust and believe what they're saying. To make matters worse, the more exhausted we are, the noisier the signal is, and the harder it is to hear the message.”**

**― Emily Nagoski,** [**Burnout: The Secret to Unlocking the Stress Cycle**](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/66080282)

The stress cycle. It’s real. We function really well under long stretches of stress right up until we….don’t. For too many years, I misused alcohol to deal with my stress. Annoying meeting with bosses at work? A drink after work. Partner that still can’t manage to hear me?  Wine. Family drama? Don’t mind if I do, gin martini. But here’s the thing: alcohol doesn’t “complete the stress cycle.”  I wasn’t listening to my body enough to do something to bring it back to a place of safety. Our lizard brains know. Our guts know. Our hearts know. They know when we’re not safe, and they know when it’s totally okay to just be and let it all hang out, without any kind of threat. It’s probably fair to say that all of us have been living with levels of stress we’ve never experienced before thanks to the pandemic and well, I live in the US, so I’ll leave it there. Giving up drinking exposed just how much I needed a way to truly end my stress cycles. I had inherently been doing some of these things all along, but I wanted to share with you **the Nagoski sisters’ tried and true seven ways to get your body back to feeling safe** after something tumultuous rocks your otherwise even keel.

1. Move: just moving-- maybe you go up and down your stairs a few times. Maybe you hit that 8 mile run with all you’ve got. Maybe you simply stretch and do what’s accessible to you.
2. Breathe: this can be more formal breathwork or even just a few deep, slow breaths to bring you back to you.
3. Talk to people: different from #5 in that with this one, they mean, just interact with a person you see. Say hi to the neighbor you don’t know well. Ask your mail carrier about their day. Simple human interaction helps us feel more connected, and thus, more safe. Be friendly to the human selling you a coffee. \[Side note: I CRAVED this type of interaction during the heady days of the pandemic. Living in a major city, quarantined except to buy groceries, meant that I saw almost no one for weeks and weeks. Simply thanking the clerk at the store and wishing them safety and good health felt utterly therapeutic.\]
4. Laugh:  Is there anything as satisfying as a fit of giggle, a belly laugh, a snigger, or a hearty old chuckle to instantly buoy your spirits?  Feeling a little more up = feeling a little bit safer.
5. Speak to loved ones: speaks for itself.  For the record, I include this sub in this category.
6. Cry: painful in the moment, but relieving when it’s done. Let it out, let it go, pass me my hankie.
7. Do something creative: I’m not the most artistic person, but I am a kitchen professional. So for me, cooking or baking up something out of my usual routine feels real nice. Or a dance break with the blinds drawn because I like my neighbors and do not wish to scare them.

**Did you recently complete a stress cycle?  Which strategy did you use?**  I’m convinced we all intrinsically know that these 7 actions can help us out, but I love the science behind it.  IWNDWYT today, friends, because I can cry, and hug, and whisk and cold-weather run with the best of them, instead. It's not always easy, but it always helps.

After I lost my mom I went a few years basically drinking like a fish, while holding a job at a liquor store…(good idea, right?). Starting in January 2021 I have been in the hospital 7 times, most for pancreatitis. You think that would scare me off enough on its own but this damn disease has me under its grips.

I recently moved away from my hometown thinking that would be the fix, and I did well for the first couple weeks but then I had that one bad day and it all came falling down. I went to set up with a new primary doctor today and he basically told me to go right to the hospital or detox. I plan to take myself into the hospital tomorrow morning. I’m determined to get myself past this and make the family I do have left proud. Wishing the best for all of you.

   I got absolutely hammered this past weekend and did some things that really damaged my marriage, but my wife is a saint and we’re working through it, on the condition that I knock out booze entirely, which I agreed to without hesitation. So after a glass of wine over a nice dinner Sunday night, I decided that was it. Cold turkey. 

   It’s been exactly 72hrs since my last drop of alcohol, and I feel like I’m starting to feel some withdrawal symptoms and I’m curious what I could expect over the next few days and weeks. I have a bit of a headache, some light brain fog and anxiety, and just overall feel a bit “off”. I’ve done some light googling about it with mixed findings. It sounds like I’m in the clear as far as the really serious withdrawal symptoms like seizures, as those seem to happen within the first 48hrs, but I wanted to get y’all’s input on what the next coming weeks will be like. 

   Some background, I have been a daily drinker for 10 years. Some days just a beer or two or a glass of wine, and some days 2 bottles of wine and some whiskey. Inconsistent, but I always had something to drink. Every day.",26,0

He has been really supportive and helpful. 

The problem is that his family regularly drink wine when together. That's been common for aa long as I've known them and actually one of the reasons I started in the first place. Nobody is his family seems to have a problem. They only drink socially and I've never seen any of them drunk. 

However since none of them have a problem, I've noticed they see alcoholism as a weakness and I'm not ready to tell them yet. 

So the problem is weird - my husband and i are very openly childfree, but his family remains hopeful. We went to their house and i said no thanks to the wine, and my husband did too out of support, and IMMEDIATELY they started badgering me asking if i was pregnant. We both said no, but i could see they didn't believe us. 

So the whole evening they kept teasing us about it. I told my husband that i was having trouble with that and he told them to knock it off. They did, but i could still see them sharing ""knowing"" glances at each other. 

Anyway, that made me really, REALLY want to drink because i felt stressed. To the point where we left early.

Looking back, there were red flags all along. It got bad when one of my cats died. I had 2 cats and a dog, but Nina was my favorite. She passed on, and I just wanted to be sad for a night and drink a little more than I did every other night.

I purchased and drank a lot more than usual. That turned into me drinking that much pretty much daily. I was almost 400 lbs (I'm 6'6), and the thought of doing anything without alcohol made me uncomfortable.

This continued for 7 months. I had unbearable anxiety. I was bloated. I wasn't doing my best job as a father and a husband. One day, I was just sick and hungover. Or so I thought.

On April 13th, 2020, I was hungover. This particular hangover was not getting better. I tried all the usual tricks. Shower, water, Gatorade, food, coffee, fresh air, OTC medication. It was getting worse. I thought I was going to pass out just sitting there. From extensive Google-fu and browsing this sub for almost 2 years, I have concluded that I was experiencing heavy withdrawals, and I was in very bad shape that day.

I recovered later in the day. I decided to give it a break. I didn't want it anymore. About 2 weeks later, my wife brought home a drink for herself. I confessed that I hadn't drank in 2 weeks, and I don't want to do it anymore. She drank her drink, and that was the last sip she had to date.

About a month in, I vowed to never drink again. I started piecing together the withdrawal thing and just how bad things were. Some days are easier than others, but on April 13, 2022, I will be celebrating 2 years of sobreity.


I love you all.",39,0

Had been having weekend benders that scared me and was feeling next to no motivation. So I talked to my doctor about antidepressants and gave 30 days being sober a shot. After that worked, i decided to go for 60. I almost got to 90 (86 days total), which was right before Christmas. Thought I had a handle on things, that I could control my drinking. I did for the most part, primarily because i didn’t want to screw around with combining booze and medication. Things were better all around, even got a 30 day assignment to my home state for work.

However, I’ve been back in my usual environment for almost a week now. Also been having some family drama that feels worse now that I’m a distance away. My drinking was back to daily and i was guzzling down liquor over this weekend. Then on Tuesday night I just thought “screw it all” and boozed even though I had work. I was able to call out sick today, and had time to deal with the hangover and ponder things. 

I want to quit again. Not thinking of a set time like before, just thinking how much clearer my mind was and how I had energy to do things each day. Not counting today as day one, i finished off the last of what I had earlier. Hair of the dog never works. Looking forward to Day 1 tomorrow and hanging out back on here.",5,0

Today I celebrate a year completely sober. Never thought I'd make it this far. It's been horrible and yet super liberating, I feel like at 29 I'm finally getting to know who I really am underneath all the layers of bs. I've been struggling with forms of addiction all my life, unknowingly. parents were alcoholic and I've developed an avoidant personality disorder to survive, but I'm starting intensive therapy on my one year anniversary to help me regain further control of my life. After almost a full year of only experiencing negative emotions it finally feels like the clouds have parted for good.

There may be some people that can handle having a vice in their life, but I don't trust myself with them anymore, and the longer time passes, the more I am at peace with that. I'm starting volunteer work in the rehab I was in next week, to pass on what I've learned to whoever is willing to listen, that the mountain of overcoming addiction might seem too steep at the start but there is life waiting for you on the other side. It's all about babysteps, patience and kindness, asking for help if you need it and allowing yourself to rest. I couldn't have done it alone, and thanks to my wonderful support system and platforms like these I didn't have to.

Thanks for sharing your stories and being overall wonderfully supportive as a community. There have been countless valuable insights I've gained from lurking here, and great example responses that I've literally stolen to explain/counter people that questioned my sobriety in bad faith.

Wish you all the best and onto the next year.

“It’s so nice out! It feels like a great day to drink! Think how fun it would be! Just a couple would be fine! Just a strong buzz and that’s it!”

Like… yeah right. I’ve told myself that soooo many times and ended up so terribly sick and full of regrets the next day… I know that being drunk isn’t that great and isn’t worth the hangover at all, but… damn that initial buzz is so addictive. The euphoric feeling of that first one or two (strong) drinks. UGH. My brain wants that feeling so bad that it doesn’t care about where it would lead after.

He brought it up to me last year, that if we got invited he would decline as we are both doing well with our sobriety. Well, he got invited and he accepted for both of us. These have been his friends since high school and I know he enjoys this time with them. 

I got upset because it puts me in a difficult position. I am the one with a drinking problem, I am the one who can’t handle her alcohol. They are all binge drinkers and drink from morning to night. While they can bounce back up and be completely fine, it leaves me with a crippling hangover and anxiety. 

Seriously tempted to just suggest he goes alone. There is one girl there who will drink a six pack the whole weekend. She doesn’t drink much so I can chill with her and not drink. I just don’t know if I’m strong enough to handle that situation to not relapse. 

I can’t ask him to put his life on hold because of my issue, so I’m not upset at him for accepting. I just don’t think it aligns with who I am and who I want to be. Does anyone have tips/advice/stories on this happening to them?",4,0

That day I was walking alone drinking (lots of) beer, got into this place and bought one large pizza, 6 beers and a bottle of wine to go. For days I was saying to myself ""this is the last night drinking, tomorrow I stop"". And each morning I woke up sure that I would drink again.

So this day I got home and my mother had sent me this huge text. We have been fighting about many things since december, when I came to visit her, and one topic was my evident alcohol abuse, which she addressed in that text.

I was so pissed with the way she wrote that I had to stop drinking. But it hit me hard...

I ate the pizza alone wanting to cry. Slept without drinking the stuff. The next day I left the beer in a place I know someone would pick up. The bottle of wine is still at my place, I'm gonna give it to my sister.

So the last drink I had was here where I sit now. One warm beer that I have no recollection.

I'm not hugely better than then, but at least I'm sober. And mom and I are fine.

Long story short. I’m 72 hours in with no alcohol after slamming vodka for 3-4 years, and very excited to start seeing the positive results of not drinking as that’s all I’ve known for years.

I do occasionally still get twinges of desire, and for a moment I think about maybe buying just one tall can of my favourite micro brew... And then I remember how I couldn't drink just one because it was somehow ""wasting"" alcohol because I wouldn't get drunk from it and so ""needed"" more, and how I'd be bloated and uncomfortable and not sleep well afterwards. Not to mention the cost! Not. Worth. It. And I know it for sure now.

Waking up to work out instead of waking up to vomit and feel like death? What a concept!

Working a full day at my job. I'm being trained now to go from front desk to being an optician with commission potential on top of my base. A job with a level of responsibility and reliability that I never would have been comfortable with pursuing as a drunk. I couldn't remember what I ate for dinner the night before, I never would have been successful at this job.

Honestly though if I were still an active drunk now, I would have been dead months ago, I'm positive of that. Instead of spending my young years worrying about premature death, I'm doing normal things like holding a job and dating and paying my rent on time. I think I drank so much because I was mortified of growing up and I was clinging to any semblance of perceived youthful thinking. Now though, I'm pretty happy with being a boring adult. Losing my bodily functions sure taught me to appreciate the little things.

I’m addicted to GETTING drunk.,"After almost 20 years of struggling with addiction I’ve finally broken the cycle. I was never able to go more than 2 weeks without convincing myself that “I could moderate this time”. My addict brain would actually pull it off for awhile because some drinking was better than nothing. But it ALWAYS went south. I finally went to rehab and I learned something that was extremely useful for me when taking a hard look at myself. 

If I was just addicted to BEING drunk I would take maybe 3 shots and then “maintain” said buzz with say, one drink per hour. But that’s not what I wanted and I never truly realized it. The process of GETTING drunk (my body processing alcohol) releases dopamine. THAT’S what I craved. It didn’t matter how much I had to drink. I always wanted to process more.

I could be a fifth deep and would still want another shot. But we all know the diminishing returns of drinking.

When I realized that my battle wasn’t with moderation but with my brain treating the processing of alcohol like crack I new that I had to stop. I was picking the wrong battle. I might as well have been trying to moderate crack.

It’s like when you think you can “just be friends” with an ex that you are still in love with. You’ll take something over nothing but you always end up in the same place wanting more and feeling worse.

2999,2022-02-09 12:44:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/sojc11/life_signs/,Life Signs,"Hola everyone. This may sound silly, and in many ways it is. I’m sure we all know the feeling when it seems “life is sending you a message”. 

&#x200B;

Whether or not there is any credibility to any of this, it felt significant and positive in the moment of the experience. And I’ll take that, even if it’s just a bunch of coincidences that I’m weaving together to strengthen my goals. Life is what we make it, right?

&#x200B;

Anyhow, two nights ago I semi-begrudgingly allowed my partner to give me a Boriken Oracle Card reading. To my limited understanding, it’s basically a Puerto Rican variation of Tarot. 

&#x200B;

The cards went right for the alcoholism. Card after card told this narrative: “You are caught in addiction and you won’t break out of it on your own. The solution is not within yourself, the solution is to be part of a community.” 

&#x200B;

I more or less took it with a grain of salt. Yet my partner encouraged me that this places like this community can be a huge help in becoming healthier. And that is true, whether or not an oracle card is needed to affirm it.  

&#x200B;

A detail I’ll throw in for fun: one of the images in the cards looked to me like a flat tire. I kept thinking “darn it, this looks like it’s trying to warn me I’m going to get a flat tire tomorrow.” And sure enough I did get a flat the next day. It’s not quite a checkmate against skeptics. That tire had been patched once already. Yet the fact it happened like that was certainly a coincidence. 

&#x200B;

Yesterday was day 3 sober for me (I’m 40 and have been drinking heavily since 18). As someone pointed out here, day 3 can be a rough one. After working all day and getting the flat, I was getting home late yesterday. So I stopped at a little place up the road that has nice pre-made food to take home. I told myself “if this place has beer I’m gonna get two beers and that’s it.”

&#x200B;

They didn’t have beer. But what did the have instead? A great branzino. Branzino was their special of the day. The name I chose on a whim to join this stop drinking community. So I took that as “a sign”, bought the fish and no beer. Did not drink. 

&#x200B;

I know we make our own rules in life. Our minds can find signs in anything if that’s what we’re looking for. Yet in any event, life’s positive coincidences can sometimes lift you up when you need it. 

&#x200B;

Today I’m going to get a bunch of stuff done that I probably would've avoided if I had drank yesterday. This morning I feel reasonably clear, and well enough to go get it all done today. Not the old familiar “how much longer can I get hammered and put these things off?”

&#x200B;

This may be a silly wandering post. Yet my point is to say, it’s a real help to be part of any understanding community. And in the many weird experiences of life, let’s look for the “signs” that point the way to our health. Even if adults are just big kids with wild imaginations, let’s let that imagination steer us toward health. The path to health can be fun. Yes, it’s extraordinarily challenging. But there’s some fun and lightness along the way too.

&#x200B;

Sending strength to everybody here, the day 69s, the 1 years, the day 2s, it shows me it can be done and it’s a real help to see it. Wishing health, joy and progress to you all.",3,0

Let's start with how bad off I was. I would drink a pint of vodka a night and even more on the weekends. What made it worse was that I brewed my own red wines. Top off my airlocks with vodka and top myself off as well. It was bad having so many fermenters with different ages of wines crowding my room. 18 gallons of different sizes to be exact. I did this for about 3 years. 

I decided to seek help and dumped everything I had with the help of my friend. Almost a grand worth of ingredients gone but it was for the better. I sobered up and suffered the withdrawals. Lack of appetite, dt, tingling sensation, nausea and vomiting, the whole works. I did it without medical help when I really should have gone to the hospital.

I went to therapy a week later and did not like the doctor. I remember him saying that I will relapse and to just get on Antabuse. I relapsed hard a week later. I did not go back to therapy. I kept telling myself it was wrong of him to say that. In hindsight he probably just saw the pattern of abuse and knew it was coming. I refused a possible solution that might have helped 

Now this last year has been up and down. I stopped brewing and got my spouse involved to help. I have had alot of support and tapered down my drinking to start. I still have my bad times and horrid hangovers from researching my tolerances. I would replace the hard stuff for beer/wine and just drink more. Every weekend I would binge a bottle of wine and several beers. Then stop drinking for the week. I am ready to get myself back up and shrug off this addiction.

At the same time, we live in a culture where this problem doesnt exist for some drinkers, and it is therefore present in every restaurant, every grocery store, represented in every movie, sold on every street corner. 

The people who can drink responsibly have no first hand experience of what alcohol can become for the alcoholic. Some even find a way to judge us for it. Some judge us properly though, as this poison we drink can make us bleeding hearts in one moment and monsters the next. 

It breaks my heart to think of what some of our lives could be, would be, or currently arent because of alcohol. I mourn people I've never met who won't know how much beauty and how much peace can be had in sobriety because they've already lost their battle and passed on. It terrifies me that I know this to be true today, and could lose that truth tomorrow and drink.

Because of this the worst mistakes of my life involved heavy drinking. When I developed OCD in 2019, one of my triggers was false memories where I would invent things I did, compulsively analyse memories, get mentally stuck in events from years ago and have a panic attack.

Because of this I stopped drinking as much. The longest I went with nothing was about 7 weeks and after that it was maybe once a month or max once a week, never more than 3 drinks at a time – i've never got wasted since the OCD started but I didn't never drink. but because my avoidance was motivated by extreme fear (that I would 'do something' while drunk, or become convinced i did the days after) it didn't feel like a success. It was just another anxiety response, albeit a beneficial one.

I am now a month into a new medication which has done wonders for me. I know prozac is contentious but for OCD? holy shit. I feel alive again, truly. And when I started I made the decision to not drink at least until I speak to the psych about it again, and this time it has been a dream to not drink. I feel all the benefits of sobriety in the moment and the night after and because I'm not consumed by anxiety or despair I don't feel any longing for or that I am missing out on booze. i may not be able to cry and my jaw is so tense but i don't care – feeling like this and being able to not only not drink but enjoy it feels like a miracle.

All of which to say, I see you if you have OCD. It is a cruel, despair and guilt driven condition. It made me feel trapped in a cage of my own making and I never thought I'd get out. But drinking never helped it. I wish everyone  could experience life with those thoughts muffled like I now am, whether that's through meditation, medication or therapy (or all three which is what i'm doing).",7,0

Billboards, commercials, clothing. It's everywhere and it's glamorized. 

I will admit to being THAT sober person that insists It's a better life and truly doesn't give two shits about your ""crazy drunk night out"". I don't want to hear those stories. None of them sound fun. And yet people can't go out and have a good time without alcohol. 

It's portrayed as something that will magically make your night out better or your get together more fun, but I've only seen it ruin things like that AND ruin your next day or two.

Take the plunge and do the hard work. I promise that you will not be disappointed.**

The biggest obstacle in my recovery has not been the *why* but the *how*: how do I overcome life's obstacles now that my favorite liquid coping mechanism is off the table?

I'd been drinking regularly and heavily since I was 16, so a full 20 years of my life where I grew up with an increasingly fat monkey on my back. Which means I had few opportunities to grow healthy responses to all of the new challenges I had not yet experienced when I was 16. 

Instead of being discouraged by this and overwhelmed by the new skills I need to learn, I have actively chosen to be excited by this unfamiliar territory. Instead of the crushing weight and terror of the unknown, how about the thrill of exploration and growth?

Star Trek tells us that the final frontier is space, but that's not wholly true. The final frontier is YOU. 

I have the opportunity to grow up again, but instead of starting all over again at 16, I can do it at 36 with all of the resources and knowledge I've accumulated. Everything I achieved while I was drinking was NOT thrown out because I quit!

It's like playing a new game of Oregon Trail as the banker instead of the farmer. I have financial freedom, and a dedicated and supporting partner, and friends who are themselves more wise and loving. All things I didn't have when I was 16.

And my kids. When I was young, I didn't have anything greater than myself to care about, no extrinsic motivator. All of the small victories I've won the last month have had a real and very obvious and very  positive impact on my kids. They are blooming in front of my eyes now that I have the resources to pay attention and the time to spend with them. I am not exaggerating when I say that they make everything worth it. 

It's not easy. I won't downplay that this has been really, really hard, and I still struggle some days, but now I know I can do *so much more than just survive*! I've seen it personally, and I read your success stories here every day- the evidence is irrefutable.

Desperate exploitation,"**I am writing this to myself and to anyone else who may relate to my experience.** Having been dependent on alcohol and relapsed several times, I have become (*slightly*) more aware of my own patterns. The desire for alcohol is another form of my desperate dependency on the external world; I use objects for gratification, anxiety relief, escape and self esteem. I have noticed that alcohol is just the most tempting, and easily accessible, of these objects that I exploit (my others are: cocaine, video-game binges, food binges and desperate relationships) . I am back again on day 2. On Monday night, I had 10 beers and .5g of cocaine (alone). At 2am, I read a text from my ex saying she was pregnant with my kid and she is getting an abortion (she left because of my desperate nature, and certainly couldn't see me as a solid father). That hurt. Towards the end of the night, the alcohol was gone, I had 2 lines of cocaine left. I noticed that I felt slight peace becasue the lines were still there. 30 minutes after the final line, there was an emerging hang-over and the cocaine was fading; there was a desperate, empty fear and fiendish desire for another substance or object to exploit. In the end, I smoked cigarettes until sleeping but they didn't relieve the awful feeling. As you can guess, I woke up feeling gross and barely moved until 5pm.

Alcohol and other dependencies have caused such anxiety, mistakes and ultimately caused me to lose my girlfriend. My father left my family because of alcoholism, he has lost everything. I write this to remind myself to be observant of all of your exploitative, dependent tendencies. Alcohol is the most destructive of these tendencies, but to bring awareness to all of them, I think, is helpful. May we bring awareness of this exploitation with the intention of letting it go. I hope to slowly build the ability to 'be an island unto myself'. With inner resilience and consistent work towards this goal, I feel the habitual drinking will fade away much more naturally. Everytime I get sober, I try to make big statemtents about the length of sobriety without changing the addict within me; so far, these grandiose statements have been lies. Incremental steps and inner growth my friend! A couple quotes that have helped me:

\- Dr Hawkins: ""Forgiveness is an aspect of love that allows us to see life events from the viewpoint of grace. We forgive ourselves for the errors we made when we were less evolved. It is helpful to see the small part of ourselves \[the alcoholic\] as a cute little teddy bear \[:\] we don't hate or scold the teddy bear.""

\- Theo Von: ""People are in relationships with the drugs and alcohol""

Realising that alcohol/drug dependency is like a relationship has been useful. We can view the relationship like, 'Who benefits?' 'What are we gaining from the relationship?' For me, it is short-term mental satisfaction and anxiety relief. Can I achieve those benefits from other sources? I think the answer is definitely yes! Which gives me such hope! The positive, energetic, sober mind can guide us to actively seek those healthier sources of relief too.

Thank you for all the posts on this page, they have been so uplifting. The positivity and hope on this page has helped me many times. <3 <3 <3 <3

 Good morning. 
 Our keynote is “Persistence”.
 The Prayer for the Day asks that no lack of trust or fearfulness will make us disloyal to God.
 The prayer assumes that we WILL, at times, not feel trust in God and will be afraid to do what we know in our hearts is right.
Happily, it also strongly implies that such feelings do not constitute disloyalty to God. 
The fluctuations of the old crazy picture show in my head don’t make me either disloyal or loyal. Whether I am loyal to God (or my fellows) will be determined solely by what I do and fail to do.
 Today, I pray that my actions will be loyal to God, even if fear has caused my mind to doubt and my feelings of faith and trust to falter. 
 As ever, The Magic is in the action; not in my shifting and fickle thoughts, feelings and beliefs.
 I am grateful that my loyalty is measured by my behavior, which I can control, and not by the crazy picture show in my head, which I cannot immediately control 
 I love you all.",5,0

Life without substances opened my mind to connect more deeply with people, nature, my spiritual side. Living without substances makes everything 100% real. The bad AND the good.  A bit like this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GojecBfWlp8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GojecBfWlp8) . The best, most beautiful moments in recovery give an all-encompassing feeling of warmth, love, fulfillment in a way that substances can't even dream to reach.  It's a feeling where all layers of our conscious and subconscious are in phase with each other and with nature, with the people or person that is there with us.   All aspects that make us human play a beautiful concert in perfect harmony and give an almost divine feeling of fulfillment to us.",3,0

A nightmare at the ICU,"I have been on a daily dose of 250 mg Disulfiram/Antabuse for more than 8 months. Stopped drinking 1 year ago. On Monday for some reason I was extremely depressed, and had made up my mind to drink. I discarded that morning's Disulfiram pill. Bought myself 2 quarters of Gin (2 bottles 180 ml each). Sat down to drink with plenty of water and food. Started sipping the gin about 15-20 ml at a time at a slow enough pace at around 2:30 pm (waited for the booze to kick in and ingest before taking the next sip ). Finished 1 quarter in about 30 mins or so. Felt a bit intoxicated, no adverse effects, then i smoked a cigarette. Was feeling quite good around the 1 hour mark. 

Decided to open the second quarter bottle. Repeated the same, sipped it slowly drank + water and played some music. It was around 4 pm or so by now. Felt more intoxicated/drunk smoked another cigarette. No adverse effects, felt okay. Finished both quarters well before 5 pm.

 After about 1 hour or so I started feeling peckish. So i opened a pack of Doritos and took a few bites. It was around 6:30 pm. 

This is when shit hit the fan. I started wretching uncontrollably. Puked my guts out, face turned red, heart was racing, head started throbbing, chest started hurting(heart rate around 150 BPM) Mind you this is almost 4 hours after i had my first sip. I informed my parents and rushed to the ER at this point. Doctors said i need to spend the night at the ICU. I spent the whole night in a gown and a diaper, with a bunch of leads attached to my chest and an IV drip (this experience was worse than the puking and chest pains). 

I'll give you some info about Antabuse. Didn't want to bore you so i saved this for the end. Disulfiram(Antabuse) is supposed to prevent alcohol from being synthesized into the final byproducts in the body (Alcohol  ➡️ Aldehyde ➡️ H2O +CO2.) Disulfiram stops the process at Aceteldehyde/Aldehyde which is supposed to be toxic for the human body, which is what causes hangovers, puking, etc. The first step happens pretty quickly( almost at the same time you start feeling intoxicated) (Alcohol - Aldehyde). The second step takes time (about 40 ml every hour is what the liver can completely process) which is when you start peeing a lot and all that. 

Now back to my shitstorm. The deterrent(Antabuse) didn't do its job too well from all the details I've given you above. My body reacted adversly after almost 4 hours which is ridiculous and completely wrong given the chemical process that was supposed to happen. Now I understand each person reacts differently to disulfiram. But this is quite the shit show and i could have died considering i was planning on drinking more after the second quarter, luckily I stopped. 

This is a detailed account of my lapse in sobriety and Antabuse + Alcohol reaction and the complete shit show. The purpose of this post is to just give an experience report, and also inform anyone on Antabuse that it's shitty Drug and can kill you. It's not what they advertise it to be, if it was i would have felt the side effects as soon as I started drinking and would have not had the need to be carted to the ER.

Well good luck to all recovering addicts. I definitely nit plan in drinking again. But i will stop the Disulfiram untill im confident enough. If anyone plans to do a similar stunt, kindly wait for at least 7 days after stopping Antabuse before you hit the bottle.",14,0

I drank a Bang energy yesterday. It was cool. Hadn't ever drank one. But I also drank some vodka and had a beer with dinner. I feel like I needed that alcohol to calm my restlessness from the energy drink. But my brain also finds dumb things to justify. So today, I'm going to have another Bang energy.... except I'm meeting with my personal trainer at 5. I want to see if using all that pent up energy will help. 

....of course my brain will try to reward me with alcohol.

The 49  resets I have had to do weren't failures, it was just exhausting all the ways I could lie to myself by thinking moderation was an option for me.

Does anyone else feel that since they have stopped drinking, you don't enjoy social gatherings/parties as much anymore? Not necessarily because you are afraid of the temptation, but because watching people get drunk is a massive social turnoff?   


The reason I am asking is because the past two weekends (I have been dry for almost 3 weeks now, Sunday will be the 3 weeks) I have had to go to a social braai (barbeque as some would call it) as well as a 21st birthday party (I am 33, it was family related.) In both circumstances everyone was drinking and chatting, while I either drank water or coke (trying not to replace my drinking with sweet stuff). The social barbeque I could only stick around for around 2 hours before i got extremely bored and headed back inside to read my book, I was told I was being rude by doing that but I just don't have the patience for drunk people anymore, and to be fair the only person that knows I have quit the booze is my Fiancé.   


Fast forward to this past weekend, We arrive at the 21st at 4pm and by 9pm I just wanted to go home and relax with my Fiancé, although we did have a lot of fun dancing and really enjoyed the food, I just didn't want to be there anymore the more drunk people got. I know that is exactly what I use to be like but I just cant anymore, I don't seem to have the patience for drunk and rowdy people since I have stopped. I feel bad at times because I don't want to seem rude, but the more people drink the more irritating they become especially when they keep asking you why you aren't drinking or just to have one. I would rather avoid situations like that all together but I cant always do that.

2 years ago I made the decision to stop drinking. It was not based on the premise that I would never drink again but that's where I am at today. I'm extremely proud of myself but I feel no one else even recognises my struggle. 

It has been extremely difficult over the past 2 years and in some ways it has been easy. The decision to not drink is the easy part for me. I don't see another option for me to successfully live my life. 

The real hard part is I have discovered I am completely stunted in my social life without alcohol. It was my crutch for every single social interaction and without I feel like I am super handicapped. This hasn't got any easier for me over the 2 years. I endured the social situations I could bring myself to attend and just completely ignored the ones I couldn't. But it doesn't seem any easier. 

My partner invites me to social events with her friends, but they are all heavy drinkers and I feel  uncomfortable so I usually distance myself. She's fine with this but I feel she doesn't understand how difficult it is. I want to be social. I want to be that confident person I used to be, but I feel like that reality is so out of reach for me. 

I am working on these things with my therapist but it's a real hard slog. This has to get easier right? I have lost so many friends(I won't relinquish entire responsibility) since I've stopped drinking. My future just seems so lonely.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hi friends. Holy moly, is this community a bastion of strength!  Many of you pointed out that strength shows up in all kinds of ways and often in ways that we may not immediately identify as “strength.”  I feel you, I feel you. It’s complicated and it’s wonderful. Also: again, I sure do wish I could respond to everyone but with my time zone and work schedule, I am unable. I promise I’m reading all of your comments and send each of you a mental personal message! 

**Okay, then. Wednesday. Wednesday. Hump Day. Day of Mercury.** I have no clever quote for today, despite searching, but maybe that helps make my forthcoming point.  The fourth day, or maybe the third, depending on how you count and if you care at all if days and weeks and months have any order. Do they? What is time anymore, honestly?

Like most days, because as we all know, stopping drinking unfortunately does not stop hard things from coming our way. I’m keeping today short, because I’d really like to hear from you, instead: 

**How do you find yourself weathering the bumps and humps and lumps of life?  How did you manage something hard yesterday? How is managing the hard stuff different now that you aren’t drinking? And when it’s really all too much-- and we all have those moments-- where do you turn for a laugh, a bit of peace, some comfort, and/or some simple empathy?** When I’m having an extra tough one, I call my BFF, who lives 1500 miles away, or pick up a good book to get lost in something else, or treat myself to Netflix, or put my mind to cooking something that will nourish and comfort. Sometimes at night, if I’m just at a loss? I just call it and go to bed. It works.  **Friends, I will not drink with you today. I’m going to go tackle hard things, right alongside you. xo**",373,0

To summarize without dumping all the bullshit thoughts, emotions and insecurities that I have had my whole life and drank and got high to escape. I have a people situation that has somehow surfaced a lot of the things in the previous sentence and really wanted to drink a few hours ago. I walked into a gas station saw the alcohol and just thought I am going to relapse soon.

I have a ""work friend"" that constantly talks about hanging out, things we can do together and how comfortable they are with me but doesn't actually seem to mean any of it. When I ask when they are available or even suggest a day they already said they have nothing planned the answer is always a ""I'll let you know"" or a clearly fake and bad excuse. Occasionally agreeing with a plan then flaking. I don't even initiate anything I just try to follow up with ""when are you available to do (whatever it is they suggested we do together)"" .

If it's not obvious already, I don't have much of a social life for quite a while now and am pretty lonely so I get my hopes up and look forward to these things. This has been very consistent, every time we talk they bring up multiple things we should do and talk about how we should hang out and it all seems like it's just words with no meaning. It feels like they are just toying with me, I don't know what is going on with them, the suggestions actually seem genuine but as soon as I try to turn it into an actual plan it's off.

I feel like a bitchy teenager writing all this and seems like a thing that an adult should not let bother them at all but it has brought up a bunch of stuff in me that I want to escape. I can't stop thinking about how confused I am about this situation and thinking that they are just fucking with me as some joke. 

Thanks for hearing my emotional teenager ass rambling about how bad I am with people.

Not drinking today and I'll cheers a la crox to all those other lonely people in recovery tonight.",5,0

I skipped class (again) and drank a pint of vodka in my car. I don’t even like vodka. I told my husband I was going to class, but I didn’t. I’ve missed so many days already. So many days spent drunk or hungover hating myself. I’ve been reflecting on the past 4-5 years and how many days I’ve spent black out drunk. Too many to count. All of the pointless arguments I’ve started with my now husband, the mean hateful things I’ve said, the shame and guilt. I’ve had chronic stomach issues for years now, and I now know it’s due to the alcohol abuse. I’ve had a colonoscopy done at the age of 27. I thought I had IBS, but I’m now sure it’s because of the alcohol abuse. I started this addiction as a way to help me sleep. I used to drink a fifth to a half of a fifth every night. I’ve cut down a lot, but I still binge drink. My husband and I have only been married 2 months, and I feel like I’m already ruining our marriage. He is aware of my struggles with alcohol and is supportive. I’m so scared that I can’t beat this. There is a very long history of alcoholism in my family, and I wish I could say it will end with me. I’ve been getting cash back at stores so I can buy alcohol and it not show up on our bank account. I drink and drive a lot. I’m so thankful I haven’t gotten a DUI yet, but it could happen. I hide empty bottles under my car seat and I hate the shame I feel when I have to empty them all at a gas station trash can. I hate that I hide bottles from my husband. I hate myself. I feel like I’m leading a double life, and I hate it. I feel like now that I’ve recognize I’m an alcoholic, it’s even harder to stop. I think about it more now because I have to stop myself from buying more. I want to stop and be free from this. This sub has really helped encourage me to stop. I’m in therapy, and I’m thinking of attending AA meetings. I just want to be free. I already struggle with depression, and the alcohol makes it so much worse.

I stopped the day the decision was made that they would stop, I want to be supportive so I stand in solidarity. 
But what I’ve realized in this time is that we, as individuals and as a couple, never really learned how to have fun as adults  without alcohol… I know it sounds stupid but seriously… dinner? Drinks! Bored? Karaoke Bar! Lunch? Drinks! Relax? Cocktails! Brunch? Mimosa/Bloody Marys! Bowling? Beer! Now you can even get a drink in a movie theatre! I’m trying really hard to not inspire drinking. When we go out my partner will casually ask if I want to sit at the bar and I say I’d rather have a private table together. We avoid our old favorite place because it’s grounded in alcohol.

I am here because I have had to spend hours browsing this subreddit and listen to hours of podcasts related to drinking mistakes due to my actions two weekends in a row. I had an alcohol fueled meltdown at a bar 2 weeks ago. Made amends to the best of my ability, but certainly feel pretty stupid as the community I was around is small and I'll certainly be seen again. It took me about a week to recover from the shame.

 Then I did it again. I hung out for the first time in months with somebody who I respected, and in my drunken state I became depressive and said some very stupid things that, to be honest, are really not accurate; just created out of alcohol induced depression. I pretty much made myself look ridiculous and possibly unstable.

My weekends usually consist of binging. I used to wait until the evening to start drinking, but lately I use it as a tool to avoid the hangover. This can sometimes create problems in the evening as drinking all day tends to accumulate to....drunkenness. lol.

I play in a men's league tonight and thought it would be okay to drink a beer after the game with the guys. I won't though. For the first time after a game, I'll have a soda or something. Things need to change and I cannot sustain damaging relationships and apologizing anymore. It's exhausting and keeping me from my goals.

Oh, and to top it off, I had to move the day after my meltdown last weekend. I slept in my car at the bar after throwing up out of my door copiously. I drove home wicked hung over. I was expected to help move. I pulled myself out of bed, went to my car, and chugged a couple beers to make myself a little less than worthless. Drank all day after that, of course. 

I've finally reached a point where the hanxiety is brutal and I have trouble sleeping for a few days after a bender.

I'm over it. I don't know how long I'll stop for, but I will not drink today. Thanks for listening to my story a bit. I truly believe I will change for the better and create a life for myself that I can be proud of.",10,0

I'm almost a week and a half sober and this seems to be a cycle that I get into at this point, where I start drinking slowly, and in three weeks time from starting to drink again I crash and have to do it all over again.

But here now my wife is five weeks pregnant and at 28 I'm really wanting to help myself so I can prepare to be a good dad and husband.

I've considered AA but I hardly have the time and I don't know, it seems the drinking tricks me into failed experiment after failed experiment.

The experiment that keeps convincing me here now is that since I can't drink at home I'm safe if I just do it with friends and get home at a decent time on a Friday night.

But the last time I tried this I found my inhibition gets so low I stay out with my friends until 3-5 am and that only angers my wife. And also, admittedly, drugs that I don't want to take I end up taking (cocaine).

At the start after a good three week break or so, I'll drink just a six pack through a long night, but in no time I'll be drinking myself to insanity when it calls to me.

I've been on this sub for 7 months and only recently started to see kindling getting referenced a bunch. I've read multiple clinical/academic research papers on the subject and while I understand what it is, it does seem there's no consensus on the exact set of circumstances to cause it and the way it's referenced on this sub it's made to sound like anybody who drinks heavily and quits for a while is at extreme risk of it and it'll take us all out if we fail our sobriety.

Yet, we all know from AA, from this sub, etc. that many if not most people who get sober for a period go back to drinking at some point, or that a lot of people have sober periods and drinking periods, or are bingers who will drink heavily for a day or a weekend, take a few days off, go back to it, etc. and we've all known- or I think a lot of us have known- plenty of people who have dealt with severe alcoholism and extended periods of abstinence from alcohol for decades without kindling coming up.

Out of the papers I have read, I still can't find a pinpointed ""kindling occurs in X out of Y alcoholics"" numbers.

I'm not saying it's a fake boogie man- I'm firm in my sobriety, not looking for an excuse to drink again or anything like that- but it does seem like a fairly rare problem and if it was that much of a looming threat on people, more people would have it, it'd be more commonly known along the lines of the DT's, etc.

I've had long detailed discussions with physicians about the long term effects of alcohol, of sobriety, of going back on the sauce, etc. and I've never been told about or warned about kindling.

So I just wonder... is it really that common? Does anybody here know anybody who definitely had it? Its symptoms are described vaguely enough that anybody with a mood disorder and some history of alcohol abuse could be considered to have some form of it.

He only valued the people in his life if they drank, and used drinking to control other people. It's been easy to blame him for my struggles with drinking, and use his abuse as an excuse for why I can't help it. I went through some medical trauma as a result of being sent to what I thought was a psychiatric clinic to work on cPTSD, but it ended up being a rehab that didn't have any focus on mental health recovery, so I've been pretty turned off of AA, NA, and getting help in general. I have no interest in being 100% sober, but I want to have a healthier relationship with alcohol and work heavily on harm reduction. At this point I feel like I deserve all of the negative results of drinking, both because of the shame of drinking and also because in general I feel like a terrible person. The weight gain, the terrible sleep, the destruction of my digestive system and skin, all feel like things that are par for the course with a lifetime of trauma, and I can't shake that it's all my fault and I don't deserve to feel better or healthy. I have tried so hard to take ""breaks"" that ended up being a maximum of five or six days long. I would love to take a couple of months and see how I feel after my body has a chance to recover, but the depression keeps creeping back up and making me feel like being sick and tired is worth not feeling like a waste of space, which of course I end up feeling like anyway because of the shame. I don't really know what I'm looking for on here, my therapist actually suggested this subreddit to me when I was telling her the same things I wrote above. I guess if anyone has resources on harm reduction that don't center around complete long term sobriety or alternatives to AA and NA I would be grateful to hear them. Otherwise I kind of just want to know if anyone else can relate to this because at the moment I just feel very alone and I don't know how to help myself take a break.",7,0

Moderation doesn’t work for me.","I can go long amounts of time (few months) without drinking. But if I’m in a social situation, that’s what snowballs it. I thought it was normal to black out, puke uncontrollably, and sob excessively when you drink. When I drink one and I’m being social, it’s like the more I drink the more fun I trick myself into thinking that I’m having.

It’s starting to become such a pattern. It’s bad for my health. It puts a divide between me and my partner (who has never drank before in their life). And I don’t like the ritual of blacking out and calling everyone the next day to make sure I wasn’t mean, or disrespectful, or making a scene.

But because I don’t technically get cravings, it makes me wonder if I’m exaggerating it in my head. Maybe moderation didn’t work because I didn’t have a strong enough will to stop this time and I will next time.

Is this a common path? I have taken some deliberate breaks, a sober month here or there, but during those I was pretty unhappy with not being *allowed* to drink.

I used to be courageous. A textbook extrovert. The kind of person who teases out someone's life story within 20 minutes of meeting them. I was the hypothetical friend your mother was referring to when she asked ""if your friends jumped off a cliff would you do it too?"" and I'd always be the first one to jump, with everyone else happily flinging themselves off behind me.

In ten years, I crushed that spirit. As my courage wore down, I drank more to try and muster some up. I drank to smash through inhibitions just trying to feel like I used to. The bravery always wore off by the next day, leaving me emptier and scared and intimidated by my own shadow.

I write for a living. I've always been confident in my work even when the trolls show up to nitpick every word. Now I cower at even the hint of criticism. Imagine if your job were completely public and there were a box inviting everyone on the internet to comment on it from behind a cloak of anonymity. This never used to bother me. I'd throw back a bunch of White Claws, roll up my sleeves, and jump right in to the comment section to brawl. Now I say nothing. My heart rate soars every time I see a notification on my phone thinking it could be a remotely critical comment. I question every word. I question *myself*.

Looking back I know that the ""bravery"" alcohol gave me wasn't real. Maybe it was a bit real from drinks 1-3 for a fleeting moment but then I'd blast right past brave to belligerent and spend the next day paying off that bravery loan with anxiety and shame. Lather rinse repeat. 

I know that alcohol didn't actually make me invincible. I know that it made me say and do things that sober me would have never said or done, and that it slandered my reputation and ground me down to a broken nub from the vibrant, creative, outgoing, confident person I used to be. I know that what felt like invincibility looked like utter insanity to anyone observing from the outside. Alcohol lied and told me I could, reality would always remind me later that I could not.

Still, I miss that feeling. I miss not constantly second-guessing everything I do. I miss feeling like I could do anything. I swear I remember a younger version of myself before alcohol wore me down who truly could. And with all this time under my belt I worry I may never find her again. I don't even know if she's even under the still-smoldering ash of the last ten years. Of all the good that's come from the last 16 months of sobriety, my biggest fear is that I'll never know what it feels like to be brave again. And that really blows.",9,0

Anyway, while queueing, I found myself imagining a narrative for this woman. She’s a person who’s able to buy just four beers along with the rest of her groceries. “Wow!” I thought to myself, “to buy beer like any other item in this store! For it to be as relevant or irrelevant as a tub of ice cream or a block of nice cheese. That would be nice.” But that’s nice for other people. For me, four beers in a basket would mean spiralling into mortal decline. I felt a little sad but I powered through. Not everything is for everyone. And alcohol isn’t for me.

On one hand, I felt healthier, mornings weren't disgusting, and I lost 30 lbs. People said I looked healthier, all great confidence boosting stuff. On the other, being unable to escape my emotions was very jarring, and rather than deal with them I just tried avoid them with other shit (overeating, videogames). 

When I relapsed, I was consciously giving up on myself. I didn't even feel bad about it. I thought ""fuck this, I am unable to deal with this anxiety and depression, fuck the progress, I'm tired"". And of course 2 weeks later me and my mom have our first big fight in a while.

I drank last night but IWNDWYT. I'm getting a counselor and dealing with root causes. Done with this shit, wasting my youth and hating myself a little more everyday. It's so overwhelming to think of all the ways I want to change, but I got sober by taking it one step at a time, so thats what I'll do.

Tomorrow instead of waking up at 1pm and having diarrhea (my life for that last 3 weeks) I'm gonna get up at 7 and try making a japanese omellete. I will report back in the daily thread. IWNDWYT",12,0

The countless nights we have went out to either bars or house parties, he has been kicked out of all of them. I understand that we are very young and put ourselves in environments that facilitate this activity, but something needs to change. He gets kicked out of bars by being blacked out and performing idiotic behaviors like, for example, doing pull-ups from the rafters, stealing alcohol from behind the counter, yelling at bouncers, getting in fights he will never win, etc. He acknowledges the fact that he needs help as he told me he wants to see a counselor due to Bipolar Disorder running in the family and his lack of common sense. I do not want to push him away or give him advice that he will never listen, but he is a very understanding person when he has a clear mind. 

I don't know what to say to him or how to help him, but I do not want these activities to continue in his future. He is a very smart kid but his self control and reason escapes him as soon as alcohol touches his lips.

When I'm not drinking I pretty much just get out of bed, work, get back in bed until I fall asleep, and repeat. That's not a life no matter how you spin it. 

So it makes total sense after I get feeling better I go right back to daily drinking. Why wouldn't I? I'm human for gods sake, I don't want to just work and sleep. I want to live. This just isn't what I expected that to mean. 

I want to go outside but it's cold af. I work the sun away anyway so it's not like there's anything to do. I want to go on a road trip but the car isn't legal, and my taxes on it are $300 or something, and I can't afford them. Maybe just take the risk with the car, cops don't really care around here, but my luck is I'll get a ticket and then I'm even more broke. Which makes me wonder why am I broke all the time if I'm working so much. Doesn't seem right. Even when I'm saving money from not drinking I'm broke all the time. 

It just has me thinking. Like anyone can say what they want, that there's never a reason to waste life away drinking, but I can think of plenty honestly. Just like when people say money doesn't buy happiness. It doesn't, but it sure helps. I'm not going to drink today, and I still want to quit.

Until one day I was listening to a podcast on alcohol and heard a brilliant quote.

It went like “If you ate an apple a day. Every single day for your lunch for 20 years of your life. But then one day it was proven with 100% certainty that apples give you cancer. You’d stop eating apples and switch to a banana, despite how weird it might feel at first”. 

Really put things into perspective. 

Also another little funny fruit quote was “if you had to stop yourself from eating a banana until 1pm every day, everyone would think that you had a banana problem” - another metaphor mocking the way people (my past self included) won’t have a drink of alcohol until a set time in the day such as 1pm",130,0

I'm not sure yet if I am a true alcoholic but, I do have that faulty off switch where sometimes I just don't know I've had enough.  Anyway, there are two incidents that caused me to consider quitting drinking this time, possibly forever.  On a trip to visit my father (first visit since the pandemic started), I stayed up drinking late with my brother while my kids and husband were in bed.  I told him some personal things that I probably shouldn't have that happened a long time ago.  And since I was drunk, I probably wasn't communicating well and may have made things sound worse.  Anyway, it's not the first time this kind of thing has happened, I just don't make good decisions while drinking.  I've done some pretty dumb things. The sad bit to this is that I'm actually a very well adjusted, otherwise responsible person, yet I create these situations for myself that cause me so much anxiety/shame from time to time.  The second thing that spurred me to quit was getting COVID.  After my son and myself recooperated a few weeks ago, I got the sense that I had been using alcohol to deal with my pandemic anxiety.  Somewhere in the last couple of years, my drinking has accelerated.  It seems like the drinking of most those around me accelerated too, so it felt normal.  But, I digress.

The reasons why I feel I may not be an alcoholic are that I have never hidden my drinking.  Like,  I've never gluged alcohol in secret, never hidden a bottle.  In fact, I don't consciously feel like I need alcohol most of the time.  However, I just can't say for sure that if I decided to keep drinking that I'd never have another embarrassing episode or blackout.  No matter what rules I may make for myself, it would almost definitely happen again and that frightens me! 

This last time quitting, I do think I experienced some mild withdraw.  Headaches.  Insomnia.  A listless feeling.  And I've lost my appetite, although that may be COVID related.

Anyway,  thanks for letting me share!  I look forward to getting to know some of you!",9,4

I'm having tremendous difficulty to work this last months. It was one of the main reasons I stopped drinking 14 days ago. I knew it was frying my brain and feeding my anxiety. So, although I always knew that sobriety wouldn't itself turn my computer on and work for me, I was hoping to work a lot better by removing alcohol from my routine. 

I go to the psychologist weekly and have already been to the psychiatrist too. I'm eating better, sleeping, exercising etc. I do think that in fact I kinda dislike my job and have been sabotaging myself. But I want to work, and I need this job, so I wanna try to get better before taking some rushed decision to quit, or, of course, being fired. 

So the thing is, tough I have lots of things to solve in my life, I'm doing relatively ok without drinking, the cravings are minimal. But I'd really appreciate some practical suggestions by people that have already had this ""work paralysis"", that sensation that it is just impossible to work.

I've been alcohol sober for nearly 2 months now, and lately probably for the last couple of weeks, triggers have intensified. So for some reason like the addict that i am, after an internal battle of rationalization, i ended up finding (as always) a seemingly ""valid"" reason why it would be fine to indulge this time.   


This reason is obviously not valid, so no need to develop on this further.   


I dressed up, went outside to the ATM machine, grabbed some cash and headed to the nearby liquor store.   


Now here is the funny part, on my way there, i was wearing a new cap that i bought last weekend, this cap is a little too thight on my head, so while on my way to the store, it started to give me a little bit of a headache. This feeling reminded of the feeling of hangover the next day after drinking, which as you know isn't pleasant at all.   


So i took some time to reflect on it, vividly feel it, and realized how tomorrow would be a day spent recovering like a big fat slob, doing nothing productive, staying at home, spending mindless hours on internet, craving junk food... I basically reverse rationalized on why it would actually be a bad idea in the end, especially when my initial goal was to spend my first year alcohol free as an adult.

At the moment, I am working full time remotely while also starting my side hustle consulting biz. I do stay sober for work, and I also would stay sober for side hustle work. As such, I think my strategy is to simply...work. A lot. Already I seem to be becoming a workaholic. I know that this is not the best life balance, but since it seems I can't do it on my own, perhaps this would save me. Weekends are also for working but I fear the Friday and Saturday nights will capture me for bingeing, though my partner doesn't like it and that's when he's around.

I'm just so grateful for all the changes, challenges, the ups and downs, the sleepless nights, the transformed relationship, the Saturday mornings, the new experiences, and I'm grateful for the life that sober me is building.

Alcohol was (and probably still is) my favorite coping mechanism. It turned down the volume of my thoughts. My low self-esteem, self-doubt, and anxiety would be silenced for a few hours, but once I started drinking, there was no stopping. I was afraid to show who I was, so I drank until I wasn't me anymore. 

Well, I've given the real me a chance to fight, to combat the negative self-talk in healthy ways, to face my fears and grow exponentially in such a short period.

The beginning is hard, and when I would read these posts over the YEARS, it took me to get to this point. I was always filled with amazement that others could go six-fucking-months without drinking when my longest stretch was maxed at five days. 

The one piece of advice I can give newcomers is to do whatever is in your power to stay sober initially. I DD’d, said no, dealt with FOMO sadness, but it was easier every day.

After a few months, though, you are going to have to put in some hard work and take ownership of your life. 

I started getting very emotional and depressed again around the two-month mark. I started running, exercising, meditating, eating right and sleeping right, and talking about my feelings, thoughts, and fears, and I was able to start taking care of myself. 

I have to do all of that to stay where I'm at, and for some, that may sound daunting, but it's something that I embrace now that I'm sober. 

Real, actual life is hard. But it's a lot easier for me to do life without booze. 

Looking back, booze left me fighting life blindfolded with both hands tied behind my back.

I'm so proud and happy of this accomplishment and I cried for the first time in a while this morning (happy tears).

I also want to give a special shoutout to all of you beautiful people here on this sub! Every post is an inspiration from day 1 to day 10,000.

In addition to that singular, impressionable experience, I grew up in wasteland town of abandoned factories, well-below-average incomes, little hope and no mentors.   Alcohol was the joy adults looked forward to.  As a result, I was conditioned to view drinking - and getting buzzed - not as just ok but *expected*.  

Surprisingly, I hardly drank in college as I wasn't of drinking age and was pretty much a bookworm.  

Once I became of drinking age, my ""alcohol primed"" brain clicked on...

Through my 20s I blacked out probably once a month.  I didn't drink every day though.  In my 30s and 40s this transitioned into not blacking out but drinking every day working up to about 4 or 5 a day at its peak.  

I'm now 44 and there's a core piece of me that still *feels* it is cool, in spite of me *knowing* rationally it certainly is not. 

I started cutting back last year and.  I have averaged slightly less than 1 drink a day in the past 130 days.  

I would probably have considered this a failed attempt a few months ago but my mindset has slowly changed and I am proud of this progress and wanted to share. Part of my pride is that I genuinely *feel* this is a permanent cut-back.

One drink a day may be a socially and physically  acceptable amount of alcohol for most people.  It isn't for me. The amount of time I spend thinking about it is ridiculous.  

It's a great change not waking up with headaches and not feeling like a tremendous failure.  I do find it very, very hard to go completely AF, but it is a struggle worth pursuing.

 Good morning. 
 Our keynote is “Kindness”.
 Today’s Meditation and Prayer counsel patience and waiting for God‘s guidance rather than acting rashly.
 An early AA mentor
called the idea, ""Do something , even if it's wrong."", the most insane premise on which he conducted his life before sobriety.
 In my own life, I have gotten into, and caused, far more trouble by acting rashly or speaking too soon than by 
remaining quiet and still when uncertain of my next word or action.
 I must depend on God to find the balance between rash or premature activity on one hand and paralysis from indecision on the other.
 If I could find that balance on my own, I could manage my life. 
History makes it clear that I can do neither.
  The magic is in waiting for the Divine Spark’s guidance, but acting promptly, in spite of fear and my propensity to procrastinate, when the next stitch becomes clear. 
 I love you all.",2,0

I was overweight at the peak 31 pounds, @ an unacceptable 156 lbs.  Thankfully that 156lbs was for one day.  I freaked out. Bloated and had to buy fat jeans at the Goodwill.  Nightmare!!!  Saying regrettable things.  Negative attitude on steroids.  Hated my life.  Time to CHANGE! 

Started at SMART Recovery online.  Read 10 books.  1000 Zoom AA meetings last year to learn emotional sobriety.  A few in person meetings.  Lots of SD and another online forum.  NLP.  I lost that and 20-25 pounds twice total 3 times.   I am now holding steady at 124 lbs.  At goal minus 1 making new goal 120 lbs and build muscle.  Ramped up the exercise the last couple of years.  It feels so good to start to get strong.  There is so much to do.  Drinking alcohol is absolutely a negative in every way, and six years into the journey, having just moved across the country too, I am so happy to have dumped the wine.  Every single thing in life is better sans the booze.  Life is what I make it.  Drinking wine on the couch smoking cigs and pot was a miserable life. IWnDWYT",15,0

When Christmas came around I found myself consumed with anger - anger at my ex girlfriend for leaving me, anger at the industry I worked to build a career in for 7 years as well as the people that make up said industry for never truly accepting me and showing true colors when my career collapsed last summer. Anger at the loneliness I felt after burning so many bridges and having so many people turn away from me. So I drank, and I haven't been able to get back and stay on the wagon since. 

I'm in some pretty intense therapy and take medication for bipolar disorder. Through that, getting feedback and support from friends, and having some real moments of clarity in between drunks, I was starting to moderate more, cut back, and I found my mental health improving once again - specifically, the anger lessened greatly because I was able to come to closure on my breakup and why it happened. I was beginning to understand that even though unfair and shitty things did happen, I still had a role to play in all of it - humility allowed me to stop seeing her and my professional peers as ""monsters"" who wronged me and more as human beings that are broken and suffering in their own ways. I really thought I was coming through the clearing finally and seeing the light. That things were gonna get better. 

Then a few nights ago, after several white claws I was sent a news article that deeply annoyed and upset me. The specifics aren't important - but I shared the article on Facebook and began to rail against the things that frustrated me about this particular piece of news. Long story short, this issue that stemmed from the news article is not only something that personally was very harmful to me in the past, it's something I've been vocally critical of for years, often to the discomfort of my peers (most of my generation supports the issue that frustrates me). 

That one post sharing the article with my hypercharged, aggressive commentary turned into 3 posts, and then 5, and then 7 over the course of a few hours. The more drunk I got, the less I felt fear of crossing the line - I was calling people fake and threatening to unfriend people who supported the issue in the article, and the jist of it is my tone, wording, and fixation on this sudden anger greatly bothered and alienated my friends on FB, a dozen or more of whom unfriended me or outright blocked me. 

Because of my personal experience with this issue, I got even more mad and highly emotional. Finally I ended up passing out for the night, but not without the damage already being done. Woke up the next day, still felt I should stand by my conviction and not backtrack or apologize, but it quickly became apparent (and a few people didn't hesitate to let me know) that even if my position was valid, I went about it like a total fucking asshole and publically melted down in front of 900+ Facebook friends. 

Days come and go and I wonder why I feel so alone and why my relationships feel so hollow, and then I look at my alcohol fueled outbursts and this ugly, bitter anger I still clearly haven't resolved. I'm not hateful nor am I ignorant; I just drink too much and lose control of my emotions and lash out. And I hate it. Today I've felt like shit, especially knowing some of those people who blocked me were good friends I respect. I've offered some apologies to friends and actually went ahead and just uninstalled Facebook as I clearly can't be trusted to have access to the ""say what's on your mind"" box. Plus, I think the people that are left could use just as much a break from me as I could use from them. 

Thanks for reading all that. I am currently coming up on 48 hours no alcohol (since this incident) and fellas, I really want and need to remove alcohol from my life for good. Once I start I can't stop drinking, and when the stars align and my emotions and alcohol line up, I make poor choices and lash out for no good reason other than my own frustration. I am tired of destroying my relationships and friendships. I've had much worse bottoms than this in the past, but this one felt especially defeating. 

Sigh. I needed to get all that off my chest. Gonna pick myself up, brush my shoulders off, and try again. It's all I can do. Any words of support are greatly appreciated. 

Thanks. ♥️",24,0

I'm trying to find things I once enjoyed to resume, or new things to learn to enjoy, and ways to schedule things to look forward to that don't involve alcohol. That is tough, especially since I'll probably have to cancel some social events in order not to be tempted early on. But exercise, cooking, walks, reading, writing, singing, and coffee are some ideas I've had so far.

Lately I have not even looked forward to drinking, which actually makes it easier to make the transition to having ""nothing"" to look forward to, when for years I would look forward to alcohol. Rationally I know that there are things to look forward to, but I don't feel excited yet.

Yesterday I read an essay that Leo Tolstoy wrote in 1890 on the question of intoxicants, called [Why Do Men Stupefy Themselves?](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Why_Do_Men_Stupefy_Themselves%3F) I'd known its title for at least a few years but I had never been able to bring myself to read it.

I just got woken up because there is an emergency with one of the pets. My wife needs to take the cat to the vet and it’s 12:45 am.

So, the good thing about being sober is that I’m alert. I can function. I can stay home with my kids while she takes them to the vet. Oh, if I had been drinking this would be a nightmare. And this is just a pet emergency: imagine if there was a fire or a break-in or one of the kids was urgently sick. It would be a colossal disaster. 

So I am thankful I didn’t drink today. 

Now for the bad …

I’ve been thinking about divorce lately. I’m not happy. And I’m beginning to realize that drinking was masking my unhappiness. 

I didn’t want pets, but the kids did and I wanted them to be happy. And now there’s this huge emergency that I don’t really give two shits about. 

All of that is piled onto the fact that I didn’t sleep well the night before, I had a horrible day at work, and I’m long over being frustrated with being the sole earner in our household. Another bill to add to the mix and guess who is going to pay for it? 🤚 

And I’ve got some family issues going on right now with an ailing parent, that is emotionally eating me up. 

I suppose the good thing is that in this moment I realize that there’s nothing alcohol would do that would be positive for the situation. But it would certainly make it worse.

OK, that’s the rant. I’m not expecting to find any answers. I’m just typing this from my bed because I’m frustrated and overwhelmed, but at least I’m sober.

I went cold turkey from my last binge and I believe the next time it could kill me.  I was sober and feeling terrific in December,. planned to ""moderate"" Christmas Eve through New Year and quit. It went great until it didn't.  Around January 15th I fell into the old ""hair of the dog"" routine again.  By afternoon I've had the whole damn dog.  Thing is, my consumption wasn't that much (for me).  Mostly beer and hard seltzers with supplemental vodka.  But it was morning,. noon and night for 10 days.  My day 1 I woke and was physically incapable of either driving or even walking to get more I was shaking so bad.  Never shook like that before.  Heart pounding and no sleep for 66 hours.  NEVER had withdrawals like that before.  Been around this block before,. and always by day 4 I was good to go. Now 13 days in I can still feel slight tremors,. brain fog, faster heart rate and my balance is fucked.  I am quitting for my health,. I have to.  I am 58 and may not survive more drinking.  I worry about my liver.             
     Nevertheless cravings come up with all the old lies alcohol tells me.
     Yesterday I told myself...""It's for your HEALTH ,!"". not about ""getting away with "" something.  What if my doctor told me I was severely allergic to cheese.  I love cheese,  my world would be dimmed without it.  BUT if I was told eating cheese would be life-threatening and lead to days of misery and sickness,. I would simply accept it and give it up.  Even though everyone else can eat cheese in front of me,. and TV ads for cheese are everywhere,.teasing images of pizza,. enchiladas,.cheeseburgers and sandwiches.  I wouldn't whine to myself about how unfair it all was, but accept that some people can eat cheese and I can't.  Not plot ways to sneak cheese because I deserve it.  Takes the emotion and entitlement out of the decision to drink or not 
After I run through these mental images the craving subsides.  Thank you subredditors,. I am so grateful to feel I'm not alone in this.  First time post,. but have been following for a couple of months. IWNDWYT.....but I will have some pepper jack cheese and crackers right now!",15,0

Do you guys have any advice? I'm so tired of this... I have ADHD and CPTSD, so not only do I dopamine seek, I also want something to numb me when I have a flashback. I am in both EMDR for my trauma and see a regular therapist, so I am addressing these issues and they are why I stopped drinking every day in October. It just feels so impossible sometimes.",11,0

The things that I have done while intoxicated absolutely make me cringe and hate myself. The drugs, the sex, the fighting, the things I’ve said. The people I’ve hurt… How do you deal with the immense regret/shame/guilt after drinking? 


I’m having a really, really, really hard time getting over that right now. The one thing I’ve read is that “the best way to keep those things from happening again is to just stop drinking.” This advice came from a Reddit sub that didn’t have anything to do with alcoholism, as I’m sure you can tell. I wish I could “just stop.”

It hurts so much. I’m tired of waking up remembering everything I’ve done, feeling dizzy and weak and sick to my stomach and miserable. And the god awful anxiety… I can’t take another round of it. I can’t do this to myself anymore.

I’ll always get like 4 days in and be like “I think I’ll be ok to get a little drunk.” And then it’s a full on bender. I know obviously it WONT be ok. But something is seriously wired very wrong in my brain? Why do I convince myself it’ll be okay? Why do I go back knowing how fucking bad I’m going to feel? 

2 years of this. I wish enough would just be enough already. The weight I’ve gained… all the the things I’ve done to my organs and my health and body … I feel like I am just rotting from the inside out. It’s like 3-4 times a week I get absolutely shit faced.. I can’t do this anymore. I don’t want to :(

I’m very motivated right now to never do this to myself again. But I say that, it’s only been two days… I’m afraid for later in the week when I think I’ll be ok again.",10,0

Then I tried Dry January last month. Made it 7 days which then followed that with a week long bender that ended in a three day long hangover. I finally decided to tell my mom who is a recovering alcoholic (but now sober 3 years!). I knew this was the next step in getting the help I so desperately need. I was sober for almost 2 more weeks which was the longest I haven't drank in probably 4 years. This ended in another few-day bender and I knew I couldn't do this anymore. I had to take a leave of absence from work to finally get my shit together.

While I agree that the negatives of continuing to drink far outweigh the sacrifice of time and money to medically detox, that is not what he says.  I'm 28 days in, so it doesn't apply to me at this point, but it is hard to not take everything else he says with a grain of salt.

I really want to put faith in the state of mind he recommends for continued and craving-free sobriety.  It is really hard to reconcile with what I mentioned above.  He started with a ""quit smoking"" book... Maybe he just saw a fat paycheck and used find/replace with cigarettes and alcohol.

It all kinda broke me and for  most the later half of 2021 I was pushing nearly a bottle of the hard stuff down my neck everyday.

Anyways, realized this isn’t the life I wanna live.  Got on naltrexone (50mg with The Sinclair Method).  Dropped that down to 3 drinks a day, then down to 1-2.  Now I’m AF but doing a secondary anti-kindle taper week starting with a 1mg of clonozapam and eventually going down to .25mg in 5 days.

I’ve done opiate withdrawal before, so I have some idea of the body sensations that will happen.  Luckily I have endless gabapentin which is a blessing for WD.  I have ZERO cravings, which is a good sign.  I’m in mild distress I would say (thank you long tapper, a little kpin, and the gabapentin).

Fortunately I’m no where near a DTs candidate and the gabapentin keeps my seizure threshold high so I can rule that out.

I guess I’m asking for the folklore of what I should do next.  Does CBD help in the short term (I don’t like thc)?  Did you all force yourselves out to go for a run or is staying in bed for a couple days ok?  Any magic tea you imbibed?  Can anyone who’s done WD with opiates and EtOH compare and contrast?

The main reason I stopped and started attending AA was because I never want to climb back in the anxiety and depression hole I would dig for myself every weekend. I was what I would call a social binge drinker. Always the drunkest at the party and the last one to go to bed. I consistently would feel the emotional withdrawal effects of a heavy weekend of drinking until Wednesday (even without consuming alcohol after Saturday night). I refused to believe it was a problem because I didn’t need to drink every day and I’ve seen relatives who were much worse than me in relation to being required to drinking sun up to sun down on a daily basis

After a run today I decided to take a gander at my Garman connect app which tracks all my health parameters from my watch. I was not shocked to find that my stress was about 3 times as high on sundays and mondays as it was during the other days of the week. Just figured I’d share this in case anyone was wondering if hangziety was a myth. 

I always tried to blame my job or chemical imbalance for my unhappiness during the week, but to be honest I think I was too afraid to admit what the problem really was.

ultimatums didn’t make me stop. like secrets of hidden liquor in empty A1 sauce bottles. just cooking, honey. eventually you can see it flashing like neon signs in their eyes. pain, mistrust, betrayal, you said you loved me, why can’t you stop for them? not even for them!? you nod, see it clearer than you can even stumble, function. so you take it, and you file it away. as a reason, as fodder for the demons, as an excuse, as the “one last time, one last time, if i don’t do it one last time i will rip from my skin and annihilate everything in my path.”

alcohol, for me, isn’t a lover. not a smooth caress as i blacked out every night, it was an IED of selfish empty consumptions. loathing and guilt sweating from me with each step. money down the drain, and when there was no money, oh i would find it, with predictable excuses like a self portrait of mockery. it didn’t make me beautiful, but bloated like a corpse.  i couldn’t even look in the mirror, this disgusting thing always snarled back where my face should have been.

there’s wine still on the bedroom walls. a subconscious exorcism where i couldn’t make it to taste this fucking addiction in reverse from the privacy of my locked bathroom at 8 in the morning. dark faded droplets under a framed ultrasound picture of a baby i lost on a spring day. the shame stained through the sheets too, and i leave it there, because even though there is no weakness in forgiveness, forgetting is for fools.

when i shucked the bullets in the chamber of that gun is the only time alcohol ever supported me. and even then it screamed for my neck, screamed for death so loud, that i almost listened.

i am 28 days sober tomorrow.

Do I still get urges to drink. But I’ve grown more confident in checking in with myself and saying 

“Why do I feel like I want a drink?” 
“What’s making me uncomfortable?” 
“What negative emotion am I trying to avoid?”

I’m able to trust myself again. I throw parties, I go out dancing, but I sure as fuck don’t drink. It’s just no longer a habit I have.

Today is day 16, longest streak in a long time and I found myself getting very annoyed this weekend at my husband.  I am not so much annoyed that ""he gets to drink"" and I don't. Frankly I don't want to. I know it is just a lie that a beer will make me relaxed or make me have fun. I brought up something last night that I told him about on Thursday or Friday and he had zero recollection about it. In addition to that, I see my husband being very short with our daughter in certain scenarios.

It makes me think of how I had a period of time where I was blacking out too often. I also see myself and how little patience I had for our daughter in the past year. 

My husband has definitely backed off on his drinking since I quit, but I wish he had stuck with the idea of quitting. He will make his own choice in time. I am proud that he has cut back on how much he drinks. I know what alcohol is doing to him and I do worry. I want to know what it would be like to be fully present in this part of our life and marriage without the filter of beer.

I still had fun; I still laughed; I still hung out with friends. The only difference was that I can remember all the good times, I'm thinner and I saved a bunch of money. 

I don't think anyone would've ever described me as an alcoholic. I held down a good, professional job (one that happened to involve a lot of drinking in its own right), I exercised, I had a good marriage and never had a DUI, but more and more my life began to revolve around alcohol. I'd plan my vacations around drinking, figure out how to get hammered and not have to drive, etc. In the end, I was sneaking drinks when I visited family and blacking out WAAAY too much (though one time is too much). I had tried dozens of ways to limit my drinking: ""only two drinks a day"", or ""7 drinks a week"", but of course, I never kept to my self-imposed restrictions. In the end, getting off it completely was the only answer. I stopped, incredibly, on a Saturday - and on the day before the Superbowl no less. Something was different about quitting this time. I was ready...and reading countless posts on this sub made me recognize that, though I never really put it together previously, I was an alcoholic and things needed to change. 

I gave alcohol a good 15 years of my life and, while there were definitely a lot of good times, I'm moving on. Sayonara, booze, wine & beer, I'm going to see what else is out there. Time to focus on what's next and see what I'm capable of when I'm not thinking about how much I drank or how much I get to drink. 

My next phase is now tackling the sugar addiction which has emerged since I quit alcohol and all the sugar it contains, but that feels much more benign, and now that I know what I'm capable of I know it won't be a problem. 

Life is good now. I can drive whenever I want and am happy to tell people I don't drink. If asked why, I just tell them, ""I was just drinking too much and wanted to stop"". People seem happy with that answer and are often impressed - or feel compelled to talk about their own goals or struggles. Also, emerging from a drinking life the way I have has made me more empathetic to others. I was going through something and no one ever knew it, so now I assume everyone else is going through something difficult and I choose to be nice to them. 

But, what I really wanted to say with this post is ""Thank You"". To each of you who are a part of this community, who post, who comment, thank you. I joined Reddit after discovering the Stopdrinking page and I will say that the support, honesty and inspiration that I've discovered here was the #1 factor for why I was able to quit this time. You are all awesome people and I can't thank you enough.

When I first realized I had a problem, I didn’t want to admit it because I was so young. I’m 24 now, and while that is still VERY young, I can no longer justify it as being 21 and having fun.

Honestly, it’s never been fun. I can count the amount of times I’ve actually had fun drinking on one hand. 99% of the time, I’ve always drank alone and to just escape my own head.

My life is great- or rather, was. I had a great job, a great girlfriend, a puppy. I had everything I had ever wanted and I have thrown it away time and time again for something that poisons my mind, body, and spirit.

On Wednesday, I’ll be going into treatment for the 4th time in 7/8 months. I can string together 3 months, 2 months, a month; I just always pick up again. The time I’m able to stay sober is getting completely sober and my instances of drinking are getting much worse. I’m talking blacking out and living in my car for 4 days- that kind of bad.

I know alcoholism is a progressive illness and, for me, the next step is homelessness, jail, and death. This constant cycle of getting the hopes up of my loved ones and making them think I’m finally going to stay sober, followed by relapsing and doing unimaginable things to those around me is unbearable for everyone involved.

I know it’s getting to the point now where people are starting to no longer be able to distinguish between my horrible, alcoholic self and pleasant, kind, sober me. No one believes a single word that comes out of my mouth, no one believes I genuinely love them. I NEED this rehab to be the last one, I know I have too much potential and love inside me to die an alcoholic death.

I guess I just want to know, how do I forgive myself for the things I’ve done? If I am able to forgive myself, how do I remember this horrible feeling and not pick up again? I’m just ruining my life for something that I hate.",7,0

I last for a month then usually fall off the wagon. I had a trip with my boyfriend to NYC about a month of being sober- I drank while I was in NYC, I thought I could be stronger but I was not. Got back to my home state and started my sobriety over- my bf wants me to come with him on a business trip where there is a lot of mingling and socializing- I thought I was ready but I was not. I wish I could voice my insecurities of traveling- but I love to travel- it’s just now I’m 31 it’s not fun anymore bc I use it as an excuse to drink. So yesterday on a layover I started drinking at the airport. My boyfriend was LIVID- even after one drink infront of everyone at the airport bar was like YOU CANNOT SERVE HER SHES AN ALCOHOLIC”. The bar tender had to talk to my bf and tell him to settle down. He then cancels all my cards that we share. He then proceeded to call my 80 year old dad and told him to come pick me up from the airport- mind you he lives about an hour and 20 mins away. So I called my dad after I found out my bf was in communication with him and told my dad that yes I did drink but my bf is being very overbearing and trying to humiliate me to keep me away from the booze. My 80 year dad arrived and the airport against my wishes and I was buzzed at the time I just yelled at him and told him i said not to come, flipped him off, and ran away from him. He won’t talk to me anymore. Last text I got from my dad was him saying we need to speak face to face about our relationship and he wants to know where he went so wrong. Ouch. I’m so upset with myself and cannot shake this guilt. It’s actually really heartbreaking. I know that was a turning point for my dad seeing me treat him like that.

even though i haven’t had any cravings after the first two weeks, the last two months have been really hard and i’ve often felt defeated.

I have been using alcohol for pain management since a 2018 hip and back injury. Yesterday was Day 12 sober. I had yet another spine surgery a week ago. My course of pain meds gave me zero pain relief and only left me groggy and stumbling. The last time I took any was another surgery a year ago, and they didn't help me then either.  Alcohol is the only thing that ever helped.  I know...not the kind of help we need and definitely not sustainable.

Last night I was in too much pain to sleep.  Stone sober and my back and hip felt like ice picks were being twisted in me.  Sitting hurt bad and lying down hurt more. Finally I just caved. I grabbed my wife's open half-bottle of wine and drank it. I was so upset with myself, but it did calm me down a little.  Finally got to sleep kneeling on the floor in front of a coffee table stacked with pillows to lean over.

Called my surgeon's office today and told them all this.  They said ""we can see you in three weeks""!?!?!  I told them I couldn't wait three hours!  We settled on Thursday.

I’ve gone back and forth on my drinking and drug-use as “problematic” or “I’m just young and having fun.” I still don’t have that sorted but maybe it’s not a dichotomy. I used to be a stoner (read weed addict) and I quit weed about a year and a half ago, and learned how to be sober on a daily basis….. aside from the glasses of wine I’d have a few days a week and the binges I’d go on on weekends. I was chalking it up to young fun partying, but things got kind of bad during the pandemic and then worse once my city opened up bars and clubs. I was drinking to the point of getting wasted, and also starting using coke almost every weekend. I have started to wonder if my friendships are meaningful and even matter outside of the bars. I have started to believe there’s way more to life. I talked with my friends about this and they actually all agree, and they want to prioritize more sober, wholesome time together and I’m so thankful. I had my first sober weekend in what feels like a very long time, and I actually went out to a show on Friday and drank nothing bed Red Bull. I had the hilarious obnoxious urge to brag to the bar tender that I was sober (I didn’t don’t worry lol). 

I definitely feel the pink cloud right now and I feel good about my decision. I wonder how that will change as time goes on. But for today, I’m happy to be completely sober. I’m absolutely taking it one day at a time as the thought of the future is daunting. But I really want this for myself, I really want to be the best, healthiest version of me I can be.

I've been trying to stop drinking for awhile now. My drinking was never as bad as some people on here but it was enough to be causing me regular misery.

Anyways... I've noticed I keep running into the same problem when I stop. I can get a couple days, even a week of sobriety. But I just cannot get positive. I can't feel good about myself or things, or look forward to hobbies, or get motivated to work out and eat healthy. I think not being able to get positive just makes me become negative and that leads me right back to drinking or binge eating to avoid drinking (which never works).

I can watch motivational videos about health, fitness, life etc. and its clear these people are operating on a much more positive outlook. They don't have mental anchors and shit weighing them down.

Back to Day 1 of Total Sobriety","I struggled a lot with alcohol abuse in 2019 and 2020. Kept craving and relapsing. The main reason I turned to alcohol was because I struggled with severe anxiety and depression. But I put in the work, got to the root cause of my issues, developed healthy coping mechanisms and it made a world of a difference. Today for most part I am healthy, happy and I no longer seek out alcohol to self medicate. But there's a part of me that still misses and likes the social aspect of alcohol, the great feeling of the whole group being slightly buzzed and laughing along and I yearningly think of the few good memories I had with it before I became a problem drinker. 

After going totally sober for a while, since August 2021, I started letting myself drink again once a month, and in November increased that to twice a month. I really wanted to be someone who can go back to drinking like the others, only once in a while of course. I gave myself rules, put in a lot of effort to stay in moderation the few times I drank. 

But I think the honest truth is that I will never have a ""normal"" relationship with alcohol which I just have to accept. In the handful of times I tried to drink since I restarted, it was 50-50. Half the times I was alright and had a good time, the rest half I was not - involved blacking out, talking too much, and passing out etc. Every time I drank though I had a downer the day after and a lot of anxiety about it. It takes me 2-3 days to get myself back to normal after a night of drinking, it's just not worth it. 

Yesterday was my 30th birthday party and I had a grand old party organized. I drank and it was great until it was not. I passed out on the couch after having a little too much to drink, rolled over in my sleep and hit my head on the coffee table splitting it open. It ruined the night for my guests too as they had to rush me to the hospital.  Now I'm sitting here with stitches on my head questioning everything and feeling miserable.

New here, 2 weeks into sobriety and never felt better about myself. I have previously stopped drinking for 2 months but I feel a lot more empowered by these 2 weeks than I did when I had stopped for 2 months, the simple reason being is because the 2 months I stopped I had done it for someone else and not for myself. This time around I chose to take responsibility for my actions and committed myself to it and I personally feel more invested.

&#x200B;

That being said, I just wanted to say everyday I go through the posts made on here and it is astonishing how supportive everyone is. You all really do make it easier knowing that we are not alone.  To each and everyone of you, be it the lurkers or the daily posters, you all rock.

Still cringing about it,"Yesterday at my job I saw a dude that I haven't seen since high school. We used to be casual buddies so I was pretty happy to see him, and said ""Hey Jim!""

Jim turned around and said ""Oh hey!"" I said ""Haven't seen you in such a long time, how's it--""

Jim interrupts to say ""I'm playing a show at the brewery Friday. Come down""

Now, I'm not the most socially adept person and tend to stumble over my words sometimes. I got a little confused with this exchange in the moment. A couple things flashed through my head but predominantly in the moment I felt kind of affronted that instead of any kind of like ""nice to see you dude"" exchange, he just immediately wants me to come see his performance. It didn't occur to me until after that he probably didn't recognize or remember me and instead of telling me that acted like he did. 

There are multiple practical reasons I wouldn't want to go out on Friday night. But anyway I stuttered out ""Uh, probably not bro.""

Jim- ""Probably not? Why?""

Me- ""Uh, well, I just quit drinking, and uh, probably best for me to not go to a brewery right now.""

I don't know why I said this. Is it the truth? Absolutely. I'm on day 26 and knowing myself I would for sure go get drunk and continue drinking days afterward. But I didn't need to tell Jim this. 

So Jim says- ""Oh okay? Yeah man if you can't handle it or whatever.""

Me- ""uh, uh, nah man it's cool, I mean, uh""

Jim- ""Hey dude good luck on the not drinking. It can be tough. Later!""

And then he continued shopping.

So anyway I really hope he actually didn't recognize and remember me because I feel pretty embarrassed. The whole situation was so weird. I'll get over it in a day or two but I need to learn to lie better so I'm not blurting out about my alcohol recovery to randos. 

The last two days actually had so much kind of built-up stress and anxiety that last night when I got home I cried pretty hard for a while. I hate crying. But I didn't drink, which I would have done a month ago. And after I cried I felt better. And I feel ok this morning.

Didn’t fall hard, caught myself several times before I metaphorically smashed my face on the black ice, but after over a year sober, it’s a hard thing to admit. And sucks I lost my streak. Rolled in the new year sober but then idk.. just quit trying at life.

 Good morning. 
 Our keynote is: 
“ Help God’s kids do what they need to have done,...”.
 The Thought for the Day urges us to think less about the pleasure of our contemplated actions and more about their consequences.
 My perception disorder makes the warning especially ominous.
At an AA conference I️ heard a song entitled, “Trouble Always Starts Out Looking Like Fun.”.
 My insane ideas never introduce themselves as crazy notions which might destroy my life. They present as fun and/or common sense. Because of the disorder of my perception, I️ am apt to believe them!
 My first sponsor held that we always get the divinely perfect consequences of our actions. Sometimes my actions open the door to The Magic and other times they plunge me into chaos. Therefore, it is critical that I persistently seek and follow the guidance of the Divine Spark.
 The Spark always directs action which leads to The Magic and never to chaos! Unlike my mind, it never lies to me.
 I love you all.",2,0

I went back on Zoloft. I had success with it 4 years ago, until my drinking got out of hand. I'm hoping that it can help me go back to feeling like myself. My depression and anxiety aren't debilitating, but just present enough for me to feel on edge at times and have a general emptiness. Still no cravings for alcohol, at least.

I've also started the process of getting a therapist again. My doctor, who prescribes my medications, has a therapist who works in the same office and is actually able to talk to me for free due to some kind of new grant funding that the health company got. So that's pretty promising.

I will regularly go a week or two, sometimes three, between drinks.  When I do drink, I drink so much that I’m scared I’ll have a heart attack or something.  I’m usually so hungover the following day that I can’t function whatsoever.  I’ve read Annie Grace’s books and tried to do her 30 day challenge but failed two weeks in.  I feel like so many of these help programs assume that people are daily drinkers and a lot of what they are saying is directed towards those people and their pattern of daily drinking.  Two weeks in and it feels like they are talking to you like you’re over the hump, but two weeks sober for me suddenly feels like the first day and I’m climbing the walls.

He's casually spoken about his more than I of mine, and I think that's because he had much less of a choice in his addiction than I did. He took a bad spill in his youth and suffered a bad back injury. From what I gather, he goes to a doctor for regular check-ups, rehab and ""pain management."" 

Years ago he became addicted to his prescribed pain meds. Opioids. It got to the point where his wife divorced him and he had to move out. At the time their daughter was just a little thing. I'd say he was out of the house for 6 months. He'd come over a few times during the week and on weekends to spend time with his kid.

Somehow he kicked his addiction to the pills. Again, we've never had that discussion. One day I'd like to muster the cajones to have that conversation with him because I'm genuinely curious, and they're our neighbors and friends. He and the mom of his children rekindled things. They remarried and have since had another child. They lead a happy family life together.

I work in the technology field. He runs a shop that serves the construction and plumbing industry. I wear flip flops and t-shirts and sit on Zoom calls most days. He wears steel toe boots and jeans and shakes hands with guys with busted knuckles.

This morning, for the \~35th day I've stood at my dining room window that looks out at my neighbor's driveway and I've watched him back his truck out of his driveway in the dark at 6:30 a.m. so he can be at the shop to take care of customers by 7 a.m. I still have two and a half hours before my work day even starts. And I get to work from home.

My standing at my dining room window is intentional and self-serving. Probably bordering on creepy. But it's with great amounts of respect and admiration. He's getting out and heading to work while everyone else on the street is probably still sleeping or just waking up. I've been enjoying waking up early (not *coming to* with a hangover), checking in here while having my coffee, and watching my neighbor back his truck out of his driveway.

I don't know what the point of this story is. I respect and admire the guy for doing whatever it is that he had to do to get off the pain meds, get his family back together, and back his truck out of the driveway at 6:30 a.m. to go to work every day.

Maybe my point is for us all to look around and find those people and the little things that provide inspiration for us to be accountable and to show up every day.

My boyfriend lost his job and even though we're living apart I am supporting both of us with no family help on my part at least he does get a little from his family and I had to stop smoking. Life is so overwhelming and I don't have the energy, motivation or willpower to quit again just now. I started drinking again 17 days ago and I've drank 16 days since then, with no real attempt at moderation. I truly understand that moderation is a myth for addicts which is something I never really believed while sober. I see myself quitting again just not until everything becomes less chaotic. I'm applying for new jobs and so is my boyfriend. I'm too embarrassed to even talk about it and only my bf and my best friends know and they don't know how to even talk to me about it. I feel like everyone feels like they're walking on eggshells around me. I feel guilty and ashamed. I'm only 21. I just want to be able to make everything go quiet in the evenings.

Started “partying” with my best friend at our home pretty consistently at age 25-26. Nothing too crazy, just genuinely having a good time and having about 4-6 a night. In amazing shape from my job and exercising regularly. Could show up to work hungover and slam a Bang Energy, then proceed to unload 5-7 27’ trailers full of packages. (What can brown do for you?) I clearly see now that during this year or so, I was laying the groundwork for addiction. It was FUN. We had a blast drinking together. We had relationships. We were attractive. Life was good. We were pretty poor, but who cares? Started dabbling into adderall and the occasional xanax when I was coming down from adderall. 

We move to a new place at age 27. Same city. Quickly realize our upstairs neighbors are pieces of shit who are always having couples fights. Constant slamming and banging. I start trying new beers. Get very into beer culture. Cupboards are adorned with empties from all over the world. Still attractive. Still dating around. Best friend is starting to become more of a recluse. My adderall usage spikes. Would work, then down several pills on the drive home. Proceed to stay up all day (worked nights) and get an hour of “sleep” before going back to work. Beyond exhausted at work, as well as extremely irritated. Would drink about 5 beers that following night to finally sleep. This repeats for about a year and a half. Still somehow in shape. 

28 now. Get promoted at my job to a much less physical position. Still struggling with adderall abuse. Drinking doesn’t particularly ramp up, but start slowly gaining weight from office job. Face gets noticeably puffier. Somehow stop adderall use. Promoted again. Drinking ramps up for a bit. I try xanax again. Immediately quit drinking because xanax>booze. Go on vacation and have a mid life crisis because I fucking hate my job. Put in two weeks. Age 29 now. Almost have an anxiety attack at work because I’m unknowingly withdrawing from xanax. Feel better after taking some in the bathroom. Final Friday passes after 8 years at that job. Addicted to xanax for 2 months after I quit. Decide to quit cold turkey. 

Worst withdrawals of my life. Go to the ER after 5 days because my heart feels like it’s going to explode. Terrifying depersonalization episodes. Weird head tremors. Doctor gives me a milder benzo. I take less than I’m supposed to, because FUCK this stuff. I drive 3 hours to my parent’s house and detox there for 2 weeks. Plenty of crying as I’m basically bedridden. 

Eventually recover. Move to parent’s city after a month by myself. First time on my own. 2 months completely sober, minus an adderall slip up. 

I’m in the store one day, and I grab a 4 pack of a Belgian ale. The buzz doesn’t even feel that good. Yet, I’m back at the store every night. For months on end. I’m finally off the wagon. For real, this time. 

Discover white claw. Much prefer it now because all of that speciality shit was giving me IBS. Drink 7-12 a night for a year straight. Gain 40 pounds. Went from a solid 7-8 on the “attractiveness scale” to a 5. Haven’t made any friends. Don’t care to. Start struggling with even walking around the block. And here we are. 


Fuck this. I made it 5 days sober last week. Proceeded to drink 6 days straight. Now, I’m shooting for a week of sobriety. I want to feel good again. I’ve conquered all of my vices except one. Being drunk. I WILL win. For myself and my family. For my future.",9,0

I've been a heavy drinker for over a decade. I've let my drinking habits run and ruin my life. I failed out of college twice, lost the love and support of a good woman I wanted to be my wife, and been ostracized by former friends because they couldn't watch me slowly kill myself with the bottle.

Last year I had cleaned up my life a bit. I had cut back on my drinking and had been sober for months. Those were so.e of the best months of my adult life.

 My grandmother died on Thanksgiving day and I picked up the bottle again. Fam had a funeral and life went on. I kept drinkng.

 I started running a fever Christmas afternoon. Tested positive for Covid. Doctor and work both told me 10 days quarantine. Guess how I spent my time in isolation. Yeah, drowning myself.

After getting out of quarantine my job performance crashed. My energy just wasn't there anymore, drank myself to sleep, overslept and showed up to work late and hung over; sometimes I didn't show up at all.

Last week there was an ice storm where I live and power, internet, and cell network all crashed. Guess what I did. Instead of even trying to make it to work (which I totally could have), I went on a 3 day bender. I even missed my niece's 5th birthday on Saturday. I didn't drink yesterday. My body feels like it's been through hell.

I've quit before and know I can do it again. I know what my body and brain are about to go through; I can make it. I fully expect to be fired when I show up for my shift today. It's gonna hurt, because I like my job, but I'm gonna make it.

I've been subbed here for a while and everyone's stories, good and bad, have helped me get my head wrapped around my drinking problem. Y'all helped me realize that I don't have to do this alone.

Wish me luck, folks. Today is gonna be a rough one.

I live states away from my family- the only person I know where I live  is my best friend, and he gets annoyed with me when I bring up the fact that I have a problem. I know that these issues are for a therapist but sometimes it would be nice to just talk to someone who cares about me- I just feel so alone in this, but I also don’t want to be toxic or draining to him. So I’m dealing with this alone with no one to open up to. I made it 7 days then drank and then made it 4 days. And then ever since I have been drinking daily again for about a week. I just feel like I’m killing myself, and I’m failing myself and that I’m too weak to save myself.

I know i have to help myself. I’m just hurt that if I try and open up about how I feel I’m killing myself to the one person around me, I end up feeling even more depressed bc I feel bad and we fight about it.  It’s not his problem. I don’t want to be a horrible friend. But I’d it ok to expect a little support? If the tables were turned, I’d be so worried about my friend. 

Is this something I should just continue to cope with alone? I feel so alone and just like my life doesn’t matter to any one including myself: this life with him is when my drinking problem started in the first place. I am not saying he caused my drinking problem but I didn’t start drinking a lot until we lived together. 

I had access to free booze all the time because of him. He drank a lot at first  but then stopped and cooled down on that- I started drinking more around him, but I ended up being the one with the problem. Because of him, I ended up extremely isolated and away from every one I’ve ever known. He’s not a bad person, but I feel trapped in this life of just drinking and working and never solving problems because “that’s life.”

3405,2022-02-07 01:04:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/smixcw/dungeon_master/,Dungeon Master,"I DM’d a game of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons tonight. It was a new group, but if the six other players, I had played with two of them before. 

Two of the new folks were drinking the little bottles pretty quickly, and it started to show. We only played for two hours, but the two drinkers were wobbly even while seated. 

Now, I have DM’d while smashed off my ass, and I turn into Monty Haul. I mean, I opened the Dungeon Master’s Guide and just started giving the party dozens and dozens of magical items… including artifacts. When I sat with that group the next session, and I learned what I had given them, I had to figure out how to take most of it back, or deal with one or two players I couldn’t kill, and thus couldn’t intimidate or scare. Part of the fun of the game is knowing you could lose. If you can’t lose, there goes most or all of the challenge. 

In fact, I did start off the session telling the people I had never played with that I don’t _want_ to kill the entire party, but _their_ character might die. But as long as the other party members can cart their dead corpse back the town, a Resurrection spell _can_ be bought… for a price. 

But tonight, I didn’t drink. I knew I would have to drive home, so I wouldn’t have, but in fact I had made sure I didn’t have anything available to drink other than bottled water. 

Instead, I focused on keeping the game moving along and giving the other players a good time, because as DM, that’s how _I_ have a good time. 

Drinking wouldn’t have made the game more fun, it would have accentuated my tiredness (we started at 9pm), and I might have passed out before any of them. Even if I didn’t pass out, the alcohol would made my task of getting home problematic. I can afford a taxi, but hate not having my car at hand whenever I want it. I would have had to take another taxi back to pick up my can tomorrow. How is _that_ fun? (Drinking and driving was off the table. My partners would never have let me get out the door with my keys if I had drunk even one Adult Beverage. They’re good people. 

So, fun times art around. Nobody died, in game or in real life, and I didn’t make an ass of myself such that they’d never want me back in their house. I’d call that a win. 

BTW, I didn’t drink anything when I got home, either.

I do, however, think it would probably be best to remove alcohol from my life entirely. Mainly for health reasons (I’m on some medications that it’s not great to drink with — though not totally prohibited), but also because I don’t want to eventually fall into old bad habits.

For context, I did give up drinking for two years. For most of it I was utterly miserable and it was hard not having occasional breaks from misery.

I am on mental health medication. My psychiatrist says I have bipolar 2, though I’m still not sure the diagnosis is correct. The medication has helped some.

Anyway, for anyone in a somewhat similar situation, how do you learn to just accept living with pain and not getting to take breaks from it? I think if  I’m truly going to be sober I need to accept my feelings and learn to live with them. Any pointers?

Also, I do want to note I don’t think this is the situation for everyone and I think a lot of people find real happiness in sobriety. So if you happen to read this please don’t let my situation leave you disheartened.

Thanks in advance for any thoughts.",5,0

I feel like I’ve been yearning for this clarity and joy and self-love for so many years now and it’s finally happening without alcohol. I don’t feel like that’s unrealistic euphoria or rose colored glasses… I think I was just finally ready to live my best life and be my best self. 

I have been in therapy a few times, and I’ve added a lot of tools to my toolbox for mental health management and I am FINALLY able to use them appropriately. Ugh. So many good feelings. Just so many… feelings. Period!

I've been following this thread for years but was recently doxxed hence the new account. I've been sober for almost 2 months after 15 years of every day fairly heavy drinking. I'm mostly doing well, sleeping, getting back into old hobbies, trying to be a better parent. 
I am really struggling, however, with uncontrollable angry outbursts at what used to be minor annoyances. My wife asked me to clean a cup I thought I cleaned tonight and I exploded (verbally not physically). She says she doesnt even like to be around me anymore because my outbursts are so unpredictable and scary even though they last for only a minute. Ive talked to my therapist and she says it will just take time but I feel like I have no control and hate it.  My wife knows about my alcohol but cannot understand how it could cause this.
Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice would be appreciated....does it get better? I can't fall asleep because I feel so ashamed of my behavior today in front of the kids. 
Thanks for reading if anyone still is.",27,0

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This post goes up at:

* US - Night/Early Morning
* Europe - Morning
* Asia and Australia - Evening/Night

A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar.

Good morning from the east coast of the US. Good afternoon and good evening to all you lovely folks all over the globe. Monday-- we’re here! We’re here, so let’s sit in it. Let’s even go ahead and lean into it. Thank you for your responses yesterday and for checking in. While I couldn’t quite respond to everyone, please know I read through every comment. 

Many of you shared how it felt or feels to return back to yourselves, how it feels to be transforming into something familiar, yet new, and how it might be scary, or slow-going, or a mystery, but it’s definitely worth it. One of the things that helped me get back to me?  **Asking for help!**  I shared with two people very close to me that I was not drinking anymore and the “why” of that, and asked that they support me. I read books and listened to podcasts and reached out here and also just absorbed all of your words, your wisdom, your compassion and humor. You helped. 

**“When you judge yourself for needing help, you judge those you are helping. When you attach value to giving help, you attach value to needing help. The danger of tying your self-worth to being a helper is feeling shame when you have to ask for help. Offering help is courageous and compassionate, but so is asking for help.”  Brene Brown**

We might hold off on asking for help-- whatever that looks like to you-- because we immediately think, oh no, now what I have to say I’m an alcoholic? I have to share my deepest, darkest moments with people familiar and strange?  I have to admit that I can’t do this alone (the horror)? 

I’d like to note two things: 1. by showing up here, every day, you are asking for support in small and big ways and; 2. by showing up here every day you are giving support in small and big ways. Asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Asking for help means you’re ready to face something head on. Asking for help often results in building community, solidarity, and fortifies relationships with those in your life-- both IRL and in forums like this sub. 

**What pushed you to ask for help? How has asking supported your journey? How has asking for help turned you into a better helper? IWNDWYT and thank you, deeply, for helping me on my own path and for helping one another.**",471,0

I had around a month and decided to drink Friday night. Saturday was fine, no major hangover, so I decided to do it again of course. Today my stomach was the worst it’s ever been, on the toilet since the minute I woke up. At around 10pm I had what was most likely a panic attack, since I’m very prone to those after drinking. Being an anxious person, I’ve half convinced myself it was a TIA or a mini seizure from withdrawal. The logical part of me knows it was a panic attack and my parents were there and insist that’s what it was too. 

Anyways, it’s not Reddit’s problem what it was or wasn’t. The point is I scare the living hell out of myself every time yet still go back to it. All my blood tests are good except I know my blood sugar is trending up and I know my blood pressure freaks out when I drink. If I was sober I could at least be reassured by the fact that I’m healthy and it couldn’t be anything but a panic attack. Actually I don’t even get those when I’m sober. 

I’m going on 24 years old soon and I’m just way too young to be scaring myself like this. So why do I do it? I lost the love of my life 6 months ago and can’t seem to let go of that temporary escape. I don’t know if I ever will. Tonight I’ve scared myself enough to go to bed sober. I hope I’ll remember the feeling but it always seems to fade.",4,0

I started drinking about 6 years ago, since then it has ruined friendships and destroyed my body, mind and my life. Alcohol took my grandpa a year before I moved to my moms hometown as a kid so I never met him, he was one of the kindest and most loved people by the entire family and even everyone in his neighborhood. It sucks I never got to meet that wonderful human being. It took an uncle of mine who I heard was also amazing, super chill guy who I was apparently very close to as a toddler, any family gatherings I would run straight to him, hed carry me around like I was his own kid.

Its because of alcohol that I grew up terrified of my own dad, not knowing if hed come home a happy drunk or throwing shit everywhere and screaming. Im an adult now and have fixed my relationship with him but he still drinks and it hurts thinking I might lose him to alcohol like my grandpa and my uncle. Hes had multiple injuries over the years because he was drunk or hanging out with the wrong people because they were his drinking buddies. His last incident almost got him killed.

I have a cousin who lived on the streets and almost died because of alcohol. He moved in with me and some family, made an amazing recovery and just a few weeks ago, right when he was about to have surgery to fix the problems his drinking had caused, he relapsed. I had just moved in with family where he was also staying and tried to help him. we talked, we laughed, we argued and cried. My aunt and uncle are too old to be dealing with that shit and my uncle is diabetic, the stress of dealing with an alcoholic is literally killing him so he moved in with a friend of his who is willing to help him out.

I had to clean the room, the mattress is going in the trash, he spilled all kinds of stuff on it. Vodka, juices, soda, water, his own piss and vomit. The floor was sticky, some surfaces too and the whole room smelled like ass.
Im afraid of losing him and on top of all of that, Im a drunk too. I hate this stuff. Im tired. My body is tired, my mind is tired, Im just so fucking tired of being tired and anxious all the god damn time.

I went way too hard last night, didnt go to work and earlier today I called my boss and came clean. I explained, apologized and told him if he needs to fire me for someone more dependable I understand and wont be mad. He said its not a problem and to just go in tomorrow like nothing happened, he said he wants to help me. I cried like a baby when I hung up. Im currently just taking care of myself and dealing with the gnarly hangover, staying hydrated and eating. I really want to quit doing this to myself.",4,0

Started the day by finding a can of Dale's Pale Ale behind the shoe rack. My husband, who is also on Day 12 with me, must've hid it there in order to stop me from drinking it (so he could have it) weeks or months ago. It was dusty. I immediately poured it down the sink. As it fell, I commented how this liquid -- which we have had so many fights about since getting together in 2016 -- was really just a bad smelling poison that resembles piss, after all. It just seemed so stupid after 12 days of a clear head.

I've noticed that chores are easier for me to get done now that I'm not boozin every day. It's amazing how much alcohol affects the body and mind over the time. It made me lazy, depressed, and irritable. Now I find myself easily completing tasks that I would've agonized over for days in the past. I made my bed, cleaned my fish tank, did the dishes, scrubbed the kitchen walls -- no problem. 

Me and my husband were at odds with each other all morning, but went to the gym together in the afternoon after all. I feel more fit and prettier now than I did while drinking. I've been snacking and eating whatever I want (within limits) and am still losing weight. I'm hoping to gain a lot of muscle this year, and end the year with Lara Croft/Tifa Lockhart-like physical capabilities. My motivation is just through the roof sober. 

I've also been playing Fallout 4 for the past couple days and finding myself able to concentrate and complete missions and just really learn the game quickly in a way I don't think I can when I'm full of intoxicants. Idk. My brain is working better. 

I've been sober from everything: from weed and pills as well as alcohol. It's been wild. That's all I got. 

I feel like it's getting easier the more days I get through, but I'm going to stay on-guard. Cuz I can see myself getting a little too comfortable one night and getting wasted, and starting this whole damn cycle again.

Newly sober after way too long. In being clear headed and with this restless energy I have been thinking a lot about triggers or enabling influences. Not so much the things that made me drink, but the things that made it OK or normal.

This morning, it occurred to me that my family are basically drinking budies. I am from a very heavy drinking family. I now live abroad and we do phone calls. They wouldn't call unless they were drinking and neither would I.

If they did call and I was sober I'd rush out to get loaded. We simply have never had a meaningful conversation while not drunk or drinking and thinking on it now probably not then either.

In sobriety I can't think of anything worse than talking to drunk people as I am sure they can't think of anything more uncomfortable than talking while completely straight. So we've not been talking.

Don't get me wrong. I love them all and don't blame them for my boozing. I just can't talk drunken shit anymore.

Anyone else have this or a similar experience? Did you ever get sober contact?

Thank you all for giving me a place to go.

But I also need to keep my feet on the ground and avoid exaggerating. Because, if not, many great things that happened while I drank will end up as poisoned memories.

For example, I lived in Paris for 4 years and it was there that my alcohol consumption became alcohol abuse. Sometimes I look back into that time and feel bad because I wasted those years drinking, but that's not entirely true. I also had great experiences, met lots of interesting people, and I loved my girlfriend.

You tell yourself you're not an alcoholic because you don't drink every day. Heck, you usually only drink once per week. And there *are* times when you muster up the willpower to stop after just two or three drinks.



But those times are few and far between. Most times, you drink until you pass out. 


It starts innocently enough. A drink with dinner. Waiter comes around and asks if you'd like another. Sure, why not? 



You pay your dinner bill and head to the bar down the street. I mean it's only 8pm, what are you just supposed to just *go home*? Ugh, how boring. You're not boring. You're fun. You'll just nurse a drink at the bar for a couple hours while you listen to music and people watch.



Wait, how is your glass empty already? You hardly even feel it. One more can't possibly hurt. Slowly but surely, you feel less and less guilty about ordering the next one. And the next one. You're having fun, right? You work so hard. You're allowed to have fun. You have the right to *feel good* once in a while. You wave down the bartender to order the next one. And the next one.



Hours go by. You stumble home drunk. You know you should stop but you also know you're not going to. You don't normally keep alcohol in the house - that's one of your rules. But you remember that you bought vodka to have during a recent weekend visit from a long distance friend. You'll just add a little bit of vodka to a glass of seltzer. Just a little bit. It'll be mostly seltzer. You're just being responsible and trying to rehydrate at this point.



Whoops, poured that one a bit too heavy. And the next one. And the next one. 



Until HOLY FUCK how did you get here? It's 10am and you wake up on the couch still fully clothed. Head pounding. Stomach in knots. Anxiety through the roof. Heart beating out of your chest as you drag yourself to the kitchen for a glass of water and some Advil. 



You spend the rest of the day desperately trying to sleep it off. The room spins, your hands shake, your stomach turns. Everything sucks. Everything hurts. You hate yourself for allowing this to happen again.



But life doesn't have to be this way. You *can* say no to that first drink. You *can* say no to starting the chain of events that will inevitably leave you feeling empty, worthless, and miserable. You *can* choose a better life. One that is full of energy and hope for the future.



And you can start today. IWNDWYT.",71,0

With bitter temperatures and no electricity, my partner and I camped out at my parents’s house, who have a generator. 

So many irritating factors at that house, those which threaten my sobriety. Like many others here, it’s extremely triggering being in one’s childhood home. 

There’s my father. Smart. Educated. Brilliant. Alcoholic. Doesn’t want me to know he’s hammered while I sit on the couch in their den and read. Sneaks over to the liquor cabinet and asks me something loudly and impossible to decipher, a poor attempt to hide the sound of the bourbon being poured. 

There’s my mother. Completely aware that my dad has a problem, but refuses to acknowledge. Continues to offer me Prosecco, despite knowing that I don’t drink. She clearly hears what she wants to hear. 

Then there’s my brother. He won’t join us because him and his wife are judgmental assholes, who only care about their own opinions/experiences. They’ll Inundate us with texts and cast shade/judgment on us all. 

My father’s alcoholism, my mother’s stoicism, my brother’s narcissism. Where does that leave me?

It did not leave me in a bottle of Prosecco. It did not see me sneaking into that liquor cabinet. It find me hungover in the morning. 

Yes, I was stressed. Yes, I was exhausted. Yes, I wanted nothing more than to escape. 

I chose to escape by: taking long walks and enjoying the beauty of the ice covered world, reading a captivating non-fiction, eating over indulgent food I wouldn’t normally eat, reading here; supporting others. 

I survived. Power is back and I’m home.

I was his fucking daughter. For a little while at least.  


Despite saying I was not going to attend the gathering, I did. Had my first panic attack within a half hour, but stayed, made myself eat. Every single person there was drinking.

However this has happened before due to stress, except it was like 1-2 spots and now I have around 15.. I do believe Covid could somehow have made my skin more dry/focus on the virus instead of other body parts or organs/idfk, but I certainly wouldn’t attribute it all to covid.

Addiction runs in my family. I never thought it was an issue for me until about 5 years ago. I have always had major depression (and recently diagnosed with ADHD), but I managed it well until my relationship with my partner (and parent of my child) went south. I started drinking to cope with the stress, although I didn’t really realise it at the time. It doesn’t help that the country I live in has an incredibly toxic drinking culture. 

I’m high-functioning in general so I’ve been managing life stuff well enough, but I hate myself regardless. I hate the fact that I KNOW my meds won’t work properly because I keep drinking, but I do it anyway. I hate knowing that if I keep on this way, I will inevitably become a worse parent to my child. I hate the fact that I managed to get a nice new job, but I kept on drinking anyway. I’m scared to death that I’ll end up becoming a horrible, mean drunk like my grandfather. 

I’ve been wanting to stop for a while. Last night I had a few and went to bed without washing my face. Seems like a trivial thing, but it made me realise that I’ve stopped caring for myself. So this morning I looked up SMART Recovery meetings and joined this sub. 24 hours down.

In these early days of sobriety, the thought of alcohol is constant and overwhelming. My wife and I went out to the country yesterday for an overnight trip with our baby and dog. The whole day yesterday, I was thinking of how I could get some alcohol in my system. 

Went to the art museum in the small town, maybe I could buy some wine while my wife is feeding our daughter in the museum cafe. Maybe I could sneak to the bar while my wife is in the antique store. Finally, when my wife asked me to run to Walmart to get diapers then pick up takeout for dinner, I would be all alone. I could grab a beer at Walmart and drink it in the parking lot or I could wait for our food at the restaurant bar and have a drink.

Fortunately, I didn’t do any of these things. It’s a small to thing to resist alcohol on a one night trip, but it was major achievement for me.

Today is my two year sober birthday. I know many of you out there are struggling and I want you all to know that sobriety is possible. Just keep your head up as best you can try your hardest. Don't be too down on yourself if you slip up, just climb back on the horse and continue trying - You'll get there eventually, as long as you want it. 

If you can get it, sobriety is the most rewarding thing. Each day I wake up and am grateful that I'm not hungover, that I didn't do or say something regretful. 

In two years, so much has improved in my life. However bad you think things are now, understand that just about everything can be repaired, even things you currently believe are irreparable. Take it a day at a time, challenge yourself to get to 90 days and trust in the process. Most importantly, and perhaps the hardest part, enjoy the process. Learn to look at things half glass full. Challenge your mind to go to places, dark places, try to find the roots of what is ailing you that is leading you to medicate yourself. If you can work on yourself to those depths, you'll get it.

However, I decided that I'd do dry January. I did, easily, and felt so much better for it.  I didn't start again in February.

Today I had guests for lunch - actually one, as the other had gone on a snap holiday - but, thinking there'd be 3 of us, I bought 2 bottles of wine. I used some to cook with and drank what was left (just over half a bottle as my guest was driving). 

Now, my reason for being pleased with myself is that, on any other occasion, I would have opened the second bottle; in fact, I really wanted to, but I reasoned with my self; if I opened a new bottle, the chances were that I'd drink it all and, if by some miracle I didn't, it would be a waste.

So I didn't. I had a mug of coffee and a pudding.

I'm trying to build a narrative of the role alcohol has played in my life so I can understand it better and respond appropriately. 

Can anyone else relate to what I'm about to say please? 

I spent my teens in a weird emotionally shut down self destructive, nihilistic state using alcohol to 1) feel sensations & 2) disengage further from others. 

I stopped around age 35, for 2 years, then resumed in a very controlled limited way. 

At age 48, my life is having a reboot! I can stop drinking, but want to know it's for the right reason. 

Can anyone relate to this statement : 

Many people develop the ability to connect with others by using alcohol socially. Yet some people (me?) use alcohol to disengage, and only learn the ability to connect with others once sober. For these people, even having a small amount may not be a good option.

I was a huge partier and heavy drinker in my early 20s, priding myself on being a tank and not coming across as drunk even though I 100% was. As I got older and realized heavy partying was being looked down upon, I transitioned to drinking high end alcohol. I was known in my friend group as the wine expert and then best way to learn wine was to drink it. Drink all the varietals, different regions of varietals, all the wine! But, In the back of my mine, I always knew I had an alcohol consumption problem. People tried talking me out of it because I wasn’t what an alcoholic looked like. I always got myself home and they never had to take care of me because I drank too much. But they didn’t know how actively I was talking myself down from drinking a whole bottle of wine like it was juice. They didn’t know the number of times I regretted saying something or doing something because I was drunk. 

Last year, after drinking many nights alone due to the pandemic, I realized I needed to make a change. After a couple months of cutting back, I decided stop drinking once and for all. I took it a day at a time, and thanks to this sub for giving a community of people to remember why I wanted to stop in the first place. I should only focus on not drinking *today*. I never set out to do a full year but a week turned into a month, then 3months, then 6 and by the time I got to 9, I realized that a year was in sight. I’m here. I made it! And I feel better than ever.

Last night, I attended a birthday party for a friend. Shots were being passed around for hours and I saw them all go from sober, tipsy to drunk. I realized I didn’t envy them. I wasn’t stressing about how much I was drinking, I wasn’t worried about how I was being perceived, worrying if my eyes were giving away how much I had, or if I was acting too drunk. I knew that my club soda&bitters would not equal the bar tab they were racking up, I would get a good nights sleep, I would wake up in the morning hangover free. I felt free and, more importantly, I felt like myself. 

When I told people I stopped drinking, their first response was “but not forever, right?”. And honestly, I don’t know. It would be kind of cool if I did. I’m enjoying not drinking today, I do not plan on drinking tomorrow. We’ll just see how many sober todays I decide to do.

My wife had a lot of old college friends in town, and we went out to dinner on Friday night. The drinks flowed liberally and freely. Last night, my family had this huge party for us. 

It was the perfect recipe for drinking. Free food, free drinks. Everyone was in a good mood and ready to party. My wife even said, “You’ve gone nearly two months. You’ll be okay. Just stop again tomorrow.”

At around six p.m. I was feeling that kind of anticipation any drinker feels before a good party. My mouth watered as I thought how delicious my first cold beer in months would taste. I told myself that it’s been a good run, I did my best, and I’ll hop back on the train tomorrow. But first, just give it another thirty minutes and see how things go. Then another. And another.

Then came the end of the night, and had the only thing I drank was some coffee and seltzer water.

I ended up having a great time anyway and talking to people who I haven’t seen in ages. I woke up this morning with a clear head and having faced down the strongest temptation I’ve faced so far.

Some nights absolutely blasted, some nights just a few before bed, some nights not at all. I don't typically have any issues with stopping myself, until I reach that tipping point of about 4-5 drinks. I've had thoughts of quitting before, but never stuck with it because it didn't cause *that* many problems in my life. But after a recent vacation in which I had unfettered access to literally any kind of alcohol I desired, I have found myself entirely burnt out on it. I think I'm done with drinking. Not craving alcohol at all. Even sat at a bar with my family yesterday and didn't feel the slightest temptation to drink. A coca cola hit the spot instead. It's weird... I woke up 3 mornings ago and just kind of decided that I'm going to do my best to remove it from my life as it currently exists. I know I will probably have alcohol again, as I am only 26... But for the time being IWNDWYT.

That being said, I do think I am experiencing mild withdrawal symptoms. My mouth is producing a lot more saliva than I am used to, I'm pretty fatigued and a lot more introverted than usual... Did anybody else share these symptoms? Is it withdrawal that I'm experiencing, or just a recalibration of sorts?

I spent most of the week alone at home and minding my own business. Last night and this morning my gut told me I needed to head out and socialise, lest I relapse by jumping at the first invitation to head out drinking. 

As luck would have it, on this sunny Sunday afternoon, a friend invited me for a coffee and managed to convince me to join him for lunch too. I almost bailed after the coffee to scurry home and hide away, sober, anxious, lonely. But I didn’t! I pushed through my anxiety and had the loveliest afternoon. Hangover free, in the company of a great friend, and enjoying lunch in a cosy restaurant. 

So my takeaway from today is that I’m not going to succumb to my social anxiety — that’s precisely what pushed me into relapses. Daytime socialising with people who don’t want to drink is great. I felt like a brighter and lighter version of myself. No social anxiety at all while there! I encourage anyone with similar anxieties to just give it a go and see if you enjoy it.

Long story short, I did NOT drink (not even a craving) and in fact, felt the truest, most overwhelming joy as I sat with her this morning. I surprised myself on both accounts.

I've smoked joints on and off since I was a teenager, always with tobacco though and I found it made the cannabis really unpleasant.

I invested in a Pax 2 vape and buy fresh bud and I've been vaping since before Christmas. I found it really helped during that period. 

I struggle generally with depression, stress and anxiety, I've tried lots of different medication over the years. Tried medicating with booze, but naturally that didn't work. 

Cannabis is illegal where I am currently but thankfully knew someone who could hook me up, it's been a lifesaver for me. Thankfully I don't experience the associated paranoia. 

It's a crutch but I feel way more comfortable vaping every day (I vape around 0.5g - 1g of bud a day, it's cheaper than booze and you can make edibles from the vaped bud left over). I can go away for a few days and not have a problem without cannabis. I turn away drinks as I know my vape is waiting for me at home.

Your vision is blurry from the bender. You’re probably broke but spending the last of your money on this rum. You get home & immediately start taking shots. You feel so depressed and helpless. You black out & nap several times throughout the day & call off work the next morning. The cycle repeats. The shakes, the anxiety, the depression, continuously taking shots.

THIS is what one drink leads to. Whether it’s days from now or months from now, one drink will bring me back to that kind of behavior. And I never want to act like that or feel like that ever again. I need to remember this.

After shooting guns, the alcohol is abundant. Pretty sure a few of the guys cracked beers in the parking lot as soon as we walked out of the gun range.

I told them a gave up drinking, and it was my 44th day sober. No one gave me shit. No one tried to feed me booze. They were all cool with it and continued on with the festivities.
My takeaways from yesterday were this, normally in social situations like those, I would almost always be the guy getting the drunkest the fastest, and trying to be the life of the party…we’ll, being the sober observer yesterday, I saw that the life of the party was actually just a stumbling mess by the end of the night, and not something I could ever want to be again.
Also this was the first time I realized I really don’t need alcohol to have fun. I enjoyed myself the entire day, drove myself home sober, and didn’t wake up with a hangover or the loathing feelings of regret.

The temptations were still there though. I wanted to drink. I knew that a couple shots of crown would have made me feel real nice inside, but I didn’t.

MY path was AA, and yeah I know, but it worked for me an agnostic loner who may be somewhere on the shoulder of the spectrum and whose middle name is ""Don't tell me what to do"".

I would get home from work and sit and drink until the pain went away. But now I can’t stop. Once I put my kids to bed I will sit down and drink vodka until the pain goes away.

I can happily go weeks without drinking or craving alcohol. (and don’t even particularly love partying). However, every few weeks I find myself in a drinking situation with acquaintances or strangers in which I have 4-7 drinks in a night. I wake up with debilitating anxiety and physical hangover symptoms that last days. I have PTSD stemming from college party days, so really anything more than 2 drinks in a night will set the anxiety bells off. I worry about what I may have done/said, that people will take me less seriously, that I’m putting myself in unsafe/undesirable surroundings with men, and that I’m destroying my body and mind.

My problem is that I don’t always realize when I go out (often it starts with a casual dinner or 4pm happy hour) that I’ll be in such a situation and therefore I don’t make plans to avoid over drinking ahead of time. I’m sober curious, but after countless times of promising myself during a hangover that I’ll never drink again and then ignoring it shortly after, I’m terrified that I’ll just fail. It feels like I’ll never fix my relationship with alcohol. How do I get over this fear/anxiety?? How do I start this journey so as to limit drinking rather than entirely cut it out?",3,0

I (like a lot of us) have a ton of baggage from my drinking days that I tend to hold on to from time to time. 

I do a lot of mindfulness practice these days, and it helps me tremendously to acknowledge these thoughts and feelings for what they are and learn from them.

It just hurts when I know the way I acted, the way I behaved in my past goes entirely against who I want to be. I, in short, was not always my best self. 

I always have been a very kind person, but I used alcohol to numb the self-doubt and hypercritical thoughts that I experience. Alcohol was the cure for those thoughts at the moment but ended up causing more distress later on.

How do you all handle the guilt and shame? I try my best to use it as motivation to stay sober and control my character, but it gets hard sometimes and I beat myself up over past mistakes.",14,0

I wanted to share some observations ive made about limiting beliefs I have and have had around drinking. So to dive right in, I am an aspiring musician, guitarist and lead vocalist. Throughout my life and drinking career going to live music, playing music and drinking have been some of my favorite past times (sex, drugs and rock n roll amirite?). Numerous times I have had the literal conversation along the lines of ""I need to drink to play music or see a live show, I'm a clunky musician when sober"". Well last night at our first band practice since me getting sober I discovered that that was not in fact true. I was really just a more clunky musician when I was hungover. At nearly a month sober I noticed I was able to maintain my focus and get into flow state with my guitar playing much easier and last longer. Also my vocal range was noticeably improved and my voice lasted much longer before getting ragged out (which makes sense because I'm not burning my asophagus with gasoline nightly). Having this experience and realization filled me with a lot of joy and hope. Cheers!",46,0

They took a lyft out at 6pm to be responsible and I stayed home with our kids. At about 8 30 she sends me a screenshot and calls me asking what she wants me to do. Lyft wants $192 for a ride that cost $30 2 or 3 hours ago.

Normally I'd be 5 or 6 deep *at least* by 8pm on a Saturday, and Ive never messed around with drinking and driving despite being a boozebag, so that would've just been $192 lit on fire. Instead, I pulled the 3 kids out of bed and we loaded up for a little late night adventure.

 Good morning.
 Our keynote is: 
“Pray to seek to love,  comfort and understand,...”.
 According to the Meditation for the Day, God finds, amid the crowd, a few people who persistently seek to live in the presence of The Divine.
 It reminds me of a conversation my original sponsor had with Bill Wilson. Bill said about 95% of the people who succeed in AA do enough to stay sober and have good lives. Those folks are, indeed, good AA members, Bill said. 
But, he continued, about 5% want it all. They want all possible peace, spirituality and harmony with God and their fellows. I suspect this divide applies to all who profess spirituality, not just AA members.
 From the day I heard that story, I have longed to be part of the 5%. I am convinced that whether I am part of the 5% or the 95% at any given time depends primarily on my behavior that day.
 To have a chance of experiencing the magic of being in the 5%, I must remain conscious of God, treat my fellows well and stitch as the Divine Spark directs.
 I love you all.",7,0

They weigh you when you walk into the exam room area, so you’re fully clothed and have your shoes on. We just got  a foot of snow here in MI, so I had my boots on, heavy coat, hat, etc. I remarked to the nurse that weighing us like this wasn’t fair and she laughed and said that I was welcome to come back out naked to reweigh. I declined. However, when she told me what I weighed with all that on, I was shocked. Since May, I have lost over 25 pounds!

My blood pressure is still on the high end, most likely due to stress, but it’s way down from my last office check. 

My Doctor, who was instrumental in getting me the Naltrexone rx was beaming when he came in. He said that he saw me come in and couldn’t believe the transformation. He gave me a hug and shared that he is the Chief Medical Officer at the addiction clinic here in town. I didn’t know this. 

I pushed him as to why he never called me out on my drinking and its manifestations in my body and affect (bad skin, depression, gout pain, etc.) over the years, and he didn’t have an answer for me. I pushed and said that my alcohol abuse was all me, but when it shows its face medically, perhaps he should have held me accountable. He shook his head and said that most folks who drink and drink heavily aren’t ready to hear what the doctor has to say. Ouch. 

We had a great chat and he remarked that he wouldn’t mind having me come in and chat with some of his patients to share my story of recovery without AA and with using Naltrexone. I used to hate going to my physicals, as I usually came away feeling horrible and ended up with another med to take to help combat what alcohol was doing to my system. At this point, I may only need to be on two maintenance meds going forward, one for my BP, and one as a prophylactic for my gout. For an old guy (57) that’s a big fucking win. 

What’s the takeaway here? Be honest with your provider. Be honest with yourself. You don’t need to suffer for that poison. 

There’s help out there.

15 minutes later the cops started banging at my door and I started having a mental breakdown.

You look ok and then laughed at me like why was I there. I haven’t been to a hospital since.

Had never tried it before but having seen many posts about it here I thought what the heck, actually not bad lol think ill be ordering a metric tonne of the stuff!

The pub was nice and quiet and I really enjoyed my time without drinking. I saw a few empty pint glasses my inner bartender 'previous job' came out I cleared the table, it was the smell couldn't stand it! Sat by the fire I enjoyed my meal! Looked up at my old favourite behind the bar and thought 'I drank 100's if not 1000's bottles of it' it used to have some power over me but, look at me ""I'm the Captain now!"" Went back to my meal and had a little chuckle. 

Sunday mornings are the best! Time for family and close friends. I hope you have a lovely sober Sunday hangover free, may peace be upon you all.

Culminated with a friend drunk calling me at like 2:30 p.m. this Saturday encouraging me to drink. I could've drank... but I actually didn't want to. It blew my mind. I never thought that would happen. Which made me think about why it happened.

When I came to realize I had a drinking problem, I always thought it was a binary choice. I drink alcohol or I don't. Real simple shit. Problem was, initially I made that decision begrudgingly out of necessity. As I beat myself up throughout the failures and relapses, I wish someone would've told me that's a terrible way to think about it. It's really a long process of learning new behaviors and associations.

I've been seriously working on sobriety for probably 1.5 years now. I initially thought I'd never get through day 1 as my buzz was the only reason I even got up. Eventually those became doable. Then 2 whole long days in a row seemed just impossible. Eventually got the hang of those. Day 3s were a huge hurdle as I learned the true meaning of withdrawal. Then weeks seemed insurmountable. Now I fall down on a scale measurable by months. 

But the weird thing is, each failure I beat myself up over was my addicted brain learning. Trying to stick a square peg in a round hole at a slightly different angle. I felt possessed when I relapsed, like I was a bystander in my own body as it went on to self-destruct by walking into the liquor store ""for a gift for someone"" and then walking out with a few for me. Or whatever dumb excuse I came up with. Convinced I needed it, I turned a blind eye to drinking a little just this once that often turned into wicked benders.

But they got shorter. They got less frequent. Each time the temptation lessened its grip on me as I started to find alternatives to stress and frustration. Anyhow, I wish someone would have told me this, like a lot of things, boils down to a lot of practice and learning. I'm finally starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Stumbled around in the dark a lot to find it, but I finally feel hopeful. That I can do this *and* be happy about it. So I wanted to share that with the community that helped get me here and maybe inspire someone else that it actually does get better... it just takes time.",6,0

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hello, sweet SD community. It’s Sunday-- a purported day of rest for many people, but certainly not all of us. If you are able to take time to take care today, I hope you do. If you are working today, I wish you the easiest possible time on the job, with time for yourself when it’s through.

There was a time when I often had the “Sunday night blues.” That time between 4 pm and whenever I crashed for the night always included some work dread for the week ahead, and I'd often time spent wishing I’d drank less over the weekend so I’d feel fresher, and having ""accomplished more."" But! No more. Why? I think a lot my blues were tied up not feeling comfortable with how I’d spent my time off. Feeling sadness, or guilt or shame for having drank too much, or eaten too much, or simply not really LIVED my weekend. Perhaps you can relate.

But I’m not that person any more. In the course of stopping drinking, which for me has been about 4-5 years in the making, with little more than a year without so much as a sip of anything, **I’ve returned to myself.** During my years of over-consumption, I numbed out. I disappeared. I made myself small, tried to people-please to make up for my inner shame, worked myself way too hard at my job, and simply let my true, core self fade into the background. The thing about stopping drinking is that we find our way back to ourselves. We may be a little battered, a little weary, a little cautious. But we’re scrappier. Smarter. Stronger. We may find we’re funny again, or relaxed again, or mired in feelings (oh the feelings!), or maybe there’s something new about us that we really love. Maybe we have reclaimed our feelings of easy joy-- the kind we had when we were kids. As we all return to ourselves, let’s be gentle with that person who was tamped down for so long. Let’s be easy and let her feel, and be unsure, but stay the course and love her, her flaws, her past, her present and her future.

**“Step into the fire of **self-discovery**. This fire will not burn you.” Mooji**

So now? Sundays are for pausing, resting, and doing things that continue to connect me to myself. No more blues. Just open space and time to see people I love, or not. Read, or not. Run, or not. No matter what I do or don’t do before diving into another week of work, I am grounded in the me that I am today.  And that's enough. I am enough, and so are you.

Life has been good aside from that, I'm walking my dog more, feeding my cats more, I'm overall more present, College took a backseat while I was getting sober, and by some miracle I passed my first semester. My main problem now is getting back in there and overcoming the boat loads of anxiety (could I have messaged some ppl there? Maybe, don't remember and boy do I feel like a freak) Couldn't have gotten this far without AA, documentaries, books and this subreddit. I hope to maintain this, biggest hurdle is apologising to the rest of the people I hurt/freaked out that night, I was always the shy kid and alcohol made it so much worse, whatever stuff I repress or don't think is important enough to mention I blurt out when drunk, to everyone else it seems like it's coming out of nowhere but fuck dude I'm too good at holding everything in (until I'm not, I guess)

My anxiety and alcoholism, two sides of the same coin it seems. I think I’ve had generalized and social anxiety for years. I don’t think people can really tell tbh, I’m super bubbly and colorful, I love people and to party, I like to have fun and I fucking love life but even when I’m having the time of my life there’s this little feeling in the back of my mind that something’s about to snap. And the vibe will break. And it’ll all go wrong. 

I love to party, but I also feel like I can’t be the funnest, craziest most colorful version of myself when I’m sober, I can’t say the things I wanna say, I can’t be quick witted, I can’t get out of myself to have fun, and after all fun if really what I feel like is all I really want out of life. So I drink. I drink a little at first and as soon as I have a taste I want more, I wanna get to that spot where everything feels perfect. Where everything I say is great. Where I could be doing anything or with anyone and feel incredible. I feel like I’m coming up, and socializing gets easier and easier and better and better but I want more and more and more and I can’t stop and then nothing. Then I wake up, I don’t know how I got home, I might be naked in someone else’s bed who I don’t remember meeting and who I wouldn’t touch with a 10 foot pole sober. I might be outside. I getting crippling anxiety, I don’t even wanna ask my friends what happened cause I know it’s bad. Cause I’ve been told 100,000 what I’m like. All I remember were the fun bits at least! 

This happens maybe 1/3 times I drink. I don’t drink everyday, but whenever I’m in a party situation, which is a lot, I drink, and maybe half those times I blackout. I’m 24 and I’ve hurt people and ruined relationships. It sucks cause I live for partying but I don’t think I can be myself, or the person I wanna be, without it. The anxiety is too bad. But I can’t live like this I’m gunna kill myself or someone else so I wanna make some steps to change. I was considering trying to find some medications for anxiety and maybe if I can get that under control I won’t feel the need to push those uneasy feelings down with alcohol so much. My questions are this: 1.) does anyone relate and how the FUCK am I supposed to party sober does it get better and less awkward?? Or do I just have to avoid my favorite thing the rest of my life?? And 2.) has anyone had success with medication for general anxiety or social anxiety? I have a psychiatrist I’m gunna talk to but I wanna know peoples experience.

I’ve suspected for a while that my relationship with alcohol is problematic (at best - destructive is probably more honest and accurate). I’ve always enjoyed drinking and sometimes overdid it for sure, but it was usually rare - my birthday, NYE, etc. But that’s changed. It started slowly- a glass of wine every night with dinner. Then two, then a few, then drinking an entire bottle. I remember the first time I finished a bottle of white wine myself on a random night: I felt like s*hit the next day. Now? That’s what I need to even feel drunk. And that scares me. 

I think my drinking really started in earnest during quarantine (I’m probably not unique, in that respect…). I drank to cope with the uncertainty, with the boredom, when I was too anxious to read or write, just for fun, etc. I was lucky to have a job that fairly easily transitioned to virtual but honestly I think getting up for the commute on the train was something that kept my drinking in check. I went from needing to be out the door of my apartment at 6:45 am to rolling out of bed at 8:45 am and logging on after making a coffee. I started to drink a lot during the week. I was hungover a lot of work days, which violated what had always been a tacit agreement I had with myself - no getting drunk on weekdays. But I did get drunk on weekdays. A lot of them. One Zoom game night with friends I got so drunk I could barely keep up with the very silly, simple, easy game we were playing. I woke up the next day feeling anxious and mortified. At the first in-person wedding I attended since 2020 I got drunk, had a very stupid argument with a friend (all my fault and only because I was so drunk), and do not remember getting back to the hotel. It seems I walked, which would’ve been about two and a half miles, because I checked my phone and no evidence of calling a ride service. I could list many other examples, but the point is the drinking continued even when it became distinctly NOT fun. 

All that to say, I think I’m finally accepting I need to stop drinking. A friend of mine always asked me to come to a hot yoga class with her on Saturday mornings. I almost never agreed because in the back of my mind I knew it was very likely I would be hungover on a Saturday morning, would bail, and get charged for a last minute cancelation. I have been hungover many, many Saturdays over the past couple of years. But today, I went to hot yoga, on a Saturday, not hungover, and I’m calling that a win",10,1

I started smoking, drinking, and pill popping around age 17. I turn 30 soon so decided I was going to enter my thirties proud of myself. So here I am. 

Over the years I've tried to cut down and/or get sober many, many times. My longest stretch was 22 days not drinking in December 2020, but I was still smoking schwag weed during that time. This time I've quit everything, cuz at the root, for me, it's all the same thing. I've been abusing substances to cover up trauma and pain and it has not been effective.

It has been very difficult to deal with the lifetime's worth of feelings and sensations that has now been coming up. Last night I drank a CBD drink and decided to follow an ex-best friend from years ago on Twitter, thinking enough time had passed that she might not mind. A few minutes later I thought better of it, and unfollowed her. But then I noticed she had already blocked me. That hurt a lot. The rejection hurt, the memory of how I acted back then that caused her to drop me, and the feeling of stupidity for having initiated this sad microdrama hurt. 

I don't think I'll be having high-potency CBD drinks again. But I've just dealt with all these different shades of hurt, and haven't gone out and gotten something to drink today the way I definitely would've a week and a half ago. I am very proud of that. 

My husband is getting sober with me. It's been day 11 for both of us. And instead of us drinking and fighting, he is reading in bed with the second cat I went out and adopted on Tuesday. He doesn't read when he's drinking. So....I'm just so proud of us. 

Getting sober is a very brave thing to do. I have not really existed as an adult without intoxication and child abuse is what drove me to get high and drunk in the first place. So I feel like I am naked, sensitive, just brimming with sensations. Some of the sensations are pleasant and some are horrible. 

But I feel like I am finally living *genuinely.* Good or bad, this is my life. And I want to be here for it. 

I've gotten through this Saturday without getting intoxicated. I'll have my Sunday without drugs (be it alcohol, or whatever), too.

Best of luck to all of you. What we are doing is scary, and not easy. But we are doing it. Failure isn't relapsing. Failure is giving up on yourself.

I never realized how much time there was in 100 days. These past 100 days didn't go by slowly or fast, they just sort of went by. 

Anyways, I'm making this post to share my journey so far and to share some of the things I've learned. Someone once told me that hearing my experience and other people's experiences helped them stay sober. I'm hoping to give back and hopefully help someone stay sober with this post. 

**Sobriety is a marathon, not a race.**

If I could start over, I would've been more patient with myself on day 1. I thought I had to put extra pressure on myself and take on more things to make up for lost time. Most of my sobriety revolves around self-discovery. So looking back, rushing that doesn't make any sense. 

**Going through emotions, good or bad, is okay.** 

I used to view negative emotions such as anger and sadness as terrible feelings. But that's all they are, they're just feelings. They're not good or bad. Feeling them is okay. Hell, that's probably why I stopped drinking in the first place; so I can feel emotions again. 

**Sobriety is not linear. Maintaining sobriety will be different for everyone.**

I managed to stay sober by keeping myself busy and putting extra pressure on myself. This will not work for everyone and that's okay. As I've mentioned above, sobriety has been mostly about self-discovery for me. So my coping mechanisms will probably only work for me. There isn't one set way to stay sober. The important thing is to keep an open mind and try out different things and see what works.

With that being said, this last point is probably the most important one for me at the moment.

**What works today could stop working tomorrow.**

During the first two months of my sobriety, I depended a lot on support groups. They helped me out greatly but people change and grow. I'm not the same person today as I was on day 1 (admittedly though, I'm still probably the same with some minor changes haha). So it makes sense that what works for my sobriety changes. 

Recently I've been finding that my life doesn't have to revolve around sobriety anymore to stay sober. I can start making my life revolve around other things now but I do need sobriety as a foundation. My life has been great sober but like with everything in life, it has its shitty moments. I never regretted getting sober or trying my best to stay sober.",51,0

I would have been telling myself I was relaxing and having some Me Time, but I would have ended the day feeling like I'd wasted it and not even feeling all that relaxed.

Down time IS important, don't get me wrong on that. Sitting on my ass watching tv is also fine sometimes. But I felt so much more rejuvenated by my half day than I used to.

Not just from ruining my sobriety but also from my emotional pain,"I've posted here last month about it so I'll give a summary. My wife got into a car accident and was stuck out of state. Cat that I love to death stopped eating. When she got the rental to come back we took him to the vet. He had a growth and his kidney was huge. Vet said he wouldn't get better and was in pain so we put him to sleep. His brother has been sick (they are both getting old. 14 years) with vomiting and diarrhea.

 Fast forward to what's going on now. Wifes mom who she brought back with her has a dog that is now sick with diarrhea. We are waiting on the results of the cats stool sample because nothing bad showed up in blood work just like when we had him checked before. Nothing is wrong with our cat other than malnutrition and dehydrated from the vomiting and diarrhea. Wife is freaking out because the pet water fountain has some mildew growing but she has cleaned it constantly and never saw it before. She thinks she is killing all the animals. Told her no way they got something from it, which my mom (previous vet tech) agreed with because it showed up waaay after cat was sick. The cat that died had an issue that was growing for a long time because it was a large tumor. The dog could be just having problems dealing with the new diet because we put her on healthy foods because she was super overweight. I guess we will know for sure when we hear back from the vet. Cat is done all his antibiotics and food. Vomiting has stopped but still has very bad diarrhea.

I'm freaking out here. We are both freaking out here. So much bad luck this year. I don't want to lose both cats. Bad enough what if it's something contagious and her dog now has it? What if it was the cat fountain? Did we kill our cats? Did we kill her mom's dog? I doubt it but I'm a nervous wreck. I just started getting over the loss of my cat and now everything is going back to crap. I just don't want to feel anymore. I just want a break from life. I want to get so faced I black out.

Well, I have nearly two years sober after ten years of drinking far too much on a daily basis. I opened up the ol’ instagram this morning and much to my chagrin I see that my ex wife and mother of my children got engaged last night. We’ve been divorced for almost two years. (I should add that the timing of my divorce and my sobriety are somewhat related.) What people don’t really mention often enough, is that with sobriety comes all of the emotions that you spent years avoiding. I am,in fact, still unequivocally still very much in love with my ex wife. To me, her and my kids are home. (She does know how I feel.) Please excuse my coarse language but FUCK. 

This is a whole ball of shitty emotions I really DO NOT feel like dealing with. I went out to get a coffee and inevitably did, absolutely, think on getting a bottle of Jameson. Fuck, I even went through the liquor section of the grocery after grabbing my Starbucks. You know what though? Even this is not worth ruining my sobriety. All this shit will still be here tomorrow. The kids come home tomorrow and hungover/drunk dad is a guy I swore to myself that I will not be again. Don’t get me wrong, this fucking breaks my heart.

So I did this great thing and managed to stay sober for 50 days (tomorrow). Last time I drank, I moderated. A lot of water. One glass of wine I sipped for 1 hour. And a vodka shot when I knew I'd go out in a minute. My friends got wasted.

I became aware that moderation isn't for me. It took all my mental resources to maintain it. Then, when I was in my apt alone, I'd get smashed. Vodka, whiskey, wine, beers, cider. Fancy expensive or homeless cheap didn't matter. I drank to be drunk.

I know that being sober alone won't solve all of my issues. It's enough that I sleep well, eat well, don't do stupid things I regret. And I have more money.

However, I'm sad because I struggle to find a job which I can sustain. I've lowered my financial expectations to have fewer responsibilities. I've learned a lot of skills. The problem is I seem to land jobs with psycho-managers, mean, abusive and over-demanding, lying about work, schedule and pay.

I fish for sympathy here, not for coaching advice. I know I'll figure my work situation in some time. It's just today was horrible and I quit. In the past I'd stay in a toxic environment for months until I even start to entertain the idea, that maybe me or my skills aren't the issue.

Last time I managed to stay sober for a longer time was 6 years ago. I was sober for a couple of months. Went into toxic romantic relationship that sent me into dark place for many, many years. Don't want to repeat it with toxic work environment ppl. I've decided to be proactive this time. It's just it feels disappointing and tiring to look for work, going into interviews and quitting. I was unemployed for some months during 2020 and 2021 too.

I don't want to seem like I'm all perfect. I'm just fortunate to have a great boss in a past for whom I've worked for 1,5y. So I know I'm in a shitty work place rn (my colleagues are really nice, it's management).

And yeah, I think some of you may understand me. I talked with my non-alcoholic friends, but they don't get it.

 Good morning.
 Our keynote is: “Humbly say to ourselves many times each day, ‘Thy will be done’,...”.
 Today’s Meditation and Prayer are about persisting along the path of spirituality and the 12 steps.
 I view “persisting” as quite different from “continuing”, which connotes never straying from the path.
“Persisting”, on the other hand, presumes repeatedly failing and starting over.
 Today’s reading affirms the inevitability of encountering periods during which I feel cut off from God, AA and spirituality. In those gray times, I can’t wave a wand and change my thoughts, feelings or beliefs.
 What I can do is persist in actions consistent with faith. 
However faint the Divine Spark may seem, I can do my best to take the next stitch as directed. If I persist in doing so while trudging through those spiritual twilights, my actions will eventually restore my mind, heart and soul. I will once again become aware of and, therefore, consciously part of, God’s Magic. 
 I love you all.",5,0

I think I’m just bored.,"My drinking didn’t really become a problem until the pandemic hit. I was fortunate to have enough savings plus my dad’s retirement income (he lives with me) to quit working and ride it out at home until the vaccine became available. I returned to work and was thriving, drinking less and less, feeling alive again, you get the drill. 

But I caught Covid because I work in a public facing job with a very anti-mask and vax mentality. I’m looking for a WFH job, because I just can’t handle the mental stress of bringing Covid home to my dad. He has cancer and even though he’s vaccinated and missed catching it from me this time, what about the next time? My mental health is really struggling. 

Which brings me to examining my reasons to drink. It all started when I was home all day, every day, not seeing friends or going to do activities or dating…again, I’m sure you know the drill. I began drinking at night, while I watched tv, because it made the time go by faster until I could sleep and start the dreariness all over again. Then it progressed to day drinking because even after cleaning the whole house, I still had hours of drudgery ahead of me. 

Now here I am, day 3 after the latest 2 month binge, and it became a whopper of a bender when I was sick with Covid (ironic, right? I felt so sick for 7 days straight, and couldn’t stop pumping my body full of poison). 

But ultimately I really think the root cause is boredom. I feel healthy again, I’m starting to bounce back after taking even a small break, and I just want my routine of coming home after work and sitting alone in my room drinking while I watch tv. 

The answer seems obvious: pick up some hobbies, incorporate healthy habits in my life to fill the time. Learn to bake bread, take up yoga at home, etc etc. But I’ve always had a problem with that, going back years before I became a problem drinking. My depression and possible ADHD makes me feel incapable of sticking with a new hobby. I’ve purchased so many different hobby supplies over the years and I get bored in a week or two and they just collect dust. I’ve tried so many types of exercise and I hate them all, I genuinely hate exercise and have never felt satisfied after a workout of any kind. Just annoyed that I tried yoga/swimming/walking/tennis/on and on, without still not feeling a spark. 

I used to be an avid reader and loved to write, but a severe manic episode damaged my concentration and some other executive functions etc (thanks, bipolar) and I find it difficult and painful to read now, beyond the occasional super interesting 2 page internet article. And writing…I’m getting mentally tired already with this short Reddit post. 

So…any creative suggestions on filling the boredom void? Something I haven’t thought of? Some trick to make it stick?

Life is better because I don't have the internal debate about when, how many, blocking off the next day etc.  

I don't celebrate this anywhere but in this sub. I'm really proud of myself.  Addiction runs strong in my family. I still have cravings and triggers but its become manageable.

Today, I’m at 8 days and I’ve started shedding things that give me “the ick” or feel off-putting. I know this is normal but it’s happened too quickly. I almost can’t keep up. 

The first one is no longer posting manically on social media. SM now feels like a bleak and lonely and false place, and it doesn’t bring joy. That makes me a little sad because it has always been such a big part of my life. 

The other thing that’s shedding is the relationship I have had with a guy for a few months. Commenting on my alcohol-free week, he said, “spending a weekend sober would make me sad” ☹️😂 … I had no response. After months of excitement and fun back and forth.. I just.. left him on read. Suddenly, that felt very bleak and lonely and false too. 

Everything I’ve known for the longest time now feels so far away. And I accept it but I am mourning it. Social media and this relationship were usually my pick-me-ups for bad hangovers or a place to peacock while under the influence. It seems they don’t have a place in my life right now.

I bought myself a pack of non alcoholic beer and it made me understand something. I genuinely liked beer for the taste, but couldn’t moderate because of the alcohol. It wasn’t an excuse, but I did use it to justify how much I bought. Since buying the beer, I realized that. I have only had one a day and that’s all I’ve wanted. I drink one after getting home from work while my dinner heats up. That’s it. No desire for another one. No cravings for something harder. Now this hasn’t come without struggling and a lot of learning but it’s a nice place to be at. Especially knowing how much money I have, and how much I could buy if I wanted to... but I don’t want to. And I’m proud of myself for that. Even though there has been a lot of stress in my life, I haven’t genuinely wanted to drink. I honestly think that facing discomfort without numbing it out has strengthened my stress tolerance and ability to withstand being uncomfortable and getting through it with my own internal navigation. 

Anyways, thank you so much for reading if you did.

Phew. That’s really all I have to say hah. I really want to check Instagram for no reason and it feels just like how my drug and alcohol cravings felt in the beginning 😂 hence the reason I’m taking a break.

We were sharing goals, aspirations, hobbies, music interests, and other things of the sort.  My line of work is very much “work hard, play harder” and we got to talking about some of the stories  from the old days, when I decided to mention that I haven’t drank since September.  Just like that the guy I was talking to said, it’s been just over a year for me, and the other said he’s been really cutting back quite a bit.  I mentioned that I just generally feel sharper and better in the mind since the change, to keep the discussion light, and not delve further into my own mental health struggles, but it was well received.  The guy with over a year said, “I just can’t do the things I want when I’m drinking.  I like to get up early, workout, pursue hobbies, and get after all of my different interests.  When I drink I’m hungover, and it’s entirely counter productive for me.”  I told him I agree with him 100%, and the guy who mentioned he was cutting back brought up the fact that he had a hard time stopping once he got going with it, and I was just kind of blown away to know that there are a lot more people around me trying to avoid alcohol than I thought, and that the party culture crowd seems larger because they tend to be louder about announcing their exploits.

My pressure is slightly lower than it was when I was drinking, hopefully it keeps getting lower.

It has been an eye opening 5 days for sure. I feel better, more energy, more time in the evenings with my family instead of just drinking. I have had weird pokes and pinches in my liver and stomach area. I had waves of very slight headaches the other day. My sinuses feel clearer.

One day you see fish nibbling on some food. They take a little few bites and swim away. Curious, you follow suit and swim up and nibble a little and swim away. Just a little bit. The big piece of food just sitting their is obviously tempting but you know you shouldn’t take all of it. 
You keep doing this, but one day as you are nibbling , you find yourself alone, nibbling away. 
But then you decide to swallow the thing. What could happen? 
Gulp.  Instant regret. The hook sets. 

All of a sudden you are being pulled away. You start trying to fight it, but it keeps pulling you. No matter what you do, it keeps pulling you. Your school of friends and family start to fade away in the distance. Your struggling is to no avail. From the safety of calm deep waters, you are pulled closer and closer to the chaos of the breaking zone. You were always warned to stay away, but you find yourself inching towards it, you can barely fight anymore. The tug is getting stronger and stronger. The pain increases, the raging chaos is beginning to swirl about you. Once you get pulled into it, no one ever comes back. The pull is so strong. It’s almost over. 
Then you see a school swimming near you. You hear them, they are trying to yell to you, encourage you come join them. Trying to reach out to you. You see in their eyes their concern and fear and love. You give it a swift kick and all of a sudden the searing pain hurts so much….the pull on you hurts……but you moved closer to the school. You do it again. You move closer to them and away from the chaos!!! . It hurts so much. You do it again and move even closer to them. The school cheers you on!! You can do it!! . You keep repeating it, fighting, straining, one good kick at a time. Then you find you’re at the school, and they all cheering you on. Swim away they say!! Surrounded by this new school, encouraged, as you swim away, each kick, the tug has less pull. It is still there. But it seems the more distant you are from the breakers and chaos, the tug lessens. You see others with lines just like yours leading back to the chaos. But they all say, it gets better. The farther you are away from it, the less pull it has. But it never goes away. The hook will always be there. You just have to learn a new way of swimming. Swim with the school. We can help you. Just don’t swim back near the chaos.",14,0

I was working 7 days a week, was super stressed about finances and didn't see a light at the end of any tunnel I would try to look down to keep going. I was drinking heavily to run away from all the anxiety and hateful thoughts I would rain down on myself. I'm sure this sounds familiar to many of you.

Fast forward to this morning. I had set my alarm early this morning so I could get to my 2nd job (at a gym) before opening and get my workout completed. When the alarm went off, I thought, I just want to try to sleep in a bit more and get the workout done after my shift. Then...I was just awake and motivated to go in and get my workout. So, I got up, got my coffee and preworkout, put on the clothes I had prepared last night and headed out the door. As I was driving in, I looked at the clock - it was 5:45 am. On a Saturday. And I was awake and EXCITED about being awake. It struck me in that moment that I have come a very long way from last year. I know not every day is this good, so I'm enjoying it. I'm also grateful that I have enough perspective to know that staying sober over these past 6+ months is the difference. Sobriety is what started this journey to a better place - one I had tried to start over and over and over again and could never quite accomplish. Staying sober is the thing that will keep it going. Not the workouts (which I'm back to enjoying), not the nutrition (which is yielding visible results), not the mindset work....for me, it is the sobriety that allows me the clarity to make choices every day that have gotten me this far.

Between 20-23 I was rarely sober. I finally got a 9-5 job so took my foot off the gas to become a weekend warrior with the occasional weekday binge. This has been my pattern since and I am now 30.

All those years of drinking I kind of found a comfortable limit. I would get drunk enough to satisfy my cravings but know that I would be anxiety and feeling crap the next day but not to the point I couldn't move hungover. Recently I have been pushing that limit getting closer and closer to the 23 year old me. Last night I drank waaaaay to much more than I have done in years. Woke up this morning heart pound, throwing up my KFC I ordered at 1am,  can't  keep water down and my anxiety is so high it is in space. I immediately poured everything I have away. I've know I had an issue with alcohol  but I keep telling myself I am in control and I can stop whenever.  I am now realising I have a serious problem with it.  I have not felt this way for years, I need to use this as a massive wake up call. I don't even want to feel this way again. I'm going to be ok right? I hate this.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Thank you for letting me host this week, whoo it went by fast! 

It has been a pleasure being a part of this community it truly is a beautiful, kind, and healing space for me. 

I’m going to leave you with some lyrics to a song that is very important to my sobriety. It’s been stuck in my head all day 🎶

Well I started out down a dirty road

Started out all alone

And the sun went down as I crossed the hill

And the town lit up, the world got still


I'm learning to fly, but I ain't got wings

Coming down is the hardest thing


Well, the good ol' days may not return

And the rocks might melt and the sea may burn


I'm learning to fly (learning to fly) but I ain't got wings (learning to fly)

Coming down (learning to fly) is the hardest thing (learning to fly)


Well, some say life will beat you down

Break your heart, steal your crown

So I've started out for God-knows-where

I guess I'll know when I get there


I'm learning to fly, around the clouds

But what goes up (learning to fly) must come down


I'm learning to fly (learning to fly), but I ain't got wings

Coming down is the hardest thing


I'm learning to fly (learning to fly), around the clouds

But what goes up (learning to fly) must come down

3765,2022-02-05 01:36:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/sl0dc4/learning_to_expect_good_things/,Learning to expect good things.,"One of the things my therapist said last time we chatted was that it’s hard to learn to expect good things like happiness, financial security, romance, etc when you’ve spent so long not having it. And we’re working through what that looks like when I’m not constantly hungover or drunk all the time.

Well… here’s the shit show I’ve been in the past 2 months. My car died 3 days before Christmas. Effectively cutting my only source of income. Caught covid. Mechanic had to push the date to repair two weeks because an employee got covid. 

But the good things. Got a job that pays a normal wage.

Well problem, I go from driving Uber to working in an office. I don’t have clothes to make that transition. And I don’t have a source of income to buy clothes. I was supposed to start Monday, but I was stressed I’d have to take a 2 hour bus to commute because my cars not ready. And I’ve been driving Uber for 3 years. In that entire time I’ve not used an alarm and just woke up whenever. I’m not even sure I can wake up on time none-the-less early enough for the bus.

Then work calls and says my background check hasn’t cleared yet. I got really nervous. I know I’m not a criminal and don’t have anything on my background that would barre employment, but that alcoholic urge to wonder if maybe you committed a felony while black out and just don’t remember. 

Then on top of all that my car payment finally hit repossession department and I had to spend the last amount of money I had to get that to just barely current. 

Broke down on the phone. Well… here’s where things start turning around.The financing company has a program that reduces interest and offers reduced payments for 6 months in the event of job loss or severe financial difficulty. My plan and budget was to pay off the car in a year anyway. Now with 6 months of significantly reduced interest. I’m going to be able to pay it off in 10 months. 

I breathed a huge sigh of relief. Then thought back to this background and realized since my start dates getting pushed back, I’ll have 3 days to make money driving Uber and then a day to shop. I’ll also have a car to drive to work in. Also, realized I was going to have to play catch-up with my car payment by driving Uber on the weekends for 2 weeks before my paycheck came in. Now I don’t have to be that aggressive. I can make my first payment when I get my first paycheck. Then the biggest sigh of relief. I don’t have to take a bus to work. 

I realized at no point did I stop and consider these speed bumps may have good outcomes. I didn’t think I could expect good things in my life. Now sure there’s still a chance the background check will not clear. But it would require a stolen identity (once again super possible because I lost my ids almost every weekend while drinking). I think I can go to bed expecting positives things to come of this, and not catastrophize about really wild scenarios preventing me from getting a job. 

Idk what this means for others but maybe people new to sobriety can be encouraged. It’s not just things getting better in your life, but without alcohol you get better. You learn god willing to expect great things in your life because we deserve great things because we are great people no matter what our alcoholic brains try to tell us.",11,2

Go out drinking, recover for 1-2 days, and repeat.  

I finally decided this is not only a pattern I want out of, but MORE importantly, it’s not something I can do on my own.

There will be some fancy whiskey and cigars around his new fire pit. 

     To top it off, another friend is getting off Dry January and is joining him. I had hoped he would’ve stayed sober as he just shared with me how great he feels. I feel silly cause this morning I sent him some links to podcasts and a cool Vimeo about a Sunday skateboarding sobriety meeting in LA. 

    And now I feel like a dork. I also feel like I’m snubbing them. In a way I am. Ultimately my sobriety is passing judgment on my friends career and passion (he’s also a sommelier). So there’s no way around it. The circle tightens. Choices are made. And you can’t be everyone’s friend anymore.

Same old story.. three beers one day and back in the bottle two days later. Had some on and off but it was generally ""under control"" (meaning the downward spiral just hadn't hit yet). Last weekend got bad culminating on Tuesday where I was blacked out half the day and basically ignoring work. Wednesday I just shut down locked myself in my room and only left to grab a drizzly delivery. Ignoring calls from workers, not checking my emails, etc. Hadn't showered in so long I could feel the grime on me. 


Thursday I was woken up (at 3PM) to frantic pounding at the door. Apparently HR called my emergency contacts and they sent the cops to do a wellness check. Every surface of my house was covered in beer cans and empty bottles. Well that ended up in another hospital trip where I was sobbing and apologizing for wasting their time. I also noticed I missed a bunch of calls from friend and family. 


The hospital sucked, it always does, but especially now. The nurse was great but not fun sitting on a stretcher in brightly lit hallway overnight. But, they kept me from dying and gave my some meds and a lot of fluid. 


They gave me two options: inpatient rehab (done that not my thing), or a free outpatient program attached to the hospital. I went home after release and wanted to see how I'd feel after showering and trying to eat something for the first time in days. Spoiler alert, but not great as I could feel the neuropathy and anxiety starting to kick in. Maybe chamomile would help I thought at my hands were shaking so hard I spilled on myself. So I went to the outpatient clinic.


One of the best experience of my journey. Everyone was so nice. They took the time to really listen and get an understanding of the problems I've been having. The doctor agreed on and medication to help with withdrawal and some other issues. And I have two follow ups next week.

It’s rough having an all or nothing personality, and I’m sure some of you understand. I love to drink when I’m drinking. I love the freedom and relaxation that come with it in the moment. But I absolutely hate the anxiety, self loathing, memory loss and worthlessness that comes so shortly after. And I didn’t used to be this way. I hate that people send me videos and pictures and memes about drinking because it reminded them of me. I’m still social, I make it to work and pay my bills, I can go days without drinking. I wish I didn’t need anything to encourage me not to.

I’m not drunk all day, i’m a very high functioning alcoholic with a day job, and I’ve gotten (unfortunately) very good at hiding how much I drink after work. I’m so tired of feeling out of control, and like this liquid and desire to have it controls me. I don’t want to hide my habits from him anymore.

I want to tell my husband I’m struggling with this. I know he deserves to feel however he does when I tell him. But I don’t know that I’m at the stage I can say I’ll never drink again. And I know once I tell him, I’ll feel obligated to never drink again and feel judged anytime I do. Which I’m worried will spiral me to hide drinking further. 

I didn’t drink today, and I will not drink with you today, but I feel like I need to get this out there. It’s not fair to him, and I know I could use the support. I think about drinking often and have been struggling alone. Has anyone here been open with their significant others for support? How do you break it to them? How do you convey you don’t know if you still don’t feel strong enough to stop for good even though you want to tell them?

Is there such a thing as a ‘healthy level’ of alcohol consumption, or is that a societal norm?  How many people here are totally dry, and how many feel the have their habit under tight control?

I tried moderating so I'd go a week without drinking then drink, but it always ended up being a get smashed session. I went a whole month, then relapsed and it was so bad almost like the longer I went sober the drunk beat down was harder. I punched a wall and messed up my hand pretty good. 

That caused me to get therapy for my obvious mood disorder. 

Over the holidays I drank a few glasses of wine. Felt like total shit. All of the sudden it wasn't worth it anymore. 

Two weeks ago I just quit. No going back. I can't, and I'm certain it would be terrible. It's like my addiction is a cornered animal and it will come back harder, which is why moderation and me can't coexist. 

I am starting to feel things again. Sensations are stronger now sober. My mood is easier to control.

They were drinking beer and I gave an excuse to drink only sparkling water. They were a bit pushy, but not too much.

The three of them had seen me in my worst: a terrible night in december when I got crazy drunk (to the point that I still wonder if I took some drug or have been drugged...) I have near zero memories from that night, but I lost my phone, hurt my leg etc etc.

I was really ashamed and almost didn't come today, but I chose to face them, so as to mitigate the effects of shame and guilt. I think it worked for me, at least a bit. They weren't judgmental or anything, so I'll try to be less paranoid.

I had no craving to drink (actually quite the opposite). And in general I was able to have fun and enjoy the conversation, even when they were getting drunk.

I left early and went home. On the way I was thinking if I will not drink anymore, never... I don't know. For now I won't.

Now that I'm a few weeks into my sobriety, I've really got the itch to read a good book. 

I like sci-fi and historical fiction, but if you've got any good nonfiction to recommend, I dig that too.

A few books I'm thinking about re-reading are Dune 1-4, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, and an interesting non-fiction about shamanism called The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge.

I also never finished The Dark Tower series, so I might pick that up again.

So those are my recommendations. Can you throw a few at me for my deliciously sober brain to devour?

(long, need to type this out)","I honestly don't know right now. But I started self-medicating with wine when things got hard at work, and then my life was uprooted to a new location I didn't want to move to. I was drinking at least one full bottle of wine, and then it went to wine with some mini-vodkas, and then occasionally harder liquor, but my drink of choice was wine. Wine before work, wine after work, sometimes wine during work. I was just constantly numbing myself. 

It happened so fast, and it was right before covid, and when that hit my drinking went up more. Then I move here and I work at a job where my manager was sexually harassing/assaulting me daily, and I drank more, and I'm surrounded by casinos/bars/liquor stores at every corner, so it was hard to really get out of it. Just lost my job a couple days ago (not alcohol related), and so that didn't help. Plus I have PTSD from other trauma in my childhood that I'm getting help for, but living with that daily has caused me to drink. It just exploded. 

But I'm stopping for my mental/physical health. I'm in therapy, going to reiki, seeing a psychiatrist, getting back into yoga/walking outside. I'm 31 and live with my mom and grandma, my mom is in the midst of meltdown, my grandma is 90 and doesn't understand. I don't even know how i'm doing this. 

I'm in physical pain, cramps, stomach problems, dopamine is gone obviously, just feel like i was savagely beaten up by a demon, which basically i was. But this time I'm doing it for MYSELF and not anyone else, and I was sober for 4 years before i started drinking again (besides social drinking occasionally, but I could go months without even thinking of it) and that's where I want to be again. I want to be peaceful and happy without any outside substances, especially this devil drink. 

And since I never want to feel this miserable again, that's what's keeping me from drinking. I know if I just have one glass or one small bottle it will restart the whole process and I can't. Plus I was so much better when I was sober, and I can't start another job again until i beat this. Though it sucks because i have like 100 dollars to my name now and i still need to pay my phone bill. 

Fortunately, I have 1000000 reasons not to drink, and only like 20 reasons to drink right now, but those 20 reasons I can fix. I'm done waking up with crippling anxiety and stomach issues, I'm sick of having no energy whatsoever, I'm sick of having meltdowns and snapping at people who love me, I'm sick o waking up to random texts/messages/phone calls I don't remember making and then cringing at what I wrote, I'm sick of thinking of suicide every night until i get drunk and numb it. I'm sick of hiding it and my mom worrying about it, even if I'm 31. I'm SICK of being SICK. so I can do this. 

I've heard the first 3 days are the worst, and I couldn't sleep at all last night, and watched a horror movie that was a REALLY bad choice on a come down, but it was solid so I kept watching, but avoiding that shit for a while. My reiki/spiritualist lady who is helping me just invited me over (she used to be an alcoholic too), at first I said no, but I'm going to go. She wants to help, so I'm expecting it. 

Godspeed to you all who are fighting this! It's an insidious disease that loves to just sneak up on you and coil its way around your neck until it's so tight you can't breathe and are literally fucking dying and it shoots its venom into you. WE CAN BEAT THIS! Much love to you all.",12,1

My eyes shoot open. Pitch Black. What time is it? When did he even get here? Shit. I glance over to the coffee table and see a too full wine glass. The ache in my brain drives me to take a sip, and I pour the whole thing down my throat. 

Much better. 

As I lay in the blindness of my tiny bedroom, I grasp for the memories of my drunken night. 

It escapes me. 

What the hell did we talk about? What the hell did I say*?* I’m sure I embarrassed myself. I pretty much always do. The hours crawl by as I begin to form my charade for the coming day. 

*Yes, Dear. I remember. The movie was great. The sex was awesome. I wasn’t shitfaced. I wasn’t completely blacked out. Of course not.* 

The sun slowly begins to rise and light sneaks into the room. I really need to invest in some blackout shades. I start to sit up and my head spins with me. Bathroom. Now. I avoid my gaze as I rush to the toilet, but it catches up to me when I finally finish dry heaving and I'm forced to face myself.

I look like a fucking mess. 

My hair looks like it’s a neglected dog found in an alley, matted and it’s thinner than ever. My face is puffy and red, with broken capillaries splattered around my skin. My eyes are lifeless and dull. What could he possibly see in them? What could he possibly see in me? There is no way he doesn’t notice my decline. I barely remember who I used to be, but I bet he recalls her fondly. 

I used to take care of myself. I was pretty cute and i didn't realize it. Walks and yoga daily. Hikes, kayaking, smoothies in the morning. Rarely drinking. I’m sure he would much rather have that now, after seeing this wreck. Instead of the daily smoothies, I wake myself up with the drink I was too drunk to finish last night.

I’m in grad school studying something I love and my motivation right now is close to zero.

I recognize myself (34F) in a lot of your stories. A particular shout out to the user who wrote an extremely eloquent F you to wine boxes. Man, those things really are a sick gift to problem drinkers. Sure, my college days included the ritual of “slapping the bag” of Franzia but I didn’t really think then that a decade later I’d know just when to cut the corner of the plastic in the Black Box to get that last glass an a half out.

Anyway, I was (or at least, thought I was) the “guys girl” when it came to drinking. Rarely hungover, always up for a morning beer, day drinking, whiskey neat, etc. It was strangely part of my identity. My wettest stretches usually followed drier month/s — I worked abroad for many years and couldn’t really drink in the field, would go on health kicks to drop weight, did some fertility preservation, and sometimes would just get over it for awhile. All in all, I assumed this evened out to being a normie, and when life really called for it in the future my stint would come to a natural end and all would be well.  

As the title suggests, I was wrong. Despite having my PhD in WebMD, the one thing I really didn’t give much of a thought to was how much I might be damaging my liver, probably because I didn't want to. And specifically in my case, that I could possibly have inherited things lurking that might really speed that along.

Sometime in December, I began to feel an almost ghostlike, on again-off again twinge in my upper right ribcage. I assumed I pulled something walking the puppy or at the gym, or even just had my bra strap a little too tight, but the feeling continued into last month. I finally sucked it up and got a full blood workup done despite being out-of-network, and when my liver enzymes came back slightly high, some really diligent nurses called in more tests. My iron saturation was off the charts (the normal range is 20-40% and mine was 93%). 

After genetic testing, turns out I have the Hereditary Hemochromatosis and Alpha-1 Antitrypsin mutations. Both can wreck havoc on the liver if left untreated and/or moderate to heavy alcohol consumption continues. An ultrasound showed I have mild fatty liver but it could have been much, much worse, especially if I kept turning a blind eye to what my body was trying to tell me.

I am grateful I discovered this now - I’ve got a lot to live for.

And so do you. If you are lurking here, searching Reddit for Fatty Liver stories, or just came across this and are curious about your genes, get a 23&me test. It could really make a difference. IWNDWYT (or for like, ever.)",29,0

The first seven days breezed by. And then things started getting sticky, and I unintentionally faced some things that made me uncomfortable. So I’m going to be accountable and do the work and address it instead of being lazy and relapsing. But I also wanted to check in here and be accountable to someone beyond myself too.

I will not drink with you tonight 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼

I drink everyday, and I can consume an alarming amount of alcohol in a short period of time. I’ve been trying to cut back and do better for months but not much has changed. (That’s the short version of my relationship with alcohol).

A few weeks ago I hit a low point and behaved in such a way that I felt absolutely disgusted with myself. I hated myself and recognized that I do have a problem.

I have a daily thirst to drink. Once I start I can’t stop and I fear turning out like my father and his father.

So during that moment of realization I turned to God. I was raised Christian but haven’t been to church in 15 years.

I pleaded with God to help me overcome my addictions, to help me be a better boyfriend, uncle, son, etc. This was the first time I had prayed in a long time and I really wholeheartedly pleaded with God to help me.

Since then, let me tell you my cravings are reduced by 90%. I’ve felt a weight off my shoulders and feel more in control of my body and actions.

Not only that, I feel more at peace. I don’t have suicidal thoughts anymore and my temptation for other bad habits have significantly reduced.

I understand that some of you may be atheists or have your doubts. But turning to God and asking for his help can really make a difference.",15,0

""I don't drink"" is how I responded to a question from the woman cutting my hair the other day and the guy in the grocery store who was asking me if I tried a new beer that hit the market. Both in casual conversation where alcohol came up. And you know what, both of them actually said that it was great. And that they should cut down too.

It makes me feel good to say it. This is new me. I don't drink now. It is who I am now...and on days when I feel down, I remind myself that it is who I am working on become. And no one had given me anything negative about it. And that feels great too. It also makes me feel more accountable. If people know me as someone who doesn't drink going forward, then I need to uphold that standard.

I had to modify it for my doctor the other day though. ""I don't drink....anymore."" So that one modifier still needs to be added to those who knew the old me. But still.

This time, without the cliche “Dry January,” or “Sober October” mindset… it’s so much easier? I think knowing that there is no end in sight and this is just the way my life is now helps me tremendously.

I am sleeping great, work frustrations are a lot more manageable (I am a nurse… you know how shitty it is for us right now 😂), I am better about routine chores and things that need to be done, and I’m genuinely happier. I’m very proud of choosing sobriety from alcohol at 29 years old because it is not looked at as normal. I still have some people in my life saying “oh yeah you’re not drinking right now,” even though I have said I am no longer drinking alcohol indefinitely. Which is okay! People will learn. 

I told my parents that I was sober from alcohol last weekend, and they were very supportive which was nice. I think they were just confused initially because their understanding of “sobriety” is what somebody had to do or their life was going to be ruined, or was well on the way to ruined because of alcohol. This isn’t the case for me- this was a personal choice for general well-being and mental health improvement.

Anyways, I’m super thankful for the sub. It has been my own version of AA, since I’m not quite ready to join that. I may never be 🤷🏼‍♀️.

This is a very encouraging place, and I feel like I'm doing the right thing.

So I had an accident about a week after I turned 21, and it ended up with me being hospitalized for a while and then a long road of recovery in which I'm pretty sure I damn near got addicted to opiods. I got to a point where I took painkillers relatively often, even if it was ""just to help me sleep""

I then realized that now that I was 21, I could easily get some beers. So thats what I did and I basically traded the painkillers for booze. Ever since then, I've drank probably 90% of every night. That was about 5 years ago. I've recognized it as a problem, but its grown to be so bad.

In the past year or two, Its been at least 4 beers all the way up to 10 or 12 a night. It's cost me thousands of dollars, alot of embarassment and I feel like Ive lost alot of respect. In my friend group I basically became the drunk, or at least someone who was always fucked up. It got to the point where I'd be hungover, probably smelling like beer every morning, and it was miserable many days. Eventually it got bad enough to the point where I had heart burn and my esophagus would feel like its burning often. Pretty scary.

I realized that drinking was costing me alot of money, my health by increasing my weight and generally making me extremely unhealthy, and it was overall, a crutch. I decided I no longer want to be that guy.

So a little over a week ago, I stopped drinking. Wasn't too difficult for me although I am still using THC. The problem was, my friends had a big trip planned to go to some hot springs and probably party. My friend who organized it wanted to share some big news (it turned out he flew one of our gaming buddies into our state!) so I really wanted to go, to support my friend, plus it did sound fun. 

Well I went, and beforehand I decided that I would drink, basically as a last hurrah for drinking. That's what I did. We did all of the bullshit drinking stuff, some day drinking, even had a little bit of alcohol at breakfast, and got drunk at night. We even played beer pong (which I think is dumb) and went out to a local bar. I did all the classic drinking things and I realized something

I don't care to drink anymore. Its not worth my health, the money or the effort at all. It is weird how normalized it is, I've seen so much talk about that, and its true. Alcohol and drugs are very normalized and integrated into so many thing for enjoyment. But all of that stuff, even getting drunk, wasnt even that enjoyable at all. All the day drinking stuff was worthless because it barely got me buzzed and didn't add to my experience, and then getting completely drunk was bad because again I made a fool of myself and then woke up feeling like shit and risked ruining a good time.

All in all, I've lost maybe a few pounds, I feel better and look better, although I do have other issues to address. This is the way! I have alot of respect for everyone whos managed to make this decision especially in the face of peer pressure. I surely would have folded under peer pressure on that trip had I chosen not to drink. spending a week sober, and then drinking as a last hurrah with all of my friends made me realized how weird and almost gross drinking kind of is, and I'm glad to be away from it. It's also amazing to see how my bank account isnt being sapped everyday.

I went ahead and tried the post workout drink and instantly thought wow this tasted great (surprisingly!). It tasted very familiar and I immediately asked what the flavor was. To my surprise, they said “cosmic cosmo”! In my mind, I said of course I like it, this is one of my favorite drinks when I was drinking! Ever since I had that sample, I have had the distinct urge to drink. Why?! There is nothing about it that interests me other than the buzz I get in the moment. Why is this so hard?!?

I need to cut back. Way back. I can regulate weed better than alcohol, and I feel I'm less awful on it but it zaps my creativity. It makes me a potato sometimes and it's not just which strain it is. However, I've also learned not to shame myself for letting me numb out my problems. I have nothing to feel guilty about and I will simply adjust. 

Idk, maybe this is the wrong sub since this stop drinking, but if there is anyone else out there feeling like they've traded this drug for another, know you're not alone.

For some reason the bottle has been on the kitchen counter ever since, right beside the Keurig. I've made my coffee everyday this week and the thought didn't cross my mind once to toss some whiskey into my coffee. In fact, it wasn't until today that I even remembered that I used to do this all the time. The thought that I even used to put alcohol into my morning coffee seems really absurd and laughable now, and I'm really thankful for that.

Today is 6 months sober for myself and I feel like it is getting easier. I feel more at home with myself and my thoughts, and I less frequently have the desire to drown out unpleasant feelings with booze. I have to remind myself to not ""overthink"" my feelings sometimes, just let them be and they will pass. 

My biggest takeaway from  all of this is how I felt caught in a trap. A trap that I didn't even see. I drank alcohol maybe 4 times throughout highschool, but once I became an adult it seemed like the thing that everyone did. TV shows, movies, and advertisements all made it seem like drinking is normal, but not drinking is just weird. Looking at this from the other side just makes me angry how the alcohol industry is free to sell a false image of a poisonous drug. *""Drink responsibly""* is the biggest oxymoron in the book. 

It also doesn't help that I have been in the music scene for more than a decade now and when you are surrounded with other alcoholics, it's easy to think you don't have a problem because ""*Oh, you're not as bad as so and so is....""*. But the saddest part for me was realizing how much I tried to use alcohol as a substitute for confidence. I **believed** in the power of alcohol. And because I gave it so much power it just controlled me. I needed it before every show to ""loosen up"" or to have a ""good time"". Serena Ryder has a lyric in one of her songs...""*It's not a party if it happens every day, It's not medicine if it just makes the symptoms go away""*

I didn't realize how much alcohol was holding me back until I took it away.  I'm so thankful for everyone in this sub. Once I started checking in here daily, it gave me so much more purpose to stay sober. I never thought I'd be here today on my 183rd day but I am  so happy and thankful that I am. It gets easier and it gets BETTER!

Was looking forward to deliciously falling asleep in my comfy bed. Fast forward to me wide awake---still sober, yay me!---til 2 am!!! 

I haven't drank since Tuesday night and have big plans for a NON drinking weekend. And last night, I was going through a huge manic attack. I wish I could have those more often. I seem to have 2 types of mania: the common one is the bugs under the skin uncomfortable kind that doesn't result in productivity or happiness. Last night was the rarer good kind, where I was flipping through my phone reading about project management methodologies and signing up for online courses related to my job. Recently got promoted big time, and I wanna show them I'm up to snuff. 

This isn't the first time this has happened in a sobriety attempt. I imagine my GABA receptors are like, ""wtf is going on?"" 

But today I am still feeling happy and not tired, maybe a bit less manic. I AM going to finally make it through a weekend without drinking. I WILL do it. 

Sorry for the word salad, I really needed to get this out. I am sure I'll look back on this mania-fueled post in the future and laugh, but who cares? I'm sober right now, and feeling good about it. I have a plan for this weekend to avoid booze and be productive.

Has anyone else here experienced some kind of weird mania after quitting? I definitely fear this feeling ending, the bubble popping, and don't yet have a plan in place for when that happens.

Someone(s) or something(s) were trying to get me and cause harm as I was navigating some kind of house. The details are irrelevant.

The dream was scary enough that I made myself wake up. And I also had to pee because I had a big cup of peppermint tea and then another big cup of sleepy time tea late last night before turning in for the night.

As I'm taking care of business in the wee hours of the morning (see what I did there?), I'm trying to recount and figure out what was going on in that dream that I'd just awakened from. I knew it had to be my subconscious trying to work something out, but I just couldn't figure it out.

So I hopped back into bed and got all snuggled in and warm again and gave it another quick go in trying to figure out what my dream was about. That last attempt at dream analysis was short-lived, so I let a big smile come over my face as I celebrated the fact that I'd had a dream! I couldn't tell you the last time I had a dream. I've probably had them but couldn't remember them because I've historically gotten myself obliterated and blackout drunk every night.

For years I've worn a watch that tracks my sleep. I've never really paid much attention to my sleep data because sleep data isn't that riveting to me. But I have recently looked at current sleep data versus data from when I was actively drinking. It's gross. When drinking and blacking out, the data shows that I'd go to bed, pass out, and immediately fall into flatline deep sleep with zero to minimal periods of light sleep. Sober sleep data shows healthy and evenly-spaced periods of light sleep, deep sleep, and REM cycles.

Happy Friday, and here's to happy and healthy sleeping, and hopefully some nice dreaming for you all! I will not drink with you today.",3,0

I quit drinking two years on 02-02-2020, a date that’s easy to remember. I basically got called out by my husband who sent me to this Reddit. The next day was a big Super Bowl party and I did not drink then or any time afterwards.

I thought all my issues would just disappear as soon as I quit drinking. However, it wasn’t easy and I continued to suffer sleep problems and still had that hung over feeling in the morning for quite a while. Still also had the brain fog and exhaustion for quite a while. I also thought my weight would drop since I wasn’t consuming a bottle of wine or quantities of vodka or whiskey everyday. (I didn’t lose weight until I went on the keto diet several months later.)

The good things I noticed were not concocting schemes to get the alcohol into the house, get the empties out of the house, and drink it without loved ones noticing that I was doing it. I also could remember conversations which is a big plus. I used to be functioning through a blackout but not remember a single thing. My husband and family are very glad that I stopped drinking.

I haven’t lost any friends or been left out of things due to not drinking. Drinking styles of our friends range from teetotal, to highly functional alcoholic, with several one-and-done, as well as some occasional ones who really overdo it.",72,0

I’m 19 days alcohol free - I started drinking when I was 13-14 and then proceeded to fall into a really toxic love affair with booze for 16 years. It’s that person you call up over the weekend, either a pre-planned event or a booty call, and you binge on the risk and adrenaline of it all. Pure chaos that a lot of us don’t want but need for a semblance of normalcy. 

I’m learning how to break up with the weekend chaos. 

What has got me frustrated recently are the dreams. Oh my god, I haven’t dreamt like this since I was a kid. I’m talking about the scary, nightmarish dreams.

The thing is, I wasn’t a daily drinker. Friday and Saturday night, absolutely. Binges. Hangovers. Recently, impending doom, deep shame, and constant anxiety. Tried to moderate, that sucked the fun out of it.

What I didn’t realize, alcohol shut down my brain, I would give it a break from booze for a short period of time (2-4 days), and then call up Jack Daniels for a quickie. 

I never gave a sufficient amount of time to let my brain and body heal, to dry out. This is where the dreams come in. 

I wish I could say my sleep has improved significantly. It has to a degree. I don’t wake up with a pounding headache or nausea anymore.

I’m hoping with time, the activity of my brain at night with slow with a softness, allowing for less chaotic storylines.

The day after our first date, we both randomly showed up at the same AA meeting which was on an entirely different side of town. And neither of us had talked about drinking or AA the night before. I hadn't been to a meeting in over a year. So me deciding that night to attend one AND see her there was extremely chance. 

From the get-go, our relationship quickly developed. We both had intense feelings. It also quickly became codependent in nature. We spent so much time together that my roommate / landlord became angry with how much my girlfriend stayed over. 

In the first month of our relationship, neither of us drank. I was only sober from the time of our first date, until a month later. She had been sober about three months when we met. Her drinking was a lot more intense than mine, often every day, often liquor. Mine was usually only on the weekends. Only beer. After a month of dating, we started drinking again. Usually only on the weekends, but always to the point of getting drunk. I feel like the drinking caused the intense emotions that were already there to be magnified and accelerated. 

Now, as far as the relationship goes, not specifically focused on the alcohol, I began to notice things that I did not like from the beginning. I noticed specifically that she was extremely self centered and selfish. Without getting into too much detail for the sake of time, during the first month of dating where we were both sober, a lot of things about the relationship appeared to be toxic and unhealthy. After we began drinking, I noticed she would change and almost become a different person while drinking. Once we started drinking together, her behaviors got worse. Once she began doing things with women and men that crossed boundaries and made me feel like shit, I knew in my heart the relationship would not last. 

Leaving is something that would be the first question anyone would ask. I have attempted to leave in the past, but have not been able to make it too long at all. The last month has been the worst yet. We fight and argue every weekend, and have ""broken up"" three times in that time period, only to get back together because neither of us can be apart from the other. 

I know in my heart I want to eventually leave. But when I get very still with myself, with my feelings and thoughts, I know I cannot because I am too attached to her and in love. Some would say trauma bonded. 

How important is giving up drinking in being able to leave a relationship like this? The entire relationship does not involve drinking, therefore I wonder how key that step is in the equation. Her and I would guaranteed be unhealthy still without the drinking, but I know not to the degree we are at currently.",3,0

 Good morning. 
  Our keynote is: “Honesty with compassion”.
 Today’s reading examines the alcoholic’s use of drinking as a crutch. 
 Seeking satisfaction and peace through alcohol is an extreme example of letting one’s comfort depend on something or someone other than God. Such an attempt doesn’t work in any form.
 The Big Book says that, deep down in every man, woman and child, is the idea of God. Expanding on that, I have heard it said that in each one of us there is a God-shaped hole, which can be filled by nothing but God.
 All my frantic efforts to ignore that need and seek refuge and satisfaction elsewhere resulted only in chaos and destruction. 
 Childlike dependence on God is the very foundation of recovery in AA and the spiritual life.
  Once I heard a newly sober AA member recount that his wife had told him that AA is just a crutch. The  fellow told her, “Well, I reckon a crutch ain’t a bad thing if you’re crippled.”
 God has all The Magic.
Seeking it elsewhere is a fool’s errand.

I'm a heavy drinker, 3 plus strong beers/whiskey every evening, occasionally day drinking too (maybe 1 or 2 times a month) for 25 years. It's been fine. I stop after about 3 or 4 almost always, drinking more than that isn't the issue. The issue for me is:

* Its very unhealthy 
* Its making me fat
* I don't want to do it every day.  

I can stop for a day, and I have. This week I've drank 1-3 low abv beers about every other day, with every other day off. The days I drink are fine, the days I don't I feel that thrust that I'm sure you can relate to, I feel anxious, and generally bad but only during the times I typically drink. My plan is to start taking 2 days off then 3 etc. Eventually I would **like** to lose those feelings and to only drink socially, a few times a week or maybe have a beer or 2 at home once a week.  

So my questions are:

* Am I doomed to fail with this plan? 
* Is tapering every other day just extending my suffering?
* How long do you think I'm going to feel this way?
* Is cutting back but not completely abstaining likely to work?

This has probably been asked and answered a thousand times here but I looked and didn't see. I think I already know what you are going to say. Thank you to anyone who takes the time to offer advice.

Edit: Thank you all for your thoughtful answers. Seems like the consensus is that I should just stop. That's what I was expecting. I won't argue with you, you're probably (definitely?) right. It probably goes without saying that I don't want to stop, I just want to be healthy. I enjoy drinking and hanging out with friends and family for a drink has literally been how I've socialized for all of my adult life. On the other hand, I want to live a long and healthy life and I don't want to be chained to - anything, especially not a bottle. 

It's so weird, as I consider stopping and never turning back, my eyes are welling up. I guess I'm afraid? Am I morning the death of my drinking self? WTF. I didn't ask for advice with the intent to ignore it. Ugh I guess I have to think now.",129,0

So, I'm sober for more than eight months now, which I feel like the best thing to have happened to me since a long time. I've been through a lot of things in my life that brought me to a place where I consumed cocaine everyday to basically numb the pain with it and at the same time I did that also with alcohol and cigarettes because the three of them seem to trigger each other. 

I've been consuming different drugs for about 15 years, but never to the point of daily consumption, which eventually was the case with coke, alcohol and cigarettes. I started in the morning, chugged down a huge glass of anything, then took much coke, smoked a cig etc etc until 3 or 4 at night. Everyday I did that.

And I became so miserable more and more. I destroyed myself while trying to numb the pain in the very moment, but I kept making myself worse and worse until I just couldn't do it anymore and was close to suicide.

So, I went to a clinic and just took time off of everything for myself, so I could focus again. Now I'm away from all of this shit for more than eight months now and there's a wedding and bachelor's party of a really important person in my life coming up. 

And that weakens me so much, because I feel like there is a societal pressure on me to drink something. I'm done with coke for good, but I feel like everybody is expecting me to drink something on that wedding and bachelor's party.

Did you guys experience something like that and how do you deal with it?

tl/dr: Stopped drinking, smoking and doing coke eight months ago and now there's a wedding coming up which I don't know how to deal with.

I didnt want to do the rehab clinic, for starters it was about a 5 hour journey away from where i live, i would be alone, without family in an alien place. I begged them to let me do the home detox i had all the support in place. Put that into perspective, an alcohlic begging for a detox programme only to be told it was too risky to do at home.

When I’m not drinking, I genuinely have no cravings for alcohol.  I see people post about having to avoid to alcohol aisle at the grocery store or pour away all the booze in their house or find themselves driving to the liquor store during a hard week and forcing themselves to turn around, etc.

I don’t.  We have a nice liquor bar that is stocked, I’ll buy my husband bottles of wine that sit in the fridge, and I’m okay.  I don’t have any cravings, I don’t have to resist the urge to drink, etc.  My husband has been going through a bottle of Pinot Grigio over the past few days (my personal drink of choice) and I’ve never had to stop myself from going after it.

My brain works differently when I drink, though.  THAT is where the problem begins.  When I’m out with friends and decide it would be fine to have one cocktail to be social or if I decide that one glass of red wine would be fine with a nice steak dinner.  Why do I do that, when I know how I’ll react, if I’m not having any strong cravings?  That I don’t know.  For some reason, after weeks of not wanting a drink, I’ll think I’m cured somehow and this time it’ll be okay.

And then I’m not.

Because even though sober me didn’t want any, one-glass-of-wine me suddenly feels pleasantly chill and would like another.  And another.  And then I go on a multiple day bender that results in me having to go through a few days of nausea and anxiety and insomnia all over again.

It happened in January again, so I’m back to day nine once more.  Feeling no desire to drink but dreading the next time the cocky me decides she’s okay again.

I'm proud and happy being the sober guy, I have no interest at this time to ever go back to the bottle or being a slave to the quick fix alcohol would provide

1.) Getting sober is all about your surroundings, if you're lucky enough to have the support of a non-drinker and/or people to live life with that remind you you can live just fine without alcohol - is a lot different than trying to stay sober /busy alone, or worse ina traumatic, energy sucking relationship. Relationship troubles are huge relapse catalyst (at least for me)

2.) I drank 1 bottle - a liter of Jameson around the clock, 24/7, 365 days a year for years on end....there is hope and although you wouldn't have known it, no one and I mean no one drank as much, or the way that I did. bet. Just keep moving forward its the emotional sobriety from alcohol that's the turning point, that you have to get to, typically around 90 days or so - sobriety starts becoming the only way of life 

3.)It's true, my worst day sober is 110% better than my best day drinking. That life of drinking is nothing but a time machine, time wasted, so much time and energy wasted on staying drunk - eventually you go to a bar and thank the lord you're no longer that guy sitting up at the bar telling everyone how great life is.....life just becomes important again, life/how you spend your time becomes more precious, time with friends and family becomes more valuable - when your sober, life is still hard but when viewed through a completely different lens it becomes a beautiful disaster.

I drank WAY too much. Black out drunk. Pretty sure I fell down some stairs... A co-worker of mine who had expressed interest in me before was at the party. I asked the girl I was closest with (the reason I was at the party in the first place) to just keep an eye on me to make sure nothing stupid happens. I know how I can get when I am drunk... Well. I ended up waking up to him... taking advantage of the situation. This is something I wouldn't have done sober. This is something that I DIDNT want to happen. But I know that when I hit a certain point in my drinking, I get super flirty and pretty much turn into a ho so I can almost guarantee I was portraying that I wanted it to happen. But I didn't. Not really. So that was the last time I drank.

I didn't want to ruin his life by claiming he raped me. Like I said, I am willing to bet that I was all over him. He was drunk. I was drunk. Shit happened. But I decided that was the last time I was going to drink.

Today, he called me in my office after a brief exchange about work related things as I was walking in to work. And he asked me if I wanted to hang out sometime. And honestly... it just made me so grateful for my sobriety. I am dating someone. And I am happier than I have ever been.

I hope people are having a successful start to the year. I am coming up on my 1 year anniversary, and thought I'd share something.

One of the toughest things for me to realize through this sobriety has been that maybe some of my so-called ""friends"" aren't as friendly as I thought. Almost all of my good friends have been supportive of my endeavors. There's been a couple, however, who haven't been so supportive. 

At first I just took their negativity as the typical peer pressure stuff. But after months went on they just kept insulting me, tearing me down, and bringing a lot of negativity to my life. One of them even kicked me in the head and tried to choke me while I was sober cabbing him after a wedding. And when I said how furious I was about that, I got laughed at.

So rather than letting these people affect me in such a negative way, I've just cut them out of my life for now. It was hard to admit that maybe those friends didn't care about me as much as I thought. But that's their problem. I have plenty of friends who are proud of me, and keep pushing me to continue bettering myself. I don't need to waste my time being insulted by people. The people who have insulted me most have some issues with alcohol themselves, so some of it is them projecting their own frustrations in themselves I feel like...But that's no excuse, and I don't need that BS in my life.

If you've got people in your life that aren't supportive of your choice, or try to peer pressure you into drinking, they aren't a real friend. You don't need to make it a big deal and cause drama, but maybe just take space from those people. Surround yourself with positive people and you'll have much more success in all areas of life. Being codependent is one of my issues I've needed to face in my sobriety. And I'm thankful that I'm finally accepting that I don't have to be everyone's friend.",17,0

I just felt awful and like I couldn’t do anything but wallow and get another drink, knowing I would just feel even worse the next day.
I reached a tipping point where I realised I couldn’t keep doing this, so I quit, got rid of all my alcohol and gave anything I had left to a close friend as a way to tell them I’m done, and I’m not drinking again.

Stopping drinking helped so much, everything became clearer and easier. My problems weren’t solved but I was actually making progress on them and feeling better with everyday without booze.

I did have a couple of falters, once in the pandemic I thought it would be harmless to have a beer in the garden with my dad on a hot day. Big mistake, I regretted it instantly and only drank the one, but I still felt awful the next day. That confirmed for me that not drinking was not only the right choice, but the best one I’ve made for a long time.

The second time I failed was Christmas last year, my family are all fairly big drinkers and so I’ve kinda grown up with drinking just being part of Christmas, so it didn’t feel right not having at least a glass of champagne with them.
I had a couple of mouthfuls but felt awful the whole time, but I stopped there and haven’t drunk anything since.

So here I am 400 days later, feeling so much better because of it. My biggest problem is the amount of people who just seem to be unable to accept that I don’t drink. The constant questions of why and “we’ll just one won’t hurt” or “I’ll pay for you” is tiring and I can’t believe how much some people miss the point. I don’t think I was ever an alcoholic, but I think I was on the way there for sure, and I can’t help but think what if I was an alcoholic and those people were still asking me those questions.

I would wake up at this time, around 2 am, in a complete panic with a hangover and cramps-and would be puking from both. It takes a week out of my life, and maybe even more time to recover from the mini bender. It is a terrible cycle that started during the pandemic and I couldn't shake it.

Tonight I woke up with horrible cramps and realized... I am not drunk, I am not in the middle of a panic attack, I am not in white claw hell, waiting for the grocery store to open at 7am. I am not pouring another glass of wine from the bottle hidden under the bathroom sink and begging it to take the world away- just for one more hour.

It's so crazy to be in a place where you don't struggle with drinking every day anymore, but once I get one little dose in my mouth--I am gone for days. I would feel ""fine"" and then end up in this hell hole bender every few weeks...shocked every time. I tried meetings again, but the rooms just don't do the same thing they used to for me.

Thank you to this space and all of you here. I had a feeling this would finally be the place that might work for me. I have a long way to go- but I also have the previous experience of long bouts of sobriety- I know I can do this.

I am so pumped for a 2022 with no middle of the night- Hail Mary- hair of the dog- drink away the hangover-sitting in the bath shaking BULLSHIT that comes with alcohol.

Reading all of your wonderful posts must have carried me through- because that didn't happen this month.

Today i woke up remembering that one person that changed my life, more than anything else;

So..I knew i had a problem with alcohol, i knew for two years, tried to stop multiple times without success, had an accident thant sent me into coma, and when i came out of the hospital..I kept drinking (actually from the very moment i was reanimated, i wanted only one thing: get out of that place and go back to my place to buy wine) 

 Two weeks later, after a long binge drink that left me vomiting everywhere, I woke up with these all so familiar feelings of anguish and shame; when i looked at my phone i realised i sent dozens of text messages to many people, and my brother called me to ask me if I was ok, because, ""you know, yesterday you told me your life was wasted and you wanted to die..""

I was really down, but i always maintained an exterior persona, i always managed to pretend, hell, i was a master in pretending! Now all this was gone. 

This late morning i decided to call an addictologist; for the first time. I decided to seek help. Oh, i thought of it before, but I always told myself, ""no, you don't need help, you can do it by yourself, you're strong""; this time i called..

It rang, nobody answered..so be it, i thought, at least i tried. it was enough for my fucked up mind to justify drinking again that very same day. That's decided, I'll wait one or two hours until i can walk again then I'll go to the shop and fuck it! I'll buy booze

One hour later the phone rang.

*Hello, it's the addictology service from the hospital, you called us?*

huh....yeah...

*And you weren't going to call back, right?*

...

*HAH! see?? I'm already in your mind, reading your thoughts, ha ha ha!*""







These words. This mocking yet sweet tone of voice. This..made me laugh and cry at the same time. We spent two hours talking, and that was it. It was like from this very exchange, my brain validated the decision to stop drinking. Just because of that one person, that one interaction. 

To this day I'm still full of gratitude for this person, and I just wanted to share this because you never know how your words can impact others, be it the right time and the right place.. 

Have a great day, all, and let's not drink together today:)",17,0

My early 20s weren’t too bad, but the beginning of the pandemic became the beginning of my heavy drinking. A lot of it was getting into a horrible relationship with someone who drank much more than I did previously. Our entire relationship was drinking and fighting.  He was awful for me and to me but it’s finally over, I blocked him on every platform. The last time I drank was January26th, and I’m determined to stay away from booze completely at least for a good while. I know I’m capable of having a few drinks occasionally, but at this point I’m too depressed and I need a good long break. I’m also a smoker of 11 years and I always told myself I’d quit before I turn 30. I know I will give in to a cigarette if I have enough drinks, so that’s another big motivation for me. I’ve ordered Alan Carr’s book to quit smoking, but I’m going to give myself a few weeks away from booze before tackling the next addiction. 
Alcohol combined with the toxic relationship has severely damaged my family relationships and friendships. Not answering phone calls or hanging out for weeks because it was obvious I was hungover and depressed. It’s also affected any motivation I had to start a career and do the physical things I used to do like hiking and biking. It’s honestly made me a boring person with no hobbies.

Called my alcohol and drugs counselor and she had to tell me that the only way right now was to go and get some alcohol and taper off, as I have no diazepam at home and can't get into any kind of medical detox at the moment.

Like a lot of folks I got started with alcohol in my late teens as I was headed into college.  I was directionless in my youth and alcohol seemed to present me with some shitty north star to follow in pursuit of happiness. It slowly began to play a large role in my life and continued to do so for the next 14+ years.

I guess booze solved a lot of my short term problems; Need friends? Find some drinking buddies! Need to figure out what to do with your life ? Get drunk and deal with that later! Need a personality? Drink craft beer to get drunk! Need to combat social anxiety? Have 5 drinks to calm those nerves!

Overtime it became clear; Those friendships had no depth. There is no delaying linear time. That's not how personalities work. That social anxiety will last until you find real ways to manage it.

I  barely managed my way through college but in the end I gained so little out of it. I never pursued what I really wanted to do, never attempted to even find what possibilities there were. Never sought out interesting people or did anything other than the bare minimum. What a waste of an opportunity.

It's probably been around  8 years of attempting to get alcohol out of my life.  I have known that it has been a problem for quite sometime. I would stop for a bit but it would slowly creep back into my life one way or another. I would resume my same walk to the liquor store to buy the same bottles, to sit on the same couch, to play the same video games, or watch the same TV over and over and over.

It's all just so boring. I could have been doing so much more. The world it so big and I chose to just live in my box and drink. FOR YEARS! I could have learned skills! I could have met friends! I could have learned more! I could have added just something of value!

Anyways after moving for a job I haven't had a drink in about 3 months and I have no desire to start again. I can't imagine being even older, fatter, and more boring than I already am.",51,0

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It's been his hobby for my wife's entire life. None of his kids drink, so once I came into the picture he was happy to have a drinking buddy. Only, my drinking hobby only /really/ started once I started drinking with him (weekends). 

In college and after I swore off alcohol as being an inferior intoxicant to weed. I still feel weed is way healthier physically and much more fun but the mental distress weed gave me was still terrible enough to quit. I was never really into drinking, and before this I was able to (finally!) quit smoking. 

Now I live in a country where weed is super illegal. I'd be scared if it was legal, but that's another story. I'd so much prefer to smoke to relieve my stress at the end of the day. The only thing available is alcohol, and here I am drinking ~6 drinks each Friday/Saturday night with the FIL. I enjoy it until the next day.

I know it's amateur numbers but I hate the effects. I hate how difficult it makes it to be healthy and productive. I hate my weekends flying by. Sometimes I even buy my own and drink a couple during the week. I don't feel like I have a problem, but I want to stop before I do, and I want to be living my best life.

I even recently started a fitness routine i was very happy about but the last two week nights I've drank my tequila and in the mornings felt too tired to do it. That's what's spurred my posting this.

The crux of the issue is this: I think I can stop buying drinks for myself, but I feel if I completely stopped drinking with my FIL on the weekends it'd be some kind of affront to him and his lifestyle.

I hate feeling guilty for him buying us booze all the time, so I even feel forced to contribute our money to our habit, even when I don't feel like drinking. 

My options: 
1) Don't buy for myself, moderate, and leave the booze with him.
2) Tell him no more for me.

I'm thinking 1) because I really feel I can just have a couple and be fine.

I wish I could just stop drinking entirely but I want to maintain my good relationship with my FIL.",1,0

Since reducing my drinking, I was able to get healthier and reduce my tolerance. In the past, I used to be in a constant state of being drunk and hungover, and both my body and mind saw it as normal. Now that I am healthier, I REALLY 'feel' the effects of drinking. It takes less alcohol to get me drunk, The hangovers are 100x worse and the aftereffects last 2-3 days!

My problem is that I like to drink in the evening/night and also have a drink with dinner. I find that alcohol compliments food very well. I want to cut this habit completely out. What are some alternatives? 

Yes, alternatives. I know some people aren't going to agree with that part but I would rather do something else than deal with a hangover at work because I was an idiot the night before.",3,0

Forced to tap into it, a huge part of me feels relieved to have arrived at the committed and stubborn desire to be sober without any illness or holiday or situation forcing me to. Simply, I woke up last Sunday, reflecting on the chaos at my feet and said, “enough.” Since then I have committed every day this week to my mental health and sobriety. I’m six days sober. A spring chicken. But I’m doing it. 

I (30F) follow a lot of sober women on social media who often lightheartedly joke about the gut wrenching emotions that come with early sobriety and I guess I’m just here, checking in with those with more sober days than me, what might await me and how to best deal with these outbursts of emotion? I think there’s a lot bottled up in there after six years of serious drug and alcohol abuse.

I was expecting a crazy weight loss and insightful thoughts and a new lease on life to share with you all. Instead of that post, here is this one. 

I haven’t weighed myself in weeks. I don’t think I’ve lost or gained any weight. My workouts have gotten astronomically better, though. I can run a lot further, lift a lot heavier, and I smashed several PRs this month so that is cool. I’m also pounding ice cream like it’s going out of style and I think the good people working at my favorite burger place are starting to recognize me.

Some days I feel really good mentally and other days I feel terrible. I’m in medical school and I recently took on a role with a lot more clinical exposure. I’m seeing a lot of incredibly hard things, which I know is what I signed up for, but it’s still hard. I got a leadership position at a clinic that serves refugees and with the recent Afghanistan crisis it’s just heartbreaking. I end up turning away upwards of 15 refugees a night because we just don’t have space. It weighs on me and I feel this awful sense of impotency in the face of it.

On the other hand, I got to see my first delivery recently. It was a Saturday and I was on my way to shadow in the NICU after brunch with friends. Because I don’t drink, I didn’t think twice about doing brunch and heading to the hospital on the same day. It was so beautiful that I shed a couple tears (hidden behind crazy amounts of PPE). Baby and mom were both fine and I’m so glad I got to be a part of that. 

I thought the world would become sunnier without alcohol, and in some ways, it is. In other ways, it’s the same place it was before. My body is still an imperfect human body. My mind is still a slightly hectic buzz of alternating anxiety and depression. The world is still simultaneously fucked up and beautiful. Alcohol is not the root of every problem in my life, there is still more work to be done. There’s my very honest month-in report. Thanks for reading if you did. :)",249,0

I (22F) just joined this subreddit a few days ago. I decided to join dry January on a whim. 

I did it mostly to support my mom and prove to her she could do it (even if she has resorted to just drinking on the weekends rather than every day, which is still a HUGE improvement and I am proud of her. 

I want to address the fact I still had/have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. I was drinking in excess every night, especially from July to December. 

It was difficult the first few days and first  couple of weekends but I successfully did the month! 

I actually just broke it last night, since my mom wanted to start Jan. 2nd before she went back to work. 

I just want to come on and say I had a lot of anxiety and guilt coming up to deciding to drink last night. 

It was a mistake. And I am planning on starting anew tomorrow for a sober February, and maybe even longer after that. 

Finding this subreddit has given me the courage and community to recognize my habits and hopefully start a sober life.

Working on feeling compassion for myself. Right now feeling a little disgusted and resentful that this is who I become when I drink.,"“I spend almost every weekend in bed longer than I want to be because I just always get headaches and feel sick, exhausted, and anxious on the weekends. That’s just what happens, I don’t know why. And during the week, waking up feeling groggy, dull, and like I have raw grits under my eyelids is because I have to go to work. That’s just what happens, I don’t know why. 

My friends and I really like breweries. I think they do other things with each other, but mostly I hang out with them at breweries or their house for a night of drinks and a movie. I think they go hiking, but I don’t go. Part of me wants to, but part of me worries about how I’d feel with all that love around and nothing to drink so I could feel it too. I’d have a hard time sleeping, but that would be because the ground was hard and I always get really anxious at night. That’s just what happens, I don’t know why.

 I can only relax in the evenings and weekends. I do not experience one moment of relaxation outside of that. I am constantly on alert. I haven’t been given permission to relax anywhere outside of these times because that would be excessive. But as soon as the evening starts, wherever I am, im relaxing with a drink in my hand. If I had a drink in my hand during the day then I wouldn’t be relaxing because I wouldn’t know when I could get my next one. I wouldn’t be able to maintain my elevated mood with only one drink and would inevitably become somewhat dreary. So it’s not a matter of drinking that relaxes me, it’s just the time of day. That’s just what happens, I don’t know why. 

And I only drink maybe two or three IPAs a night. Sometimes if I have leftover wine, which is rare because I’m so good at knowing exactly what type of wine I like to drink in bottles in one sitting, I’ll drink that too. Oh and if I start to feel bad for some reason, like feeling sad about going to the bathroom alone, maybe a few swigs of vodka out of the bottle. And a few more before bed. And then if I stay in bed too long playing on my phone maybe one more. During the week. Well, during Monday through Thursday, at least. On the weekends I start drinking between 1800-2000. And it continues  till probably 0200 or later (earlier at this point). That’s probably only about 7 drinks total. Who uses standard drink portion anyway? Come on. I feel like shit the next morning because I stayed up so late. That’s just what happens, I don’t know why.”

What are my motivations now? Where do I want to be? It's been tricky to work this out, and to get a sense of direction, because so much of my life has been defined and directed by alcohol for so long. It's certainly harder getting myself excited or care about some things these days - it requires sustained effort.

I drank heavily for 12+ years, and mostly round the clock in the last 2 years before I got sober. So I guess it's still going to take time for my dopamine reward system to fix itself - and I have to factor that in. I used alcohol to reward myself for anything and everything - good days, bad days, a job well done, a complete failure, an unexpected change, boredom - it got me from A to B daily.

It's strange that this has become more of an issue the longer i've been sober, but I guess it's a matter of learning to live in a sustainable way, and letting my brain rewire. Either way, things are FAR better than they were while I was drinking, and I have my whole life ahead of me to live up to my potential. That's for damn sure.

I was feeling nervous about this because I've only just got to know them. Also, as is the case with quitting alcohol, I'm going through a severe bout of acne. One of the ladies picked me up and we would pick up the other lady.

As the title suggests, we got involved in an accident. My new coffee friend was turning left when the other car continued straight on (my friend admitted to being at fault.)

The car hit us on my (passenger) side. I've come out of this with a twinge in my back and a bit of pain in my hand. My friend who was driving got bruising from the seatbelt, scratches, and hurt her knees. But we came out of it alive and conscious and so did the other driver. 

Whilst waiting to be seen by the doctors we began really getting to know each other. No point with small talk now. I told her about my drinking, she told me about her depression. I helped her undress. Just girly things.

We got dismissed and her friend picked us up. I was a little tense during the ride as we'd been in a car accident, do that's natural, but we still managed to have a laugh.

Anyway long story short, what would this accident have been like if I didn't decide to stop drinking a week ago? I wouldn't have been doing ten minutes of stretching in the morning, so would my back be worse? Maybe I would've been hungover from the night before, and close to fainting from low blood sugar, or nauseous, whilst riding in the ambulance to the hospital. I wouldn't have packed my water bottle or an apple, or hand sanitizer, or masks, all of which came in handy whilst waiting in hospital.

I would've felt guilty and ashamed seeing the other patients hooked up to machines, knowing the damage I'd done to my own body intentionally. And I wouldn't have been able to talk about my problem with alcohol and get vulnerable with this person. I would've been anxious and guilty and tired with the friend who picked us up.

I also thought that the expected thing for someone to do would be to relapse after this, because trauma. But I'm sitting here with a cup of green tea. Still probably running on adrenaline, but damn. What if.",20,1

All the while I was certain I'd be just *so* bored if I couldn’t drink and ended up feeling bored all the damn time drinking or not. Turns out it was the drinking that made me bored…and really boring.

If one spends all their time waiting for and searching out the next drink, how can they really learn and grow and build something with this life? How can they truly know themselves?

I am a blackout drinker, and on nye i was fucking trashed, and acted like a complete asshole. I was yelling, picking fights, and found myself extremely enraged that she would not talk to me that night. she told me the next day how I acted and that she wanted some time. I summoned the ass kicking machine, filled with guilt, disgust, depression, and sorrow. Instead of dealing with it rationally as in “new year, new me!” I drank at least 12-14 beers a day for the next 17 days. I would wake up on my floor not remembering a damn thing other than my head spinning so aggressively I felt more comfortable on the floor. I would find these videos on my phone where I would cry and drink and drink, telling myself how i was plotting my suicide. 
Than, it got the point where i had the “revelation” that none of this was my fault it was all hers, and that she couldn’t accept the fact that i was just drunk that night and not my usual self. I found myself calling her, leaving nasty texts, and being left on read for 5-6 days and i couldn’t help but point my finger at her, as if she was the problem.
The day before my real recognition, i drank 10-12 beers, and drove all around metro for absolutely no reason. tall boy on deck, let’s just say i made probably the poorest decisions of a lifetime. it was beyond a miracle that i made it home alive, or not in a jail cell. I woke up on the floor again so regretful and found everything just piling on. 
the day of; I was in my car in a parking lot after class and without even realizing it, over the course of an hour there was 7 empties on my passenger floor, and there i was yelling at her again on the phone. I found myself stumped in the argument, like that i was blindly enraged. She hung up and I sat, looked at the 7 beers on my floor, and said what in the absolute flying fuck am I doing. I cried and cried and explained to myself exactly how drinking was throwing everything I had right in the garbage. I drank my last beer, and made the devestating confession to my alcoholic dad (who is 8 months sober today) and told him i needed to move back home so I could work through this the best I could.
The next day after work i threw away every single beer I had, chopped up my fake ID, grabbed my essentials from my apartment and headed home.
the first week was a living hell; i still found myself blaming her, and was having the worst urges ever to drink. 
Turning away my anti-depressants thinking “I got this”, i found myself in the worst depression and last friday, i went to a store, was not carded, and bought a 24 rack of beer. I headed back to my apartment with it, had beer in hand, and i finally woke up. I said No, and threw it right in the dumpster.
i confessed to my dad and at a meeting what I had done, feeling horrible about it and still justifying a drink the next day.
I don’t post this in alcoholics anonymous because to them this would be cheating, but i started taking my anti-depressants, and I’m so seeing the light now.
My confidence is back, i’m overcoming my anxiety, and my depression.
sorry, i know this is very long. but yesterday I finally texted her and sincerely apologized, recognizing all of my faults. my fuck is she a saint. she completely understood and knows deep down the good inside of me. her faith in me doesn’t determine, but definitely helps with my dedication of never going back to that drink. after 2 years of drinking, i am 16 days dry and do not intend on ever going back.
to those that find themselves struggling, don’t be ashamed to tell your doctor how you are doing, for they can help you. the lack of dopamine can surely lead your mind in the wrong direction, throwing your bottom right out the window, and justifying a drink in every way possible.

I feel sometimes that I have no one to discuss sobriety with, so I’m grateful to this amazing sub for the opportunity to offload a little bit!

At over 500 days sober, I can confirm that life is, indeed, infinitely better without alcohol. 

I was binge drinking by the end of my relationship with the bottle. I wasn't drinking every day. Far from it, in fact - there were times when I could go days, even weeks without alcohol. Trouble was, when I did take a sip, my thoughts quickly moved beyond the beverage in my hand to the next one, and the one after that, and so on. One drink generally led to two. Two would lead to three. And by three I was scheming how to get to numbers five and six. By six, all bets were off and I could drink with increasing speed until black out.

Hangovers were, without a shred of exaggeration, horrifying and traumatic. Even when I could piece together the previous night, I would still perform twisted mental gymnastics to convince myself that I had done something terrible. When I had actually been involved in some sort of scrape or behaved in a shitty way - ranging from pointless arguments with friends/loved ones to being arrested for drukenly climbing to the roof of an apartment block - the shame was almost unbearable. Alcohol took me to some dark, confusing, frightening places that I don't care to visit again.

In sobriety I've identified two significant issues as being linked to my issues with alcohol - the first is a toxic relationship where I was the victim of sustained but generally low key domestic abuse, and a traumatic incident that occured to me in my late teens which, funnily enough, was only able to take place because I had consumed an insane amount of alcohol. It's only now, with a clear head, that I'm able to process these events. Perhaps I'll share more about these at some point in this sub. However I am dealing with these resentments, difficult as they are, for the first time. 

I now have a loving family, a steady job, friends and interests outside of work - I cannot express how grateful I am for these. Some people have expressed surprise at my sobriety - they clearly didn't realise the profound impact drink was having on me. But they didn't see the days (and weeks) lost to hangovers and the associated mental health decline. I worked hard to mask the suffocating darkness that followed excess drinking. I don't make a big deal of being sober around others, but I am always honest with them - my life is better without alcohol and I have never regretted not having a drink.

If anyone is reading this who can relate, but who is still struggling to get sober, please know that pursuing a life without alcohol is attainable and it is 100% worth it. I've listed a few tools below that have helped me on my journey:

- Alan Carr's No More Hangovers/Easy Way to Control Alcohol : easy to read, but full of insightful, useful tips.
-Play the tape forward!
-Running regularly. I am physically and menatlly able to cover distances that were unimaginable when I was drinking. 
-Prayer. I believe in the power of prayer. For those of you who aren't convinced, I suggest you give it a try. What have you got to lose? The Examen, a Jesuit spiritual exercise, is a remarkable tool in being present and being grateful for the blessings that life offers.

Thanks again to all the wonderful people on this sub.

It's really not that hard for me since I'm a binge drinker, but I have had my ""chronic"" alcoholic moments in the past...

Honestly, I don't miss it. I love the support from this community and I learn more and more every day. I can see myself never drinking again. Of course, I feel so much better, especially stopping the BS weekend warrior crap I was doing. Every single hour of free time was basically me downing a beer. So glad I'm not doing that anymore. And frankly, I don't plan on it. Anyway, the reason I'm posting is....

Is it just me or are people on popular TV shows chugging booze like there's no tomorrow? Every single show I watch, there's someone holding a beer, a wine, a whiskey. I don't think there's a single scene of any popular adult TV show without booze. I'm not an abolitionist, by any means, but it's simply outrageous. Obviously, I find a lot of comparisons between everyone smoking on tv in the 70s/80s/90s. 

Now people don't really smoke on TV. But people still smoke. I don't think alcohol is ever going to go away. Which is fine, I don't care. But what's with the constant binge drinking? It's grotesque and annoying. And I'm not mad because it makes me have cravings - I do not. (Work stress makes me have cravings.) I just find it unsettling that Hollywood's going along with it and we're going along with ""Big Booze"" even though we've condemned ""Big Tobacco"".",12,0

My wife is a strong person I can lean on when i need it, and we're rediscovering how much we enjoy each others company. I can trust myself to not go out and buy liquor after she goes to bed. 

Maybe at some point in the future I can reintroduce alcohol back in my life where it takes a back seat to things instead of being the main attraction. I'm very much not ready to even think about doing that so I'll cross that bridge when and ***IF*** I ever get there.

That I'm an out of control drunk and was getting worse.

I'm posting this for my own journal and for any clarity it may bring. And of course, for the wisdom and experience that's here in ready supply on this sub.

I grew up in chaos. My dad was a secret drunk that got to be a sloppy drunk then he got to be a derelict.. He died of throat cancer from smoking and drinking all of his life. My mom drank too much as well. I started drinking as a teen. I got married young to a great guy had two beautiful kids and then divorced him because I don't think I knew how to live with peace and balance. That's really sick

I went through the rigmarole of single mom, partying, going to school, raising kids, basically surrounding myself with more chaos. That all hit a Flashpoint in the recession. I lost my job, my house, had to move in with my daughter, all the things. It was a bad relationship betrayal thrown in for good measure. It wasn't because of drinking, I lost my job, but that's when the drinking started in earnest . It was a hobby before, I made it my vocation, haha.

Throw in another unbalanced relationship that sucked me into chaos. Then I found a good job, stable job. I was able to buy another home. It was close to my son and daughter-in-law and grandkids. And I sat in my house and drank for 7 years.

For no real reason, I finally woke up. I found another job. I'm very good at it, I really like it. And I realize my drinking was out of control. I had a couple of false starts, then this last three weeks has been pretty consistent with me not drinking.

But I miss drinking, I miss how I filled my time with lots of nothing. You guys know what I mean. There isn't anything that's filled the void yet. But I realize I need to live in peace for a while and create space for something good to come.

So I hang out here, read your wisdom, offer support of I can. I'm doing other good things in my life like counseling, I'm out walking. I wonder what the next phase will be. I just have to do it without the chaos.

I don't order books regarding ALL topics, but I do order a good chunk of nonfiction for adults. Not too long ago, I noticed that the sobriety/recovery section in my library system was... lacking. The resources we had around recovery and substance abuse were inadequate and severely out of date. While books about sobriety are not ""technically"" in my section, the general rule for librarians at my library is that if you see a book that you think the public would benefit from - BUY IT. So I purchased a few copies of  ""Not drinking tonight : a guide to creating a sober life you love"" for a few library branches in my system. It's a new book by Amanda White. Someone just came in asking for the book, and I'm smiling from ear to ear.  I'm so happy someone wants to read it. 


If you're looking for a sobriety book, and you're a bit short on cash, go to your local library and ask for an interlibrary loan (ILL) requesting a specific title. Your local library will get the book for you. Obviously, support the author and buy the book if you have the means, but if your budget is tight, public libraries = your taxpayer dollars at work.",15,0

'Last night, I dreamed that I'd been drinking
Same dream I have 'bout twice a week
I had one glass of wine
I woke up feeling fine
And that's how I knew it was a dream'

I hit a month! Things are better, I think? But like the song says, it's easier but still not easy.

I'm still counting gas stations, liquor stores, and grocery stores as I drive by.

I found a probably 6 month old beer rolling around in my trunk and had a very serious moment of introspection. Ultimately decided that it would taste awful and threw it away. 

I havent needed the Naltrexone as much. The full 'now now NOW' cravings are more rare, which is nice. 

Therapy is going well. I've made progress towards understanding the the emotions I was running away from. 

I've stopped journaling, it got kind of repetitive and compain-y and felt really self indulgent. 

I've had more time and attention to give my kids and they're eating it up. 

My wife and I are fighting so much less. I am more patient and less angry.  

I am doing all the right things. 

BUT BUT BUT

This new life is too fucking wholesome. I'm so positive! I like this new person but holy hell am I so *square*!

The instinct to just say fuck it and throw a Molotov cocktail into everything is really, really strong. It's more of a 'call of the void', intrusive thought but I've regularly imagined every step on my way to the gas station to get a 12 pack. 

My wife quit drinking too, and it's like living with a roommate with whom I also have children. To put it bluntly, my initial fear that drunk sex is the only sex is becoming increasingly true. 

I'm not sure what I'm trying to say here. Maybe I'm just looking for a little validation. Or, just sending a little postcard into the void.

I celebrated 5 years in sobriety on Tuesday and hesitated to post because I wasn’t quite sure what to say?  I didn’t want to paint an artificial picture of how far I’ve come, or to be preachy around what it takes to get here.  But in times like this, I try to remind myself to just speak my truth and hope that someone will hear what they need today.

So here are the things I have learned in my journey this far:

-I am never alone.  My guilt, shame, and alcohol-induced anxiety/depression made me think this, but I could not have been more wrong.  If you are here, reading this, you will never be alone again.  And so many people want to help you!!!

-continue to question myself by asking, “What if I’m wrong?”  What if the awful things I believe about myself are wrong?  What if I can do this?  What if other people do believe in me?  

-try everything!  Treatment centers. Sober houses.  AA.  Doing the 12 steps.  Yoga. Meditation. Therapy. Self-help books.  Asking for help.  Being vulnerable.  Being accountable.  I have tried all of these things because my way wasn’t working.  My persistent willingness helped me get here because *I was wrong* and I couldn’t do it on my own.

-stay curious.  Because I tried everything, I slowly discovered the root of my drinking.  And it’s understanding the WHY that keeps me sober.  I am still learning new things about my own psychology every day and the more I learn, the more grace I have for myself and for everyone else.

These are my favorite and most important discoveries that have literally changed the way I view the world.  I have been to hell and back- a story for another time- and I am today a grateful alcoholic that, despite my own best efforts, have been given a second chance to live my life with a perspective I would never have had otherwise.

I'm a 30 year old master's student of engineering. I got 2 DUI's (was only charged with one) in my early 20's. I spent most of my 20's paying off debts and working in every type of job from dishwasher, to construction, landscaping, restaurants, hospitality, IT, etc. 

I was always a binge drinker + frequent cannabis user. I could go fairly long stretches without alcohol so even with my DUI's, I convinced my naive self that I didn't really have a problem, I was just unlucky (cue the eye roll)

I received my BA in December 2019. I luckily found work right after COVID hit, and ended up working in a decent sales/marketing job in healthcare for about 1.5 years, drinking like a sailor the entire time. Showing up to work extremely hungover. Drinking the second I got home from work. 

Fast forward to spring 2021 - I ended up leaving that job because I was accepted into a master's engineering program, related to my undergrad degree. I went back to school when I was 25 with the focus of then getting a master's (MS or MBA), and although COVID disrupted that, I was still set on my dream. 

So, I end up moving to a new city in a different state for the Fall 2021 semester. As you guessed, I ended up drinking. I also took prescribed ADHD medication for the first time in years, which made me incredibly impulsive with drinking, and raised my tolerance 10x. As you know, my grades suffered immensely and I failed 2 classes outright while luckily passing the other 2 due to generous professors.  

A dream several years in the making, a lucky opportunity that other people would kill for, was quickly being flushed down the drain because of my drinking. I would get so drunk on Friday and Saturday that my entire weekend would be a blur of intoxicated stupidity. 

In December, I finally sought help for mental health and therapy after ignoring it for 10+ years. I went home to see my family. I came back and started my semester about 3 weeks ago. While I have been seeing my therapist, eating healthy, working out everyday - the past two weekends have been the same story - blackout drunk, getting nothing done, drinking impulsively. 

As I enter another weekend, I just wanted to reach out here. I have this one semester to get good grades and prove to my advisor that I belong in this program. If I fail to do that, I will get kicked out. 

I don't have a plan B in my life. I am 30 years old and took out an immense about of financial aid for this program. This is it for me. This program is the culmination of the decision - of the dream - I made 6 years ago to go back to school and get my AA, then BA, and now MS. I remember, in 2015, working in a dishroom at midnight, paying off legal fees from a 2nd DUI, dreaming about becoming the man I want to be. 

My family has suffered from this. I have suffered from this. I lost a woman that truly loved me because of my drinking.

So, as I sit here, I have a decision tomorrow - I can drink and throw away another weekend, or I can study, play in my basketball league, go for a walk and FaceTime my family with a clear face. 

Thanks, I wish you all the best.",65,2

Anyhow, I enjoy camping and have my first trip coming up next month. It's cold, so it's more glamping style for now but I'll be in the elements without booze and that is a bit intimidating. Thankfully it will only be my partner and I, who is very aware and supportive of my new life choices.

Has anyone tried Hop Wtr? Recess? Any CBD drinks or something related? Looking to try out something new that feels a little *special* for my mini camping vacays. For what it's worth, I enjoyed my IPA's so something hoppy is A-okay.",5,0

I woke up incredibly early as I’ve been doing since I was laid off. (It didn’t have anything to do with my drinking, the whole department was laid off when we were bought by a different company). 

I watched some tv and then got bored because I was just waiting for the interview. So I decided to have a couple beers. I knew this was a bad idea, but I figured that there was so much time in between the interview and me drinking that my body could metabolize it by then. 

So I got there about 30 minutes early, all dressed up in suit and tie and clean cut, and immediately had to go to the bathroom. I didn’t take into account how much alcohol makes me pee. Luckily, this was before I met the person interviewing me. 

I finally sat down with FOUR people grilling me. I thought it was going to be one on one because that’s what I was led to believe. 

And I nailed it. I felt so relaxed and knew exactly what to say. I got an offer a couple hours later plus a sign on bonus that wasn’t advertised. 

I know I got lucky. And I know I have a problem. But I also know that I’m not that relaxed and freewheeling when I’m sober. How do I do that? How can I be that sociable person when I’m reality I’m slightly terrified of people? Not really people, but I guess how I react around them.

So my brain was literally telling me I went to rehab to get the inside scoop thinking magically ""here now you can only have one drink and be totally fine, you won't need another because now you have all of these coping mechanisms that you've learned from rehab!""

All of you who are reading this and are ashamed of what your life has become because of the choices or actions you've made, don't beat yourself up too bad. You probably already have enough.

Maybe around 375-380 days ago I was starting my journey. I had been lurking here for many months, maybe even years, because I knew there was something disordered about my drinking habits. I was drinking half a fifth of whiskey a night, plus wine (bottles), blacking out literally every night, and as a result waking up extremely anxious, depressed, stressed, etc about what I might have said, done, texted, posted, or said on phone calls I did not remember. I remember crying in the shower, composing letters to this sub about how I was ready to quit, ready to take the support you were all offering, ready to change that part of my life. I had read “This Naked Mind” in 2019(?), and although there were a bunch of helpful things in it, I didn’t change my drinking habits, just felt guiltier with the added knowledge I gained from that book. But in January 2021 I started listening to the book “Quit Like A Girl” with my free points on audible or whatever, and I can remember walking my puppy around my neighborhood, listening to my book, and crying. Mentally, emotionally, and physically I was ready to quit drinking. Especially mentally. But in the beginning I wasn’t quite ready to commit 100%. My plan for myself was quit all alcohol for one month, “restart” myself as a newly 28 year old, and then after one month (the shortest one) drink wine whenever, but stay away from hard alcohol for the entirety of one year. Because the whiskey was the “real problem,” right?! Spoiler: all the alcohol was the problem. 


This past year has been wild. After my month of sobriety I never went back to alcohol. Hell, I think after one week I was sold on not drinking. I will say, though, the finality of it was SO SCARY at first. It truly was a “get through the next ten minutes, the next three hours, the rest of the day.” Thinking to myself “I will never drink again” was not a helpful or peaceful phrase at first. “I will not drink right now or tonight” was though.  And in the beginning when life was a little too much, I would just go to bed. The first threeish months of sobriety is pretty murky and muddled. Looking back, it feels like the beginning of sobriety was like when you try to remember waking up if that makes sense? Not quite sure how it happened, or what happened, but it definitely did happen, ya know? 


I’ve learned a lot of things this year. It was the first adult year of being sober- before I started drinking (age 23ish) I was smoking a lot of pot, and I feel like I didn’t experience my baseline of myself as a human. What it means to be “regular” as myself. I’m grateful I have been able to learn what that means. And how that feels. Here’s a list of things I’m thankful for about myself: being present in my relationships, being a good mom to my dog and cats, learning how to be a good homeowner, excelling at my job, getting restful sleep, setting boundaries, saying no, saying yes, exploring new hobbies, reclaiming time for myself that I used to spend drunk or passed out. And a lot more, but this post is getting long and I’m grateful for a lot of things. You get the idea. 


I want to thank Polar Seltzer Water for their products, I probably drank 1000 sparkly waters this year. I want to thank my friends and family for supporting and respecting me and my choices. I want to thank this community for the beautiful and challenging and hopeful posts and check-ins, I lurk here everyday and will continue to :)

From ages 18-21, I had a constant drinking problem, and there have been isolated incidents since then (though now I'm 61 days sober). I'm being crushed by a mountain of shame and pain from things I've done while drinking and don't know what to do.

It started when I came to college with zero self-esteem and a desire to change who I was. I started binge drinking so that I could make myself do things that I thought would give me validation. I'd wake up the morning after feeling disgusting and crying in the shower. I had to compartmentalize those feelings so that I could function and would repeat the cycle the next weekend. Soon I was blacking out multiple nights a week and waking up in people's beds in random houses. I also had my first ER visit for intoxication during this time, 2 nights before my last final. I destroyed most of my relationships and my reputation.

I had an internship I had worked so hard to get, but it wasn't going well. The first time I got that feedback, I went out, blacked out and woke up in the ER with my phone and purse stolen. A couple weeks later, after drinking a little, I took way too much of a drug and chewed my face off while I was supposed to be working on my final project for the internship. Because of this, I had a fever and could barely drink water or eat anything for two weeks. Obviously I didn't recover from the negative feedback I'd gotten.

There have been a couple of incidents since then, mostly because I'd moved away from binge drinking to party drugs and am able to more easily tell when I shouldn't be doing more. However, now that I'm sober, I can no longer push away the memories, shame and horror of the things I've done to myself. I'm extremely overwhelmed at a time when I've already been struggling emotionally. I have no idea what to do - any advice is welcome.",5,0

I loved looking at weather websites and apps. I used to love the weather! Still do in fact but don't read anything about it anymore.

These last few days I've cleared everything from my phone that aimlessly distracts me - Instagram, Facebook, Tinder, Okcupid etc. This is my first time ever posting on Reddit, I think. I now find myself just swiping aimlessly from screen to screen and finding nothing to rob my attention anymore. Which is great, it's working. The habit is unforming.

I'm 42 years old and have two kids around the age of 10. There are so many things I used to be excited about when I was younger growing up and even into early adulthood. I'm a creative person and always enjoyed to draw and paint and make art. I love to learn new ideas and concepts from reading books. I love cooking and doing exercise. Going for walks, trails and mountain biking. Swimming and jogging. Studying nature. Science and philosophy. So many things. I work in technology and product development. I'm passionate about that.

Only I'm not. Not anymore. Nothing seems to interest me anymore. I cannot get excited about anything. I find myself running away from almost any attempt to do any of it. Reading is a disaster. I keep buying more and more news books to read as if that will somehow force me back. Exercise, cycling and even trying to spend quality time with my kids quickly aborts and/or turns into stress.

I have this overarching desire to want to do something. To be passionate about something again. Anything. Whether it's getting into data or learning about different breeds of Indian milking cows, at this point I don't really care what it is. Nothing seems to be able to draw me in. I get so many ideas, so many possibilities cross over my mind. Inspiration is fleeting.

I listen to many of Tim Ferriss' podcasts and want so much to be 'like those people'. I've bought all his books. I am a very capable person I know that. Intelligent and without any or many deficiencies. I know I can do things. Only in reality it seems I can't. Something is blocking me.

It's like a Berlin wall that I cannot seem to get over. It seems to have gotten higher these last years. More wire at the top. Even in my professional life my motivation has greatly subdued. I used to love to learn and study courses that helped me to grow in my career. Nowadays, nothing.

I've thought so often (dreamed) about becoming autonomous, independent and successful. An entrepreneur with some wonderful and necessary mission that will forever bring me joy and riches, health and wealth for my family and I. A pipe dream. Even still, I believe it's possible.

For more than half of my adult life I drank alcohol. A lot of alcohol. It served as a great excuse to not have to even worry anymore about the fact that I don't do any of this stuff anymore. When I was drinking there was no need to worry about anything. Daily I was rapidly and easily inebriated from all fears and worries and concerns about being busy, learning and succeeding.

It's been almost 1 year now since I decided to quit drinking. It took many false starts and years of torturing attempts to reach the place I am now. I will never drink alcohol again. It's definitely the most favourable place to be considering the alternatives. I'd much rather be alcohol free and stuck in this dilemma of not knowing what I want to do with myself, than be heavily reliant on drinking alcohol every day and oblivious to it. The dilemma.

Just some frustrating thoughts, getting them down on screen. Don't know if anyone else has had a similar experience to tell about. Has come out the other side, is still going through it or is just entering in. Who knows, on the latter this post may even help those individuals to lessen their passage there-through this most undesirable no-man's land.

I was having all of the usual pains of a heavy beer drinker but chose to ignore it for a long time.  It's strange to know exactly where you liver and pancreas are.  I also have alcoholic gastritis which was causing even more problems.

Luckily after just over a week I can feel myself getting better already.  Abdominal pain is starting to fade, I am finally able to go to the bathroom without issue, I can brush my teeth without gagging, my heart rate is down 14 BPM (from 91 BPM to 77 BPM) and still slowly dropping, and I am finally able to get decent sleep at night.

I know that I still have trials and tribulations ahead but I am trying to build the right mindset now to help get me through those rough times when they come.

Ever since I started drinking at 15 I've been an abusive drinker. Hell, I blacked out on my first parties and made an ass of myself, even went full blown delusional once and there's a voice recording of that... Ugh.

I successfully moderated myself until I was 18, mainly because I was afraid of getting grounded, and ever since then, I've blacked out more often than not. I just can't moderate unless there's barely any alcohol, cause usually we drink everything we can get our hands on. I know my friends are probably alcoholics as well, so I have no idea what will happen with that friend group given that I won't be drinking in the foreseeable future.

I read posts here daily and I see those of you who have days under your belt and are struggling. I know where you are. It’s important to reflect on how you got here. How alcohol has ruined some part of your life.

Sobriety is hard. It’s work - real work. It’s a reminder that we are flawed. But it’s also a realization that we are human. That we are not meant to be perfect and that we can pursue perfection. It’s ok to never achieve it because to do so would render the remaining journey useless. The work towards that goal is the most important. It’s the realization that we can improve. Take a look at the past and see how we can be better. 

Make a true commitment and live through the pain of not drinking. Sometimes it’s painful. Each day I wake up sober is a day I am stronger. Even at 500 days I can still taste the rum and cokes I enjoyed. The frosty beer. But that’s all a gimmick played by my brain. I map out the “it’s only one scenario” and suddenly fantasize about drinking an entire fifth because that’s who I am. 

So for those exploring this or looking for inspiration I hope this helps. If I can do this then I can do 1,000 days and even 10,000 days. Maybe one day there will be a cure to alcoholism. Until then I will not drink with you today!!",118,0

But here is what i need help with:  


Ive had a few streaks of not drinking for 4-10 days but that just means ive been out of money most of the time.  
Where I usually fail is if I have money in my account, I know i finish work at around 4-6 PM.  
And I get the first thought like around 1 PM ""I could just chill with 3-4 beers this evening""  
Then it escalates to ""If im already having 4 why not 7?""  
Then im finished work and ""black out"" (not really a black out but before i kind of can think, im heading home with around 12 beers)  


Then its back to the drinking heavy -> hungover -> drink to cure hangover -> hungover etc etc.  


Any tips to avoid this or someone experienced the same?  


Any insight is very much appreciated :)

Side notes: One positive thing is that i just bought a new gaming computer, which can motivate me to go home and game instead (when i get too drunk, gaming is boring to me). But I also have a tendency a few times to be like ""Its been a hard day at work, i deserve to drink a few beers while playing"".

It’s 930am. On my heavy days I could usually skull a half gallon by 5pm if I started at 930. Anyways I put my handle of Tito’s down on the counter , lady scans it , I physically can’t put my bank card in the reader because I’m shaking so bad and there’s a huge line behind me watching. I’m 28(m) probably reek of booze from the night before , face red , sweating , ( it’s 10 degrees out where I live ) and anxiety through the roof because I know if I don’t walk out with my booze I’ll probably die. Long story short. I’m 72 hours in with no alcohol after slamming vodka for 3-4 years, and very excited to start seeing the positive results of not drinking as that’s all I’ve known for years. My liver already feels better lol. Will update if anyone wants to hear it.

1 week update : Feeling like a million bucks. After 4 nights with no sleep and basically wanting to die I can say I definitely sweat it all out. I can’t remember what it’s like to actual sleep a full 8 hours and get up with my wife and have coffee and watch the news ( I know I’m only 28 ). Motivation levels at work are through the roof , I’m not passing out at 7pm I’m “ going to sleep at 9 “. Eating like a bear because I haven’t eaten much the weeks leading up to this . Taking liver enhancement pills and a mens one a day vitamin. Never again am I going to work hungover. I averaged $28/ day on booze so just in a week I’ve saved almost $200. No more picking drunken fights with my wife so we go to bed angry at each other. It truly is the greatest thing I’ve ever done , quitting alcohol because I wasn’t aware of what I had in front of me it was always in the background of a bottle. The benefits I’ve already gotten in a week. I can’t imagine the pay off months down the road.

I have nothing but time (literally) to sit down and sort through this gigantic colossal disaster of a life. 

All I ever wanted was companionship and to feel calm and happy and like I belonged. That is absolutely why it was so hard for me to quit drinking and that is why it was impossible for me to stop once I started on any given occasion.

4076,2022-02-03 09:52:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/sjl4qy/feeling_alone/,Feeling alone.,"Today is my fiance birthday. I took the day off and his job site closed for the day due to weather. Pretty cool. We decided to have some drinks and watch the snow, then watch some movies and stay up past bed time. Fun. Until... my drunk mind wandered off and asked why do people go into becoming cops. I guess I came off snotty? (His dad is a cop). This triggered him. And the evening was ruined. 

Back story: 

Im dealing with sexual harassment at the apartment complex where we live and theres nothing I can do about it since its the owners son and its very subtle: touch on the shoulder if im in the office paying rent, just in general creating forced interaction every time im out letting the dogs out or doing laundry. It has gotten to the point where I will make the dogs wait hours before letting them out if I see him out there just avoid him. In turn this triggers me to drink, though I work at like 2 in the morning so I mostly just stay in bed with the blinds closed instead of giving into temptation thankfully. Hes called me to ask about really stupid things, just keep in contact I think.  I've been bitching to fiance for the past month about this and his advice is to tell him to leave me alone. I obviously have anxiety about what will happen after I attempt to establish boundaries like will he make our lives miserable? Be more passive aggressive? I can't find any place to live here that doesn't have a breed ban on huskies and im not just gonna give my dog away so I can spend more money at different place to live away from this asshole. 

Back to last night: 
Fiance initially blows up about the comment I made about cops, and it i get pissed in return and tell him to leave me alone and then it becomes a you can tell me to leave alone and not him argument. 

Fun night of drinking. (Sarcasm) 

I guess I feel alone, my best friend passed away 8 months ago and I dont feel like I have anyone, and I feel like fiance doesn't understand. And our drinking is getting out of control and now theres friction in our relationship due to alcohol and this bastard harassing me and me not feeling comfortable enough with our living situation to outright tell him to go fuck himself.

Today is 7 days I have been sober and feel so much better already (been uber emotional and doing through the various waves of emotions and regrets etc.). I am starting to feel human again and my feet attached to the earth. 

I've been heavily drinking since I was in my late teens and its been almost 10 years I have been a drunk. Drinking and parties became my favourite hobbies, and over time I stopped all these other hobbies. I had lost interest. I am slowly coming to wanting to things/hobbies I have always loved but was too busy getting drunk to do. 

I'm a bit nervous because I am scared that the feelings of passion and enthusiasm for the things I love and want to do won't be like before... before drinking and before it fucked up my brain and body. Do those feelings eventually come back fully?

What does this mean?,"(21M) I have never made a lengthy post here and I feel like I’m still trying to find my thoughts through the fog, so I’ll try to make this somewhat brief while going through some of my personal stages of this journey I’m on (sorry if my vocab ends up being a bit weird)

On Christmas Day I decided that I was going to stop drinking after, what I’m just going to call a 2 year bender, drinking from around 10-11 units a day the first year (when the pandemic started), then inevitably cutting down to about the equivalent of a six pack a day the second year while skipping some days, after I finally found a stable job that forced me to somewhat get my stuff together. January 16th was the official day I came off from my taper at half of my usual dose, because at what probably adds up to be like 3 units is just a tease. probably even to a sober mind (at my weight)

Going through the first week was actually wayyy easier than I expected (probably because I tapered). I got the usual symptoms: high blood pressure, anxiety, mood swings, insomnia, shakiness etc. also I did kind of panic about getting DTs out of paranoia and sometimes my brain tricked itself into momentary hard panic, though I never got them. but overall, it never felt so drastic to a point where I was ready to give in or felt like the world was ending or anything like that. By day 7 it almost felt like I never touched alcohol to begin with.

Fast forward a couple days to week 2, the story gets a bit different. While most of what physical and mental symptoms I was having started to noticeably fade, it felt like they were just replaced with new and much stranger ones. and while becoming more occasional, also becoming stronger. Shakiness and blood pressure turned into occasional and more subtle shakes, but with weird pulsations/twitches. anxiety slightly faded the same way, but turned into what's like a very loud screaming voice in my head I would get particularly at night, almost like a brain shock but with weird and almost auditory thoughts attached to them. Id have to use the bathroom like 10 times a night (though not a lot came out). I would become strangely over aware of mid-high frequencies in the room that felt like they were digging into the back of my ears. ghost hangovers became way more noticeable and the insomnia actually did intensify quite a bit.

At some point during week 2 I'm a little concerned because usually, based on the info iv gathered, any symptom post peak isn't supposed to intensify? but here I am mid way through week 3 and I am just weirded tf out at this point. granted most of these symptoms iv mentioned are almost gone, but it seems the twitching, ""shocks""/anxiety and ghost hangover continue to hit out of nowhere at random, and even harder but shorter this time. I get these weird pulsations/spasms in my lips and face in particular that follow with a tingling sensation in random places (mostly my back), kind of like a dopamine rush but definitely not. And this along with other symptoms iv mentioned are so off and on to a point where its completely unpredictable what will arise next. I remember waking up the other day for example well beyond agitated, but flat out full of a wrath I have never experienced throughout my entire time drinking or going through withdrawal. Today I got random pressures all over.

Maybe I'm just being paranoid about it and a lot of it just kind of needing to vent, but some certainty or insight into what will happen or what is happening seems paramount to my motivation right now. I know that not all symptoms go away after peak, and Not asking for a diagnosis or anything, but should I get checked out for this or am I just at a weird stage that I can get over? has anyone gone through any kind of increase of intensity throughout their initial period of quitting? seriously, any input would be appreciated.

I'm an expat living in Asia, I live alone and have no family here. It has been over 2 years since I've seen my family due to covid. 

2021 and half of 2021 was quite good, I got back together with a former flame and we were planning to get married but that all turned to shit in June of last year. For that time we were together I completely quit drinking for over a year and was focusing on health and fitness and learning a language. 

After the breakup I went back to my past ways, lost my purpose and just drifted. I've kept up my gym but put on weight. 

I'm not chemically addicted but when I drink I really can't control the quantity. I binge drink and end up getting into trouble and taken advantage of. I've lost so many things, been drugged and robbed, assaulted and more. My latest episode was I took a stranger back to my home and they robbed me when I passed out. I feel so ashamed and so low, wondering how I ended up in this place. 

The thing is I'm in my early 40s and otherwise things are going outwardly well. I start a new job I've always wanted in 3 weeks, I own my own home and I'm financially secure and going to retire early. The things I've lost or had or had robbed are replaceable but my mood is just awful now and I feel quite isolated. I know this is my one weakness and I need to make a change but I'm afraid I can't as despite everything I lack a 'why', a purpose. I do suffer from depression but I manage it with antidepressants which work well but it's probably linked to my drinking.

Anything would be helpful in terms of suggestions or support.

Hey there, I just went through a difficult patch of wanting to drink (actually ""wanting to get fucked up"" is probably a better phrase) because a lot of stressful shit was happening. I thought about posting a couple of times, but didn't because I didn't really see the point of making a post because I knew I wasn't going to drink (even if I wanted to) and making a post seemed too narcissistic.

The stressful shit is still there, but I'm starting to feel better about it.

For anyone else that may be considering this route. Yes it is nerve-wracking and uncomfortable. I was panicking this morning before I arrived.  But everyone so far is very supportive. Its well set up for keeping you as comfortable as possible. Its a free hospital run one so nothing too fancy but there are spa baths and heat blankets available.

I decided to post here to mainly occupy myself and try keep this all positive in my mind. So I might do further posts as I go if its helpful to anyone who realised they cant do it on their own right now and are considering taking a leap into medically supervised detox. 

Im in Australia for reference as health systems obviously differ in what they can offer around the world. This is just my experience but I wasnt finding too much online before coming to help me to prepare. Now im here though i'm ok with it. Not so scary after all and looking forward to going through the process  where I have round the clock support.

Morning, everyone - I hope you’re keeping well.

This week I’m grateful to be active! Honestly, I have recently been feeling so motivated and energised. This is something I’ve not felt for a long time due to my recent mental health hiccup. I’ve been carrying on with the yoga and have started back up on the running once again (after totally falling out of it back in September. Oops).

I’m grateful for my yoga classes and for being able to add in the running. I’m thankful that it’s also been helping my back pain, especially when I’m trying to get to sleep. 

Before I got sober I was completely sedentary and significantly heavier, even walking was tough and I was so sick and tired all the time.

Now that I’m getting more active, I’ve been feeling a natural tiredness in the evenings and sinking into my bed feels incredible and well earned. My new pattern each day is that I’m energised, I’m active, I’m tired and then I’m rested. What a radically new cycle for me when previously I was only feeling 50 shades of shit from the moment of waking up to the moment I collapsed - drunk - into bed. Never thought it’d be me.

What are you all thankful for lately?

Long time lurker, this sub is sooo motivational!! Quick background about me, husband and i are late 20s and both drink daily. For me this has been non stop last 3 yrs. 

Covid has only made it worse and i hate the way we are living. House is a constant mess, no motivation, weight gain, health scares and far too many drunken fights caused us to realise this needs to change.

I went from half a litre of vodka a day to working it down to a bottle of wine (not sure if thats better) to now cold turkey since yday. 

Last night was awful, not bcus i wanted to drink... But because i couldnt and simply cannot seem to sleep! Im also very irritable and worry i may take it out on my husband as he still drinks (hes working on tapering down but much slower). AND BOREDOM IS A BIG REASON I DRINK

 The next day my wife dragged me to the hospital, I had been slowly losing all of my strength to the point where I could barely get out of bed, and I was hallucinating heavily. 
 They actually sent me home a few days later, but my situation did not improve over the next three weeks so my father dragged me to the hospital again for another few days in a different hospital and then I was medevac’d from Alaska to Swedish hospital in Seattle with alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, liver disease, and several other problems.

 I was alone, (due to the pandemic I wasn’t allowed to have visitors), I could barely move (just enough strength to move my arms and head), shitting myself constantly because I couldn’t use the bathroom, and I was in a confused, hellish prison in my own mind hallucinating every possible wacky scenario, thinking the nurses were out to kill me and everything. To top it all off I had developed a gigantic goddamn bedsore above my butt crack that you could fit a golf ball in. My body was literally rotting away. And after about one month of nightmarish confusion and terror I received a liver transplant. 

Things slowly started improving after that. They allowed my wonderful wife to come visit me and she stayed as long as she could. Friends and family back in Alaska stepped up and took care of our eight year old daughter and six year old son while we were away. I had to stay in the hospital another couple of months after that for recovery and rehabilitation. Physical therapy became my full-time job for the last month, re-learning how to walk. 

They finally let me out of the hospital June 1 and my wife flew back to Alaska and retrieved our kids and brought them to stay with us at our hotel in Seattle. I had to stay close to the hospital for another month even after they let me out.

I was still using a wheelchair about 3/4 of the time when they finally gave us the OK to go back to Alaska on June 24. I only used the wheelchair a couple of times after I got home.  I started walking pretty quickly after that. 

Just before writing this I finished reading my kids bedtime stories, hurling them onto the bed (like they love), and giving them piggyback rides to their rooms for the night. I’m grateful they didn’t lose their father. I’m grateful my wife didn’t leave me and I didn’t lose everything. I wasn’t A smack-the-wife, get in fights, or drunk-drive kind of alcoholic. I just secluded myself in my man-cave and drank myself mostly to death. So hardly anybody knew I was an alcoholic, even my wife didn’t know how bad it had gotten.

This Saturday we are getting on a plane with 12 of my family members and heading to Hawaii for 10 days, something I thought would never happen again while I was laying in that hospital bed.

I don’t really feel too much like patting myself on the back for achieving one year of sobriety. It was kind-of sobriety or death, and even with sobriety I only barely survived. Countless insurance dollars and man hours from countless doctors and nurses went into patching my worthless-ass up, and I figure its the least I can do. Even though some of the nurses told me many liver transplant patients go straight back to drinking the moment they hit the streets. They even said they had one guy come back FOUR times.

Anyway, I don’t necessarily have any good advice to give other than: try not to end up like me, it took a liver transplant to finally get me to quit so if you can do it without that you’re doing better than me!",100,1

I have struggled with problem drinking and alcoholism for years. I used to drink to ignore parts of my life I didn’t like or just put off “moving forward” in life or being productive. It became my (nearly daily) hobby and I was great at it—until I wasn’t. I would just start drinking and wouldn’t stop; I’d never get blackout drunk, I would just pace myself and drink for hours, every time I drank. We’re talking sessions at the bar of 6-10 hours, followed by a half hour stumbling walk home. 
I was tired of waking up feeling like crap or being hungover endlessly. To add on to everything else, as a Type 1 diabetic my sugars would always be dangerously low the next day or drop low while I was sleeping. After a crazy holiday bender and a few (minor, I think) seizures and horrible days struggling to keep my blood sugar up, I decided to quit drinking. 

Much fewer low sugars and no seizures since I quit drinking. Hooray!!!

Most of my friends have accepted my decision and have been fairly supportive. The ones who can’t? Screw ‘em, I don’t care at this point. 

Anyway, we had a snowstorm today and I didn’t have to work, so I met up with friends for trivia night at the bar. I spent 5 hours surrounded by drinkers and never once felt the urge to drink or like I was missing out on anything. The fact that at the end of the night I wasn’t a part of any of the drunken screaming, antics, or fighting made me feel great. 

I just wanted to thanks to everyone here.

I’m 19. My name is Jack and I’ve been struggling with drinking for 8 months. I went to rehab when I was 15 for 3 months for opioids. I had been using for a month or so once or twice a week but would take as much I could get my hands on. My parents caught on fast, I was extremely depressed and had a friend kill himself and have had a brutal up bringing. I found pills and instantly took to it because it “helped. I’ve always had a very addictive personality where it’s video games, a certain restaurant, women, whatever gave me instant pleasure I would use to a extreme and throw aside when I was done. After rehab I felt I had found myself and was stone cold sober off everything for 4 years. No AA, no therapy, no nothing. Just me. I recently had a horrible messy break up w a girl I dated for 3 years with. Instantly started drinking a bottle a night. Since then I’ve cut my drinking down to 3-4 nights a week. On weekdays 6 beers a night and on weekends 9-10 with friends. But I still have the once a month self destruct black out drink all day and wake up in vomit and piss. I’ve gotten a dui and I just lost another girlfriend who I actually cared for greatly over alcohol. I don’t like AA and idk if I have the heart to go to rehab again even tho my family wants me to. How do I stop? I don’t have many close friends and not a good support system outside of family. Idk if I’m a alcoholic, very well could be but I think more than likely I have a lot of demons in my head and I started using alcohol to fight them but problem is with alcohol is only makes it worse and it’s not something I can use up and throw away when I’m done.",4,0

I've tried counseling - helps a bit, but not much. I'm really just not sure about anti-depressants.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

*Learn the alchemy true human beings know: the moment you accept what troubles you’ve been given, the door will open. Welcome difficulty as a familiar comrade. Joke with torment brought by the friend. Sorrows are the rags of old clothes and jackets that serve to cover, then are taken off. That undressing, and the naked body underneath, is the sweetness that comes after grief. -Rumi*

There is much grief in recovery. The grief of an old life, of what happiness used to mean, the grief of who we were and what we lost...

And then there is fear. We have to face ourselves and our decisions. We have to choose to live with our mistakes, to face the world stripped of our old identities and interface with reality raw and naked and fucking sober. 

And then there is courage. We face those shadows. We grieve our losses. And then without much to go on but the experience of the people who came before us, we pick up the vestiges of who we were and build new selves. 

For those of you just waking up to what drinking has done to you and your life, I wish you courage. Many have done this before. 

For those of you grieving  the losses you had to sustain to come here, I wish you grace. Be kind to yourselves. 

For those of you rebuilding your lives, I wish you wisdom. I am just moving through grief and into rebuilding. I am honestly so inspired by what sober people can build.

I'm so happy to be free of the constant cravings and headaches that wouldn't let up until I had my first drink or two. Even better, sobriety has given me the clarity and strength to tackle the underlying problems in my life that the booze was masking. 

After nearly 2.5 years, being sober is no big deal to me any more. But sometimes life just shits on you, y'know? I've had a recent close and traumatic death, I have another close relative in hospital on the verge of death, and I'm stuck in the middle of an apparently never ending divorce. It's just a really sucky time in life. My thoughts have been going to a lot of dark places recently. Sometimes I go to bed hours early just so I can lie with my head under the covers, blocking the world out. I guess everyone needs some way to cope.

And right now I'm on a work trip at a beautiful hotel with a cozy and inviting Irish bar. And the room rate includes $40 of credit to spend at the bar. And I spent the whole night at dinner with my colleagues while most of them got lit on fancy cocktails. And all the shit in my life is making me so sad and lonely and afraid. And a pint of Guinness sounds like heaven in a glass right now. Delicious and creamy and comforting. I've been thinking about it all day. The temptation is so strong.  

I almost went down to the bar a few minutes go. You know the rationalizations that your mind comes up with - ""I shouldn't waste the free credit"", ""It's just one time"", and the old classic ""One drink won't do any harm"". 

The thought that stopped me was, do I really want to start the cycle of craving again? It's bad enough feeling it now. Do I really want to inflict that daily misery on myself again? 

I got some fizzy water, retreated to my room, and double-locked the door. Not to stop anyone getting in, but as a psychological barrier to stop myself getting out. I'm proud of myself for playing the tape through and being stronger than the craving.

Today for the first time when offered a drink by a coworker, without a second thought I replied, ""I don't drink.""  and not ""I'm not drinking right now."" After saying that I was surprised in my own mind.

Some back story why this is such a big deal.  I am a professional bartender/mixologist.  Many years ago, I decided I was a lifer even though I knew I had a tenuous grasp at best on my alcohol consumption.  In this industry drinking is commonplace, easy and often FREE.  It is a very permissive attitude.  Over the summer I worked at a restaurant where the owner and general manager often started drinking by 7 pm and was a ""known"" secret that the bartenders were following shortly thereafter.  This is around the same time I realized I had lost my control over the booze and thankfully found this sub but had trouble getting more than a few days sober.  

Luckily and a bit ironically, I was sniped by another restaurant in large part due to ordering a very specific cocktail with esoteric spirits.  Long story short I was able to leave the very permissive restaurant to a new one that still has the traditional habits but not as blatant or pushy about it.  A week into the new job I was trying to make friends by joining in the drinking but having to drive home 20+ minutes and one night not fully remembering getting home, I made the big decision.  I decided I had my fill and have not had a drink since that day. 

Since I had some drinks here and there in that first week, I was prepared to have to explain myself constantly, but my new coworkers were super supportive and even our beverage director quit drinking about the same time I first tried at the previous restaurant.  So now I am at 3 months sober on Tuesday!  This is the longest I have gone since I was 18 years old almost 20 years ago.",14,0

There just isn't enough time to do the things I actually want to do. Life is doing things you don't want to do, and then you're dead.

And like, look, I've tried gratitude, I've tried mindfulness -- I've live laugh loved my way through dozens of ways to cope but honestly? Just don't like it! And to be honest I resent the implication that I'm the broken one for having a hard time dealing with it.

Drinking is such a strong eject button, because at some point literally all you want is any kind of relief. Because what else is there? Fucking blogging? Breathing exercises? Nope! Just gonna do more things I hate, and buy things I don't want to sustain a lifestyle that isn't worth living and eventually I'll be dead.

IDK, like, every crazy person says they aren't crazy but I genuinely don't think I'm wrong for being unwell in a sick environment, and I suspect a lot of us are with me.

I am feeling a mix of guilt and a little bit proud, that it was just food and that can be undone with a few days of clean eating and working out after this storm passes. If it were booze, it could not be undone. I would’ve spiraled into a dark hole of major guilt and depression. I would’ve woken up in the morning claiming I couldn’t get to work because I’d be too hungover.

I've had an occasional Monday or a Tuesday where I didn't (rare), probably out of being overly-tired and groggy. I drink everyday and feel like I rely on it for fun, relaxation, socializing, etc. 

I've drank a lot of shots and bottles and beers. I also bring it on nearly every road trip that I know will last at least 20 minutes in the car. I'm just giving one-of-many examples why I feel the need to control it and make it nearly non-existent. I'd say quit all-together but I just don't think it's realistic, at least not yet.

So I lost my job when covid hit. Well, afterwards, but there's a very clear spiral that let to my department getting closed > me getting shifted to something I wasn't qualified for > me not doing very well at it > me getting fired. Had to move back in with my parents. A year later, I'm still here. 

I found work about a month after in IT. It's government, so that's cool, but it's contracted so no benefits.. So I take calls all day and fix people's computer problems. I'm good at it (I can do it while I'm drunk to foreshadow) but it drains you. People are dicks, I get told to get a real job about twice a day, the pay isn't horrible but isn't great ($15). But, I like helping people so it evens out. 

So the drinking got bad. Easily a bottle of liquor a day if not more. I'd just have whiskey by me during work and just sip on it, by EOD I'd have a buzz then I could really go into it. I'd just drink from the bottle till it was gone. Everyone thinks I gained 50lbs from working from home. Sure that contributed, bit not as much as the booze. 

Now that I'm sober I'm like a god at work, which is cool. But I'm starting to realize like... WTF am I doing? I need to get out on my own again but I have like 400 reasons not to. I used to make A LOT more money, so I have this car which is great, but the payments are a lot. Used to not be an issue. Student loans are eventually gonna hit again. And I got this damn tumor on my life, the drinking. If I'm on my own will I just go back? It's nice to have my parents to talk to when I'm feeling my head spin, but the constantly feeling like a loser isn't really helping either. 

I'm pushing thirty and have nothing but my car and a cool resume. Oh yeah and the degree I'm paying for but not using at all. My friends mostly left because of the drinking. Not a single girl in heaven or hell will have anything to do with me because the drinking. I live in an attic. I never go outside because I work evening so it's always fridge cold and dark when I'm not working. 

I've been looking for places to stay, or even a cheapo house to buy and that's even more disheartening to tell ya the truth. I can't afford any of this. And I'm not even making minimum wage so, hearts out to those that are. And I've been working with this company for a year with zero sign of being hired on (which includes a raise). 

The only thing I have going for me is while I'm sober, I out perform tf outta every peer I have, by a very large margin as well. I take more calls, I resolve issues faster and more accurately, it's a joke really. I've found sobriety in working myself to being so tired that when it's time to clock out I have no energy to do anything but get in bed. I skip lunch if I have to, I never take breaks, it's just 11-8 full on non stop work. It's all I know to do at this point. 

So I feel like a washed up, dead beat, disappointing son who lives in his parents attic, working at a call center trying to get sober. And let me tell ya I'm trying. Every day has felt like mental gymnastics. Im trying to keep my head up but it's all so over my head at this point. 

So that's it. If you read this I appreciate it. I just would rather sit here and brain vomit than get up and get in the car. I know drinking won't help, but when I look at the risk vs reward I see it swing back and forth all day. That's all I have for now.",29,1

I have a close friend that lives in another state and just had a baby. In the fall I made plans to visit 2 months after the baby was born to meet the baby and have a nice visit with my friend. At the time we made the plans my friend did mention that she would be ready for a fun night out when I visited. Well 52 days ago I decided to quit drinking and I told my friends but didn’t really go into detail about my struggles with alcohol or about how difficult quitting can be. Over the last few weeks this friend has mentioned a few times how disappointed they are that I won’t be drinking while I’m visiting and I’ve brushed those comments off even though they did hurt my feelings. But today she called and said again how disappointing it is that I won’t be drinking and how she had really wanted a night out and implied she’d still be having a few drinks. She’s really not a big drinker so I don’t know why she’s making all these comments but it felt very insensitive. After getting off the phone I called my husband and started crying while telling him what she said and I realized I don’t really want to visit right now. I don’t want to be around drinking at the moment and I don’t want to be made to feel bad about not drinking either. So I made up a vague excuse and canceled on my friend. Then I booked myself a hotel in the downtown area of this (very large) town and found a yoga studio within walking distance and booked a class for Saturday and Sunday. I decided to put my sobriety and peace of mind first and I’m going to have myself a nice little weekend away. I’m going to eat good food in bed while binging trash tv and walk around this new city by myself. And I’m honestly looking more forward to this weekend now then I was a few days ago.

Im halfway between putting down the bottle forever or just drowning myself in beer and seeing how hard this rock bottom can hit.

It just really hurts that someone who's been your best friend and supporter over the last years just up and gives up on you.

At age 19 I was dealing with a severe gambling addiction, it eventually got me into 25k euros in debt. Ever since, I've never truly felt happy because it always felt like I was stuck and couldn't get out. Having been fired from my previous job, I had to pick up a job as a mailman. I still work there for 1,5 years and it has been the worst time in my life. 

I eventually started drinking every day after work, to deal with the pain of being in debt and essentially ruining my life at a young age. I have ADHD and always struggled to be a normal person, and all the experiences in my life gave me a big fear of failure. I just knew that no matter how hard I tried, I could never find a normal job and pay off my debt, live happily again. It just wasn't in the cards for me.

Right now, I've been drinking for over a year almost every day. I'm 22 now. But something happened recently that made me want to turn it around. I got a prescription for antidepressants, which heavily discourages drinking while using it due to risk of seizures. And I know I don't want to die. The fear of possibly getting a seizure and my loved ones finding my body a few hours later made me make an appointment at the doctor. I just can't throw away my life like that, no matter how bad it is right now.

I really hope that other people can someday just say ""no more"" to themselves and take action. I'm probably someone who got there in time since i'm only 22. It's never too soon or too late to take action and know what is best for you",7,0

It's funny, looking back. My entire goal for the first year was fighting, and living with cravings. Now I couldn't imagine a life still drinking. Even as my anxiety and depression problems remain, I have no desire to pick up the bottle again. That would just make my mental health problems worse.

I'm so so so tired of this, every day I wake up with this lease for life, telling myself today is the day, but it is of course, never the day.

I’d convinced myself that because I mainly drink beer and because I haven’t experienced dt’s yet or very serious withdrawals that I wasn’t as bad as other drinkers, but my intake had increased, it’s negative for my relationship, I’m always hung over at work, I’m spending a fortune on it. 

I was drinking every single night, beer bottles everywhere. Now I seem to spend the first half of the week at least miserable but half convinced I can forgo the weekend, but when it’s there I drink again.

He's part of the reason I slid deeper into the pitcher plant. Every Monday afternoon he would ask me to go drink with him at a nearby bar. It's hard to say no to the boss and, let's be honest, I wanted to drink at the bar instead of work in my depressing work environment. This carried on for many years like clockwork.  I usually worked harder on Fridays and over the weekend to keep up with my workload knowing that Monday I was going to be at the bar.  

He normalized drinking on the job.  He's an old head and like those characters on Mad Men.  Everyone loved him and wanted to be around him. He was the boss, so nobody made an issue of our drinking... until he retired and my new boss kicked the shit out of me but that's a different post. 

But it's one of those things that I learned more about my industry and how to do my job from him at the bar than in the office. If I wanted to learn and progress, it was going to be with him at the bar. And we did do good work, even if we were oiled up. 

I've been trying to sober up for many years and I've been avoiding my former boss for months because it's hard for me to say no. I told him I was doing Dry January, so he waited until February to meet up. But I had a game plan today. I arrived early (11:20 am) at the bar and told the bartender my story and ordered a club soda and lime with a wink (the nonverbal ""I'm in recovery"" move).  I told my boss that I'm not drinking anymore... kinda like how someone would come out of the closet to their parents. 

It's so odd justifying why I'm no longer consuming an addictive poison that makes me feel awful the next day. It's like part of me is ashamed to admit I'm dry/in recovery. 

On the other hand, I also feel liberated in that everyone close to me now knows that I'm not drinking. I kept my recovery a secret and to myself but now, everyone close to me knows I'm dry. 

As I was walking home, this song played randomly and I thought, you're damn right, I'm never going back. I'm sober Khun55555 now and I'm going to fight everyday as hard as it takes to never go back to booze. I'm going to be an example to my friends. Today required a lot of fight.

4184,2022-02-02 17:28:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/sj1yac/i_think_quitting_alcohol_changed_my_life/,I think quitting alcohol changed my life,"I (22F) quit drinking 2 months ago December 4th was the last day I drank alcohol. I only originally quit drinking so I could stop being so impulsive with my bad decisions and quit partying with my friend so much. But even better things have been happening. I started noticing how much I was neglecting my relationships with my parents and some friends. 

I was glorifying my party friend like she was my best friend only to later realize she’s never even been there for me or even cares about me. I stopped drinking with her and see her sometimes but shes a binge drinker. She only ever cared about having a good time for her own selfish reasons or satisfaction. Her influence on me was a lot more noticeable once I stopped drinking. The bad decisions, the blacking out,the driving while under the influence (yes I know it’s dangerous). She would allow me to drink and drive and even encourage me too as long as she got a ride somewhere. 

After quitting I finally came to a realization of all these things. I started being able to read the vibes around the people I was hanging out with. Noticed bad habits of another friend trying to get me to smoke to replace drinking. Cut him off completely. That girl I see sometimes at social gatherings but now I keep my distance. My relationship with my parents have improved. 

My attitude and emotions have been better. No more feeling anxious or angry or set off easily. I barely clench my jaw anymore since I’ve had problems with that for years. I find myself in happier moods. I’m sleeping better, I’m eating better, food tastes so much better. I’m not so fatigued anymore. I used to stay up until 4am and now I get up at 9am. 

I’m getting happy over the smallest things in life that before didn’t matter. I feel things better, it’s so hard to explain but it’s actually amazing. I’ve went out to parties with my virgin cocktails I make or bring. I sometimes get non-alcoholic wine and I actually like it. I finish the end of my night with a peppermint tea knowing how damn happy I am not over or at some random house or feeling out of it.

I started drinking at such an early age and I realized back in August I didn’t want to live like this. I don’t care what society or anyone says about alcohol. It’s poison. I’ve watched people I love destroy there lives on it and even lead them to something more dangerous. I told myself 2022 is going to be the year I change into the best version of myself.

My one friend has stopped smoking weed because of me. She sees how I’m doing it and how happy I am without alcohol. I want to be everyone’s good influence, I want to show others how happy and fulfilling life can be. Alcohol is what makes you feel dull and so lifeless. 

Anyways thought I’d share this, I leave to Florida next week and it’s gonna be the first time I see a palm tree or even leave Canada. I’m excited and happy. I’ve wanted this since I was young and being alcohol ever touched my soul. I just wanted to share this with you guys because I promise your inner child is in there always listening to you. I believe anyone can do this you just need good people in your life and a support system.

My mother is an alcoholic, and addiction runs through my dad's side of the family as well. When I was a teenager, my friends and I drank and got high often too, so in other words, I'm the definition of someone with a predisposition to addiction. Nine times out of ten I struggle to have just one glass of wine for example, it has to be 2,3,4, opps the whole bottle! I end up smoking like a chimney and of course waking up feeling either hungover or simply sleep deprived. I don't drink everyday after work, but I'd say every other day, or every two days. Sometimes I've even missed work because it disrupted my sleep too much and I end up with a paycheck that has hundreds of dollars shaved off of it. 

After I graduated college a little over 2 years ago, I went through a tough period of time. There were suddenly many stressors, one of which was trying to study for this stupid exam (LSAT) to get into law school, and it left me feeling so stupid and incapable all the time. Between the stress and working full- time, I didn't have the motivation or mental energy to manage my stress healthfully (like pick up a hobby, work out, paint etc..) and ended up using beer and wine to numb it out for the night. The fact that I grew up with an alcoholic and was using this substance to escape is still SO embarrassing (I feel like a cliché almost) for me, I can't believe I'm finally brining myself to put this in writing. Deep down I know better, I've seen firsthand how drink just consumes you and what starts out rather innocently can turn into an problem, and then one day you're 40 and you're legit an alcoholic- in the closet or not. 

Anyway, fortunately the stressors from those years have tapered off and I feel my life is on the precipice of a fresh chapter. I just got married to my SO (who I've been discreetly drinking around), I got accepted into a law school and will be moving this summer, I've let go of a toxic friendship that was always brining me down etc., and now its time for me to face the music. I've bravely decided  that I'm going to go 100% dry this month and work on breaking that after work ritual, and instead work on my physical health. I find when I get home, boredom can take over and wine spices things up, so I want to introduce a new form of entertainment like exercise.  The lack of physical activity and extra calories from alcohol have caused me to gain about 10 pounds on what was already a curvy figure. I hate the way I look most of the time, feel insecure about it, and as someone who fortunately never fretted over my weight  my whole life, the last few months of hiding my body have been a wake up call. I've ordered resistance bands, picked out the exercises I want to start, and I'm cautiously optimistic. I've never been an athletic woman, but I'm hoping I can plant seeds of a healthy habit in place of pinot grigio. I don't know what kind of relationship I'll have with alcohol after this dry month is over, but I'm hoping that the benefits I'm going to feel physically, mentally, and financially are going to usher in a new era. I want to go back to alcohol being a treat, something I'd consume at the beach, occasionally at a birthday party. I hate how its creeped into my everyday home life. 

Any stories that are similar to this, any advice or warnings you can give are welcome! It has taken me so long to commit these concerns into writing, so even if nobody has anything to say, this has been a big starting point step for me. <3",9,0

Our relationship has become so strong and he looks at me and speaks to me like he did before alcohol got its claws into me. And the best part of all is I am completely present for my baby boy. He won't ever know the person I was before I got sober. 

This subreddit has helped me so much. Thank you all and I will not drink with you today. <3",66,0
4200,2022-02-02 15:46:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/sizf23/a_funeral/,A Funeral,"I buried my wife yesterday. Well, to be honest, I only tossed dirt on her casket, and with the other mourners, we did our best to cover the top of her casket; the cemetery management wouldn’t let us do more than that. Then the fine folks at the cemetery buried her in the dirt. 

Anyway, after meeting and greeting family, friends and new acquaintances at three different locations on starkly separated sides of the county, I drove home to let the dogs out and “my hair down,” as it were. 

A few times throughout the day I thought about tipping a bottle over a shot glass, but the times I had that thought, I was nowhere near the bottle or the glass, or I was expected to drive somewhere else, so I couldn’t. When I had access to both, and wasn’t driving, and had the time, and no minders telling me that it’s okay to let it out, I decided that I didn’t want even one drink. 

Drinking wouldn’t make me feel better. Drinking wouldn’t bring my wife back. Drinking wouldn’t make it easier to remember if the dogs were inside laying on their beds, or outside shivering in the cold. 

So, the night of my wife’s funeral, I didn’t drink. 

What I _did_ do was call my wife’s brother, who had obligations and so couldn’t attend the funeral. I told him about how it went off without a hitch. No gaffs, not even minor ones. I told him that my family and some old friends of both Carol and myself attended, and some of them were crying. But eventually, Carol was laid to rest. 

He asked if I had had her cremated, which had been discussed. For a while, I considered having her ashes made into a potted plant pot for a tree that would grow green apples, which my wife loved. The whole process would have been less expensive than what we actually _did_ do, but we put her in the same plot where I will be buried some day (no time soon, God willing), and I like that thought better. Besides, I don’t know if green Apple tree will survive where I live. 

Long story short. I passed that hurdle; I didn’t drink. I decided not to write something like this up last night because I couldn’t be sure I wouldn’t change my mind. 

For tonight…

Moderation is a myth if I want to quit, and I want to quit. I am tired of letting my moods derail my progress. 

What else can I do to deal with this? Debating about eating my weight in chocolate currently instead of tequila. I think less regret will happen if I go for the chocolate. Ugh!

Ever since then I've had a decline in erectile function. I have  been unable to have sex because of this ever since I got out of the hospital.

I had a urology appointment yesterday and the urologist is convinced this is because of my diabetes and says it will only get worse as time goes on. Even with the aid of medication.

Diabetes causes peripheral neuropathy which can cause circulation problems resulting in Erectile Dysfunction (ED).

Alcohol can also cause peripheral neuropathy due to lack of sufficient nutrients.

Since then I have been trying to find out why. This has brought back memories from my childhood. I had a very difficult childhood with abuse, violence and repression. My grandmother, who lived with us at the time, was a severe alcoholic herself. I can't get these images out of my head of what I experienced as a child....

Since the separation, it feels as if I have a hole in my body that I'm trying to plug, and at the moment it's with alcohol.  Through alcohol, I simply suppress the negative and bad thoughts that I'm not worth anything and that I'm not good for anything. Likewise, the events I experienced in my childhood no longer seem so real to me and with alcohol I can finally sleep again. Even if the sleep is not very restful.....

But I notice that I'm getting worse and worse. At the moment I drink a bottle of wine and three quarters to a whole bottle of rum/vodka after work to forget everything and sleep. When I wake up in the morning, I first need two shots to get me in the mood for work and to be able to perform....but during work I notice that the more sober I get, the worse I feel, I get headaches, I feel sick and I get in a bad mood.....

I also notice how bad it is for my body, I have put on a lot of weight due to the alcohol, I am more forgetful and nothing seems to matter to me....from time to time I also have suicidal tendencies...but fortunately this is still within limits....

I think I have become an alcoholic by now.....but I don't want that any more! I notice how bad I feel because of the alcohol and how much it destroys. 

I have started behavioural therapy with a psychologist. I have an appointment with him once a week....

I also hope that through this forum I will get support on my way to getting sober and saying no to alcohol......I hope I succeed....wishes me luck.",6,0

Yesterday, my mother drove four hours to bring me home to my parents house. We loaded my animals and some clothes into the car and zipped off.

 To say this hasn’t been a big thing for me would be an understatement.This has been huge. I knew I had a problem and I set out to kick it from within my life. This has been hard work. This has been ups and downs and tears and laughs. I had to be in myself. I had to really look at me in the mirror and ask myself if this is the ME i wanted to go forward with or if i needed to find her or create her. I think i did a bit of both. I lost some of what i was, and that was hard. I had to say goodbye to someone like saying goodbye to an old friend. I had to make do with what i was.  
 I’ve changed my body, my mind and my soul in this year. I know this. I struggled through parts that i had medicated away for a long time, and i’m not done yet. I’m in a Chrysalis of sorts. I am only beginning what i want to be. One thing i do know is i am not who i was a year ago. If people know me and haven’t seen me in awhile, they may say i have changed. Heck yeah. I’m glad i wake up every day with a clear head knowing that no matter what i do, it won’t be drinking. It won’t be shame and bitterness.

Long-time lurker, and long-time struggler. I am a 27-year-old guy who is in the middle of a bad divorce with my high school sweetheart, we were together for 10 years and married for 4 have a house together, etc. The divorce is ongoing, 6 months separated there were a lot of issues and I won't pretend alcohol didn't contribute to the downfall, it was not the main reason but it played its part. 

I am struggling with keeping my word to myself, I promise myself every morning ""I won't drink today, I am going to get back into the gym nightly instead, etc"" but towards the end of the day I find myself taking shots to numb the pain and stress I am facing daily. I know I need a better outlet and the gym does help when I can convince myself to go. For the last 6 months, I have not been able to go over a week without drinking (let's be real more like 3 days), the only time I did stop drinking altogether was about 2 weeks after my partner and I decided to part ways, but once they moved out I found myself alone with my own thoughts and it's been downhill from there... 

I really want to stick to not drinking at all, I want to lose weight, get my complexion back, look at myself in the mirror, and feel good about myself especially when the time comes to re-enter the dating world.

Time is short. I’m sad and a little lost. It feels like layers of my life - of me - are peeling off. And I know a drink or 12 would make it feel better right now. But I also know it won’t. And I won’t do it. But I’ve reached the end of the easy path - at least for a bit - and it’s white knuckles now.

UPDATE:  I flew out to see her and I’m on my way home. I told her who she is for me. That she saved my life so many years ago. That she is open and welcoming and generous and courageous. And that she inspires me because - above all else - she doesn’t hide. She lives unapologetically as her beautiful complete self. I told her I’m a nondrinker now and she was thrilled for me.

Probably because I haven't started my day by cracking open a hard seltzer or with a shot of vodka. 

Bonus is - the last 3 mornings I haven't woken up feeling like shit. I've showered. I've walked the dog. I've gotten more work done in those days than I have in a long time. My partner enjoys talking with me instead of tolerating my ramblings.

Guess it's time to just ride that wave 😎 This must be what having feelings is like!!

Just in the past year, however, I have: totalled my car, lost my long time job, slept in my car to avoid the shame of going home drunk to the love of my life, ruined my 4 year relationship, moved across the country to live with my mom because I was too much to handle, lost all my passions for the things I love, left my beloved dogs. 

In the past three months, I have started to edge off alcohol.  I have curved my anger and resentment I've held that has built the last 4 years of heavy drinking.  I am no longer angry.  The same handle that lasted a night has now lasted a week, or more. I am sleeping more, I have been eating healthier, waking up early. Still jobless, still depressed, but the depression is not from shame and guilt from the night before, or the angry mean things I said to those that didn't deserve it. It's from the enormous amount of things I have to do now to get my life back on track. 

Today marks day 2 of not drinking, and I have made a pledge, wrote in my journal, and marked it on my calendar. This is the time I will hold myself accountable for my health and my life. I hope to look back on this post a year from now saying. Welcome day 366.  

I've lurked on this sub since I left Colorado in October. I've only posted comments a handful of times; from this community I feel there is enough support, and positive reinforcements to truly kick this habit. I am 29 in a few months and I refuse to go into my 30's with this burden on my shoulder. This is from my heart, to you, all of you. Thank you. Thank you so very much.

 Good morning. 
 Our keynote is ""Gratitude”.
 Today's reading is  about love and behaving lovingly.
 Feeling love is uplifting, joyful and makes it easier to behave lovingly. However, in and of itself, my loving feeling doesn't do much for other people or to enhance my spiritual life. 
 The promise of today's reading is that by behaving lovingly I will ultimately live in love.
 It is especially important that I act lovingly toward those for whom I don't feel love. Frequently, doing loving things for the unlovable will magically bring the freedom and joy of feeling love for them.
 Also, real love from my fellows often comes back to me as a byproduct of my efforts to love them.
 Love is not just part of spirituality; it may very well be the whole of spirituality. 
 It is impossible for me to be spiritual while behaving in an unloving manner. 
 If God is Love, then Love, itself, is God.
 I love you all.",5,0

Some time back I got a really good promotion and all that jazz. But, I've been working out of the same office. Recently the company bought a building nearby and made it the 'corporate office'. I was informed this morning that I had my own office there and to go on and move. 

As I was cleaning out my desk, I ran across some very bad lab results from 2019. This is what spurred my first real attempt to get sober. I lasted for 12 days then I was back at it.

Seeing this flooded my brain with memories. Some regret, some joy. But here I am today. In MUCH better shape physically and emotionally. My last labs were perfect, my resting heart rate is normal, my blood pressure is in normal range and so on. I don't wake up at 3:30am with thoughts of impending doom and my relationship with my wife is better than it ever has been.

When I began my sobriety journey in June 2021, I was worried if I could actually do it or not because I had ""tried"" many times before. But here I am. Sober and never going back.

My cravings are pretty much gone and I'm actually active and present in my life. 

We all struggle, we all stumble and we all fall. The key is to always get up and move forward.

We are here and we are with you.

It's time for another meeting of the Sober People Getting Shit Done Club! I'm terribly sorry - I have been remiss in holding meetings for the past several months. I would like to tell you that it was because I was so busy GSD that I just didn't have a spare moment, but that would be a lie and Sobernauts tell each other the truth, so let's blame it on the holidays or something.

For those that are new to the SPGSD club, it all started last year when I was fairly new into my sobriety, and just starting to explore who I am as a Sober Person. Am I the type of Sober Person who walks my dogs at 6 am? Turns out that I'm not, but in the meantime I decided to give it a shot. While I was out there, I saw a bunch of (presumably) Sober People doing Sober Things, like walking their dogs and driving their cars. I was laughing at myself because I felt like I had joined a secret club, and I wanted them to see me doing it as well, like ""Hello Fellow Sober People. As you can clearly see, I, too, am sober and doing the Sober Things at this ungodly time of day, as we Sober People do."" And thus the SPGSD club was born. Because if I can be a member, then so can you!


Rules for club membership:

1) Be sober
2) Do a thing while sober (note: it can be a cool thing, or a hard thing, or even a day to day thing that you would have struggled with while drinking. Just do a thing.) (Note 2: it does NOT have to be at 6 am - afternoon and evening Sober Things count just as much)
3) Tell us about the Sober Thing you did so we can all see you, doing the Sober Things, as we Sober People do.

My submission:
I have gotten really into cooking over the past 10 months of my sobriety. When I was drinking, cooking was a chore to be tackled if at all (take out also being an option.) But now that I don't have the Demon Drink sucking all of my energy and motivation, I'm into it. Last night I made pan fried steaks and shrimp with a lemon thyme sauce and it... Was... Amazing. The shrimp was not overcooked, the steak was a perfect medium rare with a nice sear on the outside, the sauce had just the right amount of bite and was creamy and savory... Y'all. You are jealous. It was so good.

Now it's your turn! Brag it up and be seen and inspire us!

IWNDWYT ❤️

A few notes:

These monkeys have groups (like humans) that don’t drink, drink socially, or are heavy drinkers. They tested their colony and specifically chose those that showed behavior in the heavy drinker colony (chose to drink a certain threshold of alcohol even when provided water)

They had to be injected with the FGF/analog, in mice it was IP and monkeys it was IV. FGFs are a family of proteins, as of now we don’t really have a way to deliver proteins other than through injection.

Treated monkeys still chose alcohol, they just drank less.

I haven’t drank around them except for once in years.  I never explained why and I used to be the party one.  I don’t even want to go to this dinner.  I will be the only one not drinking, literally the only one. I know they wonder….hmm… why isn’t she drinking.  I know I should want to not drink, it never ends well and I shouldn’t care what others think, but TBH I’m jealous of them. I’m just so tired of the struggle.  I have been fighting with sobriety for 5+ years.  I feel like I will never get it.  I’ve done it all - AA, SMART, out patient rehab (3 times).  I always end up reaching for the bottle…I get so tired mentally and physically I cave.  I’ve had blood tests, all normal so no explanation there. I went to my normal AA meeting last night and just couldn’t admit drank again after a month sober….everyone there is successful, I don’t know how they do it. They spoke of being “happy, joyous and free”.  I’m successful at everything else but this.  I am on day 3 (AGAIN) at the moment but that probably won’t last.  

I keep thinking about my 40th birthday, same group of friends same dinner out except back then I was drinking and it wasn’t a problem (or maybe it was….I don’t remember) but that night was super fun.  Had a babysitter stayed out late but now I feel like I’ll just get through the dinner, come home, watch Netflix, go to bed.  I’ve gained weight over these last 10 years which doesn’t help and just feel so depressed. I know my attitude sucks and I’m trying to be grateful for all I have.  I guess I’m just having a pity party which I feel guilty about too (I feel shame/guilt about most everything).  Sorry just needed to rant.

Hey guys. I just want to start by saying that I wasn't going for this ""quit drinking and you'll start pooping rainbows"" kind of result from quitting drinking, and I don't want to sound like I don't realize that sobriety has saved many people's lives and changed them for the better. It gives me peace knowing that so many people have escaped from addiction and the ruins alcohol can bring. So please understand that I'm not negating the benefits of quitting drinking.

I'm dealing with the personal frustration of not feeling better, at all, in any way, after quitting drinking. I wasn't drinking as much as some do, but pretty much daily, with the mentality that there was no point in drinking if you don't drink enough to get a buzz. I have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol as I do many things. But I guess I expected to feel MUCH better after almost three weeks of not drinking. Now I have trouble sleeping (I didn't before), my skin is a wreck, I can't stop obsessing over food, I'm angry and anxious a lot, I don't feel the joie de vivre that I felt regularly before, and I haven't really lost any weight (mainly because I'm eating uncontrollably). I've tried to get back into a regular workout routine and am definitely going more than I was (which was a complete break for over a month), but I've been struggling because of winter weather and lack of motivation.

I have quit drinking in the past and did feel better, mostly as a result of my mental health improving, getting better sleep-- basically all the positive changes that happened in the past I expected now (and by this point).

I guess my question is whether or not anyone else has ever felt any disappointment with still feeling like shit (or worse) after feeling like they should be starting to feel better. I'm not trying to justify starting to drink again; I realize I'm better without it, and I'll only be making my life worse. I'm just kind of down and really frustrated this morning. Food obsession and anger have by far been the hardest things for me to deal with. Maybe I'm just becoming more acutely aware of them now that I don't drink. If you have any suggestions please let me know. I could use a little positivity and insight.",24,0

I am a 30 year old man, I live in England, and I am a big drinker even by UK standards.

My hobbies include going to the football (which is a boozy affair) running pub quizzes (free drinks all night for the quizmaster) and spending time with my family and friends (in the pub).

My family are drinkers, my friends are drinkers, my place of employment has a drinking culture and my spare time activities all include drinking. I am surrounded.

Part of me still thinks I don't have a problem. I mean, I always wake up in my own bed, I don't seem to upset people or get angry/violent when I'm drunk and I don't ever drink spirits (Hard liquor to the Americans). I also don't drink everyday. But. Once I have a pint, that's it. I will continue to drink until I've had my skinful, usually around 8-10 pints but often more. The problem is that there's so many opportunities to have that first pint.  This is why the 'cutting back' advice has never really seemed like a viable plan to me. I feel like my only option is to go tee total but doing so feels A) impossible and B) like I would be turning my back on everyone and everything I love.

I love my family, friends, social life and my job. I hate feeling like shit on Mondays, the 'beer-fear', and the excess weight I'm lumped with because of the boozing. I don't know what to do.

I've found this forum and the chat group invaluable for getting support and paying it forward with my own stories of wins and losses along the way.

Moments that took strength:
-Day 1-7 withdrawals, acceptance of my position and taking steps to get help
-Christmas Eve when I was passed a family members glass of champagne to hold while they took photos during an impromptu visit from santa. Without even realising I was doing it, I took a mouthful and in an instant walked to the sink and spat it out. Close call only! Phew!
-Designated driver on many occasions. I've found I quite enjoy for several reasons, mostly making sure loved ones get home safe
-Staying up to look after my SO after her having an absolute crazy night of drinking until puked more than I've ever seen anyone puke. 2-3 per hour for at least 4 hours. Shocking. She is better and sober now.

Just last week after a swim, a new friend bought me a beer and went to hand it to me. My instinct was to say ""thanks, but I don't drink"". Significant moment!

When I was drinking my whole day revolved around booze. I would think about alcohol constantly. I would even be annoyed at the constant thoughts of alcohol. I found I could only focus on other things when I was drinking with cocktail in hand, so my mind was free to think about OTHER THINGS. How pathetic is that. It’s so sad but so true. Obviously I still think about alcohol every day, but not the desire to drink. The desire to remain sober and not forget why I stopped drinking in the first place. As time goes on from the last drink, you can start to forget all the bad, or worse, think you’re “normal” now and can go back to a drink or two here and there. Nope - not letting myself fall back down that path again. 

Seriously, it is so freeing to wake up in the morning and get a glass of water, stretch, cuddle my animals, think about my plan for the day, etc. without thinking about my first drink. I notice I finally get to this point (not thinking about drinking 24/7) about 3 weeks into sobriety. But it just gets better and better. My new daily routine has taken shape and I’m really getting in the swing of life and living it as my true self, unencumbered by a brain soaked in ethanol. I’m so grateful I’ve come this far. I really didn’t know how I’d be able to do it, quit drinking, but knew I couldn’t keep living my life poisoning myself all day every day.

I was 28 at the time. I went to the hospital were I met a doctor which made see I had a problem, I was hoping to find I had a heart problem that obligated me to stop drinking, but i didn't find anything wrong with my body, only with my mind. 
I stoped drinking for 3 months, until one day that I thought it was ok, I learned my lesson and got back to drinking.( My father had/have issues with drinking, and also my grand father). So started drinking easily, and now I'm 30 and last weekend I've drinked without control, this wasn't the first time I drinked without control since my last stop, But this time I really felt I was fighting in my mind saying to myself "" time to go"", "" this is my last"" .. but I kept drinking until my limit. 
I got home, since the party was in my building, but I threw up my guts out in a Sunday night. Monday was terrible, I couldnt look to my girlfriend from shame, but I had to say I was sorry. Sorry wasn't good enough this time. We live together for 1 year, and we are together for 4 years. She said I had to solve that immediately, or in the long run she wouldn't he able to be with me, have children with me. 
A important  thing about the story. I go to a therapist for many years, he helped me many times, and also this one . But I struggle in believing I have a problem, even thought I know I have one. ( I think this is my brains trying to confuse me, and keep the source of dopamine flowing. )

It's my second week of sobriety and this morning I decided to sit down and write a list of things I like better than booze just to keep the cravings at bay. This may sound exotic to many of you but #1 was language. I had to stop there because I was just overwhelmed by the swarm of memories it brought back.

Warning: this is going to be a long post. And again, apologies for my English. It's not my first language.

Back in high school I was my teachers' greatest source of joy and despair. They realized I had immense potential, but I just couldn't seem to take real interest in any subject. That was until I turned sixteen and I stumbled into linguistics. Not that they were teaching it in my school, which was a mediocre, small town institution serving a working class community. We were constantly told that a good boy aspires to get a job in the nearby back-breaking, shamelessly polluting steel factory instead of becoming a drug dealer. Alcoholism was rampant in town and my own father happily followed the general trend. 

The nearest bookstore was fifty miles away, but I somehow managed to teach myself French. The reason I did that was that I was simply fascinated by its sound. I loved all those vowels I had never heard before. It took me one year to speak it decently, then I went for the classy stuff and decided to teach myself Latin. French had the lovely sound; Latin had the beautiful grammar.

I began getting good grades in all subjects for the only reason that I needed to convince my parents that sending me to college wouldn't have been a waste of money. ""See, dad? I could become a teacher"". Teaching was a privileged profession down there, back then. I was careful to catch my dad in one of his sober moments to tell him that what I wanted to graduate in was comparative linguistics. I didn't want chairs hurled at me.

Don't get me wrong: dad was quite a reasonable, accepting fellow when he wasn't drinking. But that was rare and you had to make the most of it while it lasted. I learned the meaning of ""seize the day"" at a very young age.

The nearest college definitely wasn't a first class one but better than nothing. At least I finally got to invest my energy in something I loved. I attended an Indo-European class and fell desperately in love with it. I told my professor I was considering an academic career in Indo-European studies. She asked me if I knew ancient Greek. I replied I didn't. She promptly killed my enthusiasm by replying, ""Then forget about it, son"". I proceeded to teach myself ancient Greek.

I spent the next ten years literally buried in books. By the age of 30 I could master Greek, Sanskrit, Old English, Old Norse, German both modern and old. Then I moved to a city where I knew the action was. I was 33 when I got tenure at one of the best universities in my country. Which pretty much made me an enfant prodige, I guess.

So I had done it. I was in a vibrant environment. I was surrounded by brilliant, inspiring minds. My head was swarming with ideas and I was finally free to express myself, I felt appreciated, I felt rewarded for who I was. I was happy. I was happy, at last. My first year there was absolute, unconditional joy.

Then I started drinking.

Something broke inside me. Today I know it's called imposter's syndrome. A voice inside me began to tell me that I didn't really deserve all that. That it was too much for me. ""Who do you think you are? How dare you be happy?"" 

I had never seriously engaged my deep conviction that life is having to deal with an alcoholic father; having to hope in nothing more than staying afloat in a dirty, miserable town; having to hide your talent because it makes you look ""strange"". I had never really acknowledged that happiness should be your fucking norm and the damn goal you should strive for. That happiness is fucking possible.

So I decided to throw my happiness away, because basically I didn't believe in it any more than I believed in unicorns.

I knew alcohol was poison. My father had very graphicly shown me. A year ago I would have said that I drank in spite of that. Today I know that I drank specifically because of that. It's not surprising that I simultaneously engaged in a whole array of other self-destructive enterprises. Getting into toxic relationships was the most egregious of them. My masterpiece was falling in love with a bitch whose days were spent lying on the sofa watching TV, cracking beers and yelling at me because I hadn't bought her a packet of cigarettes on my way back from work. ""I'm sorry, honey"", was all I could reply in self defense. Wrong answer, of course. The right one would have been: ""Get your butt to the store right across the street and buy your fags with your own fucking money, you lazy bitch"".

I went cold turkey for the umpteenth time two weeks ago. Another run to the ER, where I'm now considered as an old acquaintance. I can tell you 80% of the nurses there have Sanskrit tattoos designed by me. This time I need to make it last, though, because next time it'll be the psychiatric ward if I don't learn to love myself.

I never was one to indulge in alcohol. I always saw people in my family go the extra mile and end up dead or utterly destroyed. Then I turned 21 and of course through hanging with friends or being at concerts/special events, I ended up with a habit that lasted from 21-24ish.

The worst of the worst would be friday through sunday. Almost a full bottle of anything every weekend(day)  to ""have fun"" on the weekend. Either a bottle or cases of hard seltzers. I would wake up hungover, suffer for a day or two, and keep it moving. Around 24, I woke up one day unable to even hold myself up to sit. Could not walk without feeling super weak and I had constant hot flashes. Eventually I got the strength to eat a banana and I passed out shortly after. That was the worst of the worst and I knew from then on, I had to make changes. I stopped the binge drinking and decided ""Okay I'll just drink lightly from now on""

Now that I'm 25, I cannot even drink a single beer or take 1 shot without spending the night feeling like absolute shit. I always wake up the next day with horrible upper back pain near my neck and my left arm feeling sore. I'm not sure what it is but it genuinely makes me sad that I can't enjoy a beer without it ruining my entire following day.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I’m sorry for not responding to everyone yesterday, my job involves a lot of driving and I can’t check my phone. I’ll try to do better today.

This week in AA we spoke about giving reverence to the person inside us who is struggling to express themselves. I am a singer and writer, and those things were so stifled in my drinking that I never thought I would recover them.

When I was drinking I was like a broken piano trying so hard to make beautiful music, but my keys were missing and my strings were frayed and the only sound I could make was a disconnected jangle of broken notes. My noise was so loud I couldn’t hear the song of my own soul.

Now that I’m sober can hear my song and she is so much more than the timid little tune I could just barely hear when I stopped banging keys. In the stillness I can hear whole sweeping movements and tiny little measures and each sea change comes with a tide of new music and every day is a beautiful new dive into who I really am.

The first step in my journey was inspired by “know who you are” from Moana. I have crossed the horizon to find you. I know your name. They have stolen the heart from inside you, but this does not define you. This is not who you are. You know who you are.

We know who we are, underneath all the trauma and noise. We know we are so much bigger than these shitty bundles of bad behaviors and substance abuse. Nothing on earth can silence that voice.

I wish all of you the recovery of your inner voice. It’s in there, and as you practice these new ways of being and showing up in the world it will ring clearer than a clarion call, so bright that you’ll never lose it again.

Happy Wednesday and IWNDWYT!

IWNDWYT

Last weekend I screwed up really bad and I've now lost count of how many times. I've spent the last year trying to work on my mental health and all the triggers and reasons behind why I have a tendency to drink to the point of blackout and lose complete control, but I have probably not taken it seriously enough and still don't have a good enough grasp over what those reasons are. I 'for now' have a partner who has been so supportive and amazing but I feel like this may have been the last straw.

Things had been going great for a while and we felt closer as a couple than ever, we even spoke that day about how good things had been. We had been out in a different city to meet friends and then went to a gig. This is where I completely lost control of my actions, became sneaky and lying about going to the bar, even though it would have been obvious. Every time I went I said to myself I won't get another, my partner even called me on it and said I had 'one chance to stop now or ruin it all' and I couldn't stop even then. 

I'm completely and utterly sick of my behaviour and desperately want to break the cycle and start making better, healthier choices for myself, and I know that means packing it in for good. I've tried moderating and limiting my drinking but as I'm sure plenty of you already know, that is probably not going to work. 

I'm not sure my relationship is going to be okay this time, I've hurt my partner so much and she's lost so much trust in me and is understandably scared of me in those moments, I become mean and unpredictable. I don't believe I would ever do anything to harm her but I also don't want to ever be in a position again where I can't remember what I've done and have to be told how horrible I was and how much I ruined things and embarrassed myself and my partner. She deserves so much better than that.

So here I am on day 3 of no alcohol and I won't Be Drinking With You Today

Thanks",1,0

Sobriety has really unlocked such a successful and exciting life over the last 18 months. What’s most rewarding to me is the ability to navigate through challenging scenarios. Making better decisions during critical times, in my opinion, has been the most rewarding. 

Tonight, I had to drive to one of my businesses to fix something that had broke. It would have caused major issues for my employees come tomorrow morning. After my wife and I put the kid down for the night, I happily drove to the office, fixed the situation, and am back home (12 midnight).

I’m just laughing at the fact that had I been drinking, I would have most likely not drove all the way there, and would have let the issue push into the next day. Thank you all, appreciate you being here.",11,0

I'm not new to this subreddit, I tried quitting a few times and had a pretty good go at it about 2 years ago but fell off and began drinking last year. I'm pretty depressed about a few things in my life at the moment but don't have the time or money to see a counsellor/psych etc.   


I figured my new years resolution this year would be to try live a healthier life again. So far I haven't touched alcohol, ciggarettes or party drugs in 19 days. I've signed back up at a gym as I used to be really into training years ago and am slowly finding my love for it again but I can't help feel depressed about it all.   


I feel bored. All I want to do on weekends is sit at home and drink beer, play video games and escape reality. I hate myself for not being able to just have one or two and call it a night. There's probably a whole bunch of other underlying stuff I should probably talk about with a professional but as mentioned, time and money is an issue for me right now.   


Does being sober get better? Maybe I need more hobbies? But then I tell myself that I'm only searching for ways to fill the void of getting written off.   


There is beer in the garage fridge outside and I'm so tempted to grab one but I won't. I don't want to let my girl down.

Tonight I was getting off a 13 hour shift and when I walked outside a bunch of friends/ coworkers were outside absolutely trashed. Two were stripped down to their underwear. One looked like she had nothing going on behind her eyes. They honestly looked like they were having a blast and apparently had been at it all day. We walked down the street past a bar (I happened to be going the same way) and they invited me to have a drink. I politely declined and walked to my car and went home. 

Can I just tell you how happy I am to be home with my dogs? How happy I am to not be out there after working all day and night. How happy I am to go wash my makeup off my face instead of sleeping in it, ruining my pillowcases, and looking like a nut job in the morning. How happy I’ll be to feel fine tomorrow. How happy I’ll be to not throw up in the morning. How happy I’ll be that I didn’t drive my car drunk endangering everyone on the road’s lives. How happy I’ll be to not embarrass myself. Or piss my bed. Or break my ankle (again). 

I did enough partying for a lifetime. The money I spent on whiskey and cocaine now goes to crazy expensive French linen sheets and my growing nighttime skincare routine. And I’m ok with that. Actually I’m more than ok with that. I can’t believe I, the queen of Jameson herself is going to say this, but I prefer it.

But I hope today is my last day two. I don't want to get into *gestures wildly* just yet. But let's just say I'm 30, been drinking moderately since I was 20, and heavily for about 6 years. There are entire segments of my life that are just one giant black out. 

My husband, for what it's worth, has stuck by my ass the entire way. All the black outs, the reckless behavior, the fighting. Rehab and relapsing. He has stuck it out with me. He truly is a Saint. 

About a year ago he asked me to drink less. So we made rules. Only so many beers a day. No drinking before or during work. No drinking with specific people. They worked about as well as you can imagine. What the situation devolved into was just me hiding my drinking. Having two drinks and saying I had one. Knocking off wor early so I could have a few before I met up with him. And then I would just be back to drinking like normal. 

So, I want to mention real quick that his step dad passed in July due to liver failure. He was a long time drinker, exhibiting many of the sames signs I was developing. So he passed in July. It was very sudden and really hard on him. 

So, que two nights ago. I'm drunk. I start a fight with him about us not spending enough time together. He suddenly breaks down on the kitchen floor crying. As long as I live ill never forget what he was saying to himself. ""Alcohol is going to kill you. You're going to die and I'm going to be a widower. I'm going to lose you and I don't know what I'll do."" 

I just. I can't anymore. I knew I was putting him through hell but somehow this struck me different. He means the world to me. And the only thing he wants from me is to quit drinking. I know we are supposed to quit for ourselves, and not another person. But, until I'm strong enough to do this for myself, I'll do it for you baby.

I’m not sure what exactly flipped a switch in my mind. Maybe it’s finally being diagnosed and treated for ADHD (less impulsivity and self medication). I just woke up one day and realized out of all my vices, alcohol just had the least amount of value in my life. 

Right before I quit, I was feeling miserable at work and honestly for the last three years i’ve felt restless in every job which caused me to jump ship before I ever got good at what I was doing. I just found out I’ve made MVP for crushing my sales goal and i’m day 1 into a new month without crippling anxiety that I won’t hit quota. 

I pushed away a man who I was in love with because I just wasn’t the best me I could have been and used drinking as a way to relieve my anxiety every time I hung out with him. This lead to some cringe-y and embarrassing moments which i’m sure made me really unattractive. He’s also into his health and working on his business so at the time, it was clear that our values were not aligned. It sucks but I made those decisions. 

My sleep has improved and I no longer fight my alarm hitting the snooze button 100 times. I’m much more consistent with my workouts and hoping to get back to my PRs in my squats and deadlifts (the gyms were closed for awhile and it really took a toll). 

The only thing that I haven’t seen improvements in is probably my skin. I’ve read some other posters who’ve had similar issues (acne, dry patches, etc.) I gather it’s my hormones trying to rebalance themselves. I’ll take the short term pain for nice, not itchy skin that i’ve always wanted.

It’s never too late to quit. I’ve been binge drinking for 13 years but at the same time, I think you really have to want to change. I never thought I’d be here but I’m not even tempted at this point. I’m happy to still go out with my friends who still indulge. I can always DD. :)",13,0

To be honest I haven’t noticed any big problem related to alcohol, I work hard on my business, have a great relationship with my girlfriend and with my family and don’t drive and drink. 
I just had the habit of going to my computer and drink alone late at night working until finishing that bottle without bothering anybody. 
A few months ago I started using heavier drinks like scotch or tequila and suddenly the 3 nights became 4 or 5 yesterday was the last night I did it and got rid of every single drop of alcohol in my house (trowed it to the trash can).
Today I went to work at night like I used to but without alcohol, it’s unbelievable how productive I was and how good I feel right now.
I guess that feeling that I wasn’t hurting anyone in my life was just an excuse to justify why I kept drinking so often, deep in my mind I knew that the most affected person is me.

On the way back home to the city I decided i would drink for the rest of the day. Did a hard reset ~ changed my mind and am enjoying the fact that I overcame what could have been a major setback. 

It was dumb, but I did follow the plan and next year I hope to just tell them I'm not drinking ~ but this was my first time in such a situation.

It has been a while since I've had a daily alcohol habit, but I would still occasionally feel the urge to get blackout drunk now and then. 

I'm the type who waits for everyone to go to bed, then run out and find the nearest open liquor store. Get a pint of whisky and a few tall boys with the intent of saving some for later, but instead drinking until its all gone. Usually I can't wait till I can slip away and get those few hours to myself to drink and blackout. A night or two of doing this results in me getting that ""needy"" feeling about it again and my brain starts wanting me to get back to daily use. Then I get myself to chill out for a while, but I always end up repeating the cycle.

Over the holidays I was given a THC edible in the form of a muffin that was extremely strong (legal in my state btw). I ate the whole thing when it was recommended I only eat a quarter of it because I have a low tolerance for THC. The feeling wasn't exactly enjoyable and made me very paranoid, but ever since that night, I have absolutely no desire to have even 1 drink. 

I'm not saying this is some magic cure for alcoholism and I'm definitely not trying to encourage replacing alcohol with edibles or any other form of THC. This is purely only my personal experience that I thought may be worth a try for some. I could also be totally falsely tying the two things together as cause and effect when really it isn't.

On October 25th, I had my last drink. My cat had just had a health scare, and he needed to eat special food. I checked my bank account and funds were low. I needed food, my cat needed food, but most importantly I needed alcohol. I started doing my usual mental gymnastics to see what I could go without, food for me was always nixed first. And then I thought “maybe I can just get my cat the cheap food, he’ll be fine until my next check right?” I immediately stopped in my tracks and asked myself if I was serious. Am I really willing to risk the health of my cat for alcohol? Potentially harm or kill (urinary blockages are no joke) the small helpless creature that I love and keep alive… just so I can get drunk? That was the first time I ever considered quitting, and that is the day that I quit. 

That night as I was trying to sleep, I was scrolling on Twitter and saw Chrissy Teigen post a screenshot of the I Am Sober app, she had just hit 100 days. My stomach was in knots, I was filled with dread because I didn’t think I could get there, but I decided to just… try. I downloaded the app right then and there, and wouldn’t you know it, here the fuck I am. That’s why today is a huge milestone for me. 

Aaaanyways, I love seeing comparison photos, and I wasn’t expecting much for mine? But seeing these pictures side by side shocked me, and I’m just excited to share it.

I immediately regretted it when the words came out of my mouth and I had a sinking feeling as the server walked away to pour my drink. 

She came back and told me they were all out of [specific beer I had ordered]. Would I like to try something else?

It felt like one of those deus ex machina moments, a literal sign from the universe. A second chance. 

I said no. The sushi was delicious. The bill was cheap. I drove home sober and put on a movie, and I’m committed to Dry February now.

It took a full blown mental breakdown at dinner with my family as I was coming down from booze, coke, and M just after Christmas in 2018

Some of those good habits from 2019 have stuck. Thank god. No more drugs. 

Slowly over the course of the next couple years I found myself pickling my insides with IPA and wine once again. One bottle wasn't enough. 2 wasn't enough. Only the stupor that puts me to sleep was enough. 

Im feeling so good again after doing a month of abstinence. I've had days where all I can think about in my apartment alone at night is having a nice cold beer. Will that ever go away? 

I'm feeling good going into February, but I'm scared I'll give myself some slack one day and have a drink. I KNOW that I can't have one. One will turn to two which will turn into blacking out and making out with that girls boyfriend who I work with, fueling drama which I hate. Fucking anxiety. 

Moderation isn't in the cards for me.

To me, the word quitting implies weakness. Quitting implies you give up, or you don't want to try hard enough. Quitting makes it sound like this is just as easy as giving up, when sobriety has taken me real immersive effort, and 24/7 vigilance around potential triggers.

In reality, alcohol is what made me quit things, alcohol made me quit taking care of myself, quit being a good friend, quit eating, quit trying at work, quit making any efforts toward health, quit my hobbies, quit anything that wasn't just cracking open beers and watching tv.. and lets be honest, my short attention span had me quitting tv shows too.

For the first time since becoming a drinker I am starting things. I'm starting to take care of myself, I'm starting to reach out to my friends more, I'm starting to follow routines, and most importantly, I'm starting to believe myself.

This is one of the hardest things I've ever done. For the first time in years, I'm not quitting. I'm starting, I'm doing and I'm living.

I have tried Day 1 quite a few times. I spent years as a weekend binge drinker from about the age of 15 to then turning into an every day drinker now in my 30's. My partner drinks every day after work to unwind and that became my normal too. So I'd have a few drinks after work while cooking dinner etc. I rarely get properly drunk but it became an issue because I couldn't go a day without a few drinks. Sometimes that was 3 drinks and sometimes that was 8 drinks. This has been ongoing for years now.  When you're in an echo chamber of either people around you doing the same thing or just not actually telling people that's what you're doing, you kind of forget that it's not normal. Or at least, I don't want it to be our normal.  


I couldn't tell you the last time I had a day without a drink. In the last few years it would be very very rare. The last time I went a weekend without a drink? Years and years. It easily became as normal to me as eating dinner.

So here I am. Halfway through day 3. I'm not sure how I feel except pretty tired/unfocused. It's really hot here and I struggled to sleep last night. I found that soda and non alcoholic sugary cider has been a huge help. Where I live they haven't had a huge range of non-alcoholic options till very recently and it's amazing. I didn't feel like I was trying to replace my normal alcohol with those options, rather that they were really tasty and I just enjoyed having one after work.   


I don't feel like crazy proud of myself because I feel like if I do start to feel proud, I'll set myself up for failure. I know that doesn't make sense. My boyfriend has been a bit strange about it all, kind of encouraging and kind of discouraging at the same time. I'm not too worried about that just now. I'm focusing on my why. Reading This Naked Mind helped big time. I have listened to it a few times on audible now and while I liked it and agreed with everything said, it didn't really click. For some reason this time it just did and once I finished it (for probably the third or fourth time), I just didn't have a drink that day. Now I'm listening to a few other books that are similar. Not sure why I posted this, just a check in I guess. 

Keep going all, this group is amazing.

It’s been 45 days since my last drink and since I royally fucked up the best thing that ever happened to me. I got blackout wasted at a show with my boyfriend, got into an argument, and keyed his truck, and now he’s not my boyfriend anymore. It’s not the first time I got drunk and destroyed his things, but it was the final nail in the coffin. I hate that that side of me ever existed because I would never do anything like that sober. But I understand the fault is mine for picking up a drink to begin with. 

He came over tonight to bring back my things and we talked. It was one of the hardest conversations I’ve ever had, but it was cathartic in its own way. He said that a part of him knew that night was inevitable and he’d be right, because I am unpredictable and destructive as long as I allow alcohol to rule me. He also said he doesn’t hate me and that he doesn’t want me out of his life, which I’m trying not to read to much into, but there is a faint glimmer of hope that through sobriety I can one day make amends. He really is a wonderful person that I never deserved as long as I was giving in to my addiction. I just hate that it’s come to this and that I could hurt him like that. 

There are still times when I’m stressed out or sad that I think very briefly, “a drink would sure be nice right now,” but the thought is always fleeting. Alcohol destroyed what I had with the person I love most. In all it hasn’t been to hard to not drink, because my disgust with what I let myself become has put a sense of finality onto things. I will never drink again because the person I want to be cannot exist as long as alcohol is in the picture. I lost my love this time, but next time it could be my kids, or my life.

I’ve been lurking on this sub for too long. For as long as I can remember I have used alcohol to numb my feelings. This is especially true when there’s “an event” in my life that makes me have to actually face myself and my emotions. But I also do this on a regular basis, I am an everyday drinker. I go through a half gallon of whiskey easily in a week. I am a 30yr old woman who cannot remember the last day she didn’t have at least a drink. Even when I’m sick I drink. I drink to sleep. I drink when I’m working from home now. All I do is drink. Everyday. 

Sunday, my girlfriend broke up with me. I promptly found myself at my usual bar, drinking whisky as fast as it would go down.  Just waiting for the hurt to go away, and I thought “I’m about to do it again”. I’m about to black out every night, act out because I’m hurt and wasted. 

But this was a healthy relationship with a clean break. The first one in my life not to end traumatically.  

Yesterday, after work. I found myself at my usual bar with my usual friends but this time I thought “I’m NOT going to do this again”This is the time that I face my emotions, with a clear mind, without alcohol. 

I just wanted to post this here because I have seen the support that others have posted about on this sub for a long time and it’s a big reason I believe in myself that I can do this.  I’m starting this with the goal of making it through the month of February without drinking alcohol. 

So, TLDR; I will not drink with you today.

I worked at a grocery store, and as you can imagine over the past 2 years it has been insanity. I would work myself to the bone and then come home and drown myself in booze.

So. I’m a bartender and assistant manager of a dive bar. I make a lot of money and I have a great schedule. I’m not leaving my job at this time. I have been able to maintain my sobriety and change my schedule/ work habits to support myself. And it’s really working. My work even increased the variety of NA beers for me.  My GM is a supporter and a friend so that’s all great.
My dilemma is a little complicated. I can straw taste drinks to be sure that I made them correctly. But today I was offered a taste of a new tequila we’re thinking of stocking and I took the sip (less than an ounce) without thinking really. I said no to all liquor samples after that.
 I wasn’t that kind of drinker. I was a social anxiety drinker, the more I was talking at the bar the longer I’d drink and get carried away without recognizing how much I had. 
I don’t know if I should reset my clock or what. I’m really proud of my 30 days. 
I’m still working on sobriety rules that work for me. Can anyone relate?",1,0

I barely had time to brush my teeth much less keep up with the yoga and other self care that has been so crucial to my sobriety. 

Basically I’m a stressed out mess. I keep thinking how easy it would be to drink a few beers and turn my brain off. Rationally I know that’s not how it works, at least not for me. I’m not GOING to drink. I don’t even want to. I just want to feel better. How do you all protect your sobriety when life gets overwhelming?

So I (30m) have been drinking regular for about 4 years now and the last two years I have been drinking every two to three days from 2.5l beer to like 6/7l at worst. Sometimes a wine but never Liquor. 

I currently can't sleep because of anxiety and just a lingering feeling of unwellness. Sometimes my heart pounds faster but not Always. And I feel a little bit scared because I just read what stopping drinking cold turkey can cause.


The thing is I quit cold turkey a couple of months ago for 3 weeks because I got the shingles and it wasn't really bad (I guess the shingles distracted me lol).


I don't really know what Im asking here really. Maybe some words of encouragement and your stories? Oh and also stopped Smoking 4 days ago!

From July to September I didn't drink at all. From Oct to mid Dec I was drinking heavily on average once a week. Since then I drunk moderately once around Christmas and heavily once a week and a half ago.

Around September I had a severe bout of depression. Since then I've been suffering anhedonia most days. I also feel this certain sense of discomfort... maybe anxiety and irritability. I've also been having another issue where my jaw feels really tight and tense as does my forehead, and I have a lot of difficulty sleeping.

Do these problems seem likely the result of quitting drinking? I only just figured that the anhedonia at least likely is. And I wanted to ask about that specifically: I know it can take a long time for your brain to recover and to get over the anhedonia after quitting. But if you drink at all does that effectively mean you're back to square one?",2,0

I've been back on Lexapro for a couple weeks now and going to continue on it for another couple weeks and kind of  reassess.

The anxiety is a living hell.,"I’m a binge-drinking alcoholic. 29 years old. I don’t drink everyday. Sometimes I don’t drink for weeks. But when I do drink, I can very rarely control the amount that I drink. Sometimes I can get by with just a 6 pack of beers with friends and stop, but 8/10 times it doesn’t go that way. Beer after beer after beer for hours. Then I get sick and black out. I’ve been like this since I was a teenager. After these binges I try and go as long as I can without having a drink. Sometimes weeks, sometimes even a month or longer. This causes me to miss social events on purpose because I am afraid i’ll get too drunk. Or miss dinners with my family/fiancés family because I know there will be beer around and I don’t want to be tempted. When I do go out and give into that temptation, like I said 8/10 times it doesn’t go well at all. 
I am mentally ill. I have Generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and Pure OCD. I’m medicated and in therapy and I’d like to say recovered from those episodes. But a few days after I drink this horrific anxiety starts to cripple me. Anxiety so bad that I have to take sick days or PTO days I could have used for a nice vacation. Anxiety so bad that I feel like I am going completely out of my mind. A complete bodily take over of fear and panic. That is the worst part about these binges for me. I have so many reasons to stop, but this is the one that is driving me. I know what hangxiety is, but from research and talking to people with similar issues it seems like it only lasts a day or so. Mine lasts 2-3 weeks everytime after a binge, barely giving me enough time to enjoy normal healthy life until my next one. Thank you for reading. Any advice/words of encouragement will be helpful.

I am now approaching my second reset in as many months. In being a data nerd, my tracking has enabled me to see trends in my drinking and to find a correlation to life events such as a big changes, stressful situations, holiday party/family dinners, etc.

I tried dry January.  **I succeeded for 14 days and I learned how not to succeed for the rest of the month.**


Below is my sobriety since I have begun tracking this beast and since I began making a conscious effort to face my problems and make a change.  I started tracking before I decided to try and commit to a change. October and November are rough, but being able to visualize the progress made in December and January, two of the hardest months for me personally, is encouraging.

For any other data junkies my ""progression"" is noted below.  This is encouraging to me.


**October**

* 65% of days, 3-4 drinks (20 days)

* 23% of days, 5-6 drinks. (7 days)

* 6% of days, 6+ drinks, blackout. (2 days)

* 6% of days, sober. (2 days)



**November**

* 47% of days, 3-4 drinks. (14 days)

* 30% of days, 5-6 drinks. (9 days)

* 13% of days, 1-2 drinks. (4 days) 

* 7% of days, sober! (2 days)

* 3% of days, 6+ drinks, blackout (1 day)



**December**

* 71% of days, sober! (22 days)

* 23% of days, 3-4 drinks. (7 days)

* 3% of days, 1-2 drinks. (1 day)

* 3% of days, 6+ drinks, blackout. (1 day)


**January**

* 45% of days, sober! (14 days) 

* 10% of days, 1-2 drinks. (3 days)

* 26% of days, 3-4 drinks. (8 days)

* 19% of days, 5-6 drinks. (6 days)


**4-month picture (123 days)**

* 40% of days, 3-4 drinks (49 days)

* 33% of days, sober! (40 days)

* 18% of days, 4-5 drinks (22 days)

Feeling all the bad stuff 10x,"tl:dr : My drinking has become worse over the years leading into embarrassing moments and now what I have learned to be withdrawals. I'm trying to keep it together, but can't escape the damage I have caused. I plan on staying sober from here on out. Just losing my mind currently.

Hey all. Just wanted to share my story and how things are presently going on day 4 sober. Im a 39m been drinking since I was 17, the heavy drinking started around 30. Recently my drinking has been out of whack and control. I will drink every other day or so, sometimes into the next day - 3 days has been my max out consecutive days (thank god) but I never thought I was experiencing what is described as withdrawals. I'd always chalk it up to a two-three day hangover and never thought anything of it as of late.

So my good pals have always known me as a drinker - that's what he does, that's what he loves, he's not bothering anybody, not hurting anybody, so let him be. So I thought. Recently my friends have been commenting on my drinking habits and not really in a good way. Enough to criticize me to the point of being self critical while drinking (if that makes sense).

I went to Hawaii last March with a few pals and stayed there for a good while. My friend who lives there let me stay as long as I wanted, and I did. My friends don't know that I get blasted the way I do because they only get to see me once in a blue and never seen me live-in action drunkard style. I by nature am a very likeable person, I wear my heart on my sleeve so I think that's what hindered the confrontation after all these years. Anyways, I believe going to Hawaii actually worsened my habit exponentially. I out-drank all the big drinkers there and even made my friends, friends be like wtf?? Not in a good way, more like this dude is on some other level drunkeness...fast foward a few months...

I come back home to the mainland and continued what I thought was innocent drinking. So I thought. Ever since my trip to Hawaii I have been evaluating my habits under a microscope. I'm now at the point where I embarrass myself almost every time I go to hang out. As a matter of fact things that should have embarrassed me in Hawaii never computed because I was in such a fog at the time, now I realize I brought that back home with me.

My last bender Wed-Fri was so terrifying. I went over my friends place where he hosted a small gathering of mutual friends I was drinking 10% abv IPAs morning and night, Wed night thru Friday. In that duration of time I managed to make an ass out of myself to the point of my friends taking pictures of me in a mockingly way. I ended up at another friends house close by Friday night and made a fool out of myself again (I probably reeked of booze and had dragon breath at this point). When the beer ran out it was time for an uber, then all of the doom set in on the way home...

I had no beer in the fridge at home so I just passed out normally. The next day (Saturday) waking up was the first time I felt what a real withdrawal feels like. Definitely was an acute WD, and I had the feeling of wanting to die. Not only do I have the embarrassment looming through my head of the previous bender, now I'm panicking, nervous, sweating with a slight tremor and spasms. Later on I had insomnia and couldn't sleep after the first 24 hours of withdrawing. There's no more denying it, I have passed the barrier of mild hangover territory into full blown withdrawal land. And who's to say that I have not been going through them the entire time because of my frequent drinking? Thats the scary part.

The acute wd's have now passed and I'm feeling all the bad feels presently. All the emotions, all of the screw-ups and embarrassing moments, all of the times I secretly pissed someone off because of me being delusional about my problem. It's awful. I can't describe the feeling of knowing what you know you did wrong and being dead sober to deal with the lingering thoughts. I suffer from anxiety and it's 10x at the moment. I've been crying pretty much the entire day. I'm lost, I don't know what to do. All I know is I want to retire from drinking. I just can't deal with my past now and it's driving me crazy.

If you read all of this thank you for sticking around to hear my story. It's time to face the music and hang up my coat. ",4,0

But it brought me to where I am today, where I am committed to staying sober. I have realized that cutting alcohol out of my life is also allowing me to cut out toxic people. I have a new lease on life, and I am going to live it and love it with people who respect and support me. By abusing alcohol, I allowed another form of abuse into my life—a person who weaponized my drinking in order to justify his physical and emotional abuse of me. I have been in therapy now for a year trying to process the trauma of that relationship, and today marks my official freedom from that terrible chapter of my life. Sobriety for me is not just about not drinking, but also about learning how to recognize abuse and stay away from toxic relationships. Each day I am making better choices and setting boundaries. A month of sober days under my belt, and good riddance to alcohol and abusers. Thanks for listening!",7,0

I did this originally as a way to lose weight, or to ""get healthy."" It was just going to be an experiment. Along the way I found out a lot more about myself. Here's the list of thoughts I have at the end. 

1. I am a ""better person."" I didn't feel like shit every Saturday or Sunday so I actually grocery shopped and meal prepped. I did laundry every week and kept a clean house. It was honestly a miracle. 
2. I only started drinking for the social anxiety benefits. I am an awkward turtle when it comes to social events and alcohol always helped loosen me up. I realized I don' t need it to be fun. I still attended a basketball game an went to a brewery with friends and chatted and had fun without getting drunk! 
3. I realized I might have had a binge drinking problem. I have never been an every day drinker. But on weekends or at parties, I would start and not know when to stop. Sometimes I would drink 2  whole bottles of wine on a Saturday night.  I blacked out twice in December and once on Christmas Eve at my future-in-laws. Talk about extremely embarrassing! I've had numerous of these situations in the past and having a month of not drinking caused me to have to face them and realize it's not okay. That I want to remember everything. That I don't want my future in-laws to see me like that. 
4. I was forced to face my emotions head on rather than drown them in alcohol. I found that throughout the month I found myself a little bit more depressed. Feelings and emotions came up that I didn't even know I had. Every Sunday I would be extremely sad about having to go back to work all week. I was feeling inadequate and lazy at my job and I was forced to face that head on and actually analyze why I was feeling that way. I realized I was feeling unstable in my relationship and I wasn't able to just drink some wine and forget about it, so I actually sat my partner down one morning and cried and got all of my feelings out. We had a great discussion. I really and truly believe that becoming sober might have saved our relationship in the future. 
5. Being sober is incredibly difficult when you are surrounded by it. My parents drink, my fiancé, his whole family and all of my friends drink. I can't tell you the number of times I heard ""why the hell would you do that???"" in response to telling people I was trying Dry January. I also got a lot of ""are you sure you don't want one?"" I am scared to lose some friends through this. Any person who really cares about me should be supportive. 
6. I am thankful to the few friends who were supportive along the way offering kind words. Including the bartender at our favorite local bar who went out of his way to make sure I had some thing non-alcoholic to drink and supported me 1000%. 
7. I am going to continue this sober journey. I don't feel the need to drink anymore. I've got a 1-week vacation in Puerto Rico and my birthday this month. If I can make it through both of those I think that maybe I can be sober the rest of my life.

I genuinely was close to having ""just a little bit"". My mind is clearer, and like everyone else, once you have a little bit of sober time your mind lies to you that you can moderate yourself. I know thats bullshit. If I cant refrain after 4 weeks without, what makes me think that I'll be able to refrain after THAT DAY throwing away my counter, and feeling a fake ass feel good that has its leashes ready to be tied tight at a moments notice.


So, I basically just talked with people and distracted myself whenever I got super tempted. The temptation always happens for me when I'm alone by myself. I like having a little time to myself to be alone and focus on whatever I want for sure but I need to be careful because I can get lonely fast (texting and phone calls is great to have, but it cant replace socializing in real life together in the physical presence of others).

My story is I tried to get sober for years and after a stint in detox and a really bad post-rehab relapse, I finally took it seriously and stopped drinking on 3/28/21.

Unfortunately, in September with the mix of a break from my PhD and going back to work/school, I was really stressed and drank a bottle of wine. That was it and while drinking/the next day I felt so awful. It reminded me of what it was like to drink constantly and feel mentally and physically terrible 24/7. Since then I’ve stayed sober.

I’ve talked to my recovery group about this and my therapist, and everyone says it’s up to me if I want to restart my sober time from that point. I feel guilty not restarting it, to be honest. But, it also hurts to feel like I lost all that time between March and September. I never told my non-alcoholic friends about the slip, and one just texted me asking when my one year is (she knows i initially got sober in spring) to celebrate. 

Does anyone have any wisdom here for me? Should I celebrate the ‘one year’ because despite the slip it signifies the point in time when I really started taking sobriety seriously? Should I not celebrate because it’s not honest? Any thoughts would be appreciated :)",11,0

Basically, I wouldn't be able to have fun or do the things that I enjoy without alcohol.

For as long as I can remember alcohol was always present during every fun memory in my life.  Living abroad, parties, vacations, friends, everything.  It was hard to imagine what life would be like without alcohol.  I knew very well that I wanted to stop drinking but at the time I was willing to sacrifice all of my future fun and revoke my fun card.  I even thought that I had to stop shopping and buying all of the luxury items I loved because I thought ""what's the point of buying nice clothes to wear out if I won't be having ANY fun anymore?""  Also I live in south Florida and alcohol is a BIG part of the nightlife and culture here.  More liquor stores than McDonalds.

What I learned is that actually the opposite happened and continues to happen.  I actually have a lot more fun without alcohol.  Last month I went to a club I used to go to and actually drove there, used to Uber because I drank a lot.  Sipped on cranberry and pineapple juices which were $2 instead of the usual $11-$20 I paid for every drink.  I enjoyed myself more because I could remember the entire night and I didn't piss off the DJ with my old drunken antics.  Paul Oakenfold got really pissed when I bumped into his turntables back in 2018.  Also, I still shop and buy all of the clothes I used to.  Actually, it's better because I can actually fit into those clothes and my belt size went down.  Lastly, I'm at the point where I just don't pay attention to or think about drinking when I go out.  I even still go to the beach bars I used to go to but just order juices or soda.  Food is still the same and the atmosphere never changed.  I went through something similar when I quit cigarettes.  Everything I did I had to have a cigarette but eventually it got to the point where I forgot that I even used to smoke.

So if you're on the fence about quitting or are worried that your social life will become non existent I can tell you that in some aspects it will actually improve.

This past weekend I caved in and decided to show everyone my drunk self I managed to drink 10 times more then I ever had and in the morning I threw up for the first time and in that moment I have never been more dissapointed in myself despite the congratulations I got from my peers. I hurt me emotionally as I always saw myself as a fun guy to hang around but it seemed like my friends enjoyed me more when I wasn't myself.

Longtime lurker, first time poster. I want to start by thanking you all for being the reinforced drumbeat that’s driven my decision to try sobriety. 

A bit of context: I would have never, ever considered myself an alcoholic by present-day standards. I rarely binged, avoided boozing during the the weeks unless I was dating, and certainly never fled towards it in my darkest moments. 

That said, I hit the “three day hangover” stretch as soon as I graduated college - and it didn’t help that I’m a lightweight. I had hit the point where even just two beers would drive manic depression the rest of the week. 

At the start of the new year, I realized that my alcohol consumption hadn’t really paid dividends since college. I wasn’t generating meaningful relationships from it, I wasn’t improving my sex life, it wasn’t helping with work, etc. 

So I stopped. Completely cold. And I haven’t looked back since. 

Here’s a list of things I’ve accomplished since:

- I’ve lost 5 pounds and I have the energy to finally exercise like a madman. You can already see it in my face, which is noticeably thinner and my jawline is BACK. 

- My mental health isn’t swinging like a pendulum anymore. I feel intensely more in control. 

- I’ve started reading again. The depressive hangovers really would force long television or video game binges. These were coping mechanisms I leveraged to ignore my hangover-intensified depression. 

- I met someone I’m crazy about - and she’s sober too (total coincidence). We’ve gone on 4 incredible dates already and I’m swooning. I’m confident that the value and substance of the emotional connection thus far would be minuscule if alcohol had been involved. 

- Last - and most importantly - I’ve developed the confidence to say ‘no’ again to situations against my liking. I never really realized how little consideration I’ve had for myself over the years… especially when I’ve been so aware of the destructive nature of my hangovers. I’ve reminded myself that it’s liberating to accept and respect my weaknesses, set boundaries, and live more presently (which can be tough to do with substance abuse in a city like NYC). 

If I can do it, so can you. It’s really been wonderful. Thanks again to you all for being the positive reinforcement I’ve needed to begin this journey.

However the insomnia is starting to kick in and my body is SO tired but my mind is still awake.

I graduated college in 2020 and lived at home with my parents while I worked for a year. My boss was an absolute asshole- yelling at me and patients and nurses alike. I was on my feet 8am to 2pm with no food and no break. So I was hiding beers in bag to work and filling my coffee cups with them in the bathroom. I was coming home to hide in my room to crush whatever warm 6 pack I had hidden in my closet. I was fighting with my parents and making horrible relationship decisions. 

Sometime in May of 2021, I tried to break it off with someone I was seeing. I texted him that I was no longer interested in sleeping with him but I had some of his belongings if he wanted to meet at my regular watering hole to come collect them. 

We met up a week later and I was already 4 drinks in when he walked into the bar. We had a two more drinks before I walked out to my car to give him his stuff back. He suggested we get some food and I, being the naive intoxicated individual that I am, agreed. I drove us two streets over to a restaurant and on the way he crushed 3 beers from the beer cases I kept in my car (reserve stash during/post work). I told my mom I was getting food with some friends and I’d be home by 8pm. 

Before we went in he tried to kiss me and convince me that we could still keep hooking up despite me saying I wasn’t interested in having sex with anybody right now. At the restaurant, I go to the restroom and come back out to find he ordered margaritas. I drank half of mine when I remember him sliding onto my side of the booth. I remember knocking my drink over. Then I remember waking up in his bed, partially clothed, with my mom and brother knocking down his door. 

It was 11pm and I hadn’t responded to any of the 36 missed calls on my phone or the 23 missed calls on his. 

I dressed myself and let my brother drive me home. I showered and felt sore and achy- there were bruises but I was all too familiar with blackout bruises at that point. After I got into bed, I called him and asked if we had sex. He said yes. I went to sleep and woke up to a thunderstorm and spotting and the familiar feeling of a brutal hangover. 
I barely made it through a day or two at work before I came home, swallowed 27 benzos, and drank a bottle of wine. My brother found me again, in my room this time, and after throwing it up, it took me 3 days to sleep it off. 

I texted him a few weeks later and told him that what happened wasn’t okay with me. He told me I begged for it, that I was manipulating him and taking advantage of him. He told me he was a nice guy to a fault. 

Since then, I have had stretches of not drinking for 4-5 days but it always ends with a beer on Friday which turns into 3 on Saturday which becomes a bottle of wine on Sunday and then it never stops. 
I’m in medical school now. Trying to get through whatever hellhole lectures I need to for the day. I thought I wasn’t addicted or anything. We all need stress relief. I wasn’t blacking out like I used to and I wasn’t even drinking hard alcohol. Some days I could have one beer and stop. But if you drink 7 days a week, the one day you only drink one drink cancels out because of the 3 days you finished a 10% six pack. 

Last Wednesday, it was my friend’s birthday. It was going to be a casual get together with just 4 people and we were going have maybe 2 beers before going back to our homes to study. And I had two drinks there, passed out on the couch mid sentence, and woke up a few minutes later vomiting all over myself. I went to the bathroom and then I don’t remember. I was told I came back out as a different person. My eyes were glazed over and I couldn’t stand. They said they didn’t know what happened to me. 
I told them the next day the beer had expired. It wasn’t- it was the 5 beers i had at home on a empty stomach beforehand. My friend who’s house this was called me and said she was concerned this was becoming a pattern. I didn’t realize it. Was it? How many times had she seen me blackout? Seen me vomit? Fall on my ass? Keep drinking? 

I know this is already a novel but ever since last May I found that I didn’t trust my judgement. How much was too much? How did I blackout? How did I find myself in that situation? If I just keep drinking I’ll never have to actually acknowledge any of that. All this to say, it’s day 6 and I still don’t know if I’m ready to acknowledge most of the stuff in my head but at least I saw this one with a little help from a friend. I acknowledged this one and I’m going to try to do something about it. 

Thank you for listening to me vent.

 Good morning. 
 Our keynote is “Courtesy”.
 The Thought for the Day addresses the short sightedness of an alcoholic picking up the first drink.  At that moment we ignore the certain avalanche of negativity which must result from seeking a fleeting bit of euphoria. It is, quite simply, an insane decision.
  In my experience, this particular brand of insanity is not limited to alcoholics and drinking. Even though I haven’t drank for many years, I still tend to do things which cost far more than they are worth. 
 Procrastination, for example, ensures pain out of all proportion to the difficulty of the neglected task. Likewise, spending too much money on unneeded things brings remorse,  guilt and financial consequences wildly outweighing the pleasure of the acquisition.
 I am so lacking in self discipline that I must let God discipline me through the 12 steps.  
By God’s grace, if I live the steps and persistently obey the Divine Spark, one stitch at a time, God will provide the missing discipline. I will once again consciously walk in The Magic.

4446,2022-02-01 10:35:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/shxrps/protracted_laziness/,Protracted Laziness.,"I feel my last two relapses were partly an ""inability to relax"".  The compartmentalizing of ""Okay, it's time to relax, time to enjoy.  ...Why aren't I enjoying things?""

The theme of feeling ""bored"", which comes up a lot here. Bored, but not content.  Restless.

One of my strategies this time has been to just embrace boredom.  To try to accept that not everything needs to be exciting.  Embrace calm.  I like the nugget of wisdom that we should seek serotonin, not dopamine.

Whelp, so far, it seems to be working.  I'm content doing absolutely nothing.  Sometimes zoning out and hitting F5 a lot.  Sometimes zoning in on a movie.  Sometimes reading a chapter of a book.  Sometimes starting a page and accepting ""this isn't calling to me"".  Sometimes having the same healthy meal every day.  Sometimes not caring and having a chocolate binge.

Sounds great, but I'm always thinking long-term sustainability.  See...  I'm not a self-motivated person.  I almost miss the desire motivation of a Day II, when your ability to do things comes back. The newfound ability to DO things.

I'm pretty much as lazy as I was before I started drinking.

Gosh, is that really what I'm writing about?  Laziness?

Drinking does awful things to you, but at times that withdrawal anxiety would light a fire under my ass to get things done.

I still ponder if I have depression, though it's not expressing itself in negative moods right now.  Hard to say.

Long-term, I know this can't be sustained.  Maybe I'll get annoyed with myself, I don't know.

But short-term...  

I have to go back well over a decade, long before I started drinking to find a time when I had a calm like this.  No girlfriends, not recovering from a girlfriend, not seeking a girlfriend.  No friend drama.  No family drama.  No school drama.  No work drama.  

No drama.  None.

There is nothing going on in my life.

You'd think I'm on weed, but I haven't touched the stuff in years.  : D

Calm and lazy.

(Most of my major friends/girlfriends have been a bit more ""hey, let's do things"" and push me out of my stagnation.  I'm a good counterbalance to chaos.)

I'm not sure what I'm saying.  Thanks for listening.  Just good to periodically take stock so I can avoid any potential relapses before I have to actually struggle.  Guess I'm just worried at how lazy I am.  I'm sure somehow laziness can lead to relapse triggers.  Or maybe I'm doing more/better than I realize and not giving myself enough credit.

Anyone have tips on how to handle social events?,"For context, I'm a mid-thirties professional living in a major east coast city where after-work happy hours and weekend brunches are the most common social events.  

I've finally come to the realization that I simply need to stop binge drinking, which, upon further reflection, is the only kind of drinking I do, which means I simply need to stop drinking altogether. 

But I'm already foreseeing some problems.  How do you handle the pressure at social events? For example, on Friday my girlfriend and I are meeting with friends for a dinner and show at a nice Greek restaurant nearby.  I've been to this place before.  It is a ton of fun with music, dancing, excellent food, and . . . lots of booze.  I can foresee our table alone getting 4 or 5 bottles of wine plus miscellaneous beers and cocktails and, inevitably, shots.  

I'm already dreading it.  I worry I won't be able to say no.  Not for fear of ""looking weird"", but because I have always loved drinking in those kinds of environments, and I'm worried I won't be able to stop myself.  Every time I drink at events like this, I end up with a massive hangover that takes multiple days to clear, and I almost always do/say/text something shameful that I regret. 

Looking back over the years, my drinking has severely hindered my development.  I would have gotten much better grades in college if I didn't binge drink like a maniac.  I would have gotten into a better law school and, while I did much better in law school than undergrad because I actually applied myself, I still didn't do as well as I should have because I spent so much time either drunk or hungover.  

That has continued on into my career.  I am probably objectively what many people might call ""successful""--and I am proud of my accomplishments and grateful for the opportunities that were available to me--but I am acutely aware that I am capable of so much more if I could just stop wasting so much time drunk or hungover.  My entire life my hangovers have taken me a minimum of two days to clear, dating as far back as my teenage years.  For all-day drinking binges, like a brunch that turns into closing down the bars, it can take 5 days before I feel normal again.  This has been such a massive drain on my creativity and industrious and detracts from my ability to pursue things I really enjoy.  I would hate to find out how much time I have spent drunk or hungover up to this point in my life.  

I apologize for turning this into a rant but this is all sort of dawning on me at once.  I want to do a dry February first, just to see if I can.  But I don't want to become a social recluse.  It would be unfair to my partner first of all, and second I am an extrovert.  I care about my friends and need to interact with them.  

I would appreciate any thoughts or guidance.",6,0

Like a few times before, last week I fell back into drinking pretty hard and after a night out this last Friday realized it’s time to stop again. Now I’m having such weird and vivid dreams and terrible sleep (not that I ever had great sleep) but since I’m realizing this has happened the last few times it’s a lot easier for me to deal with. I feel like after so many days and weeks of either passing out completely drunk or being so exhausted from a hangover, my body needs a several days to reset to healthier sleep and the dreams are my brain trying to sort things out. It helps to know that it’ll pass soon and serves as a reminder of what alcohol is doing to my brain… and that it’s best if I don’t have a drink tonight. 

Just my random thought while still sitting here in bed after not a lot of sleep - but still happy I’m not hungover.",8,0

I wanted to thank you guys for being around. The support I’ve seen you offer others was a voice of empathy I really needed when I couldn’t provide it for myself. 

I don’t have much to give back. But I thought at the very least I would re-share a comment I posted in a thread here last year about how walking daily has made a difference in my life between my drinking and depression… even if I hate it. This isn’t an attempt to say this absolutely works, but how it worked for me personally.

I’ve walked about the length of the United States between the time I quit drinking and one year sober today. I’m proud of myself for that. 

I commented this post in a thread that talked about a quote from Jim Carey that sparked a lot of conversation and below is just something I shared with a commenter who asked me how walked helped me, and I shared my reflections. 

(I did make a couple edits to be more clear in the post below)

——

My original comment to the thread:
Since working from home I’ve started walking a lot more. While walking 10-15 miles every morning doesn’t cure my depression it definitely alleviates some of those surface level issues and makes my day a little less heavy.

(Here a commenter asked me if I could genuinely explain how it helping because it wasn’t helpful for them)

My Response: I think there can be a variety of reasons why it may or may not work for people. You don’t have to do tons of walking, even just 3000-5000 steps (this is like 30-50 minutes of walking) makes me feel a little better. I also want to acknowledge I know getting out and walking somewhere nice or fun is not a possibility for everyone given where they might live

For me, at first it was only “well I guess it’s good for me so I should do it even if I don’t want to” and I was pacing a lot because of anxiety, it felt better pacing outside, it also helped pass the time less painfully... it took months to evolve from there, or at least until I payed attention to what I was feeling.

My depression still hurts really f-ing bad. I’m seeing it like a stage play. The cause of my depression is the show playing on the stage (core issues), but there are curtains (symptoms of depression) hung around the stage so you can’t see what’s playing. Those curtains are a result of my depression not wanting me to see the main play. If I can pull some of the curtains back (fatigue, low mood, lack of motivation, loneliness, SI, feeling lazy, unaccomplished, etc) I might be able to see what play is actually showing and try to understand it.

Walking has helped me pull some of the curtains back so I can start to see what the core of my depression looks like and I can attempt to address it. It’s easier to try and see what’s causing my depression when I’m not curb-stomping myself abusing alcohol to cope and just generally being very mean to myself.

Just for ease, I’m gonna share it as a list of things I’ve noticed in the past year.

————-

1&amp;2 are the most practical ones, the things I can always fall back on without fail, after that are things that evolved with it.

1.	⁠It makes me feel like I did something with my day, so even if I go right back to bed “at least I got out and walked today” I can’t accuse myself of being a fat lazy fuck when I burned 700-1200 calories and know I got sun and exercised my body I often get tired too especially by the end of the week, but I’ll take the physically tired and makes me need to go to bed tired instead of the depressed I’m tired because I can’t sleep.

2.	⁠It makes me feel less terrible if I fall back on something like ordering a pizza because I’m having a really bad day. “At least I worked some of the calories of this off” Again, I can’t call myself a fat fuck after burning 700-1200 calories. I did the work to deserve that break (I find that especially helpful when I’m stressed and want to drink, junk food isn’t much better but it’s a better direction)

3.	⁠It gives me time to think, I reflect on therapy and my pressing thoughts while I’m out and type a journal while I walk to work through things. I can process things easier when I’m not at my desk or trapped in my apartment. My thoughts are often repetitive, so when I use this time to work them out, it brings me some relief, and a new topic for my next session

4.	⁠When a thought becomes to much, my brain is too loud, I’m overwhelmed, Anxiety makes my chest feel like it’s going to burst, I just run. I run away from my problems as if they can’t catch me like I’m a child believing this is a legitimate solution, with absolutely NO SHAME. Not to reference family guy but when I run away like that- I can’t help but think of the  “you can’t catch me gay thoughts” gag and by the time I’m exhausted and thinking about that dumb joke, my head is on a bit straighter (No pun intended) I don’t even run for that long, I just escape myself after 2-3 minuets of HARD running. If the thoughts come back I run hard again until my brain is mush and all I can do is count my foot steps while catching my breath. Pretending to be a werewolf in the woods also makes running feel fucking awesome even if it’s silly.

5.	⁠I’m motivated by exploring, I lived where I am for 3 years before finding out I live a twenty minuet walk from a long bike trail along a creek. I see a lot nature, hear a lot of nature, smell a lot of nature. It’s different than being in my shitty low income apartment, it makes me feel like I have a chance to escape one day even if for a minuet.

6.	⁠It makes me have to keep it interesting. I play Mobile games that incentivize walking, I sing music loudly while I’m out, I make playlists that I can walk to the beat of, I fantasize and exercise my imagination which has been crippled due to drinking and depression. I make up short stories, come up with new art to make, make music videos in my head. Recently had a fun little adventure in my head imagining what I’d do if I blinked and I was in my old office job six years ago. Some of it involved how would I convince my current therapist I’m from the future without them thinking I’m mental haha. I listen to a lot of music and scroll new music, listen to podcasts, scroll Reddit, sometimes I get library books and walk while reading. On the weekends there’s a specific bench I stop at and sit and read for an hour just to be out. Sometimes I call someone to talk if it helps keep me distracted. I mentioned eating junk food, I’m fortunate enough to be able to walk to a grocery store from that trail as well. If I make myself do that walk imma buy myself that candy bar or bag of chips I wanted and maybe buy myself a coffee.

7.	⁠It made me grateful for my mobility. It took a whole year for me to appreciate that. But even the past couple weeks I couldn’t help but think about how devastated I’d be if I didn’t have walking as an escape. It happens rarely, and I usually catch it after the fact, but when I can catch a moment where I’m actually just breathing, and I feel a breeze and the sun things feel like they’re not going to collapse around me. It’s like not existing for a moment and it’s peaceful.

8.	⁠I see so many animals, and somehow it makes me feel real. I don’t know how to describe this one aside from I feel like I exists when I see other living things. Imagine the difference between seeing a video of a kitten, and being able to physically play with a kitten. That feeling is consistent every time I see an animal. I’ve found some cool animal bones too which is a bonus.

9.	⁠I added bringing a travel mug of coffee in the winter. It’s small and dumb, but especially when it was colder out. It just felt so fucking good to be outside in the cold with hot coffee

———-

There’s a lot of days that I don’t want to do it. If you asked if I liked exercising I’d tell you no haha. I try to let myself rest if I really just can’t.

It’s hard like 80%, if not every time. I’m rarely just out of bed with enthusiasm to get outside to just do it. I probably wouldn’t be able to tell you I got out of bed wanting to do it a single day in the past 3 weeks. The days I do it’s because I’m so overfilled with anxiety that I NEED to be on the move because it’s the only thing that brings me relief. I spend more days convincing myself “I just have to do it today” and try to remember I’ll feel better about it once I’m in it. I try not to think ahead and worry about if I’m able to do it again tomorrow, or next week, or next month. That becomes too overwhelming and just frighten and discourages me. My cat biting me when he’s done being nice about asking for breakfast also helps me get out.

It’s so hard that “just do it” is an oversimplified answer, but it’s not simple to just do. That frustrates me often.

None of this happened over night, I’m honestly surprised by the list I wrote myself because I didn’t ever reflect on it so concretely before. It sounds overly simple and too good to be true, and reading it back to myself even leaves me like, it literally sounds too easy. To steal a phrase from my T that makes me cringe but endears me, it sounds too pie in the sky. I’m actually kinda mad they were right with that analogy.",13,0

Granted, my friends don’t have a problem like me; but it’s that stigma, where you don’t want to admit you have a problem to the people you’ve loved and known for years and make future encounters awkward, and you’re personally working on it, but it’s that ability for them that, “yeah I can have a drink at 11:30am with my friend during lunch, and that’s just it for the day” that keeps sending me back. 

I don’t know if I’m the only one or not, but it’s the social stigmatism that makes it so hard. I don’t want them to know about my problem and damage any future events, invitations, or even just a hangout.

4457,2022-02-01 08:02:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/shug84/dose/,Dose,"So, basically, 40 years as a daily drinker. During that time my daily dose of alcohol never really changed by much. It stayed pretty much equivalent to a 750ml bottle of wine/day.

750 x .13(approximate concentration of al in wine) = 97.5 ml of al/day, say 100 ml/day.

At one or two points in my life I was low on money. I was never really broke, but I had to be frugal. So, I tried different methods to keep my costs down, but still maintain my daily fix of alcohol.

I found that you can get like giant bottles of vodka and drink for cheap. But, doing this, buying giant bottles of vodka, lead to over drinking, which I didn't like. I had a cousin who basically drank a liter of vodka per day. She went crazy and died young and alone. She would call me up, drunk, and start some sort of incoherent rambling. After a time, I would just hang up.  It wasn't a pretty sight.

Anyway, for some time I settled on buying 200 ml bottles of some cheap kind of vodka. 200ml of 100 proof vodka has 100ml of alcohol, the perfect dose for me. You can get a 200ml bottle for under $5, as opposed to maybe $8 for a cheap bottle of wine.

4464,2022-02-01 06:43:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/sht1v9/day_1/,Day 1,"Hello everyone,

I've stalked this sub for years and have finally made the decision to engage by creating an account.

A bit about me: I'm a 37 year old man living in Australia. As one can imagine, alcohol is an inescapably large part of our culture here - at least for people of Anglo/Irish backgrounds and similar in my experience. 

I first took up the bottle at 18 - I remember the first time I was drunk out of my mind (FIFA World Cup party in 2002) before returning home and vomiting throughout my room. Despite feeling like death for several days afterward, it must have been love at first sight and the bitter seeds of later abuse were planted. Anyway, that little introduction to the world of booze somehow lead to about a 2 year pause on drinking.

Of course, as many of us know, this break was not to last and became mostly weekend benders until age 25 when I travelled overseas for a few months. I don't think I spent a single day sober during it and went so hard I remember having considerable pain eating at times (alcoholic hepatitis? Who knows). Realising I was well down a dangerous path, and figuring I'd probably hammered my liver into a pulp, I quit for about 2 years.

Fast forward to a job in an agency - not a fun place to be as a sober person. Eventually 80+ hour weeks and incessant pressure to be part of the team lead to me resuming my drinking career and has steadily gone downhill for the following ten years. A litany of embarrassing memories have followed at birthdays, weddings, social functions, work events and even the wake of a school friend who died of alcoholism at 35. The irony of getting wasted at that last one makes me shudder. I thought, man you made an ass of yourself, you have to stop. Did I? Of course not.

The whole pandemic has been a mess. I've spent far too many days ""working remotely"" when I'm honestly just drinking from a mini keg of beer or even mixing in whiskey to up its potency. This all starting early in the morning, hiding drinking from my wife (which I am sure she is aware of but chooses not to raise with me). Polishing off six-packs of beer just about every day and feeling barely buzzed at all, and hating myself at the sheer pointlessness of it. Just last week I did twelve in a day and even then felt fairly ok. Two years ago that would have seemed an absurd amount even on a big night.

I've tried a few things over the last 3-4 years, namely NLP counselling, prescription Naltrexone and Acamprosate. Honestly, none of these seem to work and I frankly lack the money to pursue more aggressive treatments. As such, I'm kind of lost as I hoped that pharmaceutical treatments like Naltrexone would at least help, since it evidently does for some others.

I could write a thick novel recounting all the other anguish, embarrassment, money wasted, ruminating, hangovers, promises made and broken. I don't see the point in that aside from accepting that I must change or I will ultimately die from this disease. 

It's comforting to know that every day many of us heroically fight the slippery slope that leads us down this terrible hole of a horrible but ""socially acceptable"" addiction. I just thought I'd introduce myself here, in the sincere hope the community we have can help me find a way to dig myself out, too.

Maybe it’s all the juice I’ve been drinking instead? I would love to shed 15-20 pounds and just figured I would’ve noticed some sort of improvement by now.

Literally right now. The consequences of problem drinking may take a bit longer to address and in some cases irreparable damage may have been caused, but in truth and in fact, the drinking problem can be solved the moment that you read this post. The issue with an addiction is that it clouds the simplicity of the solution to the problem because we are chemically manipulated to try and solve the problem with the problem, and that’s an untenable and illogical situation. There is therefore only one solution to the drinking problem and as I have said already, that solution is available to everybody this very second.",8,0

4479,2022-02-01 03:08:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/shpsh6/dry_january_reflections/,Dry January Reflections,"I have been flitting between drinking ""now and again"" and stilts of not drinking for a while, whenever I felt that I was losing control and drinking regularly. Most recent of those times was over Christmas. Drinking too much, totally failing to handle difficult family relationships and being a bit of an obnoxious ass - a defence mechanism that sober me can keep in check.

So I decided, late on NYE, that I was going to do dry January. I had also decided over the Christmas period to get back on my bike and work towards some ridiculous stretch goals this year. Making those two decisions together has turned out to have been incredibly fortuitous, providing a 'why' every time I thought about having a drink.

The first week of Jan was forgettable. I had overdone it over Christmas, felt rough, and wanted nothing more than clean food and drink.
The second week, I started riding. And immediately remembered why I love it. The sense of freedom, of being liberated from the pressures of life. Where the only thing that matters is keeping going, and that's straightforward - you just keep the pedals turning and stay upright for as long as it takes.

Week 3 I set up the turbo trainer indoors so I could ride even in the dark and wet mornings.

On 30 Jan I did an indoor ride with a big mountain pass in the middle of it and I decided in the moment to just go for it. A 40 minute flat-out effort, begging for it to stop, but keeping on going regardless of pain. And I made it. And grinned all the way down the other side, knowing I was fitter than I thought, and more bloody minded, and damn near anything is possible if you put in the effort and keep going when it hurts.

This month I have learnt so much about what it is to be sober. I have so much energy it is unreal, I am happy in January for the first time that I can remember. I have done more cycling in January than I expected when I set my goals and a 300km ride in June is now a very realistic target rather than a scary stretch goal that I'm unsure is even possible.

I also learnt that I do get cravings. Not badly, but they're there. I don't like that. I am sure that they will get worse if I continue the cycle of allowing myself to drink until I start to feel like I'm losing control and then stopping again for a while. I need to sit with that knowledge for a while.

I also didn't tell anyone but my partner that I was doing dry January unless drinking came up. That helped. I still don't want to face the 'shame' of being sober to my friends and family (it's not shame. It's fear. It's definitely complex. I don't think I have the vocabulary yet for why I can't do this yet. I'll get there, but it probably needs more time on the clock).

One conversation towards the end of Jan stands out to me. We went to dinner with a friend of mine...
""I'm not drinking""
""aaah, designated driver""
""yes, and I'm doing dry January""
""oh! Oh well, only a few days to go before you can drink again!""

And she was deadly serious in offering that consolation. I just sat there thinking that I had a ride planned for the next day and didn't want it to suck, so I was happy to turn it down.

So here we are, 1 Feb. Dry January is over and I can drink again. I don't want to. Part of me definitely would like a drink. Omg would it. But a bigger part of me wants to ride my bike.

I can't remember the last time I felt this healthy, this excited about the future, this awake and alive.

I'm not good with finalities and ""never"" so I don't want to say that I won't drink again. I might. And it will be OK if that happens. I'm not counting a streak because it would break if I drink and I know it would take my resolve with it - but currently I'm 31/31 days sober. At least 95% of days in 2022 spent sober sounds like a good goal. A stretch goal that sounds kinda scary right now but also just about achievable. Like all the most rewarding goals.

Thank you everyone for normalising not drinking for me. I usually lurk. But seeing regular posts about not drinking has been fundamental to me accepting that as an option - even a possibility - for myself. I just needed time to work out my why.",23,0

I feel good, I'm sleeping ok, keeping busy, doing well at work, spending plenty of time with my children.

My first attempt at a self-medicated detox failed. I basically kept drinking and hammered the valium as well.

My second attempt worked. I went from 50 units a day to zero, and used street valium to manage the withdrawal symptoms. I used a high dose initially (80mg) so actually felt very little withdrawal. I tapered this down quickly and by day 4 didn't need valium during the day, just to sleep. Then I tapered off more slowly but have now had three nights of decent sleep with nothing.

I realise a self-managed detox using black market valium goes against almost all medical advice - but for me this was the right choice. I was not ill enough to get an emergency hospital detox. And the community drug and alcohol team (who I am engaged with) required me to demonstrate controlled drinking and tapering for a couple of months before they'd consider a medical detox.

A good friend who has been sober nearly four years has bought me a lovely diary to capture morning and evening reflection - plans for the day, gratitude, an affirmation, etc. I've been eating much better, starting to get active doing long walks and a swim.

My main focus now - beyond just maintaining sobriety - is to get fit and lose weight. I'm 120kg and average height, so quite severely obese. I've also got some plans to improve my living space, and to take up meditation.

4483,2022-02-01 02:04:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/shosf8/400_days_today/,400 days today.,"I’m 400 days sober today and 1 month off of weed. 

I tried for such a long time to get a few days under my belt. I lived with the guilt of waking up every morning not remember how I got in bed. I was going through the motions just waiting to get drunk. I hated it by the end but my body still wanted it. 

I’m so grateful to be sober. I’m able to be present for my partner. I can do things I never thought were possible now. My life has so radically changed in the last year and a big part of it is because I stopped drinking. I got married. Started tattooing. Found passion for art again. If you told drunk me where I’d be today, I would laugh in your face. I remember crying ugly when I hit one year. That hill felt insurmountable, like asking me to climb Mount Everest barefoot. But I did it, one day at a time. Eventually you just kind of forget your walking, step by step, and you’re able to make serious progress.  

I was killing myself slowly with alcohol. I knew i was an alcoholic before I got to college. None of that changed how I felt about it til I was just TIRED of it. I get that you can’t convince someone to get sober, they have to do it for themselves. I wish I could though, I have friends flirting with sobriety, friends I can see hurting but not ready to change. It’s not up to me to fix them, I have to take care of myself.  But they know I’m here for them when they’re ready. 

I still have bad days, days I think about alcohol too much. I remember, a little past 300 days, I stopped and looked at the liquor aisle of the grocery store a little too long, and it felt like the ring from LOTR calling to me. I started to think what if I just had a little, I’ve been good. I knew better but it terrified me all the same. I think I just left the grocery store and went home and cried. It scared the ever living shit out of me to know I was still under its thumb in some way. 

There’s power in knowing you’re an addict. I never was one for the 12 steps but I think some things still ring true for me. Admitting you have a problem, knowing you’re powerless over it. Acceptance. 

It felt like I buried my best friend last year, and at times I do miss them. Alcohol was good to me for a time, protected me and offered a coping strategy that worked when nothing else did. But I outgrew them and I’m grateful for that. Looking back on it, they’re a shit friend, and we took advantage of each other. 

I’ve rambled here but maybe something resonates with someone struggling to keep a few days under their belt. I promise you this, it’s worth it. 

I just wanted to share that I hit 400 days and I’m proud of myself. Be kind to yourselves. You can do it. 

I’ll never drink again, I know it’ll be the end for me. There’s strength in that, having that ultimátum. At least I hope so.

I'm so angry at how much of my time I've wasted to hangovers and romanticised pity parties - I owe my husband so much. I am so grateful and lucky for him consistently being team me.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I had originally written a post on the coattails of yesterday’s music post but upon seeing the date today I decided to write something different.

Trying something new is hard. When we decide to give up drinking we need to find things to fill in the space of our day so we don’t cannibalize ourselves thinking about not drinking. We also don’t give ourselves the space and grace we need to keep going if we fall down. We believe that we should be flawless, that quitting drinking should be as easy as becoming addicted to alcohol was. The difference is that becoming addicted to alcohol happens mindlessly. We need to utilize mindfulness to undo our addictive tendencies. 

I have found that doing something as simple as a short morning meditation makes all the difference for me. It gives me something to munch on so I don’t cannibalize myself by thinking about not drinking. The Big Book of AA has Upon Awakening although the god stuff is a bit much for me. I personally use the thought of the day from the [Hazelden Foundation](https://www.hazeldenbettyford.org/thought-for-the-day)

Share with me your favorite books, podcasts, songs, YouTube videos, creators, influencers, whatever material you like to munch on to keep yourself sane while you travel this path.

I started to have a lot of symptoms like loss of sex drive, increased weight, trouble sleeping. Then a few months ago, I started having sleep paralysis. I decided to ween for a couple weeks since I was obviously dependent. I could barely even do that properly, frequently going over my self imposed limits and buying new bottles. But I eventually did it, right in time to go out of town for the holidays where my family does not drink (religious). After coming back I have kept it up. Since it was a secret, I don't have many outside pressure to drink since I never did it socially. But I also have no one to share my achievement with either. I have lost about 7 pounds and don't really miss drinking other than wanting something to take the edge off at night.

I'm so angry at myself because I had made it to 352 days and I ruined it over... heartbreak. I hope it's okay if I rant a bit here, I honestly don't know what else to do.

I have childhood trauma, depression and anxiety that all caused me to abuse alcohol for years. last year, shortly after my 27th birthday it was getting really bad. after almost getting thrown in the drunk tank and then self-harming, I decided I needed to quit or I'd probably commit suicide.

the last year has been challenging but great. quitting didn't solve everything but it allowed me to confront my problems. I've felt so much healthier and happier. started going to therapy and AA, patched up some friendships that I had basically sabotaged, made strides at my job and with hobbies. even though there were so many low moments and temptations, I managed somehow to not reach for the poison.

then someone reappeared in my life who I've always had really strong feelings for, but who was committed to someone else and I accepted nothing would ever happen with. he was a year separated from his partner. we spent around two months together and I found out that I wasn't wrong about the connection I thought we had. it was the happiest, most fulfilling time I've ever spent with a person. I even inspired him to look at his own problems with drinking (our first memories together always involved alcohol).

then out of the blue, he went MIA on me for a few days. I could tell what was coming and finally he told me he loved me but wanted to make things work with his ex because they have a kid together. I was angry and devastated. a couple of days passed where I felt completely numb but then the next day it got too much and I drank a 6-pack of beer and a flask of whiskey and made myself sick.

now I'm on day 2 of an awful hangover, anxious and depressed, and all I want to do is reach for a beer to take the edge off. I can't believe I ruined all of my progress over this. I can't express how angry I am at myself. It's almost my 28th birthday and I thought I was going to celebrate it with such a great milestone, but now instead I have to do a reset. how can I not be so hard on myself about this? I don't know if I can start over.
