My scalp is the area probably most affected. My lips are always dry and cracked and peeling too. When I shave it’s pretty hard not to end up with a bunch of cuts because my face is so dry. My skin also feels really sensitive to touch and temperature and I get tingling sensations that spread across my body.

I have IBS so no doubt that’s dehydrating my skin too because I lose fluids.

I drink plenty of water but it never seems to hydrate me. The last time I was sober I didn’t drink for nearly 3 months, but my skin was still bad. So I’m just wondering if maybe it took longer than that for some of you to see an improvement in your skin?",2

I've always been a big drinker, but it got worse when the pandemic hit. I started slamming a bottle of Bulleit Rye a day for about the last 3 months. At the request of my sister, who's been through rehab, I voluntarily checked into a facility for fear of severe withdrawals. They gave me benzos and monitored me for five days before letting me out (I'm ok).

I'm not exaggerating: what I saw in there was hell. People shaking, convulsing, vomiting, screaming and talking to things that weren't there, stumbling around in a stupor like the walking dead. I was seeing the future I was headed toward if I didn't stop.

It blows me away that this drug is so readily available and accepted by society. Please, if you think you have a problem, reach out for help or see a doctor. No one drinks less over time. And what I saw in that facility scared me to death. One guy admitted that it was his tenth(!!!) time being admitted.

I knew I was in a bad spot, so I swallowed my pride and reached out for help to my sister. It was the hardest thing I had to do– tell my family, my girlfriend, my friends. But once I did, I didn't have to lie anymore. There was a weight lifted and I could face the problem head-on.

I just wanted to share my experience, and I hope it helps someone. The best of luck and health to everyone. I will not drink with you today.",110

What's the point?","A week and some days ago I relapsed hard, binged for the entire time on quite a bit of the hard stuff and decided I didn't want to continue back to old habits.

This time I wanted it to be different, it hadn't been as bad as previous attempts to quit and I was following a taper but was finding it hard to manage, and finally asked a friend (for the first time, ever) to join me at the doctor's office to see if they could prescribe something to help with the first set of bad withdrawals, and to have someone checking in on me.

My friend was very supportive, the doctor however was not. My friend and I talked about my addiction issues (she's known but never helped like this), was happy I reached out even. She gave me a one day token to encourage me to stick to it this time, and my only options were hospital or try another doctor in two days, I waited and thought about it, not my first rodeo I know when I need emergency help.

Very early the next morning I was having some odd withdrawals I hadn't before and went to the hospital, she texted with me back and forth as usual for a bit, all was well.

Today is better, saw my doctor and I'm on day 2 officially. I figured I'd give her a call to distract myself with some normal conversation, went to voicemail, no biggie.

She texted me, asked what was up and I said not much. She asked how things were today and I gave her the rundown on how I was feeling, you know a bit shaky, anxious and avoiding cravings, that I followed directions and will be seeing my doctor daily for the next while. Asked her how she was doing.

A little bit later she starts texting me in a rampage accusing me telling me she can't be my only support (she knows I have a list of supports) and that I made her put in effort only to waste it, she started telling me to tell other people about it, they have a history of making me feel worse and triggering my drinking so I explained that and she kept going off.

Her missing a call from me makes her anxious, she can't talk about my issues. I said okay, I have supports in place and I won't bring it up. That also made her angry.

Apparently I don't get it, I never asked her to be my only support, just knowing a friend knew I was going through this was so much help, it added a bit of accountability, and for once a friend / family member didn't just rip in to me and list every single fault about me and how I've failed.

I regret reaching out and asking for help, I feel fucking embarrassed and ashamed and now I feel like I can't talk to anyone I know ever again about anything I'm going / gone through.

I feel broken, and just ready to cry. Why bother ever talking to anyone about anything when they just resent you for it?

Sorry, I just needed to vent I guess.",11

Fear is my biggest enemy,"Hi all. Today marks the 21st day that I have chosen not to drink. It has been over 2 years since the last time I could say that. But instead of being overjoyed like I had been for the first couple of weeks, I have spent the last 3 days feeling sad for no reason and just couldn’t shake it. Today, I wanted a drink so badly. So instead of pushing away the thoughts of drinking, I decided to embrace them, but to also follow them all the way through to the inevitable ending. I let myself enjoy the thought of getting thoroughly hammered, how my body would feel, and how all of this weird anxiety would just disappear more and more with every drink. Then, I let myself remember what else would disappear with each drink: Being able to think clearly, speak normally, walk steadily. I would have to choose a time when my kids were at their dad’s, and I didn’t have to work the next day, so I could sleep off the hangover. I let myself remember how bad my body would feel, head pounding, stomach heaving. I let myself remember the shame that came each morning. I let myself remember every bad bit that came with that drink I wanted so badly, and I didn’t want it anymore. 

Next came the question that was bothering me. Why was I so anxious, where was this sadness coming from when I have been feeling better than I have for years? It took a while, but I realized that what I was feeling was fear. I have lived for so much of my adulthood half-blitzed out of mind that I have no idea how to live! I know what my end-goal is, to be sober for the rest of my life, but until now, I don’t think I ever thought I could really do it. I never fully pictured a future that did not involve alcohol. So the experience of doing it, actually living this life I want, it was scary enough to make me want to run back into the 1st bottle I could find. Fear of the unknown is a powerful thing. Almost powerful enough to make me go back to making the same mistakes, instead of going forward into a scary (awesome!) future. Alcohol is not worth it. I’m just going to have to figure out this life thing.

I live in a smaller town and other than the bars there is not much of a social scene. I go to the bars to meet people so I use drinking as an excuse to go out. And as a single guy it’s really the only place around to meet single women. The fear and reality of loneliness are a powerful force that can aid in creating and maintaining bad habits.

Also, an added bonus of being sober is that the summer heat and humidity doesn’t bother me as much. It’s going to be 90 degrees for the next week, and I know I’d be such a sweaty, disgusting mess if I was drinking.

My sister, who lives 3000 miles away, is having trouble with her mental health, and according to my mom, is drinking WAY to much. She has a history of alcohol and drug use combined with depression and anxiety.  She is taking a lot of meds, which aren't working, and is self medicating with alcohol.

She's confided in my mom that she's in a very bad place, but told her not to tell me or my dad.  We've always been close, and she knows all about my struggles, and the only reason I can think of her not telling me  is that she's afraid I'll tell her that I think she should quit alcohol. 

I've sent her books, podcasts, I've talked to her about my experience, and she should know that I understand what she's going through.

.... but I'm not supposed to know.  And if I mention it she'll know that my mom betrayed her trust to me and will shut her out from her life (she has done this before to my mom).

It breaks my heart because I'm worried about her and I think I can help at least by empathizing, and sharing my experience, but I don't think it'll go well if I ask her about it.

I will stop lurking and tell my story real quick. My therapist is my biggest fan!

Never would I have thought I would post anything on a stop drinking forum. I am a 31 year old woman from Western Europe. To make a very long story a lot shorter, I always liked alcohol. Mostly beer and red wine. Sometimes gin or pure whisky. In social settings, but mostly to take the edge off of my anxiety, after work or while still in university, after a long day of studying.

This is the quick version; I got in a long term relationship. Graduated. Got my first job in my field of work, bought a big ass house while actually not being mentally ready for it and lost my job shortly after rebuilding the house. My body pulled the plug on me after that, I became burnt out and extremely depressed because of my entire situation. 9 months later my partner pulled the plug on our relationship. I moved in back with my mother and I was a total and utter trainwreck. Then Corona/COVID-19 happend. 

I had all the reasons to drink alcohol. And so I did, oh yes I did. I became dependant and didn't really think I had a problem, until I really started longing for alcohol. It became way to important and unhealthy.

So I quit on June 6th 2020.

To be honest, I wasn't the heaviest drinker around. But I guess it's not a competition :-) I don't have to prove I need to quit drinking. Maybe everyone should stop consuming alcohol, it's poison for your mind, body and soul.

I quit with a goal for at least 30 days, 100 days or an undefined timeframe. I want to do what feels right for me, it's not about reaching a number. I might never drink again.

It feels like freedom, without my head being all cloudy and depression slowly killing me - got quite close to ending my life back in January. Today I feel like I have refound the old me, before life became too heavy for me over 10 years ago. But I'm not the same person I was back then. Scarred, but wiser, calm and sober. Happy.

My anxiety isn't entirely gone yet. But it's damn close. And I'm ""only"" 23 days into sobriety. Did I just say I'm happy?.. I surprised myself, well that's a first.

I have been wanting to ""take a 1 week break"" from drinking for... a while... now. This idea never really manifests into more than just a  nice thought, but if I actually do start the break it's usually by day 2 or 3 that I decide for some reason or another that it's not the right time or not really needed.

Well, I feel stopping is needed and although I've known this, I haven't fully accepted this yet until today. I have been making recent changes and developing other new habits in life but then I only get so far until they fall by the wayside. I (very) reluctantly admit that it's often alcohol related. I have been making great strides with my mental health and overall lifestyle lately. This includes seeing a therapist the most regularly/consistently I ever have in my life. However, I feel that as soon as I'm about to break through with real progress or fully ingrain a new habit... I take a few steps back and keep slipping away from achieving what I was so close to. I always brush off the idea that alcohol could be playing a role in these setbacks, but if I track my consumption the pattern is clear. So, today is my first day not drinking. I mean, why would I want to keep sabotaging myself and my goals by drinking? Especially since this is something I have control over. If nothing else, I'm viewing this as an experiment to see how my life will be different without drinking... although rationally I already know it will improve, but viewing it as an experiment somehow seems less daunting.

I don't know why I've been so hesitant to fully commit to stop drinking. I guess it's like some other thoughts I've seen here: I don't have any of the ""caricatures"" of an alcoholic, it is just a constant and pretty much daily part of my life. However, I know this doesn't mean that it's not a problem. It doesn't directly cause issues or lead to catastrophic events, but it leads me to wasting time and avoiding what I actually want to do in my life. I have successfully quit and am still sober from other things (weed, nicotine, caffeine) and without a doubt quitting all of these things over the years has definitely helped both my mental and physical health. So why is drinking alcohol different? Why do I allow that habit to still hang on strong?

Anyway... I'm not sure the ""purpose"" of this post, but I guess it's just to make it more real by putting all of this, including my goal, into writing. My goal was originally to stop drinking for 1 week, it has now changed to 6 months. I realize, especially from my experience with quitting weed, that 1 week is not enough for change. I feel 6 months will at least allow me to reset and reflect on this change. I am completely open to it lasting longer than 6 months, but anything longer than that just feels too intimidating at the moment.

Thank you to everyone here, your advice and experiences shared have already helped me. I have been lurking for a while and finally joined Reddit to become actively involved in this sub.

I look forward to staying sober with all of you. IWNDWYT.

Good day all. I will not disclose my name or business - this is purely research to see if there is a need and interest at a high level.

I'm sober a little over 7 years and have owned a sober living business in the Phoenix Arizona area for 5 years of it. I have one nice house with a max of 6 men who are serious about their recovery. It's really not been something I've tried to profit from, but more keeps me humble and serving, and helping some guys who are where I was. I have no issues having people come in the house, but after 5 years, I'm beginning to wonder if I can help more.

My partner and I both also own businesses that rely heavily on some specific IT related fields (unified communications, web development, networking, etc.) and we're both growing quickly. As we're talking about how to grow, I'm always trying to incorporate the guys who live in the house that are rebuilding their lives and trying to get back on their feet.

All that is to say, I'm curious if there would be any interest for a specialty sober living for people with the technical backgrounds? Whether local or out of state, be able to relocate to the Phoenix area with a guaranteed nice place to stay with like minded / talented people who are also in recovery. Whether immediately or after a period of recovery time, we match up people with projects that we have going on. Perhaps it's just to hold someone over for a few weeks while they find something more permanent, maybe you decide you like our mission and want to continue to be a part of the team. The important details would be:

1. Sobriety is first and foremost.
2. Contributing to the well-being of the house through shared responsibilities to keep the place in good shape.
3. Committed to the shared project team JIRA x hours per week / month for minimum rent or pay full price.

A lot more structure to be put around, but wanted to solicit general feedback. I have met other sober living owners in this area that have tried explaining a similar model where they were creating landscaping businesses, or something general labor, but it always appeared as if they were trapping guys in these low paying jobs with no way to get out of the house due to wages. This is with the full intention of helping someone help themselves, and we hopefully have some people committed to good work and receiving a positive reference on their next step if only staying for a bit.

TL;DR: Sober living for IT / development people with guaranteed work after recovery period?",5

Actually I have been in a weird spot for close to a month. My cravings have started to get strong, I'm day dreaming about drinking, wishing I could be alone in this house so I can drink without being held accountable by anyone. 

I never did the AA thing, I've wanted to, but my anxiety  has always gotten the best of me, even after a year of sobriety under my belt. I reached out to the one sober person I admire and look up to (although we've never met, and have only had small talk online, mostly about sobriety), and she sent me some Zoom meetings to check out. I'm going to try to work up the courage to try them this week. 

I also told myself the least I could do is check-in here for 90 days, starting today. It'll be my little version of 90 meetings in 90 days. Writing/journaling has always been a solid tool for me, and I've struggled with it over the last month, so maybe committing to coming here every day will help me get back on track to a better mental space.

Writing a little or long post explaining where I'm at mentally, physically, spiritually, is also going to be a real test in my ability to allow people to see me be vulnerable. I struggle to even let the people who have known me for most my life see me be vulnerable. I think I can't even keep a therapist for the same reason. I haven't found anyone who I feel completely comfortable opening up to. And I think that's part of my fear around AA meetings, I watch all these people so bravely open up and share their vulnerability so gracefully (most of the time), and then I feel this pressure to open up in the same way, but allowing my true feelings to come out into the open has only caused an emotional reaction out of me. Like full on panic attack melt down in front of a room full of strangers. 

My hope is that posting here daily for 90 days, talking about the same things I would want to talk about in an actual in person meeting will help me learn how to get comfortable with expressing myself, and not just having the knee jerk reaction to melt down and just cry. I mean crying is helpful and healthy, but it doesn't feel like it should be my only way of expressing what I'm feeling. And I think that learning how to express what I'm experiencing is an important next step in maintaining my sobriety. If drinking is a knee jerk reaction to numbing some deeper trauma that I've experienced, then eventually I'm going to need to confront this trauma so I can release it to the best of my ability. Otherwise I'm going to just keep ending up back in this heavy mental state with a desire to numb what I'm feeling with alcohol. Honestly I'm surprised I've made it a full year without realizing this sooner.

So, where am I at today, day one? I haven't drank, but I did go on a little bit of a weed binge this weekend. You know, just replaced one numbing substance (alcohol) with another (weed). I think I'm currently in the depths of a weed hangover. A part of me just wants to get back in bed, and keep the stony state of mind going, but I don't think it's going to help me get out of my current depressed state, it's most likely just going to make it worse.

I do have a stack of work to get done. I can either put it off for one more day, or just get it done today. I still haven't decided what I'm going to do.  The longer I sit here, the more mentally and physically exhausted I feel. Maybe I need a day to just be. Problem is I'm a perfectionist that gets anxious and down on myself when I stay still for too long, and the flip side of that is that I also don't know how to tell when I actually do need a break, and how to not beat myself up for allowing that break.

Anywho, I think I'm going to end on that note. I feel a bit lighter getting that all out. I think I'm going to do some chores around the house. The pup is pawing my leg right now, I think he's asking me to join him for hangs in the backyard, so I'll take him up on that offer :)  I'll try to be gentle and kind to myself while I move through this slightly depressed weed hangover state of mind, and if I get the motivation to work later, then I will, but if I don't then I will rest for today and get my work stuff done tomorrow.

Sobriety doesn’t mean life is suddenly easier and everything is perfect because it’s not - it still has tons of challenges. But I try to navigate the challenges as best I can now.  Drinking wasn’t the best me. Sobriety is me trying to be the best I can be.

My first few years of drinking I was a very light social drinker, I usually avoided it. At about age 26 I turned into a ""work hard, party hard"" kinda person where I wouldn't drink during the week but usually heavy drink on the weekends with friends and go to bars / clubs. The whole time I had a pretty good grip on alcohol, never got too drunk etc. 

Halfway through last year, I went through a rough patch in life where I had to deal with a lot of massive stressors at once. I didn't know to how to cope healthily and started drinking everyday. I also started dating someone who would typically have about a glass of wine most evenings to unwind and that's how the daily drinking started, but I quickly escalated to a point where I was heavy drinking most nights and I became a sloppy blackout drunk. Alcohol went from being something fun to something I was using to get through life. Things came crashing down pretty quickly because it led to a ton of anxiety and depression which I didn't get treated in time and one day in October, buzzed and massively depressed, I attempted suicide. 

After a stint in the psych ward, getting mental health help and acknowledging and working on my problems, I'm doing a lot better now but I still struggle with a couple of things.

Based on what I've studied so far, alcohol and depression seem to go hand in hand but I still wonder if the chicken or egg came first. Did my depression make me an alcoholic or did my alcohol abuse make me depressed? Also, my father is both an alcoholic and has BPD. Apparently things like addiction and mental health can be genetic, I didn't know this until recently, mental health awareness is not a thing in my family and upbringing. I have much regret that if only I was more aware early on, in hindsight, I would have been more careful with how I used alcohol. 

And secondly, while I know better now and have been sober 95% of the days since my attempt 8 months ago, I struggle with denial. I have a hard time accepting that I just don't have a normal relationship with alcohol anymore and have to maintain complete sobriety. I find myself craving alcohol now, not when I'm emotional like I used to, but actually when I'm bored. I think of all the fun times I had with it and all the years I had a grip on my drinking and hope that maybe I can go back to being a normal drinker, which I know is not really possible. The few times I tried to drink in moderation since I started sobriety, I couldn't, went overboard and the days following it, my depression and anxiety were through the roof. 

No matter how hard I try to convince myself, I can't shake the little voice of hope in my head seems to think sobriety is temporary and I can eventually go back to drinking ""normally"".

Tl;dr after a stint in sobriety, is it possible to go back to drinking responsibly? I want to commit to lifelong sobriety but whenever I think of it, I freak out a little. It's easier to tell myself that if I go sober for a couple of months, then I'll get ""better"" and can go back to being a social drinker. How do I work through that?

So today, I'm not drinking...I scheduled all the medical and mental health appointments I'd been putting off for months even before COVID.  I'm working on a manageable cleaning schedule and plan on surprising my boys with a clean room when they return home from camp on Thursday.  I'm feeling better by just taking a step in the right direction.  I've had several stints of abstinence and felt AMAZING!  Why I keep volunteering to go through this time and again is mind-blowing...

On a good note, was able to download Naked Mind for free and have been listening to it as I've been out and about being a productive, responsible adult today.  I'm thankful for all the encouragement this forum has provided...you all are impacting so many lives, especially for those of us whose shame has become a prison and we feel we can't reach out to anyone for support!",5

I never thought I’d be here. But I’m here to tell you, even at the worst times in your life, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. I’ll keep this short and sweet, but let this get motivation for you. I feel clean, I feel healthy. I even get to spend days with my son. Sober. I’ve never felt more alive. Thank you for all in this group who made this possible for me. Stay strong. Until I post again. Xx

I surprisingly still have a high tolerance level. I drink like a fish. And now I have finally realised that I can't deal with hangovers, I always have to self-medicate with more booze to take the edge off the hangover. Pathetic.
It's now Monday evening where I am and I am still absolutely drained of energy two days later and all I have eaten is the worst foods imaginable from a health perspective.
The amount of money I spent in suchna short space of time is staggering also.
I am in no rush to find myself drink any time soon.

My roommate is a functioning alcoholic, and there’s always bottles and bottles of beer and liquor lurking around to tempt me into going on a binge. (My style of self destruction)
It started out with careful moderation and quickly moved to no fucks given. I violated my probation with a hot UA a month ago, and I’ve been trying to get a grip ever since. My chronic depression related anger is the demon that I mask, and also the demon that surfaces after about 7-8 shots. I’ve gone off on my roommate, and it was def a combination of cabin fever and a killer hangover. This Covid stuff is really getting me down. I can’t get a job in my industry, and my savings are dwindling daily. I’m so worried about the future, and I know a change in my lifestyle is the only road to success. My short fuse is my own worst enemy, and it’s usually misdirected at someone that doesn’t deserve it. Self sabotage seems to be my favorite game that I constantly play with myself. Not to mention my mother passed away in late February, and although I didn’t immediately break my sobriety it was def a trigger to my eventual relapse. She died of chronic alcoholism which she used as self medication for bipolar disorder. It was really really hard to say goodbye, and I still miss her every single moment of every day.

I haven't had any DUI's, drama, health issues etc.. so why have I spent since April 8th drinking everyday? I am fully functioning- I work all day from home but I also drink all day. Here's what my most recent routine looked like. 

Wake up around 8

First drink around 9

Drink all day - vodka and La croix, or White Claws (mind you I rarely get a buzz because I have to be on conference calls and my tolerance is so high anyway. 

Go to bed at 10:30

Wake up at 3 AM - have another 4-5 drinks until about 5 AM

Go to bed again and wake up at 8 

Start all over next day.

Alcohol is triggering my anxiety to the point now that I'm unable to sleep and settle. 

I've been here before, and quit before. I know I can do it again. I just know it. I quit for almost 2 years and it did me the world of good. Both mentally and physically.

I drink perhaps once or twice in the week and smoke almost every day. It's draining my bank balance, I'm tired, irritable and unable to stop worrying everytime I'm hungover. 

It's just not worth it anymore. It's preventing me from living my life and seeing myself in a good light. Plus I'm a super annoying drink. I'm provocative and I don't like myself at all. I don't feel bad in other areas of my life, but it's starting to affect my life in such a negative way overall.

2020-06-29 12:02:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hi2k25/insomnia_stopping_me_from_not_drinking/,Insomnia stopping me from not drinking.,"I'm having a lot of trouble stopping drinking (or rather, just bringing it down to a sensible amount, which is the goal), because every time I drink less than 12 units of alcohol I'm guaranteed to not get to sleep until 5-6am, having gone to bed around midnight. And it is very specifically 12 units minimum, drank within 3 hours of sleep. I've tried the following variations, all of which have resulted in insomnia:

\- Not drinking at all.

\- Drinking the daily recommended limit (4 units), directly before bed.

\- Drinking the daily recommended limit, leaving 4 hours before bed (a recommendation I read).

\- Drinking 12 units but spread out from 6pm - midnight.

\- Drinking 12 units but stopping 4 hours before bed.

Based on the latter two, can alcohol withrawal be ruled out as the cause? What I can't understand is why it has to be that specific amount, that close to bed? Why if I even drop down by a few units, or drink them over a slightly longer period does it make such a huge difference? 

The other thing is it's not just insomnia - it's like being trapped between consciousness and subconsciousness, like I'm completely aware of my body and the room around me, but my thoughts are more like a dream, meaning I can't control them. And they always turn negative, bringing up literally every failing I've had, every mistake I've made, every bad thing that could potentially happen. I also invariably have stomach cramps for the rest of the following day, and my teeth aching from clenching my jaw all night isn't uncommon. All of this doesn't give me much motivation to continue the next night, since I'm terrified of going back to being trapped in that negative thought cycle for another 5-6 hours, along with the cramps the next day.

I've also tried sleep hygiene methods like turning all screens off an hour before trying to sleep, exercise, baths, etc. but none seem to make any difference. I've thought of sleeping pills, but have always been wary of them, and also think that taking them would simply be replacing one drug with another, without addressing the route cause, whatever that may be.

Has anyone here been through anything similar or have any advice?",1

Woke up around 3 in the afternoon yesterday and proceeded to have a couple more beers in the hopes that hair of the dog was all I needed. Cried myself to sleep somewhere around 7:30-8pm.

Today I am sore from the fall, embarrassed beyond all reason, shaky, clammy, and depressed. I’m too old for this. This is teenager “I don’t know any better yet” level of stupidity. Not 32. Something has got to give before irreparable damage is done.

Apparently I cannot drink responsibly, so I am taking away the option altogether. I’m feeling so low today and am even writing this with tears in my eyes that I am having a hard time choking back. Any encouragement, advice, etc would certainly be appreciated.

Drinking on the porch

Going to breweries

Eating out (with beer)— towards this end, I really don’t like many of our restaurant options if I’m forgoing a cold beer. Some restaurants really get away with serving some terrible food.

I felt so unwell mentally and physically that I didn’t see the point of getting up. I felt that way about one third of the time for the past month, and I’ve felt this way in the past. Eleven days ago, I woke up feeling this way and decided it was time to make a change in my life. I choose how I feel, nobody else. So i made the decision to drop alcohol, and coffee. I had been living the past year of my life(with the exception of one short spurt where I didn’t drink booze for 9 days), under the constant influence of either caffeine or alcohol. When somebody asked me where I wanted to eat I would say I didn’t care, as long as there was coffee in the morning and beer after noon.  I was constantly grasping at substances to mask feelings that I didn’t want to sit in. I didn’t want to feel tired from the whiskey I drank the night before. After the coffee started to wear off I’d get anxious and I didn’t want to feel the anxiety, so I’d reach for the alcohol. A vicious cycle truly. I’ve made a couple really great changes in my life, and to be honest, the first week I felt like a new woman. But I’m on day eleven now and I had bad dreams last night, I started feeling anxious again yesterday. I think I’m reaching the point that the novelty of making a life change has begun to wear off, and that is okay. I feel a little bit crappy today, but I am going to sit in the feelings, because I learned recently that you can have emotions and not respond to them. Ground breaking news for me. 

I originally planned to go 2 weeks without alcohol, and I am going to complete that. I am considering going longer.

I'm an 18 year old guy who's been drinking alcohol since 16. I drink/drank pretty much every Saturday.

I've been thinking about just quitting drinking alcohol. For me, I can't do 2 or 3 beers a week. It's either drinking a lot once a week, or none at all.

But the thing I've noticed about some people who gave up alcohol is that, they did something pretty embarrassing or bad that made them quit drinking. Y'know, like breaking a bone or getting a DUI.

I've been drinking for 2 years and nothing like that has happened. I've never drove drunk or high or anything like that. I've never lashed out at someone while drunk. I've never had hurt myself or anybody while drunk. Y'know, apart from the inside of my body. Plus, I don't even get hangovers. I've had one once, but that was after drinking A LOT.

When I'm tipsy/drunk, I'm pretty normal. The only thing that changes is that I laugh at movies more. So it's not that I don't like myself drunk. It's not like I turn into a different person or anything like that.


Should I quit drinking or not? I mean, the health benefits are insane apparently. I'm not sure if alcohol is affecting my life negatively or positively for that matter.

I dont know where to start.,"I'm the only bisexual in a family that is only barely starting to accept me after I told them 2 years ago (which is fresh air for me). My first drink of alcohol was at 17 and 8 years later, at twenty five, I find that it's a problem. I went from once a month, to once a week, to three times a week...and most of those times I'm not drinking with anyone else. I love working, I love school, I love the idea of a career, but that damn alcohol. Then this January, I decided to quit alcohol and I got 2 months into it, then COVID-19 really began to effect the states. Nothing traumatic really...until it infected my grandmother, grandfather, auntie, and her daughter (my cousin). PLUS an additional 11 of my family members including myself were infected. And I broke up with my boyfriend of three years during this time, it was an ugly break up, too. 

It's been two months. Both my grandparents and auntie passed away but my cousin barely made it out alive. In fact, she was the worst out of all of them for a week, and shes only 27. And ever since march I've been drunk more times then the past year. I remember when we said goodbye to them over a video chat. I remember my family standing six feet apart from each other, in masks, watching that video chat. And I remember their funeral. The military salutes and honours for my grandpa, the great amount of flowers and scriptures for my grandma, and the amount of art given to us for my auntie. I remember it all but I dont remember much else. 

I'm sad, it's been two months and everyone tells me that's okay, I'm mourning. But I've never been this sad...ever. With my sexuality being an issue, and my downfall of life goals because of my alcoholism, I'm just broken. I'm seeing a side of myself I haven't seen before, I've known depressed people all my life, is this it? Is that what I'm feeling? Am I JUST sad? 

I might be but I wish I could just put down the bottle and feel like myself for a bit. Even for just a second.

I think it's been the most positive and transformative period in my life.

People ask me if I will ever drink again and I'm not exactly saying I won't but I'm also saying I can't think why I would want to.

I come from a British boozy background, nothing extreme but drinks have been a fundamental part of socialising, celebrating and relaxing.

As I grew older I found that I needed to drink harder and harder to get a buzz from it. I don't really want to dwell on the negative but there's been plenty. I've felt trapped and paralysed. My intellect could see how pointless and destructive drinking had become but I continued to do it. Cognitive dissonance.

I've done a few dry Januarys but this year I'm hitting a major birthday and I really wanted to change my life. I tried and failed to quit. Then Corona hit and I stocked up on booze in preparation for lockdown. This proved disastrous really and I think caused the low point that has now made me push through and stay off it. The first weeks are so hard but then it got easier and then the benefits really started to come though.

Now I feel so much better, the craving is basically gone. 

I've always enjoyed the taste of beer and I've found alcohol free beers are amazing. A cold can of brewdog nanny state hits the spot perfectly with no woozy after effects. Having a few cans in the fridge really helps.

I've become a much better version of myself. My family life is better, I have energy, my mood is much more stable. I feel like I've been searching for years for a way to get this feeling and all along it was there just waiting for me.

I've found this sub Reddit really helpful. You're very American which is just par for the course with Reddit but I think there are enough commonalities for me. UK drinking culture is different in quite a few ways but the fundamental problems are the same.

Anyway, thanks for being here. For the people on the start of this journey, keep going! At first it's so hard but once you get going it does get much easier and the rewards are really there for you to take

Take all the money you save and buy something fun and positive. You've only got one life so live it as the best person you can be. For me I know that's alcohol free 😎",33
2020-06-29 04:45:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hhwb9x/question_about_weird_hangover/,Question about weird hangover?,"Hi guys! I know everyone here doesnt drink but I figure maybe a lot of you have had problems with alcohol and can maybe tell me if this seems familiar. 

Im a social drinker, though people in some of my circles tend to drink pretty heavily. Late 20s, female, drinking about 7-15 drinks a week, Id say, usually in two sessions-- one mid week and one on the weekend. 

The thing is Im having these like... weird, two day hangovers? 

Day 1 is a typical, normal hangover-- maybe a bit nauseous, kinda tired, but overall I mostly feel OK. I actually used to get much worse ones when I was younger. 

Day 2 is super weird though. Im very tired, very out of it, and I get this like... horrible anxiety. Its not all day but itll come in waves. Like a sense of dread or something.

I didnt even connect it to alcohol for a long time since it comes afterwards. There are even times when I dont have *any* hangover on Day 1 but I still get one on Day 2, so it felt unconnected until I started tracking it on my phone. 

&#x200B;

Now, this doesnt really happen if I only have like 2 or 3 drinks, so Im going to try to cut back further. But then I started thinking about why exactly I have this and it started to get me really freaked out-- could this be a sign of alcohol withdrawal? 

Like... could this be some sort of very, very early sign of addiction? My brain is so reliant on alcohol now that it freaks out when it stops getting any? 

Sorry if this is like triggering for anyone. I just kind of dont know who to ask, and everything I google only mentions stuff related to severe alcoholism. 

&#x200B;

Is this familiar to anyone? 

Im sort of more interested in figuring out what this is from like a medical/neurological standpoint  than discussing quitting drinking, but I do know the sub I came to so Ill try to keep an open mind haha. But it would be cool to hear from someone who has had something similar.",4

I am hoping to receive some support to keep me abstinent. I am on day 2 now. On Friday and Saturday I consumed so much alcohol that I don't even know how I am still alive. I have totally lost the ability to control how much I drink and I am blacking out most occasions now and it terrifies me. This used to be once a month but now it is twice a week.

 I have tried to stop many times and the longest I lasted was 9 months. I can easily stay off alcohol for the first 3-4 days cause the shame and guilt is so intense but once I start to feel better that voice comes back and I think I can control my drinking. That is never the case.

 I have now lost a man who is very special to me and unless I change I won't stand a chance with him. I am hoping this time my will power overides that voice that says I am fine to drink. I never want to feel like this ever again. I feel like I have just witnessed hell. I want to find the strength in me to beat this. What do I do to really believe in myself this time?",10

2020-06-29 03:58:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hhvse2/wisdom_and_experience/,Wisdom and Experience,"TL;DR: We're all on the same path toward sobriety. Some of us are further along than others, and we should continue to support each other, regardless of where you are on that path.

I casually watch this sub and try to help out with advice when I can. I want to take a moment to thank everyone who is in this sub, both the new people who are reaching for someone and those who are willing to reach out and grab them.

When I first stopped drinking, 13 years ago, I had 1 person that grabbed my hand - my dad. He had, at the time, 15 years of sobriety (he now has 28). He helped guide me and coach me on ways to stop and how to maintain my mental health. He suggested meetings as a way to keep me honest and I never really felt like they worked for me. I went to a few and I didn't feel that connection, plus it required work and I just wasn't that interested in putting it in. So I meandered through my sobriety and reached out to my dad when I was stuck. He usually had a piece of knowledge he could pass along that helped me figure out a resolution and I would move back on the path.

About 2 years ago, I hit a nasty patch with my fiancee and abruptly ended our 5 year relationship. Filled with sorrow, I tried a sip of a drink. It didn't help, but it did knock back my 10 years of sobriety to 0. I took on a bit of guilt and frustration, and again, my dad suggested I check out a meeting. While there, I met an old-timer with years of sobriety under his belt. We didn't connect much in meetings, and as time wore on, I eventually reconciled with my fiancee and I stopped going to them. As luck would have it, I actually began to develop a working relationship with the old-timer as we both work in the trades, and over the years, we've formed quite a great friendship. Last week, those old pains in my relationship resurfaced and I took a moment to step back and look objectively at them. Could it be that this whole time...I was the problem? Since I'd been here before, I knew that drinking wasn't going to help. Then I really thought about the point of the meetings - the point of the steps. In all this time of being sober, I'd never really addressed my feelings and behaviors. I had made a radical change to my lifestyle, but was still harboring those traits from my life before. So, since we were friends, and had discussed meetings in the past, I called up the old-timer, not to discuss business, but as one alcoholic to another and I reached out to ask for help. He happily grabbed my hand and provided the resources I needed to get started back into the meetings. I dug out my old book from storage, and am looking forward to trying this process again with a clearer understanding of my role.

While I've been in this journey, a close friend has been knocking on death's door from liver failure related to his massive consumption of alcohol. Once I found out, I was regularly visiting him in the hospital and trying to salvage our friendship, which sat dormant for many years even though we lived very close to each other. During that time, I'd grown to develop a friendship with his wife, whom I'd never really given the opportunity to meet or know. Their relationship also centered around alcohol and when he went into the hospital, it brought her dependence on alcohol to light. When he left for an in-patient intensive treatment at another hospital, she reached out and asked how I stopped drinking. So I told her and that helped create a bond between us and the formation of our friendship. When she was down and thinking about drinking, she'd reach out. No matter what I was doing, I'd stop and help out - 5 or 10 minutes, maybe an hour before bed, just someone to talk to and provide help or direction. She would hit me up with a milestone - 3 days, or 1 week, or 1 month! And I would use the opportunity to congratulate her on the achievement and encourage her to remain vigilant. This week she told me that she thinks of me as her sponsor - someone who was willing to help guide her down the path and give her some motivation and faith that she could do it. I thanked her for the kind words and elaborated that I think of a sponsor more as someone who has worked through the program, but I reminded her that I'm just one alcoholic trying to help someone who is thinking about living their life a different way. Happy to help if it means helping you live a better life.

Tonight, I was talking with my younger brother, who has been a functional alcoholic for the last 8 years. We talked as we always do, but I noticed he was drinking water instead of whiskey. He's going through a rough financial patch right now and has decided to give up alcohol to save money. We talked about his first night sober, and he asked for some advice on how to still his mind. I told him that it starts with a day. If you can make it through one, you can make it through 2. Tonight is his day 2. And I told him that I'm always around if he needs someone to talk to or some help along the way. He assured me that it's only temporary; once he's back on his feet, he plans to drink again. And he's an adult, who can make his own choices. But personally, I hope this choice provides him the clarity to see what alcohol has contributed to his life so he can make an informed decision about where he wants his life to lead. I have hope for him that he'll maintain sobriety, and that it will become a lifestyle choice that brings him the same comfort that it brings me. I will continue to support his desire to remain sober, even if it doesn't stick - even if we find ourselves here many more times in the future, because I truly believe that sobriety is what saved my life all those years ago and everyone deserves to have a life where you don't have to worry about getting hurt, or hurting someone else, or going to jail, or dying tonight. 

I see sobriety as a fluid path we're all walking. Some of us have been walking it longer than others, but the road is more enjoyable with good friends and great conversation. Thanks for reading this. It's reminded me how much I appreciate this journey. I can only hope it's inspired you to continue yours.",7

My question is, what are people's experiences with quitting and exercise? I used to be 10kg heavier, love powerlifting and am currently enrolled in my local BJJ academy (opening up on July 1st). I'm also finalizing with my wife the prospect of a power rack in the garage for a home gym.

Has anybody gone from drinking every night to an active, healthy lifestyle? I'm wondering whether there are some tips or tricks to making such a transition? 

It's probably worth asking if there are any tips/tricks to the whole fatherhood thing while I'm here. Not: how to be a dad, so much as: new dads, what are your experiences with staying sober and welcoming a new child into the world.

May last drink was nearly 18 months ago, but these past couple of days have been hard.

One of the reasons I stopped was because I wanted to have a bit more respect for my job. I was/am a team leader in a retail situation and often showed up hungover or on a few occasions still drunk, and it was not a good look.

Fast forward to the weekend just gone, and work has been shit. The upper management have been cutting hours (like they do at the end of every financial year - July to June in Australia) and short staffing me, then asking me to explain why the work doesn't get finished.

3 days straight we were short by 3-6hrs, 3 days straight they ask for an explanation of why the work isn't getting done.

I'm getting the shits with it, and been tempted to drink. Thinking if they can't respect me, why should I respect them.

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we check in about any AoK that we have participated in, received, witnessed, or heard about during the week which have touched us in some way. It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game.

My best friend from childhood is visiting and we took a walk through a forest preserve today. We found a spot on a picnic table by the river and sat and talked and talked for hours. We watched an alarmingly acrobatic squirrel, listened to a woodpecker banging away on some DIY, saw metallic green dragonflies with solid black wings, and smiled at groups of tweens and teens traipsing through. She pointed out that we were probably taking up a prime hangout spot by monopolizing the picnic table for so long, but eh. We were misspending our youths before those kids were even born, we got there first in more ways than one.

I haven't gone into a whole lot of depth about the nature of my drinking (or my sobriety, for that matter) with most of the normies in my life. When I was struggling with my drinking and trying to get sober, it was something that I was ashamed of, and after getting sober, I realized that it would be upsetting for people who cared about me to know that I'd been in such a bad place and hadn't asked for help. I never understood before that it could be hurtful to not tell people about things that I was going through. But it came up naturally at a couple of points in the conversation, so I talked about it.

It was weird to realize as I was talking to her that I could have talked about where I was at when all of this was going on. I felt so alone and so closed off from other people when I was active in my addiction, but seeing the looks of concern about it on her face, I realized that I could've called her and told her any of what I was feeling and going through and doing, at any time. I had no reason to expect any judgment from her, I just didn't know that I could expect support. From anyone. I thought that I just had to deal with this alone.

It felt good to talk about it because I was letting her in. And not that she doesn't know me already - when I talked about the way my drinking was obsessive and compulsive and said, ""And you know me,"" she laughed. She's the one who first pointed out to me that I could be a little obsessive about things when we were teenagers. I never saw it in myself until she pointed it out. She knows me. But somehow over the years I'd shut her out. It felt good to let her back in.

My other AoK for the day was gathering bits of litter around the picnic table and from the trail when we left and carrying it out until I could find a trash can. I didn't grab everything I saw, but it felt good to know that my net impact was positive. Which is an attitude that I'm trying to cultivate in my life these days. I don't have to fix everything all at once, but I figure that as long as I'm basically doing what I can to have a positive impact in my world and am not creating a lot of new harm, I'm doing okay, and the good parts will start to add up.

Anyway, that's me for this week, sobernauts. How's everyone else doing, any AoK you'd like to share?",16

Before that i would hardly ever drink, it just didn't do much for me. But then things in my relationship started to fall apart and eventually we broke up.

Being single meant i had no-one to hold me accountable, so i started drinking more during the week. I knew it wasn't healthy, and that there was something wrong with my motivations to drink.

I got into a new relationship and moved in with him. I thought maybe my drinking would stop. I definitely cut back, but relying on having a partner in order to stop is never going to work, especially when they can be a bit emotionally abusive. We broke up, i moved out, i continued to drink. 

Lockdown came and suddenly i was furloughed. Living alone. Drinking every day. Ashamed to put out my recycling bin because of the amount of bottles in it. Feeling wretched and disgusted with myself when i counted how many bottles of wine i'd had in a week. ""6?! That can't be right, it can't be. I can't have drunk a bottle of wine almost every night!"" 

There have been around 3 days when i started drinking at about 11am. Not because i was so hungover from the day before, just because i felt like i had nothing else to do, and it no longer mattered if i was drunk or sober when i had no-one to be sober for. 

I discovered a couple of places that deliver alcohol. It has become easier and easier to drink. I don't even need to leave the house to do it. A click of a button and it's here.

Every single time i drink i feel disgusted and ashamed of myself. While i'm drinking i feel it, but i also feel compelled to keep going. The next day i wake up full of determination that it was the last time, but as the day wears on my resolve starts to weaken, and i remember the wonderful feeling of relaxation that two glasses of wine give.

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Monday everyone. Hope you're all looking forward to a glorious week ahead :) 
  
If you'd told me a year ago that my life would look the way it does today... I would never have believed it. I was so beaten down and broken. I was newly out of a long term relationship with another alcoholic (but still living together). My life was wholly unmanageable, and I was incredibly unhappy.  I had given up on trying to ""manage"" my drinking several months ago, and realized that I needed to fully quit... but I was struggling to string two sober days together.  
  
But first and foremost, I was incredibly lonely and isolated... but I didn't even really know it. Over the years of drinking, I either burnt bridges, or failed to nurture relationships... so aside from my immediate family, my partner and one close friend... I didn't really have anybody.  
  
Now I carry a piece of paper in my wallet:  
  
""Why do people isolate when they drink? Shame - and the fear that no one will let them drink the way they want to drink.  
Whenever our addiction took on a life, we stopped growing emotionally. Somewhere along the way, we veered off maturing, and we couldn't stand ourselves.""  
  
I still have a long way to go in the road of recovery, but for some reason this particular line sticks out to me. And the biggest gains I've found in sobriety so far: an active social life, new friends in AA, and an appreciation for actually spending time with people instead of avoiding them so I could drink... alone.

I’ve been a “functional alcoholic” for over 2 years, and a problem drinker long before that. I’m sick of it. I’m sick of the control alcohol has over me. I have a myriad of physical and emotional ailments that I have been using alcohol to ignore, two special needs teen sons, and a wonderful supportive husband. I’m tired of letting us all down. It’s time to take control, and I am terrified. I dont know how to stop swinging by the store to pick up a pint of whiskey, to make it through a night without the comfort of my whiskey.

I decided I would stop again last night when I found out I maxed out one of my cc’s over this covid time.

I wouldnt have been so frivolous if I was sober. I was doing So Good. My original sober date is August 3rd 2018 and that will still be more important to me than my birthday. It was the day I decided to live.

I’ve done pretty good since then. Therapy, meds, I like ptsd groups but not addiction groups. I got my finances seriously under control. I’m managing a CBD store and curating an art gallery.

This is a dream job and I’m just waiting to fuck it up.

Whelp, if I fuck it up, it wont be because I self sabotaged. It wont be because I didnt try my hardest. It wont be because I gave up and decided to make everything about drinking again.

I have good reasons to stay sober. I’ve been sober for so long before these last few months and I was actually really liking life. I’ve been loving my confidence. I’ve been loving how much I get done these days.

But Im still terrified. Im terrified of not having it available on the back-burner. Im terrified of not being able to rely on another thing that’s been there so long for me.

Im also terrified of a life of drinking.

I havent gotten out of bed besides to pee for 25 hours. My bed is safe.

I need to have more faith in myself. I did this before, I can do it again. Learn from it and hopefully dont do this again. Im super sick of quitting",4

He hasn’t done anything to make me feel insecure about it; this is all in my own head more or less. He’s definitely a “social drinker” in that, he will have drinks with friends or in a party setting; he does not use alcohol to shut off unwanted emotions as I did in the past (currently in therapy to work through some of that). I basically didn’t see him drink for all of quarantine for this reason, and we spent a lot of sober time together.

He went to a gathering with some friends I haven’t met yet last night (they pretty much exclusively play DnD together and I’m not part of that, so kinda makes sense) and there was DnD and drinking/bonfire after. I hung with a good friend on her balcony and we drank delicious mocktails she made with muddled mint, lime, strawberries and seltzer (my girlfriends are super supportive of my choice to not drink even though most of them still do, and it’s awesome). I saw my boyfriend today and he told me about last night, and I felt kind of like I was missing out in that I can’t really enjoy a drinking bonfire and meet his friends and get to know them like I would have last summer (although maybe would have gotten too drunk and acted like an idiot, or got in a fight with my boyfriend over something dumb, who knows). I totally could go hang sober, but the fact I’m not a drinker is going to come up with a new group of people and I haven’t had to face that for awhile since I haven’t exactly been going to social events for the last few months (I’m sure most of you can relate lol). To be clear, he never suggests I drink or pressures me, he has even stopped me a few times and saved my ass when I was first trying to quit. 

So at some point today I briefly tried to bargain with myself about drinking again after I’ve made it to 6 months sober, which will be on July 1st. How would I pull this off? Keep it to 2 drinks per occasion? How would this impact the huge strides I’ve made in certain areas like my fitness and the work I’m doing on my personal development/mental health? I then realized for me, it’s all or nothing, baby. I’m either a basic ass party girl or I’m a sober girl, a drink once in awhile would quickly become getting drunk every weekend and random weekday drinks too. Maybe that would be fun at first as a “new” thing, but it would get old again real fast. I just find it disturbing that those insidious insecure thoughts can creep in so easily, where the mind starts bargaining with itself. I don’t even consider myself an addict, but I know I did use alcohol in a problematic way and I did binge drink to cope with my mental health. My therapist even advises I continue to not drink indefinitely. Just wanted to reflect on that; glad to be here with you guys. IWNDWYT :)",3

I keep thinking about drinking/using, the fact that's I'd get kicked out of my sober house is all that really stops me at this point. That's a dangerous place to be because that won't stay enough. I keep thinking that drinking/using would be worth it, I keep thinking that I have one more run left in me. I've nearly convinced myself that drinking/using until I die seems like a better fate than fighting my whole life. I really just wanna fucking let go. I know what I need to do, but I can't bring myself to do any of it, and I feel like a massive fucking idiot for it. 



I finally opened up about it in an AA meeting Wednesday, but got no feedback. I opened up again tonight in a meeting and was even more honest and just got a ""keep coming back"". And I'm probably dumb for feeling beaten down over that but the gist of my share was ""I have been bad about reaching out, I've fallen back into the ""i can do this myself"" mindset. I'm in a dangerous place mentally. so I'm forcing myself to share on the fact that I'm not ok and don't know what to do"" and idk, it just made me feel even more stupid and lost, and made me want to reach out even less :/",6

I hit this point where I black out, and my memory either goes completely, or leaves me with bits and pieces. It's during the blackouts where I leave my life in shambles.

I become unkind, angry, aggressive, I forget my relationship, become a betrayer. This isn't a maybe. It might not be every night, but eventually I snap, and do something or say something I can never take back

The biggest problem for me is I forget this feeling. The one I have right now where I think ""what the fuck was I thinking"". I know I can't handle my alcohol. But eventually, I forget, and think ""I can have a few"". That leads to ""I'm invincible!"", and I wind up back here.

Here, right now, I'm sitting alone in my apartment. I've been talking to my girl for the past 2 days trying to convince her to give me another chance to be the man I know I can be. I don't deserve her, mind, but I want to be better. I WILL be better.  I don't need alcohol to have fun. I don't need alcohol to be social. I don't need alcohol to be me. I will know myself, and I will know that I cannot handle ANY alcohol, because for me one will always lead to twenty, and if I let just one through I will regret it

I'm trying not to burden the people around me for support, I feel so low and worthless that I can't bring myself to dump myself on anyone.

I'm a 24 years old male and I may have a problem with occasional semi-binge drinking. When I go out for a dinner and have a glass of wine that always makes me feel good, but only when I limit it. When I go out alone or with someone who doesn't drink, I always manage to keep it under control.

The problem starts when there's pressure from the others as they also drink and so then I feel ""left out"" if I don't join them. What's worse is that I don't seem to be able to control myself after a couple of glasses and then of course the next day is completely shit being hangover.

Another problem is that I also have quite a lot of business meetings for my company where having a drink or two always helps on the deal. Right now I can't even imagine how the talks/discussions would go if I would just say that I won't drink with her/him. Any suggestions here perhaps from some of you who are more experienced?

I have tried giving up completely, but I must admit that most of the time a glass of wine is just fine.. but then there are other times when it leads to more and I just want to stop that. Should I give it up completely as to make a rule not to drink at all? Maybe like that I can prevent the occasional hangovers. Alternatively are there any ways/mind tricks/stuff that just helps to limit it down to one glass maximum?

I know the solution is simple, just stop after one glass. But put into practice it feels so much harder to keep it under control.

Also for me alcohol has been something that helped me wind off after work and so on. What other activities/beverages do you recommend as a replacement?

This is a pretty big step for me sharing this, which means that I acknowledge the problem. I hope some of you can give me some advice so that I can live a more healthy and balanced lifestyle. Thank you!",5

I did have one relapse. The stress of Covid 19 got the better of me and I got totally smashed a couple of months ago. If anyone is tempted to go back to the bottle - DON'T. 

It really, really is not worth it. I spent all of the next day with a pounding head and vomiting even sips of water. I upset my partner enormously too. He said he never wants to see me drunk again because it is like seeing a demon in my body. 

I haven't touched it since that one day and I decided not to count it. I learned my lesson and I didn't want to risk beating myself up over it.

Life isn't magically better but it is certainly not as difficult. To all those who are starting today - you are doing the right thing. Be safe, withdrawal from alcohol can be very dangerous.

TL:DR- I didn't drink for a week!

I have been telling myself I would post an update so here I am.  I do not know if updates are allowed in the format on this sub and if I am in the wrong please let me know.  Well it was been a very educational week indeed.  I have been creating a strict schedule for myself each night and have done fairly well about sticking to it.  I also journal what I did each day and how I felt about it every night.  Meditation has been tremendously helpful and continues to improve after each attempt.  By far the biggest help I have been able to find is in two books, ""The Daily Stoic"" by Ryan Holiday and ""The Practicing Stoic"" by Ward Farnsworth.  Stoicism has been a philosophy I have been able to find a great amount of solace in.  My readings in these books are typically the highlight of my day and I cannot recommend them enough.  I haven't really had any strong urges and the thought of drinking honestly feels me with dread but then again it has only been a week. Never the less I am proud.  I feel like I have taken my first steps towards a life time of sobriety, or at least that is my hope.  As for me and my ex it has been a none stop roller coaster of emotion.  She fluctuates almost daily between professing her love and demanding I never talk to her again.  We even had 4th of July plans up until yesterday.  I have long since surrendered the relationship to fate and accepted that it is out of my hands.  I have preferences sure but I am both prepared to take her back and never speak to her again (thanks stoicism).  We are young and the relationship was far from ever perfect but it was nice to always have someone to talk to and take your mind of things.  When I use to drink I was complete lazy slob who could never get off the couch, now just sitting around gives me the creeps.  I feel like I need to jump from one task to the other.  I suppose that is a good thing as I have been much more productive but it is something I have still been getting use to.  By far the biggest thing I have struggled with is my perceived loneliness.  All of my friends were more or less drinking buddies and with the (likely) loss of my SO I feel completely isolated from people my own age.  I have no earthy idea how to meet people outside of drinking activities.  I was the quiet guy who would show up to parties and slug alcohol till I was able to talk to people.  Oh well, I talk to my cats a lot and I have plenty of time to work on this as I start a new college for graduate school in August and I'm looking forward to a fresh start.  One thing that's played over and over in again in my head is a line from the movie Cast Away with Tom Hanks.  I watched this on a lark on my first night sober and I'm glad I did.  He is describing to his friend about how he will get over the loss of the woman he loves and equates it to finding a porta potty that he uses as a sail to escape the island he was marooned on. He says ""I just gotta keep breathing, cause you never know what the tide may bring.""  Sounds very simplistic but it really resonated with me.  Well sorry for the long rambling post and thanks to anyone who actually read.  Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated and I plan to do another update after a month.  Here's to the first week of many and keep breathing my dudes!",9

I wound up in the hospital with some god awful withdrawals when I tried coming off of it had the doctor tell me I'd die in my 20s if I kept it up and after detoxing I went dry for a couple months. I started drinking again back in January and have been drinking one tallboy of whatever cheap light lager I feel like buying daily.

2020-06-28 22:22:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hhrigm/six_months/,Six Months!,"Made it to six months sober from alcohol and weed. 

Went through one hell of a withdrawal six months ago and I remember thinking ""If I can get through this withdrawal, the sober part will be easy."" Well I've been right so far. What helps is thinking of myself as a ""non-drinker."" If I constantly tell myself ""I'm an alcoholic, I can't drink"" it subconsciously gives me something to prove wrong, where if I just think of myself as ""someone who doesn't drink"" its easy peasy.

&#x200B;

I can't begin to explain the freedom not drinking has given me. It's made me more present in all of my relationships. I read books now. My mind has returned. My thinking is more clear and faster. I have dreams for my future again. The best part might even be walking by the crowds of people drinking and knowing I won't be hungover the next morning like them. 

&#x200B;

That being said, six months is part of a long road to recovery and while its been enough to restore a lot of me, I understand there's still more to come! Post acute withdrawal syndrome can last up to two years so I have more than a year and a half of recovering more to do. It feels great to know that as long as I don't drink things will keep getting better and better.

I didn't do it alone though. I've spoken with a priest, gotten a sponsor, attended AA meetings, completed stepwork, got cognitive behavioral therapy, went to my doctor (and offloaded my extreme post withdrawal hypochondria on to him), prayed, read the bible, read the big book, read books like Alcohol Explained, This Naked Mind, Living Sober, etc, used an app on my iphone to count the days, and spoken with friends that are sober. AA stepwork is the concrete cap pouring over the grave of my drinking so that it won't rise again. I've been blessed. IWNDWYT.

TLDR: I've been sober for six months and my mind and body have returned after experiencing a dangerous withdrawal lasting two weeks and weird lingering symptoms for the first four months.

I was in the camp of alcohol being a major part of my life without controlling my life.  All of the cliche alcoholic problems didn’t exist for me.  I wasn’t ruining jobs or friendships.  I wasn’t damaging my family.  I was wasting my days and weekends - Saturday brunch drinks that lingered all day and into the evening.   Waking up with headaches being completely unproductive.  Feeling exhausted at the gym. 

The biggest eye opener from stopping: you quickly see how dependent on alcohol our culture really is.  And to assume that alcohol isn’t impacting life because you are able to exercise basic levels of self control is a big error.  

Since cutting alcohol I:

-have found time to write every evening 

-have been able to wake up for gym workouts by 5am


-have managed stress from work much better, putting it to work productively 

-have found more enjoyment reading books - reading seems deep

-am able to control my anger.  I was never an “angry drunk”, but I did overreact to parking tickets, etc.  The ability to cut out obsessing over things in the past goes hand in hand with alcohol.

-am happier.  This is probably the most biggest improvement.  To assume that alcohol helps you cope is ridiculous.  Alcohol is a powerful depressant.   I have had mild depression issues my whole life - never to the point where I am unable to get off the couch, but often to the point where I just feel unshakably sad.  Cutting alcohol has greatly reduced depressive issues.  

This post is more of a mid year check in for myself, but I hope urban city dwellers stop and check their relationship with alcohol from time to time.  For many like myself, alcohol isn’t an addiction, but it’s still a retardant to a meaningful life.",253
2020-06-28 21:41:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hhqwlt/wish_me_luck/,Wish me luck,"   I am going for it guys wish me luck. I don't think I will tell anyone but my wife starting out because I don't want a) people's inquires/judgements b) to fail expectations if it doesn't work out. 

   I have always been pretty responsible, compared to my peers I guess, because I would usually only drink some nights a week and felt pretty in control because of that. Once I get started though my good judgement goes out the window. I have driven way more intoxicated than I ever should have. Luckily I have never hurt anyone....yet. I have blacked out many times and had some cringed, embarrassing moments. Nothing life changing but nothing to be proud of. 

   The older I have gotten the more drinking has taken a toll on me. Hangovers are way worse. I'm definitely a puker. Yesterday I was having a jam with my friends. I had maybe 5-6 beers in 3-4 hrs. Didn't drink much water and was sweating and working hard. Got home and had a beer and a shot, drinking probably from 4-8  Wasn't too tipsy by any standards of my own but for some reason late that night around 12 I just was getting so sick. Like when you are hungover and puking until it's only stomach acid. Cold sweats, couldnt even sleep for 3 hours. Why do I consume something that makes me feel this way. Everyone says when they're hungover IM NEVER DRINKING AGAIN. This time I hope it's for real. 

   What is tough for me is that i am a bartender. I have been furloughed because of covid which has led me to work on a business which I hope to launch in the next few months, but I assume I will need to still work at least part time in restaurants until I can fully support myself from the business if ever. I know there are bartenders that do it but man will it be tough. 

   I guess that brings me to my motivation, my baby girl. I am a new father of a 7 month old beautiful baby. I want to live a long healthy life and see her grow and have a long healthy relationship with her. I want to give her every opportunity in the world. I also owe it to my wife. It's not fair to her to have to take extra responsibility if I am hungover. What if I did something stupid while intoxicated to hurt one of them. 

   I have tried to moderate but I know that all that goes out the window once you have one or two. I am hoping that in writing this, I will feel obligated to stick with my decision and lead a healthier happier life! Thanks for reading!",2

Joining here has helped me stay grounded and my thoughts from veering off course. I feel like I'm not alone anymore. I've been missing that from my life. I have people that support me but they've never been alcoholics themselves, and reading about other people's stories makes me realize as messed up as the actions I've taken are, that it's not unique to me and lots of others have experienced what I've experienced, and that I can come back from this and make my life better. I may not be able to take back the things I've done or get the people I've pushed away back. But today is a new day. New friendships can be had. I have an extreme desire to going back to making a positive difference in my own and others lives. I'm a very talented musician, i make my living playing. It's time I find my fire again.

Then, almost as if I do it before I realize it... I’m drinking. Almost every time I drink I blackout and do amazingly stupid things. 
I know society normalizes drinking, hell, even encourages it. I started drinking when I was 17 and hanging out with college friends. Drinking to excess was seen as a thing of strength. This behavior continued as I worked in bars and restaurants. It’s how we relax, unwind, deal with stress. It’s been 11 years now. I’m done. 
I am changing jobs (from bar to breakfast where no alcohol is served), staying away from Facebook, refocusing my priorities and working on myself. I’ve read 3 chapters in this book and I already feel better. I hated AA, tried multiple meetings over the past several years. Rehab seems like too much. Therapy was ok but not great. 
I am ready to retrain how I view alcohol and really examine my relationship with it. If I don’t, I know nothing will ever get better, only worse.

I am currently on day 65 (i think) sober and I thought I got through the worst parts of sobriety.

It seems plausible to me that both of those feelings where there when I used to drink and surface somehow now. But why now? 

My situation is way better than when I drank. I got more friends, I got a roommate and I get most of my tasks done. 
But now I am afraid to leave the bed, to get food or groceries and to engange with friends. 

Don't get me wrong all of this is way better than being a drunk asshole and I rather experience a bit of anxiety than a hangover plus anxiety. But I do not get as much done as I want to, because I spend almost 6 hours a day in anxiety time out. 

I feel everything a bit more, mostly everything scares me more. Maybe that is the deal. Feel shit but also feel shit.",15

It's my 29th birthday. My sobriety app says I'm at 430 days, an amount that simultaneously seems shockingly short and impossibly long. In some ways it feels like I'm looking back at past Drunk Me like a distant friend I worry about and only wish the best for, even though we can't spend time together anymore. As time passes, it's easier to feel compassion for her, and to see the riptide of pain and struggle she was caught up in. To understand how self-medicating fit into that yearning for oblivion. I was *so fucking afraid*. I felt like I couldn't handle the stark, raw ugliness of the world without the forgetful haze of booze. I was wrong.  

The pandemic has put seemingly everyone on their worst possible mental health footing, and here I am: so fucking happy and optimistic it feels like some cosmic joke. I'm still afraid, but I'm also still sober. Newly single and out of the relationship that helped me quit and stay quit, and scared I won't be able to find someone sober to spend my life with. But, more so happy to be certain that I can do it--sobriety, staying sane, going-through-the-motions and also taking time for the simple/beautiful stuff--all on my own. The world seems like it's on fire, the bucket that contained the contents of my life (town, boyfriend, job) was upturned, and now I'm living with my parents during the apocalypse. Taking stock of my life, I'm more than a little shocked to find that I am happy. Things are looking up--I just started grad school, and I'm out of a relationship that wasn't right for either of us. My family and friends and cat all adore me, and now I can reciprocate that love in healthy and bountiful ways.

I wish I could go tuck my shivering, withdrawal-sick self of 2 Aprils ago into bed, kiss her forehead, and tell her, honestly, ""It's going to be ok. This too, shall pass. This is the most sweetest and most precious gift we have ever given ourselves."" 

For everyone who is there right now, blinking in the harsh and brutal light of new sobriety: I PROMISE, IT DOES GET BETTER. Love yourself enough to know you deserve All of the Good Things. It took me years at attempts, 2 alcohol-withdrawal seizures and subsequent ER trips, and so much therapy/self reflection to get to this point. If I can do it, you can do it. I believe in you.

Thank you for helping me add to my mental health toolbox, r/stopdrinking. I've never posted, but I've always read and cheered you all on. This community is incredible.

We split up a few months ago because of his alcohol induced verbal abuse. We decided to try again. He had stopped drinking while he was away but I hadn't. When he came to stay the weekend with me, I was drinking and he wasn't strong enough to not have one, it turned to two, then eight. Long story short, he left, heading back home drunk and we split up again. I love this man with every fiber of my being and I screwed us up again. He asked me on Wednesday if I wouldn't have had anything to drink if he would have asked me not to, of course I wouldn't have. So it got me thinkin. About us and then my kids.

Extreme despair, heartbreak, and the physical toll of a binge led me to quit drinking. Within 48 hours of sobriety  (enforced by antabuse) i've regained hope and maybe even love.*

Last Tuesday, my girlfriend found my secret bottle of vodka. This was a last of many straws, and we broke up. I moved back to my apartment where predictable happened: I had a major binge and quickly hit a bottom emotionally, and physically.

At this bottom, I realized **there were things I couldn't change**, such as the damage that had been done to my relationship. **There was something I could change, however... and the question wasn't if I was going to quit, it was when, and how much further damage I'd do myself, and what remains of my life.**

My girlfriend asked me how I was doing, so I asked if she'd mind calling me. Sobbing with regret I told her **I was quitting drinking no matter what, and had a serious plan:**

1. Achieve at least 36 hours of sobriety by Sunday
2. If withdrawal symptoms are mild, take an Antabuse (if this part fails, I go to addiction Dr for detox).
3. Followup with an addiction doctor, and set up a schedule to supervise Antabuse for an indefinite period.

**Having a serious plan changed the conversation.** We had dinner at my apartment the next night, and she asked if it would help if I stayed with her for the first 36 hours. I said that **there's nothing more helpful than not being alone.**

Quitting cold turkey wasn't easy. I had *mild* withdrawal symptoms, that peaked around 30 hours. There were also intense bursts of anxiety and sadness that came from the horrific realization that every drink I had made her more sad and anxious.  **She described my drinking as living with a black cloud.**  **To me, the most baffling effect of alcohol is its ability to blind me from seeing the extent of my problem. For example, my apartment is littered with hundreds of cans, and I think everything is fine.**

I'm under no illusions that there isn't serious damage that still needs to be undone. However, it's undeniable that I've gone from pathetic, hopeless, and heartbroken to cautiously optimistic about the future in 48 hours. **And no matter what happens, at least I'm sober today.**",11

I managed a 40 day streak after 3 years of drowning myself every single night. But then I got comfortable. It's like I've been slowly juggling alcohol back into my life. It's never got as bad as it was, but the fact remains. Alcohol causes me problems, and I don't want it to, but I keep letting it. And i dont want to anymore. 

I'm a bit scared I'll fail. My brain keeps telling me I don't have to stop for good, that I can just socially drink and it won't affect me long term. Deep down i dont think that's healthy. I don't know if i can really do that. If you have any tips to combat the fear of losing the friends you drank with, that would help.

But mostly im here for accountability. I am making a promise to myself that I can at least do 10 days.

From the drinking on the job, to the high school style drama, to lack of respect from management. The other night, I had a shot after work which lead to me staying and having a few more drinks. I was proud of myself for not driving and felt good and in control. Then a manager came up and groped me and I lost all control. This led to a blackout, a fight with my SO over the matter that lasted all night with little arguments popping up now from it. I reported what happened and have since quit the job. I can’t help but feel if I hadn’t stayed and drank then this would have never happened. 
I’m going back to a place a I loved to work at that has no alcohol, it’s a breakfast/lunch place so the drinking culture is almost non existent.
I don’t know what will happen with that manager, and I somehow feel this is all my fault. Nothing good ever comes from drinking.

We demonize the makers and sellers of alcohol for promoting an image for us to associate with their product so that drinking seems like a fun, social activity, for beautiful people, with no negative effects.

What we don't talk about is the pervasive marketing and self promotion within sobriety. Why not? It exists, and sometimes I think it's worse.

If I look for treatment online, link after link tries to sell me on 'recovery on the beach programs' or some form of supplement, or a book that will change my life. I used to follow sober bloggers and social media pages, and even then there's some form of selling. 'Sobriety is great...especially with this nutritionally balanced lifestyle shake!'  #sober! #ad. Or, I got sober and you can too! just send me 4.99 to get my sobriety cure-all whitepaper.

This was quite a bitter pill for me to swallow, bearing in mind that I had spent the last 30 plus years using alcohol as a catalyst for my scintillating superpowers! 

It turns out that what I thought was sharp political discourse whilst watching the news was actually the drunken gibberings of a pointlessly angry man. The more booze I had, the more 'right' I was. Anybody who took a different viewpoint was an idiot, who didn't understand the intricacies of national politics/home improvements/cooking a perfect risotto/the frailties of modern footballers/correct nourishment for tomato plants etc. etc. How was it possible for someone to be so correct about such a wide range of subjects? Alcohol had turned me into a gobshite. This properly hit home during an argument with my eldest son about one of the above. After I had delivered the final verbal cudgel that would put any disagreement to bed he looked at me with wet eyes and said ""you're just like Nan"". 

My mum is an alcoholic. I don't get on with her. I can't stand speaking to her on the phone because she is always drunk and never makes any sense. She's living in some kind of ""Who Killed Baby Jane"" film script in her head. She's a nasty drunk. Not like me at all.....

4 words were all it took to make me take a step back and use a fresh pair of eyes to look at where I was at. If I carried on down the road I had chosen my children would end up not wanting to speak to me. My missus, the foundation of my whole existence, would become distant and uninvolved. I had turned into someone I wouldn't have enjoyed speaking to and was well on the way to becoming a clone of my mother. 

Booze was not my friend - so I binned it. It's taken a few months but my mojo is finally coming back. The family seem to prefer this new version of me. I definitely do....

I'm not counting days. I'm just sitting in this new sober space and enjoying it. There's no room for beating myself up about all the time that's been wasted shouting incoherently at Boris' bad haircut or Ronaldos inability to stay on his feet.

You can make it through today and you’ll have a better tomorrow!,"I’ll share some of my musings, things that did or didn’t help.

My personal situation had become just an all out drinking shitfest, just getting blackout drunk everyday after I went through an ugly divorce, just abusing the fuck out of alcohol to get me through this rough shit.

Eventually I got fired  for calling out too much because  of hangovers, which was awesome because I could collect unemployment and had no job to get in the way of my drinking time. 

Well after a few months of this, I was hating the place I was at and it was becoming obvious that something bad was going to happen if I was going to live this way.

 A DUI was just a matter of time and it wasn’t gonna be a wake up call.

I didn’t know how to get out of this cycle but I had a friend who went through this journey and recommended a place for alcohol detox. A 5 day or so stay, you’re monitored and medically treated, without insurance it cost a few thousand dollars but that’s much less than a DUI. I later on found out that I could have just shown up and told them I couldn’t pay and they would have admitted me anyway.

I looked at it as an investment in myself so maybe it made it more meaningful but I was just happy to be getting help.

I tried to get the most out of my time there, trading stories with everyone, group meetings, just getting through the hardest parts with anything that might be available there, just something, whatever, it’s boring but you just gotta ride it out. 

After that major first step everything started getting better, but it was very hard to find a new normal. 

Nothing seemed interesting, I didn’t feel like doing anything, video games, tv/movies, sports, playing music or even listening to it, food, hanging out, talking to people, just nothing at all had any appeal to it.

I just had to get through each day, finding something, looking for something, trying something, to keep myself occupied for the next 5 minutes.

Little by little the enjoyment of things will come back. It’s very hard to get through this period, it was about 2-3 months for me, which I think is considered normal, it really really sucks, just find something to do, and then something else when you’re not enjoying it, it’s uncomfortable but it


Personally I don’t think going to meetings should ever be a recommendation to anyone. I’m sure they “might help” a lot of folks, but you’re still letting alcohol control you, it’s still a part of your life, just different.

Quitting drinking has a lot of hard parts and I definitely wouldn’t say that I’m *never drinking again*, because that’s a heavy burden and fear of missing out is real.

But I haven’t missed out on anything in the past year, and even though the world is falling apart because of this virus, I’m feeling better than I have in awhile. 

Sorry to ramble on, I just love how supportive you all are here and I thought I would pop by and share my milestone, which I guess is really a milestone for all of us here, because for 365 days I did not drink with some of you guys.

Background: I know without a doubt that I can’t tell anyone I’m stopping drinking if I want this to work for me. Other people knowing would introduce outside opinion which (positive or negative) I would want to rebel against. Getting sober feels like my own private journey, and needs to be just as sneaky as the full extent of my drinking was. 

Today would have been day 15 alcohol free for me. It’s been great and the whole experience has been really positive so far- I was feeling really proud of myself.

When I got home from work today, everything was normal and I was chatting in the kitchen with my dad, and then halfway through our conversation he took out a glass, poured some wine in it and insisted I try it (I found out later it was a really crappy bottle my sister had bought- it’s not at all unusual for him to offer me a taste of a new/different wine). I refused to taste it about three times, but he kept insisting, asking ‘what’s wrong?’ and it sounded like there was some annoyance creeping into his voice so I gave in and took a single sip to make him shut up (he had a temper while I was growing up and I didn’t want to press the issue or have to explain not drinking).

I feel really shitty and conflicted about the whole thing. I was going so well and then I went and blew it on a taste of something I repeatedly said I didn’t want and that he KNEW tasted horrible anyway! And even though I truly didn’t want the alcohol, I’ve found myself having thoughts now along the lines of *‘in for a penny, right? Might as well go buy some whisky tomorrow if I’m resetting to day 1 anyway…’*

I don’t genuinely want to do that, I know that the past couple of weeks weren’t for naught, but I just don’t know how to channel my (very overblown) anger, whether or not to count this as a real slip up, and how to not let myself get derailed by hiccups like this along the road. Reading this back I actually feel quite silly for feeling so upset by something so small, but this is the only place I'm comfortable venting.

Any words of advice?",3

I hadn't slept due to the heatwave, and I woke up tired and dehydrated, with a pounding head. I dragged myself out of bed, started my WFH day, and soon found myself grumpy and unfocused. On top of being tired, I have some life stress that I'm dealing with, and hormonal issues this time of the month. I struggled to get through the day, eventually just trying to take a nap on my lunch break. Couldn't sleep, but was so tired. I ended up taking the afternoon off to watch TV, cried a little bit because I felt so low, and ended my day with a huge takeaway pizza and ice cream. 

I realised, as I was polishing off my ice cream, that this was pretty much exactly how I would have handled a hangover day. By the end of the day, after chilling and indulging in some junk food, I felt a lot better. I guess I'm still going to have  shitty days, and there is  comfort in snuggling up with TV and ice cream, just as I would have when I was suffering from a hangover. 

Except this time, this day didn't come about because of overdoing it the night before, wasting tonnes of money on booze, and I didn't have nearly as much anxiety or self-loathing, or nausea had I had been hungover.

What I'm trying to say is, just because we're sober doesn't mean every day will be perfect. But the lows are way less low, and they don't come alongside a mess of self-hatred anymore. I felt OK taking the afternoon off, recognising that my body needed a break, and this wasn't due to my irresponsibility the night before. And that's a great feeling.

I've reflected on where I went wrong and everyone kept telling me just to think of today and not tomorrow. I should have focused on the day instead of getting overwhelmed with the thought of never drinking again and can I really do that?! What I can say is I can not drink for one day and if I had focused on that one day, the days would've added up.

I'm sorry to all those that helped me and that I've let down and I'm sorry that I let myself down.

Since the quarantine started and places closed down I obviously stayed home. I never have really been a home drinker.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hey SD... it's great to be back!  
  
I first hosted back in December, when I was less than two months into my journey and I'm happy to report, I've managed to hang in there this whole time. And man, does my life ever look a lot different now than it did back then.... 
  
I won't say it's been easy all the time. There have been many ups and downs, and I have learned SO SOOOOO much... but every time I make it through a rough patch, the next good stretch seems a little longer and brighter. 
  
One of my favourite parts of sobriety, now that I'm a little further in... is starting to rediscover myself and having hobbies and stuff again. A ""rediscovered passion"" of mine is music. I still ""listened"" to music but I didn't REALLY listen. I'm back to really listening deeply. So if you happen to feel like sharing a good song with me (recovery related OR otherwise!!!) that would be a cool start to my week :)  
  
Happy Sunday, friends. I hope you'll all join me in not drinking today! IWNDWYT.",77

Each time he had a rational explanation for his interactions, and he has never been unfaithful to me. I am just really really struggling at letting go of all the un trustworthy people from my past and I take it all out on him. This is my main trigger for my 2 relapses in the past 22 days. I believe I am also a narcissist in many ways, so that's an extra hurdle. I'm trying to come up with some ways to tame the jealous insecure beast.

2020-06-28 00:45:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hh8i88/day_3_again/,Day 3 (again),"After 100 days sober earlier this year, I relapsed in March. I think it was a combination of frustrations with work (hospitality), a reintroduction of a very toxic relationship, and of course the world falling apart. I picked up right where I left off, drinking 10-15 drinks a day. Then I quit my job in April but was miraculously approved for unemployment. It was a perfect storm for the heaviest drinking I've ever done: tons of free time, no obligations whatsoever, and more money in unemployment than before. It got scary bad. I would go on a three day bender, then spend a day in bed with cold sweats and dry-heaving, only to start the whole cycle over again.

Cue to last week: the toxic relationship comes back into play. She's absolutely gorgeous but mentally unstable, a kleptomaniac, and most importantly an alcoholic and meth addict. We had a great time for a few days just drinking, then she relapsed on meth on Monday. By Tuesday I was curious to try it (it had been a few years). I tried to keep up with her and her friends, but on Wednesday afternoon I collapsed and was sent to the ER, where I spent 7 hours. 

They released me but never called her to pick me up. I stumbled out into the night with a dead phone and no idea where I was (turns out I was 30 minutes drive away from home). I spent the next 16 hours trying to make it home, walking most of the way and hallucinating the craziest shit. At some point I got the idea that a crazy ex of the girl was out to kill me with the help of his gang. I finally made it to downtown of my city, only to hallucinate that the gang had found me and chased me all around downtown. It was so real, I can still describe it all in detail. 

I ended up at my old restaurant and made a fool of myself. I think, though, that I subconsciously went there because the owners are sober and have helped me immensely in the past. They called my sister to pick me up. I was terrified to go home, but my sister wasn't going to let that happen anyway. The next morning I realized it was all in my head. How embarrassing!

So here I am starting over again. Detoxing at my sister's house has been easier than I expected. I think the last few days of meth use actually helped with withdrawals, since I wasn't drinking near as much then. I'm a bit shaky still and pretty anxious/fidgety but no seizures or anything so far. I took part of my first Zoom AA meeting today, and man was it great to be a part of. I intend to do 90 in 90 this time. Rehab might happen this time (I only did 7-day detox last time). 

The feelings of shame and hopelessness are slowly starting to shift to positivity and determination to really work the steps this time. I can't go back. I know for a fact that if I relapse again, I won't make it out.",4

Honestly I'm just feeling shitty and want to rant, and figured someone might benefit from a reminder of how awful hangovers feel.

Just for background, I'm male, midlate twenties. Old drinking habits were worse but that's for another time, these days I have 2-4 beers a few times a week. I've struggled with mild depression for a long time and alcohol makes me feel better, bad reason but yeah.

Anyways, gyms recently reopened, I've got a big project at one of my jobs and my other job gives me a lot of late shifts, meaning I'm often completely busy from 8 in the morning to 10 in the evening. Perfect opportunity to cool down drinking, right? And I did, went a week and a half without. Been feeling pretty good moodwise too. But of course, I've also been dead tired. And yesterday, Saturday, I had a day shift ending at 4, just in time before alcohol sales close at 6(European). 

So I bought 7 beers and a pizza, was wasted before 9, passed out, woke up at 2 in the morning with a head splitting headache feeling shittier than I have for a long while. I've had the stinky beer poop. I've puked my guts up. I've watched porn trying to get horny to override pain with no success. I've listened to Sound of Silence on repeat because it's my hangover comfort song. I've been missing my girlfriend a lot because she'd give me a back rub and sympathetic eyes, oh and I also listened to Mrs. Robinson a few times and hoped Joe Dimaggio would come over and just hit me hard in the head. I've burped and they tasted like vomit even though I gargled mouthwash and brushed my teeth. 

It's 6.30 now, my headache is finally gone, my head is clear and I'm just thinking... What on Earth did I do that for? It was a fun couple of hours watching Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, eating pizza and drinking, but I barely remember the ending which I'm pretty sure was the best part (except for Brad Pitt in the park, but no spoilers) and I could have had a great time without all the alcohol. The punishment for the drinks is lasting several times as long as the fun part, that's for sure.

Anyway, that's my rant, thanks for reading. Hangovers are not worth it, they are way worse than you remember and nothing like the ""groggy and mumbling but otherwise pretty much fine"" hangovers in movies(looking at you, Leo, no way you could have even gotten to the movie studio like this).",10

I’ve quit cold turkey before (dumb) but never experienced any seizures or DTs. As long as I had someone with me at all times (thanks mom!) and that I went in everyday to get stats and labs done, I got clearance. 

I’ve never med detoxed before in my life and all I can say is that it was best decision I’ve ever made. I found out, first, that I was so dehydrated that my kidneys were starting to shut down (gave me two bags of saline via IV which almost instantly brought up my blood pressure). They gave me instructions on how much fluid I should be drinking, to be eating salty foods, vitamins to take, and gave me an amazing medication for nausea that worked nearly instantly. I was able to then go home, sleep in my own bed and didn’t feel the excruciating withdrawal symptoms that I was used to. 

I’m not saying it’s been a super easy five days and I know I’m not completely out of the proverbial woods yet. But I am feeling so confident. I was just drinking to stave off the withdrawal, I wasn’t even getting drunk anymore. It was just a chore I had to go through. Detoxing has lifted such a weight off of me. 

TL/DR - if you are on the fence about doing medical detox, as I was, really consider it. Everyone has a different experience but it is one of the best decisions I’ve made.",5

Hello, SD! I've been lurking here for a short while, and while I'm interested in starting my sobriety journey, I know I can't do it without support. I moved to a new city somewhat recently, and I don't feel comfortable enough with my new, non-alcoholic friends to burden them with this new phase of my life.

I'm looking for someone (or multiple people) to help me keep myself in check. I've improved on limiting my drinking while working from home in quarantine (going from drinking throughout my work day to starting my binge at 5), but I don't think I can go further on my own. Beyond the emotional reasons why I drink, I think my biggest obstacle is that my city allows alcohol to be sold until 9pm. I do fine during the day, but once 5pm hits, I'm planning my next binge. 

I'm looking for someone (or multiple people) to help me resist the urge to go out and buy alcohol from 5-9pm CST. It doesn't matter if we're texting, playing video games, face timing, etc--I just really need some affirming companionship right now. 

A little about me: I'm 27F living in the Midwest, US. I love talking about politics, lgbt issues, drag, fashion, video games (ACNH, anyone?), any and all music (I'm also a singer if you want to jam!), pop culture, and art. I just really need some friends who are committed to sobriety, who can help distract me until 9pm hits and I'm safe. I'm also happy to be there for anyone else who is staring their journey too. We're all in this together.

Walking home I passed what seemed like 15 different liquor stores. I almost went in 3 different times. I had to sit down and tell myself that I don’t want to give alcohol the power in this moment and I thought about how much worse I would feel if I had to go to the tow yard tomorrow hungover and ashamed. It’s so easy to think that bad things won’t happen to us after we get sober. Today I realized that I’m always going to be tested and bad things are inevitable.

This week has felt a lot like being back in early recovery, in a good way. Some in person AA meetings are back and running in my city and I've been going. I live alone, I'm not in a relationship, I'm not working, and I have a tendency to isolate and live in my own head as it is. I didn't recognize it so much when I was in it, but this has been hard for me, and part of what has made it hard for me is not being able to go to meetings. 

I've been doing Zoom meetings and calling sober friends and reaching out to people with less sober time than me and trying to be supportive of them, but it ain't cutting it. I'm not struggling to stay sober, but I've been struggling generally. I can go without sitting down in a restaurant for a year without missing a beat, but not going to an AA meeting for a year would kill me. So I'm back in meetings.

I'm excited about being in recovery again. It has felt so good to hang out and talk with people after meetings. I'm reconnecting with friends and getting to know new people. The Alano club I generally go to is taking this opportunity to revamp some meetings that never transitioned to Zoom because nobody gave enough of a shit about the meeting to make it happen, chairperson included. These are meetings that have been going for years and are kinda tired, and don't have a regular attendees.

One of the new meetings is a 6th and 7th step meeting where we're reading [Drop The Rock](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36681.Drop_The_Rock) which is a book that's been recommended to me multiple times which I've never gotten around to reading. We started this week and there were a lot of lively comments. It feels exciting to be doing something new to work on my recovery. I'm starting an [A Woman's Way Through The Twelve Steps](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29028.A_Woman_s_Way_through_the_Twelve_Steps) meeting, which is another book that I've had recommended (and even own, but I don't think I made it past the first chapter.) I'm excited for that, I learn and grow so much in my recovery when I do it with other people. (And I've now also got a [Living Sober](http://aaposigintergrouptrinidad.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Living-Sober.pdf) meeting which I'm giving away as soon as I can find someone to take it. It's a great book, extremely practical, I just don't need to chair everything.)

I also went to a meeting at a different location this week, just to check out an AA history meeting which I'd heard about. ('Cos I'm a nerd like that.) I got turned around trying to find the place, and then I walked into a Cocaine Anonymous meeting and didn't realize I was in the wrong meeting for a couple of minutes. (They were very nice and said that I was welcome to stay, but that's never really been my thing and it would've felt weird.) 

So by the time I made it into the AA meeting I was five or ten minutes late. I spent my first couple of minutes there trying to surreptitiously check out the meeting schedule posted on the wall because I thought I might have read it wrong and gone to a men's meeting accidentally and everyone was being too polite to tell me, because it was a room full of guys and nobody was talking about history.

People were sharing about their experiences with hitting bottom and getting sober, and I picked up that it was someone's first AA meeting and so we were doing a first step meeting. I was the only woman in the room, and the guys generally looked like they'd experienced the sort of consequences that they were talking about - jails, homelessness, that sort of thing. It was basically what I thought AA was going to be before I went to AA.

And then, after I heard a couple of guys share, I could feel myself unwinding. I could feel that internal spring that I didn't even know was wound up so tight through me just... loosen. I relaxed. I didn't have to make myself do it, it wasn't an intellectual thing, it was physical. I knew I was safe. I knew I was home.

People talked about consequences of their drinking which I didn't experience. I've had my moments doing sketchy things with sketchy people, but I'm not going to pretend like I'm all street. I'm a white girl from the suburbs with a college education, I came from a different set of circumstances and I had a different path to my bottom. Sitting in my kitchen drinking an entire wine cube from Target by myself may not look the same on the outside, but it's the same. It's the same despair. It's the same pain. It's the same hopelessness. It's the same isolation. It's the same wasted life.

And it's the same solution. That's what got me to relax, that's how I knew I was home. It wasn't that I could recognize my own addiction when they talked about their addictions, it's that we have the same solution. When they talked about how they got sober and what works in their recovery, there wasn't even a cosmetic difference from what I'm doing. They talked about their recovery and I could hear from what they were saying about it that they were doing the deal, and I knew that I was among my people and I was safe.

I realized in that meeting that it's coming up on the tenth anniversary of my first AA meeting. (I looked it up when I got home. It was two days after the world cup final, so it would've been July 13th.) I don't really remember anything about that meeting. I remember waiting to go to the meeting, I remember looking it up and driving around and how the street looked and the building looked when I was sitting parked across the street in my car waiting to go in. Couldn't tell you a single thing that happened in the meeting. And I didn't go back to another meeting for almost four years, right around the same time that I stumbled on SD.

But I remember this guy's first meeting. I was there for it, the same way that other people were there for me. Whether I remember the specifics or not, they were they, and they've been there every time since. 

I talked to the new guy afterwards. I stood around outside with the guys and realized that I knew one of them from another meeting once his mask was off. They were all welcoming and appropriate and kind, and it was a good meeting. People had things to share that I needed to hear, and I still want to go to an AA history meeting, so I'm going back.

I'm grateful for my sobriety, sobernauts. I'm grateful that I made it here. Me getting sober was not a foregone conclusion. I got a gift that I didn't deserve, and I'm so glad that I have something to share. The best part of being sober is having something to share. There is tremendous beauty in sharing. Thanks for being here with me.

I dont think I am alcoholic but I drink almost everyday. I think I can stop but didnt happen, also didnt put effort in it.

I drink in a bar, with friends, alone or even to sleep, but all this is doesnt have a routine. I can spend some days without drinking, but few beers after work makes the day a better day.

&#x200B;

Problem is, when I drink, my head goes free, noo limits. I change my ideas, make huge plans and worst of all, buy drugs etc.

&#x200B;

The think is, I dont think it has impacted my life, but I realise I cannot change it.

I stopped drinking with the assistance of a psychiatrist as alcoholism is only one of my issues (OCD, Major Recurrent Depressive Disorder, Anxiety Issues.)

I think AA is a wonderful organization, but I do not go because of a few experiences I had at meetings. Nothing necessarily bad, but ""just not for me."" I've heard that this reason is sometimes not accepted by people in AA. True? I believe I am in recovery now after 10 months. I am at peace. I am not ""white knuckling"" or in the ""pink cloud"".

I posted today because I am finally admitting that I am lonely. I've lost all of my local friends in sobriety, and my social life has completely dried up. I have a wonderful wife who has been incredibly supportive (even stopped drinking), but I lean on her entirely now. How else do you all find social outlets?

But not hungover 🙂,"Day 3 again. After over 3 weeks of no alcohol I thought I could just have one night off while out on a very rare date night with my husband and that I would be ok, well that turned into 4 nights of drinks. Every evening without fail I’d open a drink as soon as I started cooking dinner. I felt so tired and lethargic from the previous evenings drinks that I felt I needed another drink just to get through the evening chores of family life. And the cycle starts again. Luckily this time I only reached day 4 ( previously a year of drinks every night ) before I thought this can’t go on any longer! 

Things I’m trying different this time.... journaling all of my thoughts down, I over think everything in life, forward plan every occasion, it’s like my mind has no off button, that’s part of the reason I drink as it’s the only time I can stop thinking. So every time I find my mind working overtime I will write it all down on paper and so far that has helped me stay sober this weekend. 

Trying to be more in the moment. I was at work yesterday and my mind was racing about the list I had in my head of tasks to complete at work and then my mind jumped onto the tasks at home I had to complete when I arrived home ( husband works away ) and I suddenly got very stressed and thought no wonder you think of drinking all day! Stop it!!! So I stopped what I was doing for 5 minutes and found a quiet spot outside next to a water feature. I just sat, looked up at the sky and listened to the sound of the water. I promised myself in that moment I will take regular breaks, even a few minutes, to stop what I’m doing and just breathe.

So, a week ago I had almost a week off work due to our country having the summer solstice festival which is a huge deal here and is accompanied by on-par consumption of beer to Octoberfest. But that’s not the issue. 

With a couple of friends, I went on a culinary tour to a region of our country that has its own, different language, traditions and culture. At this one place, where you have to book a seat weeks before, along with multiple courses we were served the local, tradition-rich moonshine called “shmakovka” as an apéretif. To avoid making a big deal about my problem (which only a few, closest to me, people know about), I had a 15ml (0.5 oz) shot. There were other companies at the table too and it’s a matter of honor for the hosts over there too, so I just went along. 

Now, for the last days I’ve been a little conflicted about the whole situation. Should’ve I been open about my problem and just rejected the drink? And should I request a badge reset? 

On one hand, abstinence for me is a state of mind, a path of choice to being healthy and happy and this “incident” hasn’t changed it or even challenged this mindset. I’m better than ever and I can’t even imagine a scenario anymore in which I would seek refuge in alcohol. On the other hand - it’s also an all-in commitment not to drink..and I’m well aware of the concept of slippery slope.

Isn’t it sad that no matter how much time has passed and what good place I’m in, once you’ve been down that road, alcohol can still have a certain grip on me? Is this why people who’ve been sober for 10 years still say: “I’m
an alcoholic”? I thought I was past that.

I've never had it but I've heard amazing things, so I was fine paying $53 for it. I got in the car, took a photo of the bottle, and headed home. 

Since I live with my parents, I explained the bottle when I walked in the door - many people release it by lottery, so I was lucky to find a store that sold it at random and on short notice. 

My mom said, ""Sounds good. Do you want us to keep it in our closet until you can give it to Alex?"" 

""That was my plan. I'm not interested in it, so it doesn't much matter where it is."" After coming down to my basement and thinking about it, I feel great.

- That bloated feeling is gone
- I actually *can* still have solid bowel movements. And I'm back to only once or twice a day instead of half a dozen or more dying-ketchup-bottle type deposits. 
- My stomach isn't churning all day and night
- Acid reflux has essentially disappeared 
- I sleep better
- I urinate less frequently, and it's less dark
- Breathing is a bit easier
- My mind is less foggy, and I forget fewer things 
- Inflammation has lessened. My face isn't always red, and my eyes aren't as puffy. 
- I've saved money

There are likely more, but those are the ones that stand out to me right now.

Every part of my life was in shambles (finances, social life, job performance, health, hobbies, etc) and there was no time to fix any of it between the binges and recovery time. I KNEW I needed at least a month off the sauce to get my shit together, but I had moved to a new city and the constant FOMO of events going on and the need to socialize and meet people had a vicegrip on me. 

I initially said I was going to do a ""dry March"", which I have kept going due to everything being shut down due to covid. In the last few months, I've been able to quadruple my bank account, find a great therapist and consistently work through my issues, decrease my anxiety tenfold, fix my diet and get in shape, vastly improve my work performance, and make some solid progress on my hobbies. This post isn't meant to brag at all, but just show what's possible when I don't let the feeling of FOMO consume me. There luckily is nothing going on to fear missing out on right now, but I am a bit concerned about what I'm going to do when things return to normal. 

Anyone else make progress on their drinking/life during the shutdowns the last few months, and if so, how do you plan to go about things when everything starts back up again?",12

Last year I was doing a lot of stupid shit with one landing me at the hospital. I was also really depressed and just drinking thinking I was giving my mind a break from thinking about life. 

Now, about to hit 8 months, and after August will be a year from a self harm incident. Comparing then from now, I've had so many things go wrong this year, and a large majority aren't from drinking, or my fault; just a really shitty circumstances that have affected a lot of people. Last year, I didn't really have difficult problems like this year. And I know had I been drinking, I would have done something stupid. 

It's nice to be in the other side. I'm still pretty depressed, but at least I have a pretty coherent mind to go about tonight. Hearing about the alcohol abuse and binge drinking my co workers participate in and not being part of that crowd is nice. Especially since it's trouble galore. None of them want to change either. They just glorify drinking as a right for the circumstances we're all in, except most of their problems are due to drinking. And now they are making it problematic for everyone. 

I appreciate being able to be in the other side and reflect where I'm at. I think I hit the milestone that I don't need to binge drink, or even want to. It's empowering. These are hard times and I know I'm not alone. 

I wish the best for you all and hope you get your forms of empowerment soon enough! These times are tough but staying sober is definitely a show of resilience and strength!",4

My co-worker came back from getting married in his home country and gave me a bottle of whiskey yesterday as a wedding gift, since I am his elder / senior rank. I told him a week or so ago that I had quit drinking, so he told me to just display the bottle up on a shelf. Pretty sure he just thought I stopped as part of my dieting, etc., so no harm there. 

Driving home, the thirst started. As I was pulling into my driveway I saw my neighbor and his wife out front. I asked if he liked whiskey and he does, so the bottle was passed on to a better home. 

The thirst is still there, but I'm not going to do it. I'm proud of where I am today.

During last 70 days I have drunk only once (and amount was low, so I was only tipsy, not drunk or blackouted).

I figured I'd share my experience in case anyone else is trying to decide if they should try it or not.

I enjoyed the taste. I mixed it with diet tonic so it was like having a nice non alcoholic gin and tonic. The herbal flavors were a nice change up from some other sugary mocktails I've had.

I did eventually feel a slight happy buzzy feeling, but also didn't feel very good after that wore off. That could have just been because I was a bit dehydrated and hadn't eaten much that day (my own stupid fault), so I'm not going to necessarily blame it in Kin. Once I ate and hydrated I felt physically better, but I did find myself feeling a bit anxious and very tired later that night. Again, may have been just circumstance (it was a rough week at work) rather than the Kin, but I'm very wary since one of my biggest reasons for never wanting to drink alcohol again is because of the anxiety it gives me.

Overall, I'm up to try it again some time when I am better controlling external factors like my blood sugar and starting mood and see how I feel afterwards. I did have a really good time out with friends, enjoyed the drink itself, and was very, very happy to not be drinking alcohol (especially when the cigars came out. Drunk me thinks I like smoking cigars, sober me knows better). Once this bottle is gone I don't see myself running out to buy another given the cost and that I have found other mocktail recipes that I really enjoy that are way cheaper and don't have questionable mood altering ingredients.

Kin Euphorics is definitely not for everyone and if you're someone who can see themselves going back to alcohol after experiencing a somewhat buzzy feeling, I absolutely don't recommend trying Kin. I'm extremely comfortable and confident in my sobriety at this specific point in my journey and I wouldn't try Kin if that wasn't the case.

Hope this is helpful information. No matter what else may happen, IWNDWYT.

As the title already tells you, I am a very small drinker. I never crave alcohol and almost never drink on a 'regular' evening. However, being a student (22Y), I attend the occasional party and then I do most of the time drink; and also more than I would wish for. But even after a few drinks, I already feel so much worse (read: unproductive, filthy, tired) the next day that I just want to stop drinking altogether. I do not have a severe problem with drinking at all, but every time I do drink, I feel bad about it. I care much about my physical health, and I love to exercise and take proper care of my diet. Anytime I drink (how sparse that may be), I end up also eating too much and unhealthy. 

I have already had periods without any drinking for +3 months (thanks to COVID), without any difficulty. Reading stories of others who actually experience a lot of struggle due to their drinking, I therefore feel a bit like an idiot making a thing out of not drinking. I am afraid that when I tell people I do not drink, they will respond with something along the lines of ""Why? You don't have a problem with drinking at all"". However, drinking alcohol is something which keeps bothering me, so I figured it would be better to completely stop drinking, as it is probably easier for me to maintain then to occasionally overdo it at a party.

Anyhow, I was wondering if they're others here who relate to this and what their thoughts about it are.

At the beginning of lockdown I was secretly drinking (hiding it from my partner) and it's so easy to fall back into the same pattern. Long story below, but trying to use this to reflect and change.  


I have a long history of drinking too much, and very significant issues with my parents drinking too much. I've managed to mostly keep a handle on it, and after being ill earlier last month (not alcohol related, but with a very upset stomach) decided a dry june was definitely in order. I've lost a stone (14lbs) and been eating healthy and exercising. Managed it without too much difficulty, but last night, after a tough afternoon of meetings, I cracked and made myself a vodka tonic. I have the vodka borrowed from a friend to make some pastry a while ago, and had kept it a secret from my parter. I had a couple of vodkas and then decided 'fuck it' and ordered some pizza and a bottle of wine on deliveroo, as well as some beers, which I was planning to 'hide' from my partner as well, as they had an online activity scheduled. I thought I had changed, and that I could just enjoy a friday night drink like a normal person.

Well, they definitely noticed I was a bit drunk before we'd even eaten, and although I denied it, I felt so bad for lying. We had the wine together and the pizza, which was a nice treat, but I could tell that I was just going to take it too far and that the wine was really hitting me hard.  I feel like this time when I was drinking they were so concerned about me because I'd been ill and it was a sudden out of character decision to order the wine when I've been so committed to my health over the last few weeks. When they had their online event I drank one of the beers, didn't even enjoy it, then took the rest out of the fridge, and poured the vodka down the drain. I feel like that was positive, but I can't bring myself to confess about the secret drinking. We talked about it this morning and I said I regretted doing it, but didn't confess to the whole thing (vodka, ordering extra beers). In fact, this is the first time I've ever 'confessed' to that kind of thing.

Clearly I can't go back to drinking in a normal way, and need to stay sober, and in some ways last night was a change as I didn't go crazy and decided to stop. Now I have 7 beers burning a hole in the cupboard, and I need to get rid of them and get back on the wagon.   


Feels good to get that off my chest, and I'd welcome any advice going ahead. I'm going to start checking in on the daily thread, and wish everyone here the best.",1

So I have had a problem with drinking the last 5 years, going through roughly $120 a week on either vodka or whiskey. Just over a month ago, I had my ""holy shit"" moment. I had drank roughly 1.5L, in about 3 hours, of low low low tier vodka (was cheap) and I paid for it the entire next day. Worst hangover of my life (28); cold sweats, the spins, vomiting, 100% felt like I was going to die. At that moment I gave up drinking. 

I am honestly surprised however, that I haven't had a craving AT ALL since that night. My honest opinion, having quit smoking cigarettes 160 days was a more daunting task/goal. My goal now, is make it a year ... and continue the sober journey. Oh yeah, this is also the longest time I've been sober since 21. I am ready to start a new chapter in life.",31

The boss will take us out to lunch and orders us drinks. Then after lunch the liquor cabinet opens. It's not uncommon to drink at your desk on a Friday afternoon.

Thing is, it's helped me to bond with my coworkers. It helps to loosen everyone up when we're selling on the phone. The words flow smoother. The anxiety drops. I suddenly sound like an expert.

I really have little desire to drink at all anymore which is why I'm here. I think I can manage a few drinks at lunch once a week. There's no peer pressure, but when your boss buys you a drink....what would you do?

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

True in every aspect, especially sobriety. Everything changes when a person Sobers up. I am changing now that I'm sober. 

Naturally, things around me have begun to change too. Not spending time with people that are engaging in activities harmful to my sobriety, but rather enjoying deeper connections with a few special people. Friendships have changed drastically. 

What I did not expect to change, yet is so obvious now, is my relationship with my parents. My parents, especially my dad, have been two of my BIGGEST drinking buddies. They fed me my first taste of alcohol as a child, bought my brother and I our first underage bootleg drinks, and allowed us to host friends over with a drink or two. They were the cool parents. Long story short, they're functional Alcoholics that go in and out of periods of heavy drinking. They're heavily in denial and quick to offer up every justification in the book without prompt. I've been so clear about boundaries and they still put me in a precious situation. It's turned into a huge nightmare. Amplified by his use, my dad is an Extremely emotional person, requesting space will not end will. It's also the longest I've ever really gone without talking to them. He tried to bait me into a fight tonight, but I didn't go for it. It's brutal cutting them out right now now but it's what I feel I have to do to protect myself. I can't fall victim to my father's emotional immaturity and unpacked trauma anymore. I'm busy navigating sobriety and unpacking my own stuff. 

I guess I just came here to say that outloud. This is all new to me. I am so thankful to have a space to be able to share these thoughts. I am thankful if you made it this far, and that you're here with me.",4

Today, my new coworkers and I met for a celebration. Most people drank and I had my seltzers. Other people drank up most of my seltzers, but I switched to water. I was almost poured a champagne, and declined. ""Oh, won't you even take some for the toast?"" Nah, thanks. I'm good. We were invited to do Zoom shots with our seniors, as part of ""tradition."" I poured an opaque cup full of water. A senior came over to join our celebration, and brought a bottle of whiskey with him. When he started pouring shots, I took the opportunity to go use the restroom. 

I realized after about an hour that the shirt I was wearing was one I hadn't worn for quite a while. It still smelled like drunk me, despite being washed. Not like alcohol, but like that weird sweet smell that used to seep from my pores a day or two after a binge. It makes me sick now, and it used to terrify me; ""oh god, what if someone smells it? What if my BOSS smells it?"" Now, it felt annoying, but impersonal. Instead of letting it get to me, I refused to feel ownership over it. Like it wasn't even mine.

In the end, I did it. Almost no one said anything. I had a better time than I thought I would, and have no regrets about anything rude or unprofessional I may have said or done. I noticed that nobody else drank enough to appear visibly drunk--something I never used to notice before, when I was boozing, is that adults my age usually aren't getting super smashed anymore. It was just me. At one point, I felt myself getting super loose and saying dumb shit. I had a reflex ""oh shit"" reaction until I realized I was just relaxing (without chemical influence) around my new friends. 

I was in such a dark place when I stopped. I really, truly, do not want to drink again. I mostly miss the image. I am the type of person who would enjoy a fancy beer and a cool brewery. I have come to realize, though, that 1) that shit is aggressively marketed poison and I was lining a corporation's pockets with my beer money for cool points, and 2) it's my problem if I can't find anything more interesting about my personality than that. 

Anyway, I'm doing okay. No big revelations, and I'm still struggling to be relaxed and likable the way I used to be. But it feels so much better now. I finally feel like I'm going to be okay.",29

Not drinking has transformed this vacation into the restorative time away that I’ve always wanted.  No longer does drinking become the default activity that robs me of my sleep and my wellbeing.  Truly, this is the way.

And to those who are wondering whether to take the plunge, to be honest, not cracking open a beer in the evening after everyone has gone to sleep has been a bit of a challenge.

It was advanced liver disease and he was transferred to a larger hospital (Stanford) in March where it was determined he needed a transplant.  From March 28-now I have been forbidden to contact with him.  His mother is suspiciously strict about this and going so far as to consider a restraining order when I wrote him an email in May.

We're getting pummeled by the weather right now.  I just got home from dropping daughter and her friend off at daughter's Mom's.  Lots of downed trees and flooded roads and many lightning strikes across the corn and soy bean fields.  

We're getting gusts up over 50mph, and up to 75mph.  It's scary but beautiful at the same time.  

I'm about to get ready for work.  I'll roll out the yoga mat and try and clear my head so I can focus at work.  I've got a lot going on, and I've got one shift, and off again for the rest of the weekend.

These shifts are dangerous because I tend to let my guard down and hope that nothing happens while I bide my time.  And in these cases, it's when the SHTF.  So I'll have to bring my A game.

Also, let my dog out and feed her.

Then shower, get all my supplies ready, including multitude of pens and markers.  

Also make a giant bowl of oatmeal and make myself a lunch.  But I think daughter and friend ate almost all of the food in the house.  They are supposed to feed us at work but being on third shift, all the food is usually gone.  There may be some scraps left over.

2020-06-26 20:05:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hgj6ie/principles_before_personalities/,Principles Before Personalities.,"So I’m struggling.  The pandemic halted my usual routine and I’ve been disconnected from AA for a while.  I reconnected with my home group, but the current media on BLM protests and the division between people in regards to the pandemic has caused so many people to be more vocal about their bigotry and their inability to understand human rights.  I don’t think these topics necessarily need to be discussed in AA, especially not during a meeting, but they were, and not by my choosing.

I’ve been attending Secular AA because traditional AA in my area is very religious, I think more so from other areas from what I can gather.  My home group started to get together at a member’s house, and I finally decided I needed to go.  I held off mainly because I work in healthcare and didn’t want to risk anyone’s health, but they continued to invite me.  It was in this meeting just yesterday, during a group discussion the owner said, ""All these protesters and looters are just about the largest group of uneducated people who have ever gotten together in one place"".  I suppose this was forgetting the fact that these protests and rallies are happening globally in many places, with millions of attendees spread across the world as they've been going on for weeks now.

I then voiced, “I've been going to these protests, are you calling me uneducated?""  

To which he replied, ""Well, you also have these white liberals who just want to feel good about themselves.""  

The room went silent, no one had anything to say, and the subject was changed.

I didn't speak for the rest of the meeting and went home without checking in with anyone.  I went to this meeting rather vulnerable and made that vulnerability known prior to these statements, stating that I’ve been wavering and thinking about drinking.  I don't have thick skin at the moment.

So I decided to start reaching out to people I’ve known from other traditional meetings and see if anyone is meeting up online or elsewhere.  I vented to a friend who attends other meetings and he was sympathetic, he invited me to his home group online meeting.  Then, quickly, the conversation took a turn.  He knows that I normally attend Secular AA and he’s known I don’t really buy into the “higher power” stuff.  It was through messaging, and this was the exchange:

>AA: Are you still holding fast to the objection of some sort of unseen power in the universe?

>Me: Haha yeah.  I mean, unless you mean gravity.  But a divine omniscient being or power, yeah.

>AA: I don’t think you’re an alcoholic.  I don’t mean that in a hurtful way.

>Me: Why do you say that?

>AA: I’ve been sold on the ideas and conceptions presented in the big book of Alcoholics Anonymous.

>Me: Okay?  So you don’t think someone can have the physical and emotional compulsion to drink alcohol and have self destructive behavior unless they agree with everything from a single book written in 1939?

>AA: Difference in being a hard drinker and a real alcoholic.  Same with addicts.  There are people who used to do heroin but smoke weed and drink now in safety, and then there are people who are real addicts.  Just my experience.

>Me: I do take offense to what you said because my brain looks for excuses to drink.  To tell an alcoholic that they’re not an alcoholic, especially during a time when their foundation is shaken, that could lead to relapse.  I’ve done enough research to know I cannot drink in safety.

>AA: You’re essentially agreeing with me, if you’re able to quit drinking on your own without some help from some fantastical sky daddy.  You ain’t got what I got.





So basically I feel pretty hopeless right now, like I don’t much belong anywhere.  I’m reaching out, trying to get a message of recovery from other alcoholics and I’m getting insults about my politics and views on human rights issues, and I’m told if I don’t believe in god then I’m not an alcoholic and can probably drink in safety.

Looking for some support.  Feeling extremely alone in this right now.",7

I wake up in hospitals, or detox, or jail or really anyplace you could imagine an alcoholic waking up. A few days ago I started drinking at about 7pm and the last thing I remember I was waiting for a bus. Next thing I remember it was 4am the next day, and I’m in detox in a hospital in downtown Minneapolis.

Now, on top of the embarrassment and the consequences of my behavior, I have intense anxiety over what I did that night and other nights like it. I keep convincing myself that I did something horrible. I’ve never been a violent person with or without alcohol, but I am able to convince myself that I could have possibly raped or murdered someone.

Obviously the only way to make sure this doesn’t happen again is to stop drinking altogether. Has anyone ever dealt with anything like this? How did you cope?",3

My menstrual cycle really messes with my depression and even worse anxiety.  I was sober for about seven weeks, my longest sober streak since 2013.  Over the last two weeks I've really been feeling the fatigue and rise in anxiety/depression from the time without my meds and my body trying to get back to normal after suddenly being able to get them all filled and back on my dosage schedule within 72 hours of one another.

I've had four job interviews over the last few weeks but didn't get any of the jobs.  I'm furloughed from my current job but the position theoretically still remains and I'm just waiting to go back.  Living alone, being off my meds, and being so far from my family really hit me hard.  I began drinking.  The most I ever had in a single day was about half of what I was drinking every day in December.  I had a few beers for a few days in a row (two or three beers) over about five hours and with food.  That went okay.  I decided to try my favorite wine again.  I had enough to start feeling drunk and it felt awful.  Like being weighed down physically and mentally with lead.  But I kept drinking hoping maybe it would get better.  That's the alcoholic in me, after all.

I recovered from that hangover but the depression and anxiety has lingered.  I had three beers yesterday and none today.  I noticed how the depressant effects of alcohol subtly accumulate and how messed up it makes my sleep--not to mention the other obvious physical and mental health affects.  That was an incredible reminder of how I need to be mindful of how feeling good or bad can lead to me going back to something that has no benefit for me whatsoever.  It's a waste of money, a waste of time, and a waste of my (then) dwindling sanity.  

It also makes me be much harder on myself, especially about things like the job interviews.  I *know* I did my best during those interviews, but given the current situation there has to be many people more qualified for the position who lost their jobs recently.  It just messed with me even more that I did a three hour working interview and spent over $30 on scrubs just for that interview but still didn't get the job.  :/

But, hey, this morning I was planning on hurting myself and drinking all day.  Two hours after almost going to the store for alcohol but turning around instead, I had thrown some stuff in the car with my service dog and I and we were at my parents' house.  I called them and told them what was up and they said to come over--""it's not like we're doing anything either.""  Such a better and more productive thing.  I'll be cooking for them and I always crack them up!  Plus they tell me they love me, how proud they are of how I've held up, and all of those other great things.  I almost gave up even more because I slipped up, but instead I ended up being honest about it and learning from it.  I hope this resonates with someone.

I'm a 19 year old guy who quit drinking on the 1st of Januari this year. I used to binge drink and black out completely, cause lots of fights and just feel miserable all the time. Alcohol made me feel nauseous and not happy in the slightest, even though it used to make me feel good.  I lurked on this subreddit, watched many YouTube videos and read Allen Carr's How To Stop Drinking book. The past 6 months were alright for me, I still went to friends, parties and other social gatherings. I also started to look for other interests and began working out a lot, started training Muay Thai and learning a language. However, 2 weeks ago I had a BBQ at my place and drank a few beers. Oddly enough I felt alright doing so. Fast forward 1 week and I drank another few beers with a friend and felt alright again.  Now I feel like I'm heading on a dangerous path, because who says the 3rd time will be just 3 beers and not binge drinking? The biggest reason I began again is feeling left out. I went to parties sober and to be honest, I dreaded being at the parties. People were obnoxious, puking, talking gibberish, et cetera. I like parties for meeting people, but being the only sober guy I just can't stop myself from being annoyed by the drunk people. I noticed I began to see certain friends less often. And I now realise that those friends are maybe not my true friends, but I hate the feeling of being left out. Now I'm in serious doubt whether I can pick up the sober life again. I hate how popular alcohol is in our society and especially in my age group, I can barely find any people who also want to stay sober. 

I have read posts like mine before on here and the general answer is that most people tell you to pick up a hobby, follow a sport or find new friends. It's damn hard getting into different social circles though when nearly everyone I meet drinks alcohol.  Can anyone share their story which I might relate to? Could use some mental support.

I bought a nose spray. This is what came with it. Warnings, dosages and potential side effects. Why do we not hold alcohol to the same standard? Are dosages and side effects from booze less important? Is my stupid nose spray that much more dangerous than alcohol that it comes with all these disclaimers?

If I buy pain killers, I am told to not consume it with alcohol. If it’s a dangerous combo, then why is alcohol not required to have that on the bottle too? Because it’s not sexy? Not convenient?

If I buy soda, I’m told the ingredients and nutritional content. Why we do not put nutrition labels on booze if we do it for all AF drinks? 

Ask an average person what is healthier a glass of booze or soda? You’d get some pretty mixed responses, because sugar! But booze often has a shit ton of sugar too, they just aren’t required to disclose it.

If I buy vapes, I get a bit fat ugly warning sign that nicotine is addictive. Why do I not get a bit fat ugly warning sign that alcohol is addictive? Last I checked, it’s alcohol that kills over 3’000’000 people a year not vaping.

If I buy a bottle of booze, I’m only told to drink responsibly. And what does that mean anyways?

I used to think that drinking a bottle of wine in an hour was responsible drinking.

I don’t think that changing the labels will solve everything. But I strongly believe we need better labelling. 

When everything else is regulated, not labeling booze sends us the message that it is less dangerous and less impactful on our health than all the other things that are heavily labelled.

But it’s not. Alcohol is responsible for 60’000 diagnosed cancers per year, 50% of fatal liver diseases, 5% of disease and injury and 25% of deaths of those between 20-39 are attributed to booze worldwide.

It’s not even about whether a person drinks or doesn’t. It’s about transparency so we can make more informed choices from the beginning.

If we put warning labels on vapes, cannabis and medication that is literally supposed to improve our health, we should also put it on a substance that kill far too many of us.",112

I really do feel like I'm a totally different person living a totally new life. After 30+ years of living a wild party fast life I decided this year it was time for a change. 

Last night I was sitting in my living room working late on my laptop. The evening breeze was perfect and rustling through the house smelling like flowers and cut grass. Some afro beat music was softly  echoing through the house from the kitchen where my new lady friend was cleaning up the mess I made from cooking dinner. We had just had a nice meal in the dining room with lots of candles and fresh flowers. Everything was so peaceful and calm. The house was spotless and filled with freshcut flowers and I was happy. Really happy. 

As I sat there working on my menu for the restaurant I'm about to open I got a message from an ex girlfriend who I broke up with maybe ten years ago. She had seen my social media stuff about the new restaurant and was messaging me to congratulate me and it got me thinking about all the women I've had been in serious relationships over the years and what went wrong in those relationships. 

Since you know what subreddit this is, you already know the root of the problem I had in all my failed relationships. All these years of being with women who loved me because I am talented, creative, passionate and I lost them all. I could never get myself really healthy even though I was very active. I could never keep a business going even though I'm full of great ideas. I could never see anything through and be successful even though I'm talented. 

My love of drinking and the party life kept me from being the man they all wanted me to be. 

The women I'm dating now only knows the new me. The healthy skinny me. The guy who lives in a clean beautiful house and eats well and drinks tea every night. Who works on crafts and projects and designs and builds things. Who can create and build a business from nothing to employ people and make customers happy. She is getting the version of me all the others wanted and never got because I was always drunk. 

To those of you who are just starting the journey I hope you find your way to your new life. If you are here it's because you are like me and cannot just have one drink with a meal. You might have lost everything you love. You might have lost everything over and over and over like me or you might just see the warning signs. To you I want to tell you that it gets better. Life without booze is incredible and will let you really be the person you want to be. Of course life will always be hard and fucked up things will happen but if you are sober you can face life knowing that you are in control of the things you can control and that makes you better prepared to deal with the things you cannot control. 

Thanks to everyone on this sub who has helped me get to where I am now. If you are one of my ex girlfriends, I'm sorry it took me thins long to get here.",14

Before this I was drinking regularly almost every evening and binge drinking about 2 days a week which progressively got to this point over around 8 years (hard for me to remember so long back). I have set goals to reduce my drinking plenty of times before but was never able to keep them.

I have done plenty of dumb things while drunk and finally reached a point where my wife (who has PTSD due to her late violently drunk father) was bringing up divorce due to my drinking and idiocy while drunk.    My wife was also drinking but has mostly given it up within the last couple of months and only consumes it occasionally with friends. Most of the dumb things I do involve putting myself at risk of harm and I do not get violent or angry while drinking. I started therapy a few weeks ago and it is going well. I feel like I have more support than I ever have before.

My plan at this point going forward:
1. No alcohol in the house except for special occasions (limit of 4 drinks)
2. Having drinks socially is okay (max 2 days of the week, limit of 4 drinks or less and only one if driving).
3. No liquor, only beer, wine etc.
4. Tell friends and family of my plan
5. If I have more than 4 drinks in a day I must abstain from drinking for another month and more seriously consider stopping all together.

Am I delusional thinking I can have healthy habits regarding alcohol? Is the only good plan to quit completely? I really want to believe I can enjoy responsibly and hope I can be strong enough to stick to a plan this time.",11

I'm starting to be able to see how useless drinking can be and for the first time ever and I'm beginning to feel  that alcohol doesn't enhance any situation.

To explain the title, I just don't understand why almost everything and almost everyone use it on the regular. It is such an ingrained habit in today's society that its so hard to do so many things with people without booze being involved. So many people need to celebrate the coming of the weekend by drowning themselves in booze and repetative conversation, and to top it off you are rewarded by feeling like shit the next day. It frustrating because I find I'm spending many of my weekend days alone because I'm opting out of drinking.

As a side note, I'm not passing judgement on others for doing what I used to do just venting a bit.

Thanks.",5
2020-06-26 13:35:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hgc2kn/tip_for_troubled_sleepers/,Tip for troubled sleepers,"I had a learning experience last night. 

It was not a deep sleep. (Although my worst sleep sober is better than my best sleep while drinking.) But, each time I wiggled a bit, the movement released a waft of the most wonderful smell from my hair. I snuggled my face into it and went back to sleep.

Earlier that day, I had just treated myself to a wash with some new shampoo where I got to pick my scent, and I had chosen eucalyptus. That particular smell immediately takes me back to my first visit to California, walks in the hills, sunshine, leaves rustling, ocean... all that is good. I noticed it calmed me and put me back into a pure sleep. Whatever was making me restless last night, the eucalyptus fought back and won! It had my back.

And, dare I say it was rather prompt. Us drinkers can be an impatient bunch and no amount of long-term good can replace that immediate kick-and-glow from the first sips of a drink; at first we really miss that, and struggle to adjust with patience. This is the closest I've come to a quick calm.

I found myself thinking of Annie Grace's book where she said that feelings come from the subconscious and we can't force the subconscious to feel differently, we can only hope to re-program it with time and mindful effort. Turns out we can tap into it for good stuff too. I did a quick search on the benefits of essential oils and found this...

""Inhaling the aromas from essential oils can stimulate areas of your limbic system, which is a part of your brain that plays a role in emotions, behaviors, sense of smell, and long-term memory.""

So, my tip is: think of smells that bring you joy and see if you can find it as an essential oil, hair product, lotion, etc. Make that joy-smell part of your nightly experience.

Hope it helps. Wishing you all well.",3

And how envious I felt towards those who could just have a normal weekend, drink, have fun, and not worry. Then I felt a real sad sense of missing out on life in general.

  
Now 3 hours later, after having done productive things, I am actually okay with using my weekends differently than most people. I am okay with being different.   


I have learned the past two years to not take my thoughts too seriously, and adopted a more ""non-reactive"" state where I try to distant myself from what I thinking, and looking closer into if my thoughts actually make sense. It has helped a lot, I hope it can help others too.

As I completed day 1 yesterday, I spent hours and hours reading and refreshing this page just to somewhat soothe the hungover anxiousness I was feeling. 

For context, I’m a 24F with a deep family history of alcoholism. My binge drinking days were heavy in college, which seemed to be the norm. It wasn’t until I reached grad school when I realized my drinking was truly problematic. It was no longer like my peers — I started to hide it, steal from roommates, go on day long benders drinking from the second I woke up until I passed out. 

I’ve done things I’m absolutely not proud of while drunk and no longer see myself as the “life of the party” I once believed alcohol made me to be. This has only been exacerbated by the “work from home” state COVID has put me in as well as the deep drinking culture that is engrained in the outdoor and mountain sports industry that I’m so passionate about — I swear PBR is the sponsor of young adult skiers everywhere.  

I’m understanding that I’ve never drank as a social endeavor like I thought, but I drink to get DRUNK. Truly, one is too many and 1000 is never enough. It’s the first time I’ve felt committed to sobriety and I appreciate all of your inspiring stories and words to feel affirmed in that. 

A side note: 
I told a close friend yesterday: “In 1.5 hours it will be another “day 1” of sobriety, which feels pathetic, but also good.” 

They responded: “And dude, one day it’ll be day 365 and we’ll celebrate and it’ll all be worth it. To get there a few day 1s are inevitable” 

For someone who doesn’t struggle with alcohol abuse, it was such a compassionate response and I feel so lucky to have them and this whole community in my corner.

Where to start? I lurk here a lot, especially in recent months. My story mirrors so many of yours--nothing too different, just the usual abusing alcohol to cope with day to day life.

I went through a divorce earlier this year and moved out the same week that most of the U.S. went into shutdown mode. I was thrown into depression like I didn't know was possible. I drank a lot to deal with it and because I was bored and because I have the problem of one is never enough 99.1% of the time I drink.

Last time I drank, I had again hit a new low. Each low has been lower than the last. I got an idea to grab a knife and start marking up my hands and arms. (I want everyone to know I have discussed this with my therapist. There was no need for medical attention, no bleeding out, no slit wrists, just surface wounds and light scarring--a lovely permanent reminder. I'm not downplaying what I did but am acknowledging it could have been considerably worse.)

That was 12 days ago. I haven't drank since. I don't know if/when I will again. I'm terrified of something like that happening again. So here I am, with a box of wine on the floor which is surprisingly not bothering me. I think I scared myself enough that I can continue to ignore it or eventually give it away.

I’ve been a long time lurker and have tried so many times to stop. 
My streaks usually last a few days to a week and I inevitably give in by somehow justifying the desire as some kind of reward to myself, or convince myself by saying things like “I should be able to be a NORMAL person and have a drink!”
I remember the longest break I took in recent years was a full month back in 2018 and remember how excited I was for the first drink. Like literally counting the minutes until I could get out of this sober prison. 
I can’t do it anymore. I just found myself at the end of a toxic relationship that did nothing but enable my problem, I’m doing great with my job, I’m looking forward to a new place to live, and want nothing more than to finally kick this monster that’s been growing inside of me for too long.

I fell off the wagon in quarantine and started drinking. In secret this time, because my partner thought I'd quit. Sneaking vodka in my La Croix cans and cups of iced tea was a new low. When he was here and I couldn't drink I would cry and be angry.

During this time though, I made forward progress because I'd practiced this before! I spoke to a doctor and got back on antidepressants, which helped hugely with my anxiety. I made the decision to move forward on some life stuff, which made me feel less trapped. And I woke up last week in my chubby, puffy body like: it's time to stop drinking. I want to feel good in my skin again.

I had stopped buying seltzer during quarantine (at first we couldn't get it, and then it seemed frivolous) and I went out and got three different types of Bubly. If it costs me $3.89 for an 8-pack of Bubly every day of my life, I am happy to pay the sobriety tax.

It's only been 4 days but my face already looks better. The puffiness goes out of my cheeks and my eyes look bigger. I feel like I look sort of squinty and mean when I'm drinking and my sober face is younger and kinder.

Every time I've quit I feel like peace has just been visited upon me -- like, I suddenly just KNEW I could -- and I know that's not super helpful. Keeping it up, on the other hand, is an active struggle. At least the skills I'm learning to stop drinking are just normal things I need to learn to be happy, like listening to my feelings, dealing with my problems, and investing in myself.

It's a weird feeling that I haven't had the urge to drink since.   I went to the grocery store yesterday and just ""meh'd"" at the beer/wine.  I haven't gone 24 hours without drinking in months, let alone 2+ days.   I've been the one nurses and pharmacists have been communicating with and maybe that's a sobering feeling?

I’m an alcoholic. 38 now, sober 22 months. I can have none of the drink.

I can have all of the ice cream. I can have all of the computer games. But I can’t have any of the alcohol.

My recovery was through a 12 step programme - AA. 

I’m not religious, I don’t believe in fairies and nobody should or hopefully will try to force that upon you if you are a non-believer.

What it really means is that I have a support group full of shared experiences.

What I learnt was I am full of fear. Fear of life, fear of death, fear of god, fear of people, fear of money. Fear, fear, fear.

And because of this fear, I try to control life.

And in reality, iam not in control of much in life as all. That is my insanity - built as a defence mechanism over 20 years.

I must realise and fully accept iam the surfer to life’s wave. I cannot make you like me. I cannot make her love me. I cannot. And that is a big part of my thinking problem.

I let go. I have faith in the universe these days. I control what I can. Iam part of aa. My homies.

I mostly can not control events. I can only control my reactions to events.

By living this way I remove the stress and fear and anxiety over time that made me drink to feel at ease.

Being honest with other alcoholics and working a 12 step programme is my path to contentment today.

I've been trying to stop both bad habits, but I'm struggling... I understand the nicotine being highly addictive but why can't I say no to a stupid piece of paper? I must just be a useless mess.

My first thought after that was ""but I've stopped drinking"". Although that doesn't mean I'm in the clear by any means, I've been pulling it off so far, and drinking hardly even comes to mind anymore. So I'm definitely doing at least one thing right.

After that came thoughts of how just earlier today my boss gave me praises for the work I've been doing, how she's going to talk to the higher ups to see about getting me a raise. Thoughts of how I have a savings account now instead of overdraft and payday loans. Thoughts of how my relationship has prospered over the past few months.

So I can do some things right. 

Stopping drinking opened the door to so much unseen potential. The twisted part is how while drinking I was oblivious to how terrible things really were. Now that things have gotten better I guess I look so sternly at my flaws that I feel like they define me. But hey, we're all only human.

So even if I feel like I'm falling, even if I feel like not drinking is my only flag, I'm still going to wave that flag proudly. Day by day I'm proving to myself, and the world, that a sober me is the best (human) me there is. One day at I time I'll continue to strive for my potential.

I chugged some Cisco--any other GenXers remember that shit? Fortified ""wine"" in a black bottle. Shudder. I clearly remember walking through the house after the booze hit me and thinking ""so this is what drunk is like... fun"". I threw up, obviously, and had my first hangover.   


Today I officially hit 30 days with no alcohol. I honestly don't think I've taken this long of a break before, except during a couple of three week ""cleanses"". I've been a heavy social drinker, and since the end of my marriage three years ago, a sad divorced drinker blotting out losses, childhood trauma, and the loss of a career I loved. 

I'm struggling with CPTSD, GAD, and depression--and I have been for years. I am just beginning to see how a clear mind is helping me embrace these issues and begin, just begin, to formulate other coping mechanisms. 

The biggest change is the improving connection to my two young daughters. I'm more patient, more dialed in, and see now how they bring my life joy and meaning, no matter how challenging they are being (both are forces of nature). 

Annie Grace's books, Cold Turkey by Mishka Shubaly, and this community have helped so much. Thank you to everyone who shares their journeys--you are all bad ass muthafuckers.

Over the last few years I've done a bunch of sober stints. 3 months here, 6 weeks there. I never fully committed to going sober though, until 4 weeks ago. 

I just decided enough was enough. I had a particularly bad argument with my wife and committed to going sober forever. 

It's been a great 4 weeks. Lifting heavy weights at night and going for runs by myself. It's been amazing. 

Tonight I was driving to the gym and a friend calls me. We had a chat about a few things but I noticed he was being argumentative and kept trying to take digs at me. I figured out he was drinking and he was extremely unpleasant to talk to. I ended up hanging up on him before I went into the gym to lift. The contrast of our evenings was stark. Me lifting weights and listing to personal development podcasts, while he was likely drinking alone and calling people up to verbally abuse! Wtf. No thanks. 

It's been 4 weeks since the arguement with my wife and I actually videoed a few minutes of our arguement (for some fucked up drunk reason). I knew the video was there but I didn't want to watch it. Well, after lifting, I decided it was time. It was 5 mins long but I couldn't get to the end. 

I was being a complete, drunken, asshole. I was arguing with her, trying to verbally trap her, and if I'm honest, it was probably emotional abuse. It was disgusting. 
When I got home I apologised to my wife once again, for my despicable behaviour that night and when drinking in general. She is an angel and she told me she loves me and forgives me. She's happy that I'm getting sober. 

In fact, the last 4 weeks we have connected so beautifully. Emotionally, intimately and as a family in general. 

The decision to be sober forever is so freeing. Moderation was exhausting. This is paradise. 

Part of me wishes I did this a decade ago when I was in my 20s. But, without the struggle there can be no hero's journey. 

I'm thankful for the gift of alcoholism and I'm going to use it as fuel to transform myself. 

Keep it up my friends! IWNDWYT",1031

I didn't quit that day, and to be honest, I never wanted to think about that day.

I had, what I hope to be, my last drink on February 22nd. The longest I have gone in the last 16 years without alcohol. **This is one thing I just wanted to share:**

All that bullshit they talk about during treatment and meetings how ""great things"" seemed to find these people who curbed their addiction, well, for me, ended up not being bullshit. The universe didn't knock on my door and start handing me stuff, it just really started working with me.

Things I would have seen in the past as problematic or stressful are definitely still there. I found my sobriety during the start of COVID, unemployed due to the pandemic, and a suspended license due to a DUI from the prior year. Instead of seeing it as a negative, I have seen it as: I was able to obtain unemployment while getting back into my field of work, I didn't have to worry about not being able to go anywhere, as everything was closed. A huge plus: The bars were closed, taking another temptation away. Did my sobriety change any of these things? No, but it sure did allow me to see things in a much better light and attitude.

When you stop drinking, a lot of other great things happen than just being feeling better. The universe just seems to start working with you in your head, instead of against you.",20

Usually drinking and going out socializing with new people would be my method of forgetting to be sad and remembering there are plenty of other people in the world who enjoy my company, but with no alcohol and with the world being what it is right now, I can’t. I don’t really talk to my ex-girlfriend anymore, so it’s really hard not having that constant person to send all my dumb thoughts to and joke with. She was my best friend and she couldn’t care less about me now. It’s for the best and I understand we weren’t right for each other, but it’s still an adjustment to not have that person to talk to anymore. My other best friends are busy with new relationships or just personal stuff. There aren’t a whole lot of other gay women in this part of California for some reason so I feel like I’ll never have someone to text about the stupid name an acquaintance gave her baby and dumb shit like that.

Was in tears literally asking god to please help me stop.   5 months doesn’t seem too long but my life has changed drastically since then.  My panic attacks and moods are much more under control now.  I’ve lost 30 lbs.  Sleeping great.  The last time i went to the Dr to see how I was doing 30 days into my sobriety my blood pressure was a bit on the high side 140/90, so I have cut back on sodium and feeling a little better.  I used to get really bad headaches after I quit and would feel my heard pounding like a drum so i figured they were blood pressure headaches.  Those have also disappeared recently.  It’s crazy how the body reacts when you quit.  Hoping by month 6 I feel even better than i’ve been feeling the last few weeks.   Thought i was going to die the first 3 months.

I checked into my hotel and got to my room to discover that it didn’t have a bath tub, only a shower. I had requested a room with a tub as I really wanted to treat myself - brought some bath bombs from Lush - and was looking forward to soaking and relaxing.

I called down to the front desk to see what they could do, and after some waiting on hold, they came back to say they were sorry but they didn’t have any rooms similar to mine (king-sized bed in a mini suite). I was bummed, but whatever, it’s not the end of the world. The young man at the front desk was so apologetic, he kept saying he took “full responsibility” for not meeting my request, and was going on and on, when I was just like “It is what it is, man.” I was totally polite, not rude or mad at all. After a while of him apologizing I started thinking “Hm, maybe he’ll offer me a discount or something?”

What does he offer me? A free bottle of wine! I almost laughed out loud on the phone, but hey, a free bottle of wine is a free bottle of wine! So I went down and selected a Chardonnay, and he came back with a chilled bottle and two glasses. He was very sweet. 

I’m laughing to myself as I bring the bottle and glasses up to my room. This was already gonna be a test ... could I go on vacation and not drink? I didn’t bring any booze with me (just fizzy waters!) but then this happened! 

So then the brain starts rationalizing: “You’ve made it almost 30 days. You could celebrate. You’re on vacation, you’re allowed to relax and have fun.” You know that inner voice.

I put the wine in the mini fridge, went for a drive and brought some food back to my room. I had a fizzy water with dinner, and started reading, ending up in this subreddit. And ya know what I realized? I never cracked the wine. 

I’m proud of myself for not giving in to that little voice that was saying “It’s a sign! You’re meant to drink tonight!”

It’s still in the fridge so I might have some while I’m here over the weekend. Or, I might not? Who knows? But TODAY ... I did not drink ... again. Yay me.

I had the perfect storm of factors (genetic predisposition, mental illness, PTSD) which led me to the bottle. It feels really heavy to say, but I know that I have to be honest with myself in order to focus on getting better. The longest I’ve been sober was for about month a couple of years ago, but I fell right back into it with the whole, “I’ll only get drunk this one night”, lie we all tell ourselves. I’ve wanted to get clean before, but always for other people. Now I really want it for myself, which is why I think I feel so different about it this go around.

Which brings me to why I’m here:
1.) I’ve got no one in my life I currently feel ready to share this with, so strangers on the internet seem like the perfect audience. 
2.) Do y’all have any advice (if you would be so kind to a random idiot that you don’t know) on what to do to make this adjustment easier? It really feels like a death almost. Like you’re saying goodbye to a friend. Does that make sense? I don’t know. 

I’ve been tempted once so far, but I just played my guitar to occupy myself. I know there won’t always be a guitar though. I can’t go to an AA meeting right now because of the world being on fire, but if things ever go back to some semblance of normalcy, I’d like to try it. Which brings me to another concern that probably only I worry about. I’ve been in group therapy before and it always feels so shitty to compare your trauma with someone else, but you kinda can’t help it? I know myself and I know if I’m in a group with someone who’s been drinking a bottle of scotch every day for 50 years or something and I’m, for all intents and purposes, a newbie, I worry I’ll feel kinda dumb?

I started wanting to learn about Sobriety when my sister died of an overdose 3 yrs ago and a few months later I woke up for the 5th and final time in an ER and was later transfered to detox. I'm getting better and better at Sobriety everyday and now I'll get better and better every year. 
I want to tell the truth though. This year hasn't looked like what I expected. I've been comparing myself to everyone I see in Sobriety who, within their first year of not drinking, got a great job, got married, lost weight, they're happy beyond their wildest dreams. For me it's been a constant struggle filled with many challenges. I lost my job in education due to COVID and Gov't cutbacks, I can't go to my regular gym classes that were hugely boosting my confidence and dating is like ☠️. I feel sluggish and depressed some days and ugly cry anytime I'm alone. This is not the sobriety I was promised. 
The voice in my head is always trying to get me to drink. And it makes a good case: I was fit, I was employed, I was traveling, I had a wide social circle. ""Wasn't life better?"" it says to me. But that is the lie that alcohol sold me. When I was drinking I couldn't trust anybody around me, I couldn't see the toxic people for who they were, I didn't know about boundaries, know my worth nor how to FEEL anything. My connection to the world around me was non existent. I felt non existent. 
My Sobriety didn't come gift wrapped. But when I sit in it and think about it - I've done what I once thought was impossible, I live in authentic connection. I feel my feelings for real and that is wild. I have people in my life who cheer for me and who love me which is equally wild! I'm learning how to be loved. I'm learning about who I am and that healing can hurt just as much as the traumas I've survived. In my next year of Sobriety I'm coming for everything that alcohol took from me because I'm proof that you can't keep a good heart down.",121

This is not what I expected for my one year anniversary. I thought I would be over the moon proud of myself and fired up to keep this going, but instead I feel like I'm just waiting for the ball to drop and for me to finally give in and drink. And honestly if I didn't have a partner that does an amazing job at firmly reminding me that that's not an option for me, then I would have drank by now. He was going to be going out town in 2 weeks for a couple days, but Covid ruined those plans, and there's that little tiny part of myself that's both relieved and yet also disappointed because I'm fairly certain I would have drank while he was gone.

Maybe I put too much pressure on myself for this anniversary to be something special, and now it's here and I happen to be in a low place and it makes me feel like a failure for not feeling joy and happiness on what is supposed to be a happy occasion.

I also can't stop fucking dreaming about alcohol. Almost every night for at least the last two weeks I've had some sort of situation in my dreams where I have to say no, and I struggle with it.

I wish I had someone to talk to. I wish I could work up the courage to attend AA, and start making some friends who understand this.

Fuck, I thought I had already released this part of myself, but I guess I haven't. Do you ever get over your former alcoholic self? I'm starting to think not.

If I couldn’t stay sober till July, then I proved to myself that I had to go to rehab.

But UGH! I was up to a fifth of gin a night. A couple of beers really pales in comparison to that, right? And I have that annoying little voice in the back (or very very FRONT) of my mind saying, “Come on, you can just have a couple. It’s been 3 days! It’s all out of your system. You’ll be fine.”

But then I'll  start smoking usually and then start drinking again. I've almost joined the army twice now and barely managing to finish technical school. Each time I find myself drunk on a perfect afternoon re-evaluating if I'm on the right path. I think I need to go back on medication for adhd, it's not just alcohol and binging, I like to steadily consume 24/7 now and the few months of sobriety I force myself into is overwhelming and I can't calm tf down lol.

Whenever I crack open a beer or a bottle of bourbon I just drink it until it's gone. Most of the time I'm not socialising.

He met me in, what has been, the peak of my drinking career. Had just gotten my first job out of college and moved out on my own, obvious recipe for disaster. I’ve been in treatment 3 times already and none of it stuck because I didn’t follow through on aftercare and also didn’t care. Anyways, knew I shouldn’t be dating, did it regardless. We met on an app and I wasn’t expecting to meet anyone that would amount to more than a couple of dates so maybe my drinking wouldn’t matter right?

But we clicked in every way, and, better yet, he doesn’t and can’t drink. So we kept seeing each other. And I kept drinking because I couldn’t stop and wasn’t ready to. It didn’t take long for him to notice, I’m a daily blackout drunk when I drink. He didn’t realize the severity at first. But after meeting drunk me too many times, having too many fights with her, finding her passed out having pissed the couch, he knew it was bad. 

Things started snowballing quickly after only about a month or so but we kept dating, and he thought he could help control my drinking. For probably the last four or so months, we were glorified friends. We were living together during quarantine, but we weren’t intimate for months and when I told him I loved him he wasn’t able to return the sentiment. He hadn’t experienced alcoholism before and while he cared deeply about me, he wasn’t able to return romantic feelings while I was in that state.

I moved about a month ago for work, only an hour away but neither of us have cars. “We” decided this would be a natural ending point for the relationship. It would be tough to see each other often and he wants to focus on his career. Both of which are true, but really, I hurt him and the relationship beyond repair by my drunken behaviors and everything that comes from active alcoholism, like avoiding every responsibility ever. 

He wanted to stay friends, and really meant it, because since then we’ve kept in touch. He visited me last weekend and I just got back from his place. Specifically, he let me stay with him for a couple of days because I’m trying to stay sober and am having a tough time in my new place. I know how much he cares.

But now I am in So. Much. Pain. I got off the train a couple of hours ago and all I’ve been able to do is lay here and cry. He was amazing, we got along perfectly in every way. Except for my drinking. And that’s what I’m so hung up on. I can’t stop hating myself and regretting the fact that I was the one to ruin things. Especially after seeing him and having such a great time.

He says that I have a lot of things I need to work on, and that’s certainly true. I’m only four days sober (yay!) and recognize that. But holy crap I miss him and I can’t get past the feeling of “how am I supposed to work on myself when I can’t have the one thing that was bringing me true happiness.” I know that break-ups are always hard, especially when it isn’t your choice. But the fact that my alcoholism, me, something seemingly avoidable (but you all know it isn’t that simple) led to our demise.

I don’t want to hate myself anymore over this, and I don’t want to drink over this, but I’ve never known how to cope any other way. 

I’m doing AA and really getting a lot out of it, so I’m not so much looking for advice on how to get sober but looking for support on getting past this kind of situation, and I guess hard emotions during early sobriety in general.

Please help me not drink today. I don’t want to. Right now I’m taking it one second at a time.

tldr: ex broke up with me because of my drinking. We’ve stayed friends and it fucking hurts. Don’t want to drink over these feelings.",4

The good, the bad, and the ugly.","Well, I am almost done with week 3 of no drinking. The first week was definitely challenging, but it has gotten a little easier every day, and I can really notice some changes already happening. I doubt this is different from anyone else's observations of themselves, but I still wanted to jot them down.

Pros: - I feel it is still early to see any major improvements, but to date I am definitely feeling better. When I first quit, I also started drinking a shit ton of water every day, and I feel like that has definitely helped my body start healing. My organs (mainly pancreas) have stopped throbbing and hurting for the most part, although little pains do come back here and there. I'm sleeping a lot better, mostly. I'm not sure if it's because of the water or what, but while quitting this time around, I didn't have much in the way of nightmares or those weird dreams we have while quitting, which is nice. I've also noticed that my skin is not as swollen and is looking better day by day. Also, although this kinda thing doesn't happen in 3 weeks, I got on the scale today and saw about 15 pounds lost since I last weighed myself (I was somewhere around 280, now I'm a hair under 265). Not saying that was all from quitting drinking, but I'm sure it definitely helps! As for my mental state, I can definitely see a difference as well. Although I still have chronic depression, anxiety, e.t.c., and some days are better than others, I can still tell a difference. I find myself being more or less content most of the time. Not super happy or anything, but not extremely low, either. I also have a decent bit of energy, and I'm not sweating quite so much as I did before.

Cons: - Most of the cons are really just related to not being drunk. There's boredom, restlessness, and really just figuring out what to do with myself when I would otherwise be drunk and passed out on the floor. When I get emotional, it is pretty challenging to deal with my emotions than just shut my brain off with alcohol and be happier. But beyond what I suppose could be considered the ""normal"" difficulties we all experience while becoming sober, I cant really say there's a whole lot of cons involved with quitting.

I'm still just taking one day at a time. Drinking my water, trying to keep my mind occupied, all that good stuff. Of course, its summer time, so a lot of my temptations come from wanting an ice cold beer when it's 105° out lol, but other than that, id say I'm doing okay.",10

I don't know if it's because I'm not in the office, where I need to be sober, as much, or if it's because being near my parents stirs up a lot of resentment in me. But that's gone. My desire to not drink was capable of withstanding really bad pressure, but now I'm talking to a therapist and making good money and trying not to dwell on the bad news and be grateful for the good, I'm having intrusive drinking thoughts. Planning drunks, thinking about cocktails, flying into resentful thoughts when I stop myself. It's just different. I don't want to reset my sobriety date, but my desire to keep clean is about as strong as my desire to win no but November: give it sufficient temptation and I know I'll cave. Aside from subjecting myself to intense stress, or moving out (which is the plan but not really feasible now) anyone have any advice on how to overcome the ""not quite three week slump?""",3

First we lost my grandma and the night I drank to celebrate/mourn her was the last night. I woke up the next day feeling terrible but just ready to be done. That following week I was let go from my perfect job. It was expected but really made me quite sad and lost.  
Then we came to this week. I was supposed to leave on Monday for my Grandma’s so I could help family, properly mourn her since we were not at the funeral and overall not be in terrible heat. Well I’m in TX and due to opening too soon NY has rightfully put a two week quarantine on anyone traveling from  TX and FL(where the rest of my family is who was also traveling). That broke me and all i wanted was a big glass of wine to drown my sorrows but I didn’t do it. I was even at the grocery store when I got the news and could’ve easily snuck a canned wine but I didn’t. 

I didn’t wake up hungover or groggy today and my head is clear. I’m still extremely sad and angry a very important trip for me can’t happen. But I know it’s ok, because these times are unprecedented and being handles not so great where I live.

Except this time I didn't cave and buy any, instead got flavoured sparkling water. I have come to realise that yes it is a big deal as I am justifying drinking in my head to myself, and have given myself a headache arguing with myself. 

I know it's one day at a time, one shopping trip at a time but today really clarifies to me that I am controlled by alcohol. That I have to change my relationship with alcohol and be a better person.

I went and sat down, and was asked what I wanted. I got a double gin and soda... and that was when the worst night of my life had begun. 

I have been drinking heavily (off and on) since I was 18, and I used it to cope with some highly significant traumas I had repressed down. I used it to numb myself. Felt like it was needed in order to feel normal. 


I had a few more and walked home, and when I arrived there, my partner (who by the way, is a saint and we’ve been strong for over a year and a half) was sitting there and had a huge smile on their face. I had asked if they wanted to go to the park and have a couple and play some guitar to practice. So we did, I ended up having a glass of wine while I waited for them to come with me. We got to the park, we were there for a while and it was beautiful... and suddenly it shifted. 

I didn’t realize why, but it made me an angry /mean person. Not until we started arguing, and I said some things and he had some words that he exchanged in return. It resulted in us causing a scene and the worse part was, is that he remembered everything and I barely remembered it at all. Eventually we wounded up back at home, and he told me that I basically became my father (who used alcohol to cope with literally everything since I can remember) and I left to sleep elsewhere for the night. I don’t want to get into details, but I am so embarrassed with my actions and what resulted that night. 

The next morning, I went back because I had to gather my things for work. And he sat me down and told me that I needed to get help. What he said next made me come to a complete halt, and felt like time itself had stopped completely. And that’s when I knew it was the time to make a huge life altering change. 

“I don’t want to break up with you. I want to break up with drunk you. I love you more than anything, but you aren’t you when you’re like that. And that’s not who I fell in love with.”


And I decided then and there, that I needed to get myself back on track. 

I’m 26, and I feel like it’s possible to get better. I’m just scared, nervous, but most of all... excited. 


Sorry if this doesn’t fit the posts / threads, I just don’t have a lot of people to talk to about this (without judgement anyway, a lot of people around me where I’m from are highly judgmental) 


I hope you’re having a good day.

They’re harmless I know! But the shock of finding them and having to scoot them out the door was exhausting and well if that didn’t justify a glass a wine, I don’t know what does! So naturally I had three glasses instead of one. And I was so excited to be in the teens the next day. 

I had even just bragged about this board to a friend of mine who is also on his journey and was so damn proud of myself and was finally beginning to feel slightly unloserish. Every step I took I wondered if people could see the shine that I felt inside...

He had so much control over me...until about a year ago.  I stopped acting the way he wanted and the fights got worse and worse.  He knew I would get stronger and voice my opinion more after a couple of glasses of wine each night so he demanded I go to AA.  I did.  He then got jealous of AA and told me that we were all a bunch of ""pathetic alcoholics"" and from there... I thought what's the flipping point.

Even when I wasn't drinking he didn't seem to be better.  So, short story -- I threw him out last Friday.   I drank to get the courage and then the next morning I regretted it.  Immediately I regretted it -- he was headed to the car and I was calling and texting -- begging him to come back.  He wouldn't.  

It's been this way for over a week.  He's told me countless times he's not coming back and that he's done.  And i can't stop drinking.

I'm SO sad.  It's like a death for sure -- he's just gone.  He was my ENTIRE focus (even if it was negative) because he had made himself the prime focus in life.  And now I just don't even know what to do with myself.

COVID is bad in my state and there's no going out to restaurants etc and meeting people. And even IF there was.. I would be drinking.  So, I have been working from home -- trapped inside all day and drinking wine.  I started at 11am yesterday.  Bottle and a half of wine.... some days it's 2. 

I reached out to my sponsor again last night and told her I need to do the step work again.  I don't know what else it's going to take.  Every day I wake up and say I won't drink and then I do.... 

I'm not sure AA is for me -- but I want to try to use this sub to get me through the day.   Any tips would be appreciated.  I will not drink with you today.  Thanks.",5

I know my life is significantly better without alcohol. I don’t feel guilt and shame like I used to. I’m doing well in my career (albeit a high-stress career where you feel like you are never done), I’ve lost 20 lbs, and I’m in a healthy relationship. Many of these things seemed out of reach and unmanageable with alcohol. They have felt manageable and achievable sober. Now I think anxiety/depression might be telling me they are unmanageable, and that drinking is the answer. I know it’s not! IWNDWYT",7

They changed up my position some and it feels like a demotion. At the same time they've made my life super difficult as of late. Thing is, the root of why this happened is probably the drinking, and for some reason I took to drinking to solve it. 

I feel like trash not just physically, but mentally. My spirits are crushed to be honest. I was really proud of my position at work, and when they explained the new one they made it seem like a promotion. Then we got on a meeting to start the training, and the more they talked about it the more I realized what was going on. It just slowly killed me. 

Anyways I still have to finish my work for the rest of the week for my old position while training for the new one, which starts next week. I guess that gives me time to sober up and get prepared for that.",3

I had a great marriage, my daughter was a healthy 1 1/2 yrs old, a wonderful job with great benefits. Didnt matter, i came so close to throwing it all away. Why? Well i had a complete obsession in my mind. Alcohol was the thing that completely took over, it gave me comfort, it helped me relax/de-stress after a long day, it was my reward, my entitlement for doing things that every day people do. It was also destroying everything around me slowly, it also put blinders on so i was unable to see the damage it was causing. I see now where that was heading. It took a while, but when the light bulb went off it was amazing. It was time. I had my ""fun"". I was lucky I didnt have to lose everything or everyone, I could have/ probably should have but i didnt.

I guess my point is its never to late to pick yourself up, dust your self off, and wake up your soul! You are worth it! Even if you cant see it right now, you will and so will the people that you love. Take care of yourself! One day at a time, one minute at a time and everything will fall in to place. I promise you!

I had been hungover as hell after an extended weekend bender, picked up a pint on my way to work so that I could make it through the day with no puking, then at 9am realized I'd finished the whole thing before anyone else had even showed up. Man, talk about rock bottom. I immediately felt such an overwhelming sense of shame, enough to make me have a little cry at my desk, before calling my boss and telling her I had a major problem and didn't know what to do.


In the past 6 years you could probably count the number of nights that I went to bed sober on both hands. Not always this bad- sometimes just two or three beers before bed. It's been progressively getting worse and worse to where I'd not be surprised on some mornings to find I'd killed a fifth alone. No bueno. Before, I'd told myself that I could just taper down and get to a ""normal"" level of drinking but it's now painfully obvious that this will just never be the case.


Luckily, I have an amazing boss who cares about me as a person. She said in no uncertain terms that she's always been pleased with my work, then directed me to some resources available through our company, and then told me to go take care of myself without any fear of losing my job.


Now I'm sitting back at my parent house staying here for a bit so they can keep me honest.. shaking, sweating, and dry heaving. Even with all that, I have a sense of hope now. I'm excited to not wake up feeling like death warmed over every day, and excited for my life to be more than just the few hour window that I'm obligated to remain sober. Hurts like all hell right now, but I know it'll be worth it and just hope I have the strength to keep it up.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This week has loosely been about appreciation. Appreciating the small things, mindfulness, not comparing with others, and having someone who understands - and today, the benefits of routine and rules.

I kept slipping because different situations and moods caught me off guard. I had to make new habits and patterns, simple do´s and dont´s to keep me safe; preparations, diversions, don´t play with fire kind of things. Some things were easier to give up than others, but the effect is indisputable. My evil twin still stirs in his sleep at certain occasions, but he rarely wakes up.

There´s no smooth transition here, but I want to mention the [Community Guidelines and FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index) of this sub. They´re all tried and tested to keep this sub positive, healthy and open, a safe place for newbies to drift ashore without prejudice, for oldtimers to share their valuable experience, and for us inbetweeners to continue exploring sobriety and ourselves.

So here´s **a big heartfelt thank you** to each and every one of you that makes this sub such a gem with your positivity, honesty and generosity. Do you give yourself the same love? Please do, you´re worth it.

I will not drink with you today!",85

For those of us that have repeatedly posted - ""day 1, feeling strong IWNDWYT"" , yet failed to make it past the day- we gain strength from you all and even ourselves. We realize it's a struggle. It's a struggle for me everyday. Each day I'll awake and tell myself, today is my day. I won't drink today. Yet  my  attitude slowly begins to change as the morning passes to afternoon. By the time I'm ready to leave work, my first thought is to drop by the store and buy a drink or three.  
It's hard to overcome the urge to drink. Even when I feel strong and no impulse to drink I'll find myself stopping by the store to buy something.  It's easy and convenient to drink. There are no obstacles to prevent you from drinking. The only times I felt in control was when I was in Afghanistan or Iraq. I rarely drank, maybe twice in 7 tours.  
I'd really be interested in learning from folks who has succeeded in overcoming their urges - how they did it. How did you overcome the first day, the second.......and all the others days that lead you to achieving a week, month and years.  Was it self determination, AA, group meetings the VA...what? 
To me those are the stories that interest me the most. The stories of your pain and sleepless nights struggling to succeed will help many of us here to fight our demons. Your stories will give us the strength we need to get through day 1 and those days that follow. Thankful for this group. Respect",11

I don’t know the exact date I quit though, but at one point I was just fed up with it and figured it’s best to stop. So that’s what I did. The first few weeks were.. strange. Especially the weekends, where it’s become so normal to have a drink with friends. Like many of you guys I live in a culture where not drinking is not normal — unfortunately. In the beginning some friends would ask why I didn’t drink. I would explain. Next time they’d ask me again. I would explain again. But now everyone knows I’m “the guy who doesn’t drink” and I somehow think they respect me for it. 

This has easily been one of the best decisions I’ve ever made in my life. I feel much more healthier. All the time! I work fulltime and my job can be pretty demanding. I don’t want to feel like shit in the weekends, only to wake up feeling like shit still on a Monday morning but then having to go to work. Also the hanxiety you so often get is no joke. I hated it. And I know I’m not the only one, which makes me hate the fact that drinking is so normal even more. I’m hoping more people will realize they’re better off without alcohol.

I've been through a lot in these past 46 days.. dealing with a heartbreak , getting my $500 bike stolen (the same day I bought it), buying a gym membership then having the gym shut down the following week , having a close friend then start seeing my ex (I've cut out that whole group of people..never speaking to them again) , quitting my toxic work environment , starting two new part time jobs which are far better (people actually working , no toxicity , positive people) , getting my written test completed for my driver's licence (now waiting for roadtest but covid is delaying that) , improved relationships with the remaining friends i have chose to be in my life and family members. Improving my diet (low sugar, carbs , high protein) , working out at the gym 4-5 times a week. Meditating and reading daily. Overall it's been a wild ride for me and I'm so angry at the moment with the whole backstabbing issue by my lifelong friend and being betrayed by someone I loved. I know in the future things will look up and I want to keep a documentation of my journey here.

**Goals for the end of the year :**

* Save $5000
* Pass my Road Test
* Purchase a Vehicle
* Connect and find new positive , uplifting friends
* Remove my gut and moobs
* Quit Smoking Cigarettes
* Read 20 Books
* Try to implement semen retention and focus on my purpose rather than chasing women and having romantic relationships.

For the year of 2021 I have aspirations of returning back to school to take my pre requisites for a two year associates degree at my community college and starting a job with my city for the following summer. After this year I will upgrade my new goals and post updates on how my progress is doing. I am so motivated to get things going for myself in my life and I'm not letting the alcohol or drugs bring me down anymore. Good luck to anyone who is struggling out there and trying to become the best version of themselves.. I respect that so much!! We are all worth it and we deserve to love ourselves.. IWNDWYT!",7

Home now, put my freaked out daughter and her friend to bed and realizing that I don't use alcohol to help me with stress. Not even for something like this day.  Not at all.  I still think of it as poison and I know that it would only make me feel worse; it would make me feel ill and out of it, neither of which are what I want right now at all.  In fact, I'm sitting here reflecting on the amazing day I had,  paddle boarded with my youngest daughter, exercised hard, handled all sorts of things big and small in the best way I can and truly liked myself all day.

Just wanted to know if anyone has advice on how to stop drinking. I know I have a issue-a big one. I've tried to stop on my own. I've tried to go to AA. I've just really struggled because I can't stick to it and stay stopped. I'm beginning to lose hope. I've done a lot of stupid crap while drinking and know it's the cause, but because I can hide it to some extent, no one knows about it.

Part of me wants to see if a rehab would help, but I don't want to ruin my relationships. My family is not aware of my drinking because I live so far away. But such a long period with no contact from my personal number would worry them. I've also heard it's just AA on steroids, and I feel I have access to that already.

Sorry if this is a crappy post, I guess I'm just wondering if there's any hope for someone like to to actually stop, or if I'm doomed (like I feel I am).",14

I'm now legal age, and now so are pretty much all of my friends. We've been drinking since high school like most do, but now we can go to bars. I know corona is a whole discussion, but that's not what this post is about. Right now where I am, bars with outdoor areas are open, and most people aren't distancing or anything. It's summer and my friends want to have some good times. 

My history with drinking is definitely different than most who are here. I've never had an issue with drinking in terms of an addiction or anything. I'm not an addictive person. My issue with drinking is with my health. I have acid reflux or GERD. I've had it for several years, but it's gotten worse these past couple. I've had to change what I eat and such, but nothing major. It's not nearly as bad as some people have it. If I'm irresponsible and have some flamin hot cheetos and a cup of coffee, then I'll have it bad. Nothing however aggravates my acid reflux quite like alcohol. 

In high school I didn't really drink much. I'm not someone who loves to get out of control, so I never really got blackout or anything like a lot of my friends would. It was in college though that I started having issues with drinking. A morning after playing cheers to the Governor with heavy puking seemed like just a bad hangover, but after a few instances of drinking, it got to the point where my week would be ruined cause I went out the Saturday before. I remember one particularly bad time that made me decide to just stop. I had a little bit of an issue in college though. Drinking is so ingrained in our culture, and especially at this age, that it's hard to not do. Some of my friends were really chill and were fine with me choosing not to drink, but others were not so cool. If everyone was playing a drinking game, of course I would join in, but I couldn't not drink alcohol, otherwise it was ""lame"". 

It's just hard to socialize when a lot of what people my age do for socializing is drinking. Now that I'm back where I grew up, and everyone can go to bars, that is what they want to do every night. Beers are what they do. I'm sure some would not care, but others would try to pressure me, and would think I'm a pussy and that I probably just can't take a hangover. I also just feel awkward being the only one not drinking while everyone else is getting fucked up. Definitely not the most fun thing. 

Sorry if this is just an off topic rant, and I know I'm not dealing with the same issue as most of you, but I needed to get this off my chest.",3

I want to preface this by saying that I never drink with the intention to get drunk, I actually really don't like the feeling. I also have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety since I was 13 years old (I'm 33 now). When I drink, it's to help me fall asleep and to not ""feel"" as anxious, but in return it makes me more anxious and makes life more challenging. I hate the effect binge drinking has had on my life, and I know I need healthier ways to cope. I'm just at a loss for where to begin. To put it perspective, 2 bottles of wine a night is typical for me, and it has minimal effect outside of making me sleepy. Gross. 

When you approached a change, where did you even begin? Real life helpful tips and anecdotes are hoped for. My sleep has been awful, but I don't know how to actually fall asleep the first night without alcohol. I realize that sounds silly, but it's really hard and so much for me to emotionally navigate.

120 days with no alcohol, no soda, no fast food. All I drink is coconut water, la croix, protein shakes, kombucha, and unsweetened tea. I have a smoothie for breakfast, a salad for lunch, and a reasonable dinner. Any sweets are fruits, or low cal low sugar ice cream like skinny cow or halo top. 

23 days no cigarettes. Man that was a hard one. I planned on giving up cigs with alcohol but that was just too many stressors so June 1st was my quitting date. I use a vape occasionally for nicotine but I see that as a much less harmful option. 

28 lbs lost. I’ve probably lost more fat than that but I went back to the gym June 3rd and have definitely put on some muscle. 5 days a week 1.5 hours. 

Saved 864$. I set a goal of 1000$ saved for a vacation since I haven’t had one in 8 years. I’m only 136$ away from that goal. 

Sleep is soooo much better. I swore I could never sleep if I wasn’t intoxicated. But I would wake 5-6 times a night and never feel rested. Always dragging my ass to work around 10:30 exhausted. Now I’m up and ready after 8 solid hours of uninterrupted sleep and at work by 8. 

My wife freaking loves me so much more. We always had a pretty good relationship. I was never abusive and stayed pretty functional but I was always intoxicated and forgetful, and stank, and didn’t want to do anything but drink and watch tv. Now our relationship is thriving and I feel more like a partner instead of a waste of space. She has been a great support. She is 16 months sober herself. 

All in all there have really been no negatives other than the horrible guilt and mental anxiety when I think about all the time and experiences lost, and regret about bad behavior but I am doing my best to make amends and present myself as a changed person. 

Whether you are 1 day sober or 1000 days I hope you all are seeing the positivity of your choices and stay motivated to better your life. It is so worth it. I know it’s hard. You may think well maybe he wasn’t that bad off...maybe it’s just easier for him. It wasn’t and it’s not. I was drinking approx 2700 calories of whiskey and beer on a work night weekday and about 3500 or more on weekends. Pints and 5ths were nothing. It was all about the gallons and tall cans.

I haven't wanted to drink. 

I've haven't focused on my sobriety in a while because at some point not drinking just became my normal life. But I saw a post by Post Secret today that said ""the local library played a CRUCIAL role in my recovery from severe depression""... I shared it. I included a little blurb about how important the library was during my first dry year. I shared this [list of books](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/books) that I worked from. And I shared a link to this sub. 

Then I started thinking about that ""severe depression"" that I was able to claw out of. With the help of this sub and the library. Today I remembered to focus on my freedom from alcohol. Because with all of this hate and doom in the world at least I am free from the bottle. And that is something that makes me feel good... and lifts some of the weight of the world.

2020-06-24 17:57:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hfaewk/one_year/,One Year.,"Two days ago was officially a year sober for me, and as is customary, I figured I ought to reflect on it. From when I first left the house for college at eighteen to twenty-eight I've been drunk practically six days a week every week, functioning at the bare minimum and coasting through some pretty extraordinary life experiences with only one foot in reality. It took a decade for the anxiety of wasted potential, the looming threat of my declining health, and the general malaise of near-constant stupor to finally become too much. One year after giving that up, here's what's been different for me:

1) The most important takeaway that I think new sobernauts can learn from: It takes awhile for a ship to change it's course. This baby don't turn on no dime. I thought I'd be a productive machine when I got sober. Finally all this time and energy to do invest in all the passions I've ever wanted! Guess what? I'm still a lazy bum! But that said, I am changing, just much slower than I thought I would. My fantasy of productivity was the kind of escapist thinking that drove my drinking habits in the first place, and a decade of procrastination and cutting corners just doesn't leave you with the skills necessary to accomplish your goals, even if you have the time and energy. I'm starting from the ground up in many ways, but I've come to terms with that. I am pursuing my hobbies, and I can look back and see growth in the areas I want. Don't be disheartened by the fact that growth doesn't happen magically over night. As the old saying goes, “Rome wasn't built in a day.”

2) In line with escapist thinking, I'm surprised at how muted the daydreaming part of my brain has become. That's not to say I've quit daydreaming—I very much haven't—but there used to be a few major visual landscapes my brain would go to with certain feelings. I used to see myself at the edge of a great looming pit when the fears of the world would get to me. I used to see myself spreading my arms and dropping in as I walked to the bar or the store. I imagined myself in great tunnels in burrows deep down in the dark, in some hell as I downed beer after beer, whiskey after whiskey. Depression for me was a literal hole. What's worse is, this made it enjoyable for me. I remember once describing to a friend how the hangover felt like crawling out of the mud, and growing into a super human all in a day, when really it was just normalizing. I made it special in my brain, and that justified it for a long time. Nowadays, my depression looks like: my apartment. It's very boring now to be down in the dumps. It still happens a lot, but there's nothing tricking me into finding it worthy, which makes it easier to handle in a lot of ways. Now depression isn't a story, but a chore, and I hate chores.

3) I'm a shitty person! I did a lot of scummy things in my boozy years, and most of them I can't even blame on alcohol. But what I can blame on alcohol is running from my own behavior, and pushing out the idea that I wasn't being good to the world and the people around me. Being sober has reminded me of a lot of my behavior that I drank to forget, and now I'm forced to reconcile and take ownership with that part of me. 

You'll notice that my three main takeaways aren't really that positive, and that's on purpose. I've seen a lot of people disheartened by the fact that they get a month in, two months in, and they don't feel like they see people here feeling. For some people, booze was the main thing holding them down in life, and getting rid of it fixes a lot of things in a short amount of time. For people like me, booze was a problem to be sure, but it was also a symptom of a bigger more fundamental set of issues with who I am, and that's tough to admit. My life didn't get better overnight when I quit drinking. A year in, and I'm still not doing great, but I still wouldn't trade sobriety. I wouldn't give up this ability to finally take a good long look at myself and finally take the slow boring steps in the right direction. I changed the part of me that prevented me from changing myself. If you're struggling with feeling like nothing has changed in sobriety remember the idea of improving just 1% every day. Know that even just the clarity that booze wasn't the only thing holding you back is a worthwhile discovery. Life has a lot of struggles in it, but facing them with a clear mind will make us stronger. Don't give up, friends. IWNDWYT",18

I have been doubting my drinking habits during the entirety of my undergrad. I used to go out and get blind drunk pretty often, once if not twice a week for three years. I knew already after my first year that for me, the drinking became something other than just a party substance. 

This may sound like an obvious “stay away from the alcohol” scenario, I understand this. But I keep thinking, everybody drinks, nobody always drinks for the “right” reasons? Many people keep it in check? Surely it’s okay for me? It worked so well for me to get away from my problems and to have fun and I feel like everybody does this at some point. Am I wrong? Is this dumb? Am I naïvely cultivating a destructive drinking habit? 

I’m staying at home with my parents now during Covid and I finished 3 bottles of whiskey in 2 weeks without purposefully “drinking”. I don’t know if this is too much. I finished them clean, and I bought new ones with my savings secretly because I was scared they would see how much I drank. In a way I know the safe bet is to try to kick it, I just don’t know, also, I know I don’t want to- should I try and moderate, or should I kick it entirely? I still love having wine with my parents with dinner or drinking cognac with my dad over a cigar, or having some whiskey with him at 6 before dinner, I don’t always binge drink, but I have doubts now. I have had days where I don’t drink at all, but I find that also, sometimes, alcohol is the only thing that shuts off my fucking brain at night, and then I seriously indulge. I do like to drink on my own. I can easily clean half a bottle of whiskey on my own, but I’ve never drank an entire bottle by myself in one sitting (I’ve come pretty close). The solo binge-drinking is not habitual, but I do it sometimes when I know I can get away with it. 

I need your advice on this. Anybody who might have been here where I am now, I need to know if this is something I need to nip in the butt NOW. I’m 22. I think I’m willing to make the difficult decisions but I’m not convinced I have to. I don’t know if I have a problem, my friends have told me I’m just young and that it is standard. I need someone to tell me whether or not I’m being delusional about my drinking habits. Maybe in a way I already know the answer. I feel a bit scared right now. I have been for a while. I think I need to listen to some people who know what they are talking about. Please give me advice.

I quit in 2014, and then the siren song of alcohol told me that I could moderate and that I my husband would be “sad” if I didn’t drink with him on a much-anticipated 20 year anniversary trip. Both of those things were lies.  You see, I was without alcohol for 110 days, but I didn’t have a plan for staying sober or a real sense of recovering from years of drinking. No strategies. No tools. 

Today, it’s different, I approach my new found sobriety as something to be guarded, nurtured, and tended.  My body and brain are beginning to recover. I’m making better financial decisions, healthy relationship decisions, I’m walking my dogs a lot more, and I’m creating sufficient space to consider the best thing for my long-term sobriety on an almost daily basis. 

In the beginning, my drinking wasn’t salacious but it was aberrant - it just didn’t look like the people who could take it or leave it.  Back when I was a 20 year old college girl, I could see something different about my genuine affection for drinking, for not feeling everything so much, and for taking a vacation from my thoughts and feelings as often as possible.  [[insert 10,000 day ones here]]

Today is different. It’s not easy. It’s not always simple. Today is not a bed of roses, but it’s definitely better.  It’s a lot better in ways I cannot yet put into words, but just instinctively know.  It’s better. Thank you, SD, you’ve been the biggest and most winning surprise in all of this.",11

This week I let down my little brother (his birthday week), by passing out drunk before promised time we were set to spend together, which is rare because he lives in another state. Left him hanging at the door unable to contact me because I was passed out before he even got here.

Started drinking even more, probably lost my girlfriend after a fight and was sent off to a detox center. BAC was .371 by the time I got there.

Detox center was a nightmare. No need to explain that one.

Got out and immediately found out my unemployment had finally been denied.

In the grand scheme of things, it could be worse. No OWI this time. Still have a place to live and food to eat and a car to drive. (No drunk driving please, I learned my lesson 3 years ago there).

This one just happened to hit me emotionally harder than I could have imagined. I think and hope I may be able to finally accept responsibility, to admit I'm on my way to becoming one of the worst alcoholics, if I'm not one already.

I don't know exactly what the future holds.

I previously posted asking for opinions on moderating as I transitioned from drinking every day to not drinking for thirty days then deciding to moderate at two nights a week, (just drinking on a Friday and a Sunday). It’s now week 3 of that ‘moderation’ and I can honestly say that not drinking is definitely the key to where I want to be. The nights I drank went ok enough (just three glasses of wine) but the next day I felt dull, unimpressed by everything. Just... underwhelmed. It’s the best way to describe it. Initially I didn’t blame the drink. But trying it again a few days later the same happened. Then again the next week. It also took two days to get that great feeling of clarity back that I’d worked so hard for last month. 
The feeling of clarity is what I want now. Even when a day is not great for some reason I think about not drinking and I’m instantly proud. 
I used to love drinking and I miss that feeling but it’s like an ex, things just aren’t quite as good as they were and you miss them but there’s no point continuing.

I argue with myself constantly.  But I’m always caving in and end up pouring the wine every evening. I have PTSD from a life threatening illness that I had at age 11—I lived with it for 36 years (!) before it was diagnosed as PTSD, and I feel like my brain is so set in its ways that I’m beyond help.  I have anxiety (obviously), a teen daughter with a major anxiety disorder, and both of us have celiac disease to top it off—that was diagnosed last year.  My PTSD triggers are anything medical related, so COVID has been beyond insane for me to try to deal with. My mother is negative and when I try to talk with her she will inevitably fire back with “Well you think YOU’VE got it bad? I....”
My husband isn’t very chatty—he doesn’t want to deal with any problems; things are just supposed to be fine. He’s a daily beer drinker. He says I “look for problems” when I try to talk about things I’m feeling if it’s not all sunshine and roses.  
Also, I hate confrontation.  I’m the peacemaker and have been my entire life.  I will hide my feelings, problems, and opinions so that everyone else stays comfortable. I’m an introvert in an extrovert’s career. I’m also an empath, so just dealing with the world right now is exhausting. 
SO, after a day of pretending that things are fine, by 5 or 6:00 my brain has had enough.  I’m tired of the struggle to get through the day.  And the wine is poured. The edge is off.  It’s like the cure for all these things, but it’s a toxic cure and I know it’s going to come with a price, if not now then in the next few years.  Yet the terror I feel about that looming in my future isn’t strong enough to keep me from drinking.   
So what do I do now?  I could never go to AA. How can it be anonymous?  It’s in our own neighborhoods! And again...introvert.  A meeting with others will only add to my anxiety.  I can’t even put things on my phone (groups, podcasts, etc...) because we all share “the cloud” and I can’t be honest with anyone in this house.

So - I got sober in my 20s with the help of a program and therapy and medication. Dropped myself out after I lost a relationship and screwed up school at the same time. Before that, I actually wasn’t a heavy drinker I was always a drugs person but I distinctly remember thinking “fuck it I’m just going to drink by myself for a while.”

Years and years later:

Awesome friend group I had that would have supported me - gone 

Any ability to see myself as a victim - gone, I’ve done horrible things

Any ability to look good - gone

Any relationship with family - gone

All my hobbies and things I was good at - totally gone

I’ve systematically destroyed everything that was good about me. I keep trying to figure it out but I just get overwhelmed constantly. I have pretty legit attention issues underlying a lot of this ( not ADD/ADHD, something a little stronger), but that’s not an excuse. Never sought treatment after the decline started just always said I would.

I’ve been drinking and smoking my way to death and burning myself out from the inside for so long but I still just don’t feel like there’s a point because I never follow through on anything, even when I try my hardest. 

Ever since I was a tiny kid, I always disappoint. I stopped trying to change because I figured honestly it was better than always and repeatedly letting people down but that just means I am where I am now.

I’m not drinking today, I wish there were in person meetings where I was at, but I think I’m going to try posting on here once a day. Maybe it won’t work, but at this point honestly I may as well try. I put on a patch for the cigarettes and am going to read this forum, play guitar, and journal whenever I want to drink.

Sorry if this a self centered sad sack post. That’s kind of how I feel these days. Thanks for the space to post it.",8

One of my sisters is 24 and the other is 28. They are not addicts and just seem so beautiful and healthy and alive when I look at them. They spend a lot of time traveling around with their bf/husband, having fun with a big group of friends, going to festivals, seeing new things and trying new foods, working out, looking and feeling their best, smiling and laughing a lot, etc. All the things you should be doing in tour 20s. They never seem to hit a low point, which is the normal way to be I suppose. 

I love my sisters and I would never want them to go through what I did, but it reminded me of how much life I lost. It makes me feel bitter, angry, regretful and jealous. I was thinking back to the time when I was 24 and the memory of me waking up in the morning in front of my moms house behind a bush with a bunch of dirt in my mouth, covered in leaves and locked out of the house because I didn’t have a key comes to mind. 

I spent my 25th birthday in rehab and the year leading up to finally checking myself in was my rock bottom. I had lost everything at that point, fresh out of an abusive relationship and dealing with legal trouble. I know people get clean & sober and learn how to be happy much later in life than I did, but I feel numb thinking about what could have been and how I will never get that time of my life back.",13

I chose her via Zoom because we have the same first name and her sobriety date is the day before my birthday, she’s the first person i called from inside rehab that wasn’t friends or family, so i think perhaps i can find a sponsor who isn’t anti-420?

2020-06-24 12:39:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hf4cap/one_year_anniversary/,One Year Anniversary,"Hi all,

One year ago today I was at the bar right now continuing a 6 day bender that started the day before I left for a Vegas girls trip and ended with my car hydroplaning across 3 highway lanes, slamming into the wall, and then getting nailed on my passenger side by a 53ft semi red Mack truck. I should’ve died. I could’ve killed one or god knows how many other innocent victims. My life was beyond out of control. I was drinking non-stop and doing every drug under the sun when it came my way. I don’t know where on earth I’d be right now had this not have happened and I continued into this self destructive path into my deepest oblivion. 

Luckily, I have finally been given the wake up call of a lifetime to stay motivated to never drink again and have not had a drink since then. This was quite frankly the hardest year of my life as I cut off two men in my life who I loved with every inch of my soul, but they were not good for me. They kept me chained to this cycle of addiction and by cutting ties with them I have remained clean and sober.

Since the accident I completed outpatient, got a felony charge for having non-prescribed Adderall on me dismissed, completed Ironman Ohio with a fractured bone from the accident, qualified for the Boston marathon twice, won 1st place in my age group in one of the marathons, set a PR, met someone new who is wonderful, started a meetup group for sober women called Zero Proof, and currently sitting at the BMV to get my license reinstated.

I am so grateful for another shot at life. I turned 40 right before my accident and I promised myself I will make damn sure I live the second half of my life sober and all the rest will fall in place. I’ve never been married, but I always wanted that so much so I am hopeful that dream will come true in sobriety as I don’t think it would’ve ever happened in my drinking/drugging years. I did have around 6.5 years on and off sobriety before the accident because I constantly felt ambivalent in whether I wanted sobriety bad enough or not. Today the answer is crystal clear and my hope now and forever more is that my story will help many others reclaim their sobriety as well as I am a true testament of what can happen if you put it on the back burner. It’s just a matter of time. I definitely believe it is a very progressive disease and god knows how many of us never get a second chance like I did.

I love you all and believe in you. Having a wonderful support group has been tremendously helpful no matter how you find them. There are so many routes now a day with the end goal all being the same so find one that works for you and never ever give up no matter how many times you fall down!

I have turned into a messy, horrible, mean, abusive drunk. I am not an ""every day"" drinker. But I am a problem drinker, I can't stop, I will blackout every time. I have tried to moderate my intake over and over but I always end up back here - having blacked out after doing something horrible. It is a wonder I am not dead.

Two nights ago I was absolutely awful to my own mother. I assaulted her and hurled awful verbal abuse at her. My mum is beautiful and my best friend who only ever wants the best for her children - and I did that to her. I am in shock. I am a monster. Alcohol turns me into a hate filled monster. 

I come from a family of alcoholics (my parents and brother drink daily) but I thought I missed the boat of drinking related problems - clearly I did not. If I psychoanalyse myself I have some unresolved issues relating to a sexual assault two years ago that I believe are surfacing when I drink and these emotions are coming out as anger aimed at whoever I am surrounded by. 

I am hurting not only myself but everyone in my life. My friends and family. The people I love and care about most. I am disgusted in myself. I want to hide away in shame. 

Please help me because I am begging to not ever be this person again in my entire life. I am absolutely horrified. My mother deserves better.",6

I wanted to feel better... immediately.

I wanted to lose weight... immediately.

I wanted better health... immediately.

I wanted my anxiety to disappear... immediately.

I wanted to sleep better... immediately.

I wanted to fix broken relationships... immediately.

I wanted to be free from remorse... immediately.

Unfortunately, it doesn’t happen immediately. None of it happens immediately.

It all takes time. Sometimes it takes a lot of time. In my case, it took about a year before everything felt good. Like really GOOD.

As addicts, we want instant gratification in all areas of our lives. This is one area where you have to be patient. If it doesn’t happen right away, don’t worry. It will happen. 

Each day will get a little better and then one day you’ll realize that you feel like yourself. Your true, happy, content self. And that self is so beautiful. 

Just for today, be patient with yourself. ❤️",261

Long-time lurker, first time poster...

Yesterday I got some great news about a new job I applied for within my company. I had spent the whole weekend being anxious about whether or not I got the position.

Saturday and Sunday, I stayed active, did a lot of meditation, drank a ton of water, but my anxiety reached it's zenith yesterday (Monday) an hour or so before I was scheduled for a call with the feedback panel. When I received the news that I got the job, I should have felt elated, and relieved. But I didn't. 

I had so much anxious, self-doubting energy and no where to put it. All I wanted after the call was a drink. Or 5. I also recently got back on a diet to help with the weight I've gained due to drinking, and COVID-19, and I realized...I don't know how to reward myself, not without junk food or booze that is. 

Good day? Hooray, drink! Bad day? Ugh, drink. Meh day? Bored day? Busy day? Slow day? Drink. Drink. Drink.

My partner, who has been a huge support system for me in getting sober, poured sparkling water into wine glasses when I shared the news with them, and asked me what I wanted to do to celebrate, and all I felt this ugly, resentful feeling. Sparkling water wasn't a toast...I down sparkling water by the gallon each day. In a wine glass? I never even drank wine, celebration or no. It just felt like a big let down...it wasn't my partner's fault, it was my fault, my addiction's fault. I feel like I should know how to celebrate, be happy, be proud of myself, without stuffing myself full of trash food, or drowning all feelings with alcohol. 12 hours later, my craving is still there...I know it's psychological at this point, but it's there.

I guess, I'm just wondering what you all do to celebrate your wins? 

Thanks for reading.",6

Think of your heart pounding at 3 am after a night of drinking unable to go back to sleep.  
Think of your lips being stained with red wine the next morning.  
Think of your disgusting breath and feeling in your mouth.  
Think of the embarrassing texts you send to people.  
Think of how stupid and buffoonish you look trying to have intellectual conversations while drinking.  
Think of the impulse buys you make online.  
Think of the hurtful arguments you've had with your ex.  
Think of your bloated stomach after bingeing on terrible food.  
Think of the anxiety and desire to die for days after.  

  
I get to live a life free from this. I want to lose the desire to drink, but I'll admit it's still not entirely gone. I'm trying to find reminders and reasons to not drink even though I know I gain nothing from drinking. I hope the desire goes away with time and reinforcement.",48

The forthcoming story is not good news, however, so if you're somehow here for a happy tale or something like that, don't keep reading.

Two months ago, my fiancee of four years left me because of my abundant alcohol abuse. Or rather, she left because when I drink, I turn into the most awful version of myself, and she (rightly) chose to stop putting up with it.

She is the love of my life, and when she first left, she was going to come back. She was just staying at her sister's place for a few weeks while I cooled off, but instead I decided to chug vodka and text her the worst things I've ever said to anyone. 

I don't even remember what I said, and I'm still too afraid to scroll up and see how much of an ass I made of myself.

... And because of that, she didn't come back. Not then anyway. 

Fast forward to right now, and she's asleep on my new couch in my new apartment in a new state. 

She's just here for a couple more days, picking up some of her stuff. She still tells me she loves me, every day, but she's also smart enough to know I haven't legitimately changed.

And God bless her, she says she really wants to try again one day. I'm her first serious relationship, and I do believe she means it, but I've said those same words to people.

I don't know if I'm worth it. I don't lack intrinsic self worth (I'm rather narcissistic), but after everything I've said and done, I lack the ability to feel like I'm the best choice for her, or even a good one. 

Sorry to vent yall. This is my first time here so if I broke some rules or made a crummy faux pas, I sincerely apologize. This sub just seemed like the place for me and this right now.

Without the help of some of the posts and support in this group, I KNOW it would have been impossible. Thus, I wanted to pay it forward and contribute two observations/recommendations that I have learned during my 100 dry days. 

1) You may find that some activities suck now without alcohol and bore you more than they did when you had a drink in your hand. However, consider the fact that the activity probably already sucked and drinking just made you care less or notice it less. 

Fun times are fun, with or without alcohol. I was nervous at first hanging out with friends who I used to always drink with and was terrified that with me being the only sober one, our relationships might change. Turns out, I had just as much fun with them as I did before. Don’t be afraid of “missing out.” I assure you, that’s one of the myths alcohol tells us. 

2) If you’re really struggling to fill your mind with thoughts outside of drinking, find a new hobby and dive deep into it. For me, it was writing and chess. Pick things you never associated with drinking and never did while drunk. Instead of playing video games and crushing beers Friday and Saturday nights, I worked on a long overdue novel and tried to become a better chess player. 

Keep it up. Check in everyday. Stay sober and remember, you’re better sober. Whoever you are, your best self is the sober one.",13

It was a 3-week booze-free period but I distinctly remember drinking in a dream and waking up in a panic. I went back to boozing and can remember ending up right back in the shitty mental state. Full of anxiety, self-loathing, near-constant dread, all of it. I couldn't believe it - I was certain the break would 'reset' my mind. I took another break again for dry Jan in 2019 - it felt great, but again I had no intention to stop full time. And just like before I was right back in the misery, the fear, all over again. 

Then in July of 2019, I just couldn't bear it anymore. I HAD to stop for my sanity, my life.  A distinct difference this time around is in all my dreams I'm firm in my sobriety. No more drunken dreams, I think the difference is my sub-conscience is along for the ride. This isn't just a break, its a fundamental change. I hear the same happens when you learn a new language...when you've really learned it you'll start to dream in that language. Here I am, I've really learned that I needed to make that change. I'm so thankful because before I really wasn't looking forward to the future. 

This community has been so helpful along the way, I've never posted here before and my post is a bit rambling but I'm just feeling so good, so confident in this change and the positives it brought me. Of course, there are moments I miss a drink, but it is so fleeting - those first few minutes after the bartender brings everyone their drinks and me my cran and soda. Then I think about having the drink and my life starting to blur around the edges; that sets me right back on course. It is 100% true when you hear that you have to make this change for you and you alone. Pushing through, white-knuckling, for any reason other than your own future self is so much harder - it becomes exhausting doing it to just prove a point, even if it's to yourself. I will do as so many others and bring up Annie Grace, I believe that book really helped by explaining why this was happening to me.

2020-06-24 09:28:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hf10nv/sober_day_60_reflections/,Sober Day 60 Reflections,"What I’ve learned: 

Accept that sometimes you may be the **only** one not drinking. Learn to exist in that environment or avoid the environment completely. 

Actively develop non drinking hobbies and coping mechanisms. Being able to look forward to daily small things (a relaxing bath, a run, snuggling up with a good book) is crucial. 

Sometimes thoughts about wanting to drink will enter your mind spontaneously. Do not act on those thoughts. Do not dwell on them. Do not build resentment over not drinking. Let the thought come and let it go. 

“You get what you tolerate”. Stop tolerating your own destructiveness. I used to justify drinking by saying things like “I only black out x times a year.” or “I only say/do something stupid while drinking x times a month”. One time is too many times. 

Forgive. Yourself. Everyone messes up. The most important thing is that you pick right back up where you left off even if that’s 1 time, 100 times, 1,000 times. The people that succeed are not the ones who didn’t fail. They’re the ones that didn’t give up trying. 

Drop the shame and guilt from the past. Many people may think of you in terms of old information. That’s okay. You’re not that person anymore. You know the truth and that’s the only thing that matters. 

Understand your triggers. What triggers you to drink? A beautiful hot day with clear skies and the grill going? Truth: alcohol does not actually enhance what is already in front of you. A fight with your partner or spouse? Truth: alcohol does not resolve conflict. Identify your triggers and be equipped with the truths to combat those triggers. 

Surrender completely to the emotions. Life is hard. Tragic things are happening all around us. Let yourself feel what you need to feel. Be sad. Be angry. Throw a temper tantrum. Cry. Allow yourself to grieve. Think about all of the things that are unfair and broken. Then get up and take on life and make it your bitch. Rinse and repeat. 

These things may not work for everyone - but it's what has worked for me so far. :)",29

I have recognized that i've been drinking too much in order to cope with the stress associated with his anger and insults.  He had times of mocking me when I would get anxious while not drinking and even got frustrated with my zoom AA meetings.   I just felt trapped.

Anyway, it's been 8 days now and I found myself begging him back and he won't come back.  He's done and he always said that he believed that I would end up a homeless drunk if he left me.   And somehow I am scared that's what will happen.  I feel myself drinking more and more.

I am just devastated.  He's gone -- 6 years together.  I made it one of the days this week...with only 2-3 glasses of wine.  But, last few days i've started the wine around 11 am and drank close to 2 bottles.

Working remotely and at home all day is very tough isolated.  I called my sponsor last night and talked to her and told her I need to start again.  But, i have been through AA with her - i've been through the steps.  I just can't seem to make it click for me as it has for so many.  

I feel like.. what's the point of caring about anything -- he's gone and I don't want anyone else.  I have no joy in my life and I feel so destroyed inside.  I have had dark thoughts, but i wouldn't kill myself.  But, I feel very deeply broken.   

Bottom line -- I asked the man who emotionally abused me to come back -- to take me back.  To work things out and he said no.  I'm just not to his liking anymore....and he's not capable of being with anyone anymore and he will most likely die alone.  

I'm sitting here regretting not trying harder.  I DID stop drinking for awhile while we were together but I struggled because his anger would trigger me to drink.  

Here's to another day 1.  Any tips on how I can get through this without drinking?",4
2020-06-24 09:24:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hf0y46/crossposted_to_rleaves_i_just_want_a_vice/,crossposted to r/leaves-- I just want a vice,"hey, all! i'm just looking for some connection in the midst of my frustration.

I'm 25 years old, and i've lurked this sub for years, as i've abused alcohol for years. I've tried to quit drinking many times. In early February I got drunk one night, woke up puking (I throw up at least 3 times a week for the last 2 years) and I didn't stop vomiting for 4 days-- accompanied by extreme back and abdominal pain. It landed me in the ER, and while they didn't think it was a hangover, they thought alcohol may have sparked something.

I haven't had a drink since.

I had picked up smoking weed back in September, and it was slowly replacing alcohol for me-- helping me drink less, though alcohol has always been my first love. Once I couldn't drink and risk another vomiting episode like this, I went fully into smoking-- in the morning, around noon, and then in the evening to help me eat and signal it's time for bed. I continued to vomit 3 times a week.

May 31, I started puking again. This time I didn't stop for 11 days. I went to the ER 3 times, and was finally admitted to the hospital on day 10 of the episode. I stayed overnight and was good to go the next day. I've since been diagnosed with Gastroparesis- a slow emptying of the stomach. They think it's also Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome-- a vomiting reaction to cannabis in any form. To figure out if I have CHS, I now have to abstain from weed altogether.

I haven't smoked weed since the start of my last episode, and I haven't thrown up since my last episode ended. So unless I have another episode and find weed isn't the cause, it's looking like I will need to fully abstain from cannabis forever.

Suddenly, not drinking is a lot more difficult, because I had truly replaced one with the other. I miss smoking so much-- and the people around me (my roommate and best friends) do it everyday. It's all over my house, and our evening routine is no longer, so I've been avoiding being in my home so that I'm not around the people closest to me. It pulls my heartstrings seeing the bong in the kitchen. Luckily, the people close to me in this season of my life aren't drinkers, and with the bars closed because of the pandemic, it's helped me to avoid alcohol.

I know that people smoke for years and years and quit. Decades, for many of you. I recognize I hadn't smoked long, and I think the fact that weed had really replaced alcohol in my life is what makes it difficult. I'm now facing the fact that I may need to live a life of total sobriety. My predominant feeling is that I'm honestly just pissed, and sad, and feel like I'm grieving something. My mom has been sober my whole life after a tumultuous 20s, and I always thought I could be ""good enough"" at substance use that I wouldn't end up like her. Now the idea of being fully sober is so daunting, disappointing, infuriating. It's hard to face and it's incredibly isolating to not have sober people my age around me.

I guess I'm just posting because I need a little bit of love and solidarity. Anyone else quitting multiple substances at once? Anyone else feeling isolated? I feel like I'm screaming into a void every single day, and I need support.

I also just ordered the book ""refuge recovery""-- I don't know if it's for me, I don't know if I'm an alcoholic, I don't know if I struggle with addiction. I just know that the substances I use have hurt me so deeply- physically, emotionally, I've lost so much time, so many mornings, so many evenings. I'm getting my life back but I don't know how to envision a life without weed and alcohol. Can someone tell me I can do it?

My clocks:

Alcohol sober- 131 days

Weed sober- 23 days

Days since vomiting- 16 days (the longest I've gone in 2 years)

And i'm crying writing this last sentence, because while i'm not sure it's what I want... IWNDWYT.",4

Well two years later I have become an alcoholic. I'm still alive. I'm no closer to that hole in the ground, and now I'm royally fucked.",3
2020-06-24 08:50:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hf0g8m/approaching_the_climax_of_my_addiction/,Approaching the climax of my addiction,"I (28m) was almost killed in a workplace accident 2 years ago, the anniversary is coming up soon. Before I only drank socially, but the moment I was discharged I hit the bars hard. I was in a unfamiliar city on the opposite side of my country. First the withdrawals from the painkillers hit. I went through what the hospital gave me in about 2 days. I was completely alone, thinking I was coming to terms with what happened. Looking now I think that was far from the truth, I was hiding.

Now its 2 years later, and I think I've not drank till I passed out sporadically for a day or two here and there. At first my friends back home were there to support me, but it usually was taking me out drinking at friends houses or going to bars. I'm sure some of you can see where this is going. I did too many shameful and out of character things and burned my bridges. I lost my girlfriend because I was continuously hiding my drinking from her, and I couldnt let her go through this with me. I lost my last friend soon after, after doing some embarrassing and likely scary shit and ghosting them for a month after I woke up the next morning and realized how stupid I was. They confronted me and my brain has become so useless that I could hardly offer a coherent apology. 

I keep trying to stop, I'll go a day, maybe two, but then withdrawals hit, I cant sleep, nightmares and panic attacks wake me up if I do. I have PTSD from the accident but I stopped taking my meds months ago because I knew I would kill myself if I kept mixing them, and i couldnt stand the thought of someone I knew finding me, and frankly I'm terrified. So I chose the drink instead, and hid from my problems, creating more. My money is about to run out, I'm bruised and scratched from falling over late at night alot. Ive lost alot of weight because all I do is drink..I've been up since 2am because I only drank 3 bottles of wine and melatonin and fell asleep around 10. My lease is up in a month but since I burned my last friends, I spent that next blurry day moving my stuff out in a panic, I threw everything to the dump after they came to see me and cut me off. I'm really on edge and paranoid for no reason.. I havent had a drink yet today even though its 8am, but I cant get out of my bath tub even though the water is fucking cold, I cant face the day with how bad things have gotten. 

Yesterday I met with a therapist for an assesment. Today I have to realize that I need to quit drinking or I'm going to be dead soon. Tomorrow I'm going to clean my house and finish packing. I'm alone again, it feels like before...but I need to get this written down and cry for help or I'm just going to go back. I'm sorry if this triggers anyone, I'll delete it if so. I know that I'm never going to be who I once was, but my self care, the good part of me has to be buried somewhere in my head",3

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I’ve been sitting here staring at my phone trying to think of words to say and I’m still not really sure what to write, but I’ll start with saying that I’m noticing myself starting to develop a drinking problem and I feel so ashamed about it.

Over the past couple of years I’ve been drinking more often and it has gradually grown to become almost every day and once I start I can’t stop until I feel unwell. I’m not good at keeping it to one drink, especially when I’m by myself without judgment from others. I don’t feel good when I get drunk, I say embarrassing things and become overdramatic. I find myself feeling like I need a drink most days recently and I give in to that feeling. I find it too easy to drink a bottle of wine and then open another one. And do it again the next day. I didn’t realise just how much I’ve been drinking recently and I feel so embarrassed. 

Last night was a turning point for me. I didn’t do anything bad but getting drunk, dramatic and saying weird shit is enough to make me never want to get drunk again. I need to cut it down and be a normal person, I’m not sure if I’ll stop drinking completely but my aim is to only drink on special occasions, but not get drunk, and not to drink at home anymore, not finding any reason to drink or drinking for no reason.

He said he’d text me when he was done with dinner, I let the hours tick by and finally shortly after 8 I texted him “are you not coming?” And he responded with numerous typos that he was still at dinner. I told him I was disappointed especially since this was his idea but will try to understand. He apologized and said he got caught up at dinner to which I responded “drinking took precedence?” He responded saying he did “indulge”

I had 13 days sobriety from alcohol behind me this month after a bender sent me to the ER because I wasn't sure if I could handle the withdrawal symptoms. An IV bag and a librium was enough to get me back on track, and then on day 13, I said to myself, ""why not maybe try just having a beer?""

This led to a week or two of drinking just shy of a pint of whiskey or so a day until I upped it yesterday and got so hammered that I don't remember any of the night. I woke up to a very angry fiance and the worst withdrawals, which led to a day of severe discomfort that I am still riding out to an extent (though it has lessened significantly). 

I don't know, folks; I have to say the whole thing is very discouraging. Drinking has severely fucked up my life to the point where I really feel like I'll end up dying from it some day if I don't stop. Those two weeks of not drinking were glorious, and my life was infinitely better than it is when I'm constantly fighting off daily withdrawal symptoms from a poison. 

That being said, I worry about the idea that this continues to happen. I have had 3-5 ""episodes"" from drinking this year that have really left a mark, and then I get my shit together for a little while and it's almost like I lose steam on the long game. I haven't tracked 30 days sober in a row for well over a year, and this bothers me quite a bit. 

Apologies for the war story. There's an adage in SMART Recovery that I like a lot which goes something along the lines of if you're driving from New York to California and you get a flat tire in Texas, you don't go back to New York to change it; you change it right where you're at and keep heading west! I like that. 

Discouraging, though. Thanks for listening.",5

Figured I’d share what’s been recent.

My biggest wake up call came around New Years Day a year and a half ago. Woke up probably at 2 or 3 in the afternoon not remembering how I got home, although that wasn’t super uncommon. I had done dry January before a few times so decided to do it again. 

First nights sleep sweaty, in and out sleep, but I had that before- was familiar with withdrawal symptoms. Next day I figured I’d sleep real well, but found myself with anxiety through the roof wired at 2am walking around my neighborhood to avoid a panic attack by sitting still... ok somethings not right... next day/night still no sleep, never had such heightened anxiety in my life. Minutes felt like hours. I was so naive to what alcohol withdrawal was that i started googling my symptoms and realized I had entered a new “stage” of withdrawal beyond headaches and throwing up. Had to look up what DTs stood for.... Then finally came across a reddit post (ha) of someone who by 72 hours sober went through what I was going through right before getting hallucinations thinking he saw people and almost dying. It was incredibly eye opening. At the end of his post be advised to never go cold turkey. 

When I read that I made a decision in an effort to not kill my self I needed to walk to the liquor store to get a 6 pack as soon as they opened at 8am to ween myself off. I told myself if I could get through this, I would never drink again.

I drank 6 beers over the next 12 hours, my digestive system finally started to move, and I was finally hungry enough to eat something. I was still very anxious but at least I felt some security I wasn’t going to die. Looking back I probably wasn’t going to but I just had no idea.

It all started to set in that I must’ve drank heavily every night for 3 months straight, and most nights the past 10 years, mostly alone in isolation. My body was in complete shock and in imbalance due to alcohol not being in my system.

I opened up for the first time and told my mom. She was, to my relief, very supportive and not judgmental. 

5 days in I finally slept peacefully and woke up without anxiety for the first time. 

I then went 9 months straight without drinking. 2 bachelor parties, several bar nights with friends, 2 weddings, no drinking. People admired me, some questioned why, but I was set on seeing how long I could go, and I truly believed forever.

My problem was I never did anything the way you’re supposed to. No AA meetings, never came here, just worked a lot, hung with friends and exercised as much as possible.

I gave in in September 2019 while on a date with a new girl. We dated for about 3 months into December and throughout I truly drank in moderation, and never alone. I told her I had struggled with alcohol in the past, and she was shocked-she didn’t think I had a problem at all.

Then I slowly fell back into bad habits when we broke up, 2 weeks straight drinking heavily, 3 days of painful anxiety/terrible sleep, 2 weeks off saying I’ll never do it again. Repeat, repeat. 

Several day hangovers were never a thing in college for me (10 years ago), but my drinking has changed. What was fun, has turned into a progressive, isolating, temporary fix to my depression. It’s the shitty job, or being single, or being a young father, that’s causing my depression, so I need to drink to feel better. Problem is I do forget it when I’m blackout.

I’ve gone to about 30-40 meetings since January and have branched out to meet with a couple older guys. It’s honestly just been tough to find a rhythm of a dedicated meeting especially since corona. 

My trigger or breaking point is when my mental state enters a “fuck it, I don’t care”. Self-destructive, I know. 

I’m happier when sober, not sure why I continue to put myself through this vicious cycle. I’m on day 4 today and feel good, but need to make a long-term change.

My first post here....

I don’t drink everyday but when I do I can’t stop. Especially when I’m out and not close to family. I went to the doctor in December with them telling my liver functions are up (in my 30’s) and I need to quit or tone it down. Well 3 months (March to May) I toned it down while things were closed due to COVID with 6 drinks (beers) a week. Once the bars opened I went and started the usual 3pm-11pm bar shift and feeling horrible next day so I get a beverage next day, not go to work and bend for 2-3 days. 

Obviously it’s causing me harm to my health, finances, work, family life. I’ve had a ton of criticism and pressure and still do from family when I’m sober and obviously when I’m not sober. Been seeing a therapist for 8 months and it helps but I snowball out of control still. I don’t have severe withdrawal symptoms but do not want to get to that point. 

I’m trying to find additional support to be better and get my stuff on the right track and have a healthy happy family.",7

Today, I am feeling the rewards of this decision, with a new found positive demeanour generally. Its truly one of those days where the birds are singing and the sun is shining.

However I haven't told him anything about stopping drinking and it is making me nervous.

I'm also kind of torn between stopping drinking for me vs. stopping drinking for my marriage and having my wife in earshot during our call is also a possibility.  I'm also feeling very tempted to drink and that I'm kind of realizing what white knuckling it means.  I haven't drank anything yet but I moved some alcohol around the house so being alone for this thing with drinks available is an option.  

I can play the tape forward but it doesn't necessarily mean tonight will be bad.  It does however mean I will then be lying about it later and having a harder time with sobriety over the next couple weeks.

The last bottom I cared to hit was asking my husband to pull over along Coastal Highway so I can switch seats with one of the kids. I wanted to be in the backseat because the front seat and the scenery flying by just wasn’t good for my hangover. 

Nothing changes if nothing ever changes. 

A year ago, I hesitantly googled ‘sobriety apps’ and found some old Reddit threads with recommendations. I downloaded I Am Sober, I created an account for Reddit, I found some sober social media accounts. I followed, liked, and upvoted. 

I checked in daily on my app. I commented IWNDWYT on more posts than I can count and even hosted a few Daily Check-Ins. I joined some online recovery meetings. I’m now able to acknowledge my triggers, my need for self-care, and my resentments when they are piling up. 

The shiny newness of sobriety has faded; the spark of new milestones has flickered out; and I know it’s boring work from here on out. Every day, I see people in here doing the boring work, staying sober, and most importantly, being grateful. Every day. Right here. I’m walking alongside you, as both a tour guide and tourist. I’m grateful as hell for this group and its members. I’m especially grateful for those members that document their slip ups. The bravery in admitting imperfection and then trying again?

**A little about my journey**:

My family (particularly on my father's side) has struggled on and off with drinking every day. I vowed to be more careful than them, and I was until around age 23. I had the wonderful experience of being in Europe for a few months, and I drank every single day. I noticed I was doing it, but thought, who wouldn't if they had this opportunity too? I'd be a fool not to take advantage of all the good beer and wine! Well, once I got back to the states, I moved to a new city for a job I really wanted. Even though I really wanted that job, I did not want to move from the city I was in previously. I was leaving behind such a lovely community. I was depressed when moving, felt homesick for my previous city, anxious about the new job, and socially isolated. I started having 1-2 drinks nearly every day. But two months later I  was rear-ended and got a bad concussion. I stopped drinking for 2 and 1/2 months. When the holidays came around, I began drinking, but not as frequently as before. 5 months into my recovery from the concussion came the debilitating pain from migraines. The kind of physical pain that makes you realize why doctor-assisted suicide is a thing. I tried EVERYTHING to help the pain. Please believe me when I say I tried everything. I noticed that if I drank the pain was mitigated. I could fall asleep easier. I think I started to drink 2-4 nights out of the week. That lasted a year or so, progressively leading to drinking 5 days a week. In 2019, I nearly drank every single day.

I still deal with a lot of physical pain, so the impulse to drink is alive and well in me. However, I am noticing that the impulse to drink is no longer strictly associated with physical pain. Simply put, I don't want to feel my feelings anymore. I have been through a lot of trauma and hardship since 2012 without much reprieve. I give myself grace in that anyone who goes through 8 years of traumatic bullshit would likely not want to feel their feelings anymore too. However, muting my feelings is no longer sustainable for me.

I am scared to reduce or stop drinking. I am scared of facing my feelings. I am scared of drowning my the intensity of my feelings. It's taken so much strength to survive everything that's come my way, and I don't want to drown. I am scared that my partner and I aren't compatible and that there is nothing we can do about that. I am scared of not being able to fall asleep. I am scared of missing out on social fun. I am scared of having to feel my physical pain.

I want to be the person I know I am capable of becoming. I want to make myself proud.

So far I have been experimenting with an alcohol free day in between drinking and/or a few alcohol-free days in between drinking. I have committed myself to not drinking today, tomorrow, or Thursday. For me, I have noticed making small goals has helped reduce any self-loathing that accompanies ""falling off the bandwagon.""

**I have some questions for y'all that are farther along in your journey:**

Do things that bring joy to your life *actually* become more joyful when you reduce alcohol consumption or become alcohol-free?

When does your sleep get better?

What is it like to start feeling your feelings more?

What do you wish you had known prior to reducing alcohol or becoming alcohol-free?

If you too experience a lot of physical pain, how do you cope with it (besides medication)?

Do you feel like your missing out socially? If not, when did that stop for you? If so, how do you cope/process that feeling?

Sorry for the rant (feel free to skip), but if I don’t get this “out there” I may blow up in a way that my drunken blow ups couldn’t compare to. And sorry for the language - I like to think I’ve got a decent vocabulary that doesn’t require cussing - but sometimes it just feels better too - so please skip if you are offended.

I’m on day 22 (happy about that). I’ve been one of those high functioning drinkers for years now - confining my drinking to only after 9 pm (sometimes 8 on the weekend), but daily and until I passed out (or occasionally blacked out). My drinking bothered my SO a lot - mostly (his words) because it was daily, but he did often cite safety.

After 5 years of needing to stop working because he had a series of medical needs - we were finally in a place I could work again. Of course during those five years he’d make comments about my not working - and I’d ask him what job he thought I could get that would let me have 8 weeks off at a time for round the clock care for him after his latest surgical. Either way, this past fall I was able to start doing part time stuff here & there - felt awesome! I did so well, I was offered a full time position - which rocked until quarantine kicked in. When I was working my drinking cut back substantially- but still daily. But during quarantine it got bad - and I finally got serious about stopping for good. Got my doctor involved - warned my husband withdraw might happen (he waved it off even when I gave him an article from the freaking Mayo Clinic).

Starting Day One I threw myself into some hard labor projects that have needed to be done for years - not sure if that was the best/worst, but it kept my mind occupied with audio books and mindless labor that exhausted me by nighttime. That all wrapped up on day 18 - I did 70% of this work myself - and I’m a fairly small woman. 5 trips to the landfill. A whopping 40 contractor bags set by the curb filled with paperwork that he should have shredded over the past five years.

A few days ago myself & fellow employees were notified that we would be back in the fall - a very modified environment that requires me to rethink my whole job - but we were all thrilled. So along with taking care of teenagers daily drama (to avoid his blow ups at them), and trying to wrap my brain around everything I need to prepare - I started trying to get the house manageable again after nearly three weeks of barely any cleaning. I started with laundry - which took most of a day. One thing that is pissing me off are his comments about the house - he had made a few while I was doing all the heavy projects, but he just backed down and was like “I know, you can’t do both” - arg!!!

The last few days the comments have intensified - this morning I was setting on my couch with my computer trying to get organized for the fall while texting a co-worker. Yes, she is a friend - but we were helping each other with the software - and he gets super irritated that I’m just sitting and texting. I even let it go to revisit later by saying “when you got irritated with me this morning, I felt like you were upset because you didn’t feel like what I was doing counted as work.” He even freaking confirmed that’s what he meant!!!

Add to that he HAS TO have the TV on in the bedroom to go to sleep - at least until 11:30 or 12 am (even if he is asleep - if it shuts off, he wakes up pissed). The main thing that has been a help through this was retiring to my bedroom at 9 pm, after taking bedtime meds (not the knock you out kind - the kind that just kind of sort of work in the right environment). My toughest time each day is 5-9, but at least I’ve had the 9 pm to look forward to - but without the heavy labor it’s tougher to get to sleep, and the damn TV sure isn’t helping.

And his little comments about the house, his attitude with our daughters, his apparent lack of understanding of just how much work I have to do to prepare for the fall - all of it pisses me off. My stopping drinking was “so important” to him, he swore he was going to be all supportive - he’s been anything but.

There’s even still this need of going everywhere together - I finally asked him if he wanted me to go with him because he was afraid I was going to stop by the liquor store - he was genuinely surprised and said “not at all - I just thought we could do this stuff together” - well, I’d have more freaking time to get the house clean to your standards if we weren’t turning every one person job into a two person ride along.

TL;DR: Sorry. Really sorry this was so long. I think I’ve done amazingly well - and his bitching about the TV in the bedroom, blowing up at our teen daughters for minor shit, or the house being a mess has me at my limit. This was supposed to be SO IMPORTANT to him - asshole.",2

You know what day it is?

MY 100th DAY OF SOBRIETY!!! 😱

This is something I never thought would happen. For over a decade I was digging myself deeper and deeper until I didn’t know who I was anymore. Sitting here, right now, sober...fk can you believe this shit? The amount of support and love I have received is so overwhelming and extremely appreciated. You all have no idea. I didn’t do it alone though. Since the very beginning I’ve had a strong, amazing and beautiful support system. I don’t think these 3 women will ever know how much of an impact they’ve made on my life. The day I decided to stop drinking I had a small amount of Tito’s left in my freezer from the night before (almost drank the whole bottle). I messaged my friend Emily and I asked her if I should pour the rest down my sink or down my throat (LOL). She told me sink, and let’s be real if I had just thrown the bottle in the trash I would’ve gotten it back out (totally done that before). 

Emily, you changed my life and I can’t tell you enough how happy I am that you came into my life and stayed. I always have a fkn blast with you, you’re the total package woman. ❤️

Heather, When you sent me that email about hitting your two years of sobriety it completely changed my life. Everything that you said hit so close to home and I felt like I was reading something that I had written. You have been such an amazing friend to me whether it was you just being goofy as fuck (your true nature), listening to me whine or showing me each and every day how proud you are of me. I’m at a loss for words to even fully explain how much you mean to me. I am so thankful that I met you. So so so thankful. I’ve been changed for good. ❤️

Julia, Dude I am so happy that we reconnected. You have been one of the best friends I’ve ever had and I’m very humbled to call you my friend. When Lisa died I fkn lost it. I started pushing any and everyone away from me because as you said I was self-depreciating. It was true. It was then that I realized I didn’t want to push you away and you were trying to open my eyes. I’m beyond grateful for you J. You make me laugh more than anybody ever has...fuck man you are so fucking funny! Sometimes something you’ve said pops in my head randomly and I just die each time. You are such an amazing person, you are someone that I look up to (not irl cuz I’m taller but u get what I mean). Thank you so much for making me realize my self worth and helping me grow into the person I am today. ❤️

I love you all so much. Thank you for everything squad! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤",16

In early sobriety, I sort of assumed that being around alcohol would always be difficult.

I thought that I would always secretly crave it.

I was addicted, therefore I believed the substance would always appeal to me, draw me in and call my name.

And yet being around it now, seems to have the opposite effect on me.

A couple of nights ago, I went out with some friends. I had a blast catching up, we talked and danced the night away.

In the early morning hours, the effects of alcohol really started to set in the club.

People stopped making sense. Conversations became dull. Slurred. Repetitive. Cringe-worthy.

The floors were sticky from all the spilled drinks, people became uncoordinated and pushy. 

Some guy managed to lose his house keys.

I heard a girl puking in the bathroom while her friends were laughing and another alone barely being able to walk, stumbling into a cab with guys she just met 2 minutes ago.

And in those people, I recognized past me. Watching, I have a renewed sense of gratefulness for sobriety.

When I got sober for the first time, I avoided drunk people for years.

And so inadvertently, I ended up glamorizing the feeling. I thought I missed that feeling of freedom, the random flirts, the flow in conversation, connecting. This false belief led me to relapsing several years ago. 

But seeing it in real life, it reminded me it really is all just an illusion and how much I love actually being present.

I never end up regretting things or trying to piece together what happened. Everything I say I mean, and everything I do it’s because I want to do it.

With alcohol gone from my life, so was a lot of unnecessary drama, gossip, shame, arguments and misunderstandings. 

When we got back to the hotel, I had a lovely heartfelt talk with a friend, took off my makeup, put on PJs and in the morning, I woke up feeling fresh, and really fucking grateful to not be hungover.

And to this day, I’ve never regretted making the choice to not drink the night before. And I doubt you will ever regret not drinking too.",151

Im a bit angrier at some things going on in my life to the point i dwell on some things im trying to put behind me and leave in the past. Now when Friday night comes all my problems go away and then Monday starts the cycle over again. Im wondering if this is withdrawal type anger or am I just an angry person and maybe im feeling my real feelings. To the angry ones, did you mellow out after cutting booze completely for a month or so.
I thought the progress ive made is great considering i used to drink everyday for 15 years or so, but maybe im not cut out to be a moderate drinker, im really feeling the effects of just numbing my problems and wondering if my life of drinking is just easier. Sorry for the rant.",1

My girlfriend called a detox center near me and I'm going this afternoon for an evaluation.

I'm nervous and I'm not entirely sure what to expect, as I've never been to rehab before. I told her not to tell any friends or family about it because I do feel some shame in doing this, even though I know it's for my own good.

It's been immensely helpful. Especially during the last few months where my subconscious has been romanticizing alcohol. 

But coming here daily. And reading posts from beginners to old timers, successes to setbacks, has been invaluable. 

I never thought I could actually quit. 

There were so many starts and then setbacks. So many nights when I would actually be crying while pouring a drink, and taking a sip. Wanting to stop, but not being able to. In that moment. 

But finally surrendering. And turning towards self compassion, self understanding, self forgiveness and self acceptance, made all the difference. 

If I can quit alcohol, so can you. 

And really, 1 day, 100 days or 10,000 days are really the same thing. 

We can only live one day at a time. 

And sobriety? It's just a whole bunch of single days lived, one after the other. 

Thank you to everyone on here.

I lurked for a while after finally coming to terms with having a problem in November/December of last year. I have an autoimmune disease that showed up right after graduating college which was completely debilitating (and took four years to get under control). My relationship with my parents is, for all intents and purposes, bad. I have PTSD as a result of both of those events and am working through therapy to uncover a lot of why I do what I do. Things really went off the rails with my drinking when my sister was discovered using heroin on Thanksgiving. I was able to help get her into rehab and she's been sober since, and I committed to not drinking in January. 

I made it about two and a half months. It was the happiest and most grounded I have been in years. Then a deluge of bad news happened - I lost my job, my sister dropped out of college and moved across the country, a very close friend died, and COVID - all contributed to a relapse.  Until today.

One day at a time to 365

Last Friday, June 19th, marked 365 days sober for me. 369 days ago I was at the end of another 4 year bender, day in and day out drinking to oblivion. Before that 4 year bender started, I was in the hospital getting detoxed and before that detox it was 7 years of drinking and drugging. A decade plus of ingesting poison has a toll on ones body and mind, I was in the process of losing the job I’d been successful at, relationships with my family/friends, my sanity and my health. I was at the end of the yellow brick road about to fall into the bottomless pit of addiction/hospitalization/death and it was time I made the most uncomfortable decision I was yet to make in my 29 years, reaching out for help. 

Treatment got me sober, AA has kept me sober. I’ve learned a ton about myself, about addiction, how to cope with life and the everyday hurdles that so many of us struggle with and have met some incredible people along the way. Good sponsorship, working the steps and attending meetings has been my recipe to sobriety. Life isn’t always sunshine and rainbows, but if you put in the work, your life will start to become a little easier each day that passes. 

My sponsor and I have had a pretty good relationship. When I first asked him to sponsor me, we would talk 3-5 times a week and go to a couple meetings together. I know that isn't typical (usually people talk to their sponsors every day), especially for someone coming directly out of treatment but we decided that what we were doing was working. Fast forward, since this whole covid thing started, we have maybe connected a handful of times at max, me always initiating the conversation. I know this is selfish thinking on my part, but I didn't even here from him on my 1 year birthday, no text, no call, no nothing which I thought was weird. He could be struggling with things on his side but when we would connect, everything seemed fine on his side, just busy with work/kids/wife/life. At this point, I am not sure what to do. Should I start looking for a new sponsor, though I have been through almost all 12 steps, I am willing to rework the step if I need to, but I have been very thorough on the steps I have worked. Any advice on this? From people who have been through this before?

If you are struggling or know someone who is, please reach out to someone for help. This is a game of life vs death, which side will you be on?

I have been a problem drinker for the last 7-8 years or so (if not more).  My main problem has always been that if I start, I can't stop.  So I don't start.  I'm married to someone that doesn't really drink beyond a couple beers socially and I have had 2 kids in the last four years, which has helped.  Never had a problem not drinking during pregnancy and we don't keep booze at our house. Things were pretty under control.  But bring on 2020.

I had a baby at the end of 2019 and came back from maternity leave in February. My dad died a week later unexpectedly from a fall and then complications in the hospital.  

I've been running our family business for the last 8 years--my dad's business.   I used to just come in and out to monitor things, take care of problems, do payroll, etc-- going out to lunch, hitting Target-- leisurely to be honest.  The business really ran itself and made a lot of money.  His death put the whole thing on me with a 3 month old and 3 year old. Then a month later, we had to shut down due to Covid-19 and all our customers being closed.  My husband lost his job and has stayed home with the kids due to closed daycare.  The financial responsibility of taking care of my family, my mom, and our employees is now squarely on my shoulders. Spent weeks in March getting the PPP but that has run out.  Been working more than I ever have.

Now I'm in the office alone all day.  And I started drinking.  A couple cans of wine at first. Then whiskey.  First it was just in the afternoon every few days, but now it is every day.  I often get it on the way to work.  I don't really have much to do up here at this point except that I need to be here as the boss with so much uncertainty. I'm bored. I'm drinking a couple half pints a day.  Every day is all about the alcohol and hiding it--trying to sober up before I go home to cook dinner and put my kids to bed.  I have to write everything down because I don't remember so many things from the day before. I don't drink on the weekends when I'm not working and am fine because I'm busy at home with my family.  No withdrawal.  But come Monday morning, I get bored and hit the liquor store again.

I've been lucky so far, but people have to be noticing now that my employees are working a few days a week.  I have a high tolerance so I'm not acting drunk, but there must be some suspicion.  I don't act like myself at home because I'm ""trying to act normal."" I know I should tell my husband.  It wouldn't be a shock, but I am so ashamed.  He is so strong and would support me but it makes me feel so weak that I keep doing this.

Yesterday, I was unpacking a tightly wrapped package at work and pulled on it so hard that I punched myself in the face and had to go get some stitches in my lip because I hit myself so hard.  I don't think I would have done this sober.  It is a wake up call to get my shit under control.  

My marriage and children are everything.  So is this business, but I'm going to fuck it all up if I keep going this way.  It's only been a few months of this behavior and I just want to stop and get back to normal/healthy.  But I feel so stressed and anxious, which I am treating with alcohol which is making me feel so stressed and anxious.

I barely see them, my family, and have lost almost all of my friends by being a drunk reclusive selfish asshole. I cannot even comprehend how much damage I have caused my kids and family and friends. 

I started a very successful business with a couple of friends startup money 5 years ago and was fired from my own position of GM/Owner by the other owners after 3 years. We were still very profitable and had employed 40 people at the time of my termination. They are doing fine with my replacement.

 At the time I was drinking a fifth a day, and 4-5 beers and making all the poor choices that come with. I spiraled pretty hard after that and the next 6 months was extremely dark. During a really bad stretch only leaving my bed to get whisky and beer across the street, or answer the door for delivery food. My apartment looked like....well you can probably imagine. I squandered all of my savings, sat in an apartment that had utilities shut off and got evicted. Had to move into a random persons basement and started working at a job I hated and basically stayed some sort of stone drunk up until January this year. 

I missed my best friends wedding in which I was supposed to be the best man, missed my kids birthdays. Lied and said I was working to not face my family through the holidays. Got a DUI that somehow I had thwarted for the past 8 years.

Then went sober for almost 2 weeks, honestly do not know how I did it but I did. It changed my mindset, even if it did not end with me staying sober. I relapsed again a few months ago and while its nowhere near the the levels of drinking I had been doing it has to stop for good. I do not know where to go, but this seems like my first step. 

Every single morning. I mean EVERY morning for 4 years now, I have woken up and said thats it, I am done drinking. However every night ends with an empty bottle, and several empty beer bottles next to the bed. Ive spent more on drinking the past 5 years then I have on rent and groceries. 

Im worried about my physical health. Family on both sides have extreme alcoholism amongst all 4 sides of extended family, and I feel doomed. I have a TON of dreams and aspirations for my self and my kids, but without health insurance, having zero money, terrible credit, and a ton of debt...well I feel fucked frankly.  Rock. Bottom. Hurts.",1

Last night I had a dream that I was barely conscious and having to explain myself for all the horrible drunk texts I sent out to people I hadn't talked to in months. The worst part was, I was still drunk in my dream so I felt I had to justify and double down on my drunken behavior. It felt so dirty and out of control and I could feel the eyes of judgment and disappointment from those around me. Ugh. What a gross feeling.

Happy to say that today will make 2 weeks without alcohol and while my life isn't instantly perfect, it's a lot easier to face myself in the mirror every day. Also, I used to be so sore after working or just living, so I'd use alcohol as an excuse to take the pain away after ""a long day"" but I always woke up feeling worse. I'm happy to notice that I don't wake up sore, sick or full of regret anymore. Life is definitely getting better now that alcohol doesn't control my reality.",7

In the past month, I tried to hit the brakes and twice in the first two weeks went right back to daily drinks.

The third effort has stuck and now I'm at 10 days.  I replaced evening drinking with evening running and weight lifting and that seems to have helped a lot.  I needed a replacement activity during that specific time of the day.

I have realized that when I get home, I only have to make it from 5pm to 9ish without drinking.  Once I'm at 9pm, it is basically too late to start having a drink.  I have been breaking those times down into trying to make it hour by hour on days with cravings, Friday was the hardest.

I will say I wasted a huge amount of hours in a foggy state over the past few years.  I'm typically awake 16 hours a day and was drinking 5pm to 9pm - 4 hours of 16 awake - 25% of my life!  I work 9 ish hours a day so am home for 7 hours not counting sleep.  4/7 means 57% of the time I was awake at home during the week was spent drinking.  Ridiculous stats!

I am now starting to feel like I can tell a difference from the lack of alcohol with a little more energy.  An issue is brewing though, my brain seems to be swirling around all I have to do in the evening and when trying to go to bed which is actually making it harder to sleep.  Sometimes I almost feel like I was drinking to slow myself down as my natural state is one of constant and rapid focused thought.  It was almost like I was trying to get a break from the waterfall of thought.  I may need to figure out a better way to wind down my thoughts when going to bed  (suggestions welcome).

I know this will be healthier for me so I'm sticking with it.  I am thinking a hard no drinks for 60 to 90 days to fully realize the benefits and hopefully have a very different relationship with alcohol after that.  It is in the back of mind that it might be better to just fully stay away from alcohol permanently, but I'm not at that point yet.",2

Had a few relapses last summer, and I've been sober since August 25th about 5 years of heavy daily drinking.

I've always known that I was drinking to avoid dealing with my mental health issues, and every time something triggers my anxiety my first instinct is still to drink. I've been telling myself that if I keep pushing through for long enough I'll eventually get better, but that's what I tried to do last summer and that's why I relapsed before. 

My anxiety has been getting worse again and I'm thinking about drinking more often now, so I'm finally getting help. I've scheduled an intake call with a local counseling center and I have an appointment on Monday with my doctor, where I'm finally going to come clean about my past drinking and my anxiety problems. 

I'm scared about what my doctor will say and I've never seen a therapist that has really worked for me, but I have to do something. I refuse to keep ignoring my problems until I relapse again because I know that's what will eventually happen. 

I'm committed to staying sober this time. And that means I need to finally address what was causing me to drink in the first place. Wish me luck!",1

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

""Comparison is the thief of joy."" I used to feel bad for all the things that wasn´t. It´s important to acknowledge and mourn one´s losses, and we need something to aspire to, but getting stuck in a cycle of envy and disappointment is not good. For me, it was a convenient and ever present excuse to drink.

I live in a diverse neighbourhood. On the higher end are Porsches and Ferraris, and in the canal are boats more expensive than my house. Cabins by the sea go for more than I can make in a lifetime.

So what? I know a couple of these folks. Some are great guys, other are great guys as well - but stuck in a cycle of ""never enough"". It doesn´t matter how sleek the car is, how big the house is, there is always bigger, better, newer, more.

Something clicked in me when realized that the best comparison I can make, is me to ...me. Am I happier this year than last year? Have I improved my skills? Am I a better friend, son, father and husband? Am I ever so slightly more saintly? And how are those tomatoes going?

By appreciating me for me, with my unique set of talents and experience, I found my spot in the world, which is just mine. Noone can fill that spot better than me. I´m not saying it is easy!, but it is definitely worth the fight.

Came home, two weeks later was in voluntary hospital detox. Opened up about it to close friends and family and suddenly it was like a magic act, everyone disappeared. A couple of friends responded when I reached out, said they had been thinking about me but didn’t know what to say. I told them I completely understood but I was still me, just trying to be a better me and the friend they initially knew and loved and asked them to just treat me like normal. They ghosted like I’d just hugged them after testing positive for covid. 

After detox, nowhere local accepted non-Medicaid insurance so I was left to my own devices. Ended up drinking again and in a deep depression due to covid lockdown. I finally got tired of it and took myself back to the outpatient treatment center I initially went to, they now take my insurance so I can have mental, addition, medical therapy and meetings.

I thought a few personal training sessions might help me feel more comfortable in the group ($60 each on top of the $135 I was already paying). Next thing I know, rumors are swirling around the gym about me going to rehab and not in a good way. So I messaged the owner and canceled my membership. She pretended to ask why. 

My family also ghosted me on Father’s Day dinner yesterday, then just sent a text “we have been seated at X restaurant.”

So yeah I feel really alone.",9

I stopped drinking at the beginning of lockdown due to the feeling that I was going to die or severely injure myself soon. Had a few bad blackouts in the months leading up to this, as I had been cutting down and didn't know my new tolerance. Fell down a flight of stairs in one of those. Was pretty worried. 

Anyways, I went two months without booze, which is the longest I've gone since I started drinking in my early teens. I felt amazing! Weight started to fall off, my skin was glowing, I had energy and everyone commented on how bright my eyes looked. My personality was on fire and I was getting back into hobbies.

Was out at a family gathering last week and a family member bought me a drink, declaring it was a ""special occasion"" and I deserved it after my incredible two months of sobriety! I ended up getting very, very wasted. I didn't do anything too stupid, just my typical stay up all night and dance to music with my headphones on. Woke up the next day with a fairly decent migraine. Two days later I still felt like crap, so I said why not make it into a cheat week and drink again. Went out, saw friends. Had a good enough time. Woke up a little hungover again.

I am super disappointed in the fact that I broke my sobriety not once, but twice, after all of my hard work. I feel like I've regressed in my recovery and that my brain and body are terrible again. Looked at myself in the mirror today and felt like I looked pallid and bloated. I don't have any motivation to do anything and feel like my personality has disappeared back into the dark corners of my mind.

Is it really possible two nights of drinking had this much of an impact on me? Will it take another two months to feel the way I felt before I had that first drink again? I could use a little encouragement to restart my recovery as I'm feeling pretty defeated and down about myself right now. I worked so hard for those two months and feel like I have to declare myself as back at day 1 again.",32

I called him EVERYTHING under the sun, any terrible word you could call someone was said (not that this helps- but it was nothing that would be triggering on the racial side of things). My sister joined in bc she was as drunk as I was. Shit show at the most rock bottom place you could imagine. The adolescent child starts recording everything on her phone. I even yelled at the guy to stop staring at my tits- I yelled this in front his child. I am so so ashamed of myself. I am mortified. Not only were there other people around but I was cussing in front of children. And I was being recorded. Today at work I couldn’t concentrate bc I was just thinking of this kid or the family posting that video on social media. I really, really fucked up. I wrote a note to the family apologizing the next day, sincerely apologizing. I wasn’t even thinking about a video being posted until I was at work thinking how amazingly shitty it would be if someone from work came across it and had to let my boss know. All I can do now is do better. But this might come back to bite me in the ass and will really be the most rock bottom I have ever been. I hope it doesn’t come down to that.

I proceeded to down about 5 pints of ipa in an hour or two. I was so drunk I worried I wouldn’t make my flight home. It was an inconsequential event but it made me realize that my drinking HAD to stop. I had been trying to cut down on booze for about a year prior. I did make my flight but I was embarrassed. I ended up googling AA that night and went to my first meeting on 12/3. I’ve been sober since. 

Today I arrived about 1.5 hrs early for my flight. I did not drink. I also decided to get some steps in and walked 3 miles (~50mim) in the small airport (Little Rock).

I’ve been on a health journey in quarantine and lost 25lbs so far! I’ve been taking weight loss one day at a time.

I drank during the week, but it was because life was so bad and I had lost so much.  I was even a big enough piece of shit to police someone else's drinking.

Here’s What I Want You To Know About Change.,"~I'm not sure who to credit with this very accurate post, the website is [here](https://www.spaliveaf.com/blog/2019/9/16/its-been-two-years-since-i-have-had-a-sip-of-alcoholnbsp-heres-what-i-want-you-to-know-about-change)

_I'm not on two years yet, but I've learnt a lot as an in- and out- patient over the last year. It only dawns on you after some serious self reflection, and it's about a mindset change._


Two. Years.  If someone would have told me two and a half years ago that I would be a non drinker  I would have laughed in their face. I am very impulsive and impatient. I have issues with follow through and I give up on things easily.  Most importantly,  I thought drinking was living.  It thought it was fun, exciting, and the thing that set me free.  

When I stopped drinking,  my original intention was to feel better physically.  All of that “living” had started to get the best of me and I had hit an emotional low.  While I definitely do feel better physically, that’s the the least exciting thing about what I’ve gained.  What I learned is that drinking was holding me back from living my life.  It took up so much mental and physical time that I didn’t have room for much of anything else.  Since eliminating alcohol from my life I have gained opportunity for growth and that growth.

If there is anything that you’re doing that is potentially holding you back from living your best life here’s what I want you to know…..

    Change is hard as shit. But do you want to know what’s harder than change? Thinking about changing and staying in the same miserable place. Nothing creates more internal turmoil than wanting to change something and doing nothing about it.  I know because I lived in that place for years.  You must step into your power and make the first teeny move. Maybe that’s committing to one small adjustment in your behavior. Maybe it’s reading and learning more on the topic. Maybe it’s talking to someone about your needs.  Regardless, without the first step, nothing is going to happen for you. No magical solution is going to arrive at your doorstep that will take away the discomfort of change. You can’t buy your way out of it or have someone else do it for you. You can’t think and hope your way to change without action.  It all comes down to YOU. There will be unknowns, uncertainties, and you will be a beginner. Just like you were at your job before you got great at that. Just like you were before you learned to drive.   And just like you were before you knew how to literally do anything that you have ever done. You will learn, it will get easier.  In the words of Amelia Earhart “The Most Effective Way To Do It Is To Do It….”

    2. There is no “right time.”  Cousin Franny’s wedding next month shouldn’t be the thing holding you back.  There will always be something.  A wedding, a trip, a conference, an event, etc.  You don’t make change by clearing your social calendar for the rest of your life and never facing a challenge.  You make change by being successful at each point along the way while gaining confidence and skills as you learn.  It won’t be easy the first few times.  That’s ok.  

    3.  Using willpower will fail you.  This might be controversial but I attempted willpower hundreds of times and failed.  I wrote a whole post on this and I still believe that it won’t work.  Using willpower isn’t changing.  It’s a method to deprive yourself of doing something that you want to do. This will be hard and you will feel cheated, sad, and you may eventually break under pressure.  Changing your mindset and developing a strong WHY is changing.  And there are tools to help that are far better than willpower.  

Now, please excuse me for a sec while I grab my megaphone…….

THIS IS YOUR LIFE FRIENDS.  This is it!  There is no promise for tomorrow! There is no right time!  There is no excuse!   There is no when I get older or if I were younger!  There is no when I have more money, time, freedom, support!  The time to start living your life is right now!  

YOU WILL FAIL!  You will make mistakes.  You will embarrass yourself.  You will have to feel feelings.  You will have to be uncomfortable for a bit.  You will have to ask for help. This is called growth and it’s exhilarating and exciting!  

YOU HAVE A PURPOSE.  You do.  Each and every one of us was born with a purpose and no matter how big or how small it may feel it has meaning and it will bring joy. But, sometimes, instead of honoring that pull or stepping into our truth we avoid it, walk around it, dabble in and out, or pretend it’s not there.  We cover it up with our history, we hide behind our trauma, we make a long list of excuses, we pour chemicals all over it, and we try really hard to resist.  This resistance is why we are unhappy.  Resisting is so much harder than just stepping into who were meant to be.  I know this from years of experience.

Find a way to quiet all of the noise and listen to yourself.  Listen to the messages and see what your heart is asking for.  You might not hear it at first but keep listening.  It will get louder and louder the more you quiet the noise of your ego, distractions, and avoidance. Once you hear it believe that you are worthy of this change.

I didn't get sloppy, but I wasn't present. And the following day I drank steadily throughout just to keep the hangover at bay. Always a mistake.

But I also know I will very likely forget how this feels and grab a couple beers. And then it will be a six pack a week later. And then a case. And back to square one. 

I know it is going to hurt me. I know I am going to be filled with regret. And yet somehow I rationalize it. I can always think of  reason to drink.  But I have everything to lose. I just can't seem to force myself to

I'll go 5-7 days sober and then binge drink wine all weekend. My anxiety and self-loathing will be through the roof and then repeat the cycle all over again. My drinking has also gotten scary... it's like when I do allow myself to drink my thirst is insatiable and I will just drink until I black out and then pass out every single time. I'm a small girl and drank a bottle of wine on Friday and Saturday. Saturday night I facetimed with a friend for 3 hours and don't remember the end of our conversation. I'm so embarrassed about what she thinks of me right now, but I am trying to not let myself think about it. I need to get out of this cycle of self-loathing I get into every time. I just keep telling myself that it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks of me. I need to feel good about myself to care enough to take care of myself.

Then the weeks. It got easier somehow as the months went by.

Then I forgot to keep count. And now it’s been nearly 2 years apparently. 

If you’d have told me at the beginning that I’d make it 600 whatever days and lose count halfway through, I’d have told you that you were insane.

I've been lurking on this sub for a few months. I don't know how to make the decision to stop drinking. I haven't gone more than 3 days without a drink in months. it's hard for me to see that my life would be significantly better without alcohol. I am able to do all the things I want and need to do and I excel at them. I am an overachiever type A person. Usually when I set my mind to something I have amazing willpower but this I can't seem to commit to. Things I see that help people don't seem to do it for me. Like look at the benefits. ""You'll function better"" I'm already high functioning. ""You'll be healthier"" whoopdie doo. That is not any kind of result I can see or feel. ""You'll get so much time back"" I already do everything I want and need to and do it all well and I don't drink and drive or drink at work, etc. I know that these may be ""excuses"" but they're excuses that work.

I seem to have the most conviction in the middle of the night, when I can't stop thinking about the lies and I feel  ashamed. In those small hours I make a pledge to myself that I will not drink today. But then the day goes on and I get home and crack one open or sneak sips from the liquor bottle. 

I'm also terrified of seeking help like AA. I live in a small town and being seen as an ""alcoholic"" could lead to me losing my job especially since I work in health and wellness. Yeah, I'm a fucking hypocite as well as a problem drinker. 

Honestly the only thing that gets at me about drinking is lying about it. I hate that part. If people would just let me be and drink and I didn't have to lie about it I honestly think I wouldn't feel bad about drinking and wouldn't try to quit. 

I know that it is not healthy obviously. And I do know that it places some limitations on me. But I don't have any big ""a-ha"" moment like a lot of people have. I haven't hit rock bottom or lost anything due to alcohol. I don't want to get to a point like that for sure. But. I don't know how to stop myself. 

I guess I'm looking for advice or support or something. I don't know how to say no to it and I don't really want to. I don't have any ""pink cloud"" thing or whatever.

My Reddit knowledge is limited. 

I (24-nonbinary) broke up with my girlfriend about a year ago when I lost control of my life. I didn’t want to, but I was a sinking ship taking everyone close down with me. 

I got clean in that year but kept drinking. Recently-ish I also stopped drinking (with a few bumps in that road). We didn’t talk at all when I was getting clean. I treated her like shit when I was spiraling and she just...supported me unconditionally. I deserved conditions. 

She sees the good in me and empathizes with my past but nobody deserves the emotional turmoil (I’d go as far as to say abuse) I put her through, however unintentional it may have been. That’s scary for me because I need to be kept accountable regardless of the “why” behind my actions.

Not too long ago, and with her permission, I sent her a letter in the mail to apologize for everything. She said she wants to give us another shot. 

I do, too. So badly. I’ve loved her since the day I met her. I’m in therapy and I think I might actually have a chance at being the partner she deserves. I’m just scared we can’t actually move past this together. There’s so much to work through and in order to be a healthy partnership I really think we need to address it all, together. I suggested we go to therapy together and she was really resistant. She has some rose colored glasses on when it comes to me and she thinks we can get through this without help. She says she doesn’t hold anything against me or have any feelings of hurt/distrust but that just doesn’t sound realistic to me given all that happened.

I live in Georgia and she goes to school here and has been thinking about relocating permanently but currently is in Massachusetts. 

Anyway. Those of you in relationships, or maybe even those of you who have rekindled relationships, any tips here? Is this even possible? I’d be happy to share more details or chat privately.",2

I’ve been told by my doctor that I have a “strong relationship” with alcohol, and I’ve made various attempts over the years to cut back or moderate or quit for a while. Some more successful than others. 

So this year, I had a pretty good run with Dry January and then some, but eventually broke my 40-day streak. And I more or less behaved myself and drank pretty moderately until this pandemic hit. I know I should give it another go, but honestly, I just don’t see the point in trying. Real life is on hold, there’s nothing really to look forward to, and a global health crisis feels like a dumb time to worry about self improvement of any kind. Why bother?? 

The other thing is that I frankly just don’t think I like myself very much when I’m sober. I have no goals or real ambitions in life and no focus. I get hellishly bored whenever I’m not drinking and would honestly rather just sleep all the time than try to do one of my stupid hobbies. 

I’ve been in therapy and really do like my therapist a lot, but it’s moved to video chat and that just isn’t the same. It doesn’t feel real or like I have to be accountable at all. Antidepressants kind of help, but I still have zero motivation. 

I probably won’t drink today. I don’t want any positive words or encouragement for this, though. I just want to know if anybody else feels this way because this all feels very fucking pointless right now.",4

This is what I was keep telling to myself and to those who helped me.

I don't know why I couldn't stay away from alcohol. When I was told I have a stupid mental disorder then I understood I had a real problem with alcohol, because I was drinking like crazy and I couldn't stop it. I was loosing everything. Especially my mind and my body.. everything I actually wanted to lose was drinking ... and I was not even try to quit.

Unluckily or not, after few months of troubles, I got pulled over while driving drunk.

They make you do blood and urine tests once in a while to get the license and the car back, it depends by the region, anyway it is a common thing here but a really bad thing for your life. 

Anyway my story is different, I didn't have to get back only my license and my car, and not only my life. I had to become a superhero:

I always have been into sports, extreme sports, study, friendship... I have a lot of friends! and a good job. I worked in different nations and I am good at it. I like life, people trust me and I travel and I can do a lot of things. I love getting up early and I love my life. I don't know what is wrong with me but alcohol shut it up. It shuts up all the noise and voices. So the difficult part was accepting I couldn't use that medicine anymore, and I was left alone with my beautiful life and my madness.

It is a year and a couple of months that I don't drink. I still cannot have my car back, I still cannot drive my motorcycle. I still suffer from depression and other stuff. I still have to pay for this mess, but after I threw away all those bad feelings and habits on first months of sobriety (waking up without remember anything, being stupid without knowing it, begin violent, smelly, sad, alone etc..) guess what.. **I am becoming a superhero**. Finally.

I am a superhero every time I wake up shine, and I wash my face without hating myself. 

I am a superhero every time I go to work without headache, when I know I have to live this day and not hoping it ends soon.

I am a superhero every time I go outside running or walking knowing I am not doing it to sweat toxins.

I am a superhero because I try to be myself, because I hope others will accept me the way I am and the way I have been.

I am a superhero because every day doesn't start from -10 points, but at least from 0, and score can only increase.

I am a superhero every time I do little things that make me live every day as it is the last one.

And every day I go to sleep with a superhero smile on my face.",11

I’ve pushed drinking only to the weekends, and having recently gotten really into Jiu jitsu I am motivated to stay sober on weekdays. 

But there’s a twist! Sure all I want to do on the weekends is drink some beer... all day long. Last week I bought a 12 pack even though I didn’t feel like drinking it, and I drank it because it was here. But I felt terrible the next day and didn’t want to get out of bed until around noon and I started again and felt even worse the next day. And I ask myself, why? I got pretty much no pleasure out of drinking that beer. My sober weeknights are much more enjoyable and I remember everything clearly. I can keep from drinking on weeknights, I’ve been proving this to myself these past weeks.

I've been lurking around this subreddit for a while. I am definitely in more of a sober-curious stage right now and I guess I'm not sure if this is the right place for me? I maybe only have 2-4 drinks a week, I'm never more than ""buzzed"" and have very mild hangovers, if any. 

However, I find that my anxiety skyrockets with alcohol lately. For example, if after work, I have a beer, I find that by the time I'm putting my kids down to bed, I am very cranky and short-tempered and sometimes get big heart palpitations or sudden increase in heart rate (for me, that's a big sign of anxiety happening). I also find that when I have a few beers at night, the next day or two I am more anxious than normal. I  hate it.

However, whenever I tell myself I am going to stop drinking for a while, I end up chickening out. Or self-sabotaging myself. I really don't drink much, so it seems that it shouldn't be so difficult.. but it is!

My mother is a raging alcoholic and it very much runs in my family. So, I believe I have just been a bit more aware of my relationship with alcohol. And while I am certainly not in any kind of rock-bottom situation, I feel as if I am still having an unhealthy relationship with alcohol.

Staying sober for 1 year was the hardest, yet most rewarding experience of my 38 years on this earth.  I was scared as hell at first.  The first few weeks were brutal.  I had been drinking like a fiend since I was 18.  I started drinking heavily my freshman year of college and it didn't take more than a few months to get totally out of control.  

Fast forward to 20 years later...I checked in every day on this sub.  I don't know any of you all personally, but I can tell you without a doubt...I wouldn't have been able to do this without you all.  I read ""This Naked Mind"", I used the I Am Sober app..It all helped tremendously.  I wouldn't have known about any of those things if it wasn't for this sub.

My wife stood by me this entire time and has offered me nothing but support.  I can never express how truly grateful I am for her love and understanding.  

There were many failed attempts over the years to quit.  I would string together maybe a week or two here and there, but would always end up getting black out sooner or later.  There was one brutal hangover and a night of blurred memories that finally did me in.  I had enough of feeling like I was loosing out on life.  I was always a highly functioning alcoholic.

I feel like I'm the father that I've always wanted to be.  I'm the husband that I've always wanted to be.  Like i said earlier, I'm not perfect.  I've got a long way to go, but I'm confident now and I have my happiness back and IM NEVER GOING TO GIVE THAT UP.

Looking at things through a sober lens, I now realize that I’ve mostly lived by the motto, “I haven’t had enough, ‘till I’ve had too much.” With work, it resulted in burn out. Exercise - injury. Everyday living - obsessive compulsive behaviour that drives those around me to distraction. And with alcohol - drink till I drop, then drink some more. Been on a path to fixing things for the past few years. Backed off work to the point I’m thinking of retiring. Knee injury has forced me to tailor my activities to things I can manage as I await surgery. COVID 19 has crammed us all together, and I’ve really tried to relax my approach to living, much to the relief of family. And finally, while I’ve stopped drinking for stretches as long as 6 months in recent years, it feels different this time around. Not as stressed. Cravings not bad (yet). If I can make it through the remaining pandemic restrictions, the temptations that summer always brings, and settle into a slower routine, maybe I can really stick to sobriety this time. Early days, but here’s hoping.....in any case IWNDWUT.",5

iwndwyt

https://www.amazon.ca/Asylum-William-Seabrook/dp/0486798100


“What I began to notice, apart from such matters, was that life was more pleasant, more tolerable, sober than it had ever been while I was drinking. It was now summer, and I was taking pleasure in many things I had ceased to care for. I was playing tennis again, better than I had for years, and was enjoying golf again though I knew I’d always be a dub at it. Furthermore I was enjoying waking up in the morning, and enjoying breakfast which I had loathed ever since I could remember.”


Some think....

“That alcohol is a narcotic, which, by depressing the higher centers, removes inhibitions, thereby producing a sense of freedom, a feeling of well-being, but obviously also rendering the drinker less ‘responsible’ and therefore constituting a danger.

“That while it may stimulate imagination, it never increases intelligence or skill, but on the contrary impairs reason, will, self-control, judgment, physical skill and endurance. 

“That it does not increase and sometimes decreases the body’s resistance to infection; that it’s therapeutic usefulness and value are slight. 

“That it is improbable that it has injured, in the long run, the quality of human stock, but that its individual effects are often devastating. 

“That, in addition to being a narcotic, it is a definite poison when absorbed in sufficient quantities which vary with the individual, producing successively excitation, incoördination, stupor, coma, death.”

“It is a relief from tension, though not a constructive help.”",5

I saw this post on my IG feed and felt like sharing it here. This resonates with me from my past drinking life, spending 20+ years drinking a bottle of wine a night and spending 20+ years of feeling like shit in the morning in denial that I felt so shitty. Because I built up a tolerance and always tried not to go more than a bottle in one night, hangovers weren’t what I had. Instead I felt like I was pulling a train around with me, in a thick fog underwater for the first half of my day, without complaining because I didn’t want anyone to know. Scorning myself feeling regretful and disgusting. By the afternoon that feeling wore off but the whole day of thoughts were planning my next bottle by early evening, telling myself, “you got this” and “I feel much better now”.",42

The topic veered to sobriety and we both mentioned that we'd quit drinking. I mentioned that I'd been sober since February, something I'm very proud of, and he was like ""wow that's it?"" Which made me feel so weak and awful. Like he was some master of sobriety because he had more under his belt. I was so angry but I kept my cool and told him that it was a rude thing to say. Any sort of inkling that I might still have feelings for him went out the window. Trying to cut me down even in my most happy moments, like he used to do. Nothing has changed.

However, I have changed. I forgave him for his mistakes and moved on. I'm not going to drink! I am proud of my accomplishments so far. I'm not going to give up! :)

I looked up alcohol dependence in DSM-IV. You have to have atleast 3 things that apply to you for the last 12 months.

These four things applied to me:

* ""Had to drink much more than you once did to get the effect you want? Or found that your usual number of drinks had much less effect than before? ""


* ""Had times when you ended up drinking more, or longer, than you intended?""


* ""Spent a lot of time drinking? Or being sick or getting over other aftereffects?""


* ""Continued to drink even though it ~~was making you feel depressed or anxious or adding to another health problem?~~ Or after having had a memory blackout?""

Now I don't drink that often. 4-5 times a month and only on weekends. But it does tend to get out of control and leave me with a bad hangover. Puking and stuff..
Even though I never intend to get really drunk. It's like I just forget once I get drunk.

And in 2018 I used to drink 3-4 times a week. And it made my anxiety much worse, and sometimes interfered with my job. But I managed to cut down. 

Also in DSM-5 four things also applied to me, which gave the result of moderate Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD).

I started drinking at 17, and I could moderate it really well back then, until 2018. 

What do I do? I don't want to give up drinking entirely.
Does it sound like I'm an alcoholic?

Edit: There are several alcoholics on my dads side of the family. Two of his siblings were alcoholics and many other of his relatives. And come to think of it, there are way less on my moms side. But two of her brothers are alcoholics.
But neither of my parents or siblings are. Does this increase my chance of becoming an alcoholic?",3

I’d intended on marrying him but I left him instead. We spoke for the first time in 3 years last month. Had lunch yesterday.,"Met a man, fell in love & moved in with him when I was 34. I left him after ten years of being together. I’d always been an occasional drinker of the binge variety but he drank every day & so did I. I became an alcoholic drinking to deal with his abuse & bc he drank every day. Our lives revolved around alcohol. He was/is very narcissistic, his way or no way, he was abusive-mostly mentally but he did break my bones once & I fell running from him breaking more but alcohol was involved both times & exactly what happened is still fuzzy. He shattered my self esteem while with him & drug my name through the mud when I left him. Photoshopped pics of me put up on Facebook, stalked me for months, the whole 9 yards. After I’d been gone for a year I still missed him so I thought I’d see him again just as friends & see how it went. It went very poorly. As always alcohol & his ego had a lot to do with that, he was desperate for me to get back with him. He’d be mean & send me flowers. My house started to look like a funeral parlor bc so many flowers...  So I blocked him from my phone and FB and even moved away (again) where he couldn’t find me. 

After 3 years of not speaking or seeing each other at all, except twice in the store where he just glared at me, a mutual friend said he’d like to catch up. I miss his friendship & someone who knows me so well. It wasn’t all bad, there is a pandemic & life is short so I called him. We talked a long time but I could tell he wasn’t completely over us like I am. Was very glad he didn’t text me until 3 days later. We’ve texted off & on since & he asked if we could go somewhere for beers. I’d told him I quit drinking but figured I can catch up just fine without a beer so I met him yesterday. He had high octane beers & I ordered sweet tea. We talked, was a nice time. At some point he said, so you quit drinking completely-not even beer? Yep. Did that & happy about it. He said he only drank beer now, no hard stuff. Not sure I believe that but neither here nor there. It wasn’t hard at all to abstain & he didn’t get drunk. I don’t know why I’m posting this but it was just a strange & I wanted to tell someone. Can’t tell my Mother (she would freak) & can only tell one friend I trust & she’s outta town. I wish he was always the nice guy he was yesterday & even tho I hear he has changed after have triple bypass surgery & almost dying, I just can’t go back there. It’s just sad bc we have such a history & it’s hard. I invested so much in our relationship. I feel like he def still loves (wrong word perhaps) me & would love for me to be with him again but only bc he’s older & needs someone to care for him. Everything has always been about him.. It’s just very strange. He did seem different & more caring/kind but I know what he does behind closed doors no matter how much he speaks of his new battery powered ticker bringing about his metamorphosis. Yeah, he’s a little weird. Lol. Guess I will just continue trying to be just his friend & we’ll see how that works out this time. Will only meet him in neutral places if he’d like to go out again. I miss his friendship & his humor but not all the rest. Sorry for the long post but thx for reading if you did. I’m pleased to report that I did not even want a beer. Been sober over a year & don’t ever want to go back there! I like my life now. IWNDWYT.",19

(My perspective as a young person),"I was never an alcoholic but would often drink to excess when I did and had a few phases where I might drink 3-4 nights a week for a few weeks often by myself. I have a healthy appreciation now of how easy it is to let it get out of hand.

I didn't have a super hard time quitting it and have seen a lot of benefits in baseline happiness, confidence, and feeling content with life.

Though my main issue when originally quitting and now entering my mind again now is the social aspect. I am only 19 and have constructed a dichotomy in my mind between an ordered, disciplined lifestyle and a more chaotic, almost hedonistic lifestyle. I am grateful for following the path of discipline (no alcohol/drugs, no masturbation/porn, no artificial pleasure, strong routine) and pursuing genuine satisfaction. But I can't help but feel like I am missing out on fully experiencing my youth. I feel like I am potentially missing out on those little chance encounters and building stronger connections with people because I am becoming ""boring"" and don't have opportunities to meet people. I read stories on Reddit and did sometimes experience things like running into an old acquaintance at a nightclub and the whole chain of events that can lead on from that or just crazy and memorable stories that can arise in the context of alcohol/drugs. I am imagining being more care-free and spontaneous, just living a more colourful life when I don't hold myself to these strict rules restricting pleasure. I want to be able to have deep conversations in the early morning after leaving the bar or just spontaneously drive to the beach and watch the sunset on cannabis with people I've just met. I just feel it's easier to build stronger connections (though perhaps less genuine) with people when your inhibitions are lowered and you are both experiencing the same feeling.

I just really don't know how to reconcile these two goals in my life. I am very grateful for the sheer clarity of mind that long periods of sobriety brings, I feel so much sharper and more stable, but I just don't want to let this phase of my life pass me by.

Any advice and perspective from older folks or anyone around my age on how you're able to still feel like your not missing out on anything while following this path would be greatly appreciated.",4

I think I'm going to need a little backup.,"This morning I woke up after drinking 19 IPAs with a reasonably manageable hangover and realized that today needs to be my new Day 1. I have tried cutting alcohol out of my life in the past but have always done so silently, and without any form of supplemental support. I've lurked on this sub for years and it finally feels like it's my turn to post.

My father drank himself to death five years ago and I know that I'll end up there too if I don't make a significant change.

Like a lot of you, I suffer from terrible depression and anxiety. Alcohol is my primary coping mechanism and I know that it's making things worse. 

I primarily drink to manage stress and anxiety in my work/personal life (which by virtue of what I do for a living are the same thing). I work in entertainment and production. Part of my issue is that drinking is a totally acceptable and often encouraged part of my work life. All of my business partners are also flagrant alcoholics. 

Alcohol has ruined and continues to ruin everything in my life and I don't want to live like this anymore.

I am choosing to stop drinking today for the third time in two years. The last two attempts were unsuccessful and I feel like I need a support system if I want any hope of seeing this through. 

That's all I got. Throwaway for obvious reasons. IWNDWYT. I have no idea what that means for tomorrow, but I'd like to find out.",121

The reason why? The illusion of a better life with alcohol is completely gone for me. Before that happened I had kind of toyed with the idea that i would be “missing out” if i gave up fully. I now see what a load of BS that is. 

The past few weeks i have been so so happy. I have trained well and begun the process of regaining my fitness. I have been happy every day, i have had more energy and i have enjoyed and embraced life fitness work and relationships. 

On Saturday that changed. I chose alcohol above those things. I drank, lounged around, eat poor quality junk, and had conversations I cant remember. This is then followed by the hellish Sunday where i slept most of the day and when i was awake was grumpy and tired. With zero motivation. I can now see how counter productive this is. 

The reason I am happy is I how have a reference point for life without and i can build on that. I now can see what my life can be if I don’t drink and it is one million times better. That gives me so much hope as i can genuinely see that. I have had an amazing few weeks and i can now build on it again.  

For those still struggling in the face of things. Give yourself a few weeks and throw yourself into it. I have trained 6 times a week and trained hard. The buzz it gives me in immense. Whatever you were passionate about before try and throw yourself into it. 

Seeing what life could be (on both sides of the coin) gives me so much confidence going forward alcohol free. It truly is better, i am not giving anything up or loosing out in any way.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

One key to my sobriety is mindfulness. I used to think mindfulness was a full spiritual yoga exercise kind of thing, but it certainly doesn´t have to be.

I began my mindfulness practice by handmaking coffee. Smelling the roasted beans, feeling the vibration of the grinder, hearing the trickle of the cool water, and then the bubbling, the rising heat, the aroma, the complexity of flavors - and everything was just for me.

It did not exist to please anyone, or to produce, or be admired, for that matter - it was just for me. That´s self love right there.

Being present in my mind, my senses, my body and my surroundings helped me control my anxiety. It helped me avert cravings, to heal, and to appreciate other sensations than the numbing road to oblivion that I used to long for. Even pain is better than numbness; it shows you something that needs attention.

I wish for all of you to experience one gentle, encouraging, surprising or simply unusual sensation today. I will not drink with you today!",120

Even a heart attack didn't stop me. Then last Monday I decided I wouldn't drink any more. I'd been listening to lots of podcasts and reading posts in this sub a lot. And my migraines had got much worse. So I decided that I wouldn't drink again.

 I can't believe the difference it's already made. For a start I haven't had a migraine (and would usually have had at least one in a week) and I'm sleeping like a normal person - I haven't slept a night through for years. I have loads more energy and my mood is better - I have suffered from depression my whole adult life and though it's always been controlled well by drugs it had got much worse. I'm doing my hobbies properly again. I haven't felt a craving yet, though I know they will come. 

I now understand what those of you who've stopped mean when you say it's life-changing and you won't regret it. I haven't been tested yet as we're still pretty much in lockdown in the UK so I haven't been to a party or family occasion where there's drink, but every day my resolve gets stronger so I hope I'll be able to resist temptation when it rears its ugly, bloated red face.

I don't think I'd have had the courage to stop completely without this sub. You are all amazing. I'm toasting you (with coffee!) and here's to all of us living the lives we deserve.",15

I no longer live with him or see him and his addiction ruined our family. This has made me fearful of developing a serious alcohol problem. It’s in my genes.

I’m only 17 and I think I may deal with some sort of depression. I’m never happy. Im always sad. I’m always anxious. I’m always thinking too much and over worrying. I’m always self conscious.

All of this goes away when I drink.

I feel confident in myself. I feel happy. I feel care free. I don’t worry when I’m drunk. I’m not sad when I’m drunk. I can talk openly and think clearly. I feel more like myself when I’m drunk than when I’m sober.

I don’t drink too often. Maybe a few times a month. Though at one point I was drinking with my buddy of mine every night for a span of a couple of weeks. We realized we were drinking too much and coming down.

I don’t think I’m alcoholic. I only drink when I’m with friends and it’s occasional for the most part. I’m just worried about developing an addiction like my dead beat father. 

I don’t even really know the point to this post. I’m just sad and tired of everything. If I could be drunk all the time with no consequences I would be. I kicked my nicotine addiction, so that’s good at least I guess. I just don’t want to feel this way anymore. I can’t get therapy because of covid and because we’re broke. I just want help and I don’t want to be an alcoholic. I’m lost and don’t know what to do.",4

2020-06-22 01:16:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hdlwqk/9_months/,9 MONTHS,"I’m standing at my stove eating a decadent, toasted peanut butter and jelly sandwich at midnight, breaking my intermittent fast to fully allow myself this experience of absolute joy. I did it. I’ve gone the longest I’ve ever gone in 15 years. 

For anyone who needs encouragement, I can tell you with 100% certainty that it is worth it. The first couple of months are the hardest. Afterwards there will be still be tough days. Hell, lately, every day feels like a tough day what with the state of the world, but I KNOW I am way better off sober during these dark days. Navigating through these times in a drunken fog or a post-drunk anxiety would be so terribly inconvenient and my heart goes out to anyone who is currently experiencing that. 

Now instead of screaming into a pillow, taking frequent naps or eating whatever I want to fight off a craving (very necessary actions for me in the beginning), I can just acknowledge the craving’s presence and ride out the wave... and then it’s over. IT DOES GET EASIER, but triggers will always be around.

2020-06-22 01:04:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hdlq8a/acts_of_kindness_aok_monday_the_gifts_of_sobriety/,Acts of Kindness (AoK) Monday - The Gifts Of Sobriety,"Hi everyone!

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we check in about any AoK that we have participated in, received, witnessed, or heard about during the week which have touched us in some way. It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game.

I received an AoK this week from a friend who I haven't seen in person since March. We hung out, and she had a gift bag for me, which I didn't expect. It was a housewarming gift, with a cool card that she'd made, and she'd used rainbow foil wrapping paper and glitter tape to wrap up three different packages of 'My Neighbor Totoro' puffy stickers, which is a movie that we both love. 

I was so touched by her thoughtfulness and the care that she put into it. It means a lot to me that she wanted to celebrate my new house with me. She's the first friend that I made when I got sober, and it feels good to realize that in sobriety I'm building friendships and shared history with people who are kind to me and who support me in what I'm doing.

My AoK this week has been for my local AA community. The Alano club that I frequent is transitioning back to doing some in person, limited capacity meetings. They haven't been able to get in touch with all of the people who were chairing meetings before the club closed for the duration of our state's shelter in place orders, so there aren't enough people ready to go to start chairing the meetings again. And the meetings aren't happening as frequently as they were before, so the club needs to be opened up and closed down several times a day.

I chaired a meeting there for over a year and showed up consistently and didn't burn the place down, so I got a set of keys from one of the board members and I'm opening up the club and chairing two meetings a week until things get back to an established rhythm. It involves wiping down all the chairs, the desk, the laminated reading materials, and the bathroom surfaces before and after the meeting, and making sure that people attending the meetings are wearing masks and keeping the chairs in their designated positions.

It feels really good to be back attending live meetings again, and it feels good to be able to provide a few for other people who need them. I know that AA isn't for everyone who quits drinking, but it's been an important part of my recovery, and I've missed the fellowship and connection of live meetings. It sucks to not be able to hug people I know when I see them, but I'm so grateful that this is an option again. I'm also grateful that I have the opportunity to be useful and to be of service. The shutdown has been hard on a lot of people, and it feels good to be a part of something that provides support for other people in recovery.

(I still have the key to a church where I was making the coffee before the meeting when this all started. It is a weird side effect of sobriety that I'm now entrusted to carry the keys to random buildings around. And I'm actually really confident that I'm not going to lose them, I haven't lost a set of keys since I quit drinking.)

Anyway, that's me for this week. How's everyone else doing, any AoK that you'd like to share?",14

A Wasted Guy Broke My Arm,"Just came off a multi-day river trip, my first since going AF. Back in my drinking days, I was game for put-in beers, all day day-drinking, and boozy camps. With COVID, we did things differently and took precautions, but we had a mixed group with some wild cards. I am happy to say that I wasn’t tempted to drink at all. But fuck. This group came ready to go hard. And go hard they did.

I loved being sober on the river. I got to be present and I forged a couple of new friendships and deepened an existing one. My boat was really fun and we caught fish, hiked out of camp, and kept our setup tight and clean. 

Where it got tricky was in dealing with some of our party members. Two guys had a complete inability to hold their shit together and were blackout on multiple occasions. On day 2, we broke camp hours behind schedule because an older guy was too hungover to get up (super annoying) and was being a dick about it, so my boat bailed. I found out later he’d actually fallen in the fire the night before (mostly unscathed because it was raining) and destroyed our tarp system with a bowie knife for no reason other than being too drunk. Another night, we were the only boat out of six to clean up our program and put our shit away, which is mandatory because of a significant bear problem along the river. And lastly, on the last night a younger guy drank so much that he couldn’t talk, fell down multiple times, and was inappropriate with a woman (she HANDLED it but no woman should ever be put in that position). All before it got dark. A few of us tried to slow down his consumption which didn’t work. Finally, I had to physically grab his shirt and belt and wrestle him down into the dirt to prevent him from face planting in the huge, hot fire. He is a big man and I’m a medium sized woman and in the process, I fractured a bone in my arm and now may be facing surgery. It would have been massively worse for him if I hadn’t been able to grab him. 

The next morning, it was like nothing had happened. No acknowledgement. No apology. He just kept cracking beers before we broke camp.

I am a month out from my three year sobriety mark. I am grateful that I could make the choice and do the work that got me to this point. I am relieved that I am able to address my own shitty relationship with alcohol, even if it sucks sometimes. And even though I’m physically hurt and emotionally angry, I still feel sorry for these two guys. I hope they can figure out what help they need and how to help themselves. 

And no. I will never do another trip with those two ever again.

In a short summary; my father was an alcoholic that marked my childhood. My mother always remarked it. I'm now with my best friend, I love him to the end of the world, and yet I often drink in the evenings now. To relax, to sleep, to feel like I'm not 'caged' by the limits I set for myself due to my upbringing. One day he took me to the hospital because he was worried since I had far too much - this is the first time I didn't remember anything. I was ashamed. I was also thankful. I've cut down by a lot since that, but I'm not the kind of person to go for a ""cold turkey"" as they call it here. I just love finding poetry or music that can describe how I feel, because I tend to suck at it... ",6

One thing I’ve noticed is that I pee A LOT more than I used to, like between 10 and 15 times a day. I’m wondering if this is my liver and kidneys just operating normally now that they don’t have to process all the booze constantly. Is this common? Should I be worried?

Everything seems fine, no pain or any other negative aspects other than the increased frequency. I’ve increased my water intake and I also drink quite a bit of coffee and green tea.

My (26M) boyfriend was done with me and broke up with me because of my drinking. i ended up quitting because of my own spiritual rock bottom a month later but also with the goal to get him back as we had begun talking again but he couldn’t be serious with me again while I was drinking. After I was sober a month we became serious again.

Fast forward to now. Quarantine has been hard on me and I’ve been dry drunk and just so unhappy and it was bleeding into our relationship. We were about to sign a lease together for September and he got cold feet and realized he was codependent on me and just with me for familiarity and still has resentments for things I said when drinking . The week before this he told me I was the love of his life, his rock, he couldn’t imagine life without me. I wasn’t too happy in general and was kind of just going by the motions in the relationship. He broke up with me and said if were meant to be together we will be.

I’m worried. I feel addicted to him and I have only ever been sober with him and I feel like he made me find sobriety.  I do love him and we had some amazing times. I obsess over if he’ll come back as he had dumped me twice before three years ago and two years ago. I don’t know how to navigate being sober and single as I felt like I made him my higher power sometimes. My emotions are all over the place as I used to drown them out with booze.

I lost my job and had a liquor store right across from my house. It was very, very tempting; especially being depressed from being laid off from work, losing a couple friends to overdosing and not being able to see these tough times through. But I had to keep pushing on!

I'm happy to say that I am back to working full time in a restaurant that has a very positive work force; I moved out of a very toxic household and have been generally happier these last couple weeks.

Not really sure where I'm going with this, but I'm happy to say I'm genuinely happy and don't need a bottle to trick me into thinking that way.

Everyone here at SD is part of how I have managed to stay the course. I still get the odd whisper from the booze goblin saying stuff like ""Ok, you can have *just one* now, you're fine"" and I KNOW that goblin is fulla shite. Because in my head even 900 days down ""Just one"" means ""just one bottle of wine in one go"" or ""Just one big glass containing eight standard nips of scotch"". I know because that's what I see in my head when I stare that idea of *just one* in the beadies.

For anyone still in their early days I just want to say, no matter how tough it feels, no matter how much you flounder or feel like it's not worth it - it is. Just keep that first drink OUTSIDE of your gullet and you got this. Just that one drink is all you have to turn down. Don't have the first drink, and you won't have all the drinks. And that's what I remind myself.

In the past 900 days I have managed to get my physical health back on track, go to bed every night recalling exactly what I did that day, wake up without feeling like something died in my mouth, start a science degree part-time [and doing pretty good marks-wise], cut a whole bunch of dickheads out of my life, give my dog regular walks, be fully present for my kid, enjoy reading books again, navigate the economic crash without wasting money on booze [things are tight enough without that added expense, amiright?], start growing some vegies, lose the bloat [back to one chin again, woot!] and have one thing I'm really proud of achieving to hold onto even during some really tough times - the fact I still am not drinking again.

2020-06-21 19:38:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hdh2bv/i_think_i_hit_rock_bottom_today/,I think I hit rock bottom today.,"I've been drinking regularly since I turned 21, so for basically an entire decade. Not an ""alcoholic"" so much as a weekend binge drinker. Of course that's still alcoholism, but I guess my point is I'm not someone who relies on it every day or has a physical dependence... But once I start I usually can't stop, and I love the feeling and euphoria of getting hammered. 

Last night I drank half a bottle of vodka, which typically is enough to get me drunk but not shit faced. I can still function fine the next day with just some brain fog. I knew I had a family dinner to attend today, so I figured I would switch to medical marijuana before bed and wake up feeling good. 

Well, I guess mixing the two ended up giving me what they call a ""crossfade."" it hit me really hard. I remember feeling like I had drank twice as much as I did. I passed out on my sofa without a pillow (don't remember doing so!) and had a terrible stiff neck when I woke up. I went back to bed until noon and slept almost 12hrs total. All afternoon I had this weird brain fog and spaced out feeling like I had drank way more than I actually had.

Then, right around 5pm, an hour before the dinner, I start getting horrible motion sickness and nausea. I NEVER get nausea from drinking (even when I black out) but again, I guess the marijuana threw my brain for a loop. It was awful. I kept alternating between being dizzy and feeling like I needed to vomit. 

So, long story short - I had to text my mom to let her know I wouldn't be able to make it, because I didn't feel comfortable driving or trying to socialize in such condition. I really wanted to just force myself to go, but every time I tried to get dressed I'd get waves of nausea. 

It was a dinner for my 80 year old grandfather to celebrate Father's Day and my younger sister drove in from out of town for it. I feel awful. I'm upset at myself for disappointing them and upset for allowing it to happen in the first place.

I wish I could bottle this moment and return to it any time I'm tempted to drink. I just feel like this is the point where I can no longer kid myself that ""unwinding on the weekend"" isn't impacting other people.",17

I felt left out and unloved. Friday I went for a hard bike and kicked my own ass. Saturday I did some home improvement projects and around 9 I started to think about going to buy a bottle. I didn’t, but I thought about it for longer than I would’ve liked. 
Today my family comes home and my wife is complaining about how poorly behaved our kids were the whole time they were away. Both kids have legitimate ADHD diagnosis and one is autistic. 
The hardest part for me is this stupid idea that today is “my day” because it’s Father’s Day. I am mad at myself for getting sucked into Father’s Day bullshit and allowing it to pile on to my feelings of not being loved. I want to scream and run away, but I can’t because I do bedtime every night with the kids.

I'd been living in colorado and working everyday, just to come home and drink myself to sleep. I moved back to my hometown in kentucky on a whim. I saw my friends for 3 weeks before coming home to see my dad, and believe me, I was drunk every day. We went backpacking in North Carolina for a week, and I drank every day there too. I realized that the misery I get from being hungover and during the day and just wanting that next drink was no longer worth dealing with, so I've been holed up in my dad's apartment sobering up for the last 3 days by myself (he's seeing his girlfriend in another city that's far away). I've been dealing with these really bad bouts of depression where I feel suicidal and other really bad ones of anxiety where I feel like I'm going crazy. I also have fatigue during the days and don't sleep for too long (5-6 hours of sleep at best) at night.

This is a moment I've been mentally preparing for all weekend because this *used* to be the moment I would uncork the bottle of wine I had stashed, or pour myself a mixed drink from a bottle whose contents wouldn't be missed. I even used to wish that he would ""just go to work already!!!"" Or think ""why can't he be working tonight so I can get plastered in peace?"" 

But tonight its just me and the dog and a seltzer water. I have a home improvement project that I had to leave partway done just now. I have a phone call with my Dad a little later that I definitely won't skip, because he deserves to hear ""Happy Father's Day."" I have a virtual game night with friends over zoom that I may beg off so that I can sit in peace and just be with myself. 

And I'm fine with just sitting here and doing nothing the rest of the evening (minus the phone call with Dad -- that's not getting skipped). I have no guilt about the mess from my project, and my friends will forgive me if I bail on game night. The important thing is that I am here, not drinking, and feeling actually pretty OK with that. 

It was just a stupid craving anyway, all predicated on my fiancé leaving for work. A mental tic. But I'm not giving into it, because I want him to look forward to coming home. And sure enough, just by writing this out, and its already fading.

I got drunk at a bar once and (TW: assault), blacked out, and let a guy take advantage of me ... I've lost friendships and just yesterday, after I told my dad that I would ""cool it"" with the drinking, hung out with some friends and got obliterated... again. I just can't fucking control myself and am always the drunkest one in the room. I've never fully admitted this to anyone in my life, not even my therapist but I have an alcohol abuse problem and I need to cut it the fuck out.

I hate myself. I hate myself so much for making it to this point. I hate myself more and more with each passing incident and I'm done. I'm only in my early 20's, too. I just feel like a worthless piece of garbage, a shit-stain on every relationship I have. I'm not trying to get sympathy, nor do I think that would be beneficial.

I'm home now and I still have energy to tidy the kitchen and tackle some work projects that have been going ignored. It's amazing! I still think about drinking many times a day and occasionally get overwhelmed by stress but overall my days are feeling stable and positive. 

All this only 8 days after my last post here!! I can't believe it. If I had just quit drinking years ago my life would be in a much better place now. I had no idea that only a few short weeks (total) of sobriety would be enough to start feeling in control of myself again

Of dating my mom likes to say ""some people are eye candy and some people are soul food"". I love this metaphor.

I received a few ""signs"" this morning that felt like reminders to be vigilant of returning to a toxic attachment. I'm especially vulnerable to this person in early sobriety because I am feeling extra tender.

Charms / looks / reputation aside, this person gives me a bad gut feeling. With a clear, sober mind and lots of time to reflect, I'm learning to TRUST my feelings. True, I'm a bit of a fuck up...but that doesn't mean I'm incapable of discernment. I feel this dude is bad news bears. So I will be flipping him the peace sign, ASAP.

I spend a lot of energy making sure everything I use or consume is non-toxic, organic, etc. And then I let people in who are VERY bad for my health!!! No bueno.

Of course that's not to say he's all bad and I'm perfect. I've been learning about love addiction and it's resonating bigtime. Like alcohol, he's simply not a healthy choice for me.
 
Feeling determined to build an intentional circle of support around this new version 2.0 of me and this includes romantic attachments. Historically I have not been great at choosing them. I'm learning and wising up a little more with each attempt.

I normally lurk and leave the odd comment on other peoples posts, but I thought I'd start by asking a question that's been on my mind for the last couple of weeks.

I tell myself that there's nothing good about alcohol, and for the most part that's true. I haven't drank for nearly 3 weeks now (usually 6 days a week, 4/5 beers in the evenings), and I do feel a lot healthier. I've been slowly reassessing my relationship with alcohol for the last 12 months and I do want to stop. I also understand that moderation cannot work for me. 

I can deal with the daily cravings, but I'm struggling with one particular lingering thought. I really miss the crazy anarchy of drinking with a group of friends. I really enjoy the unhinged atmosphere where anything goes. I don't want to give that up. I'm not necessarily hanging on to alcohol for it, but for me the two have always come hand in hand.

Part of me wants to toss/donate it. Part of me wants to keep it, for fear that if it’s not here I will feel like it’s been taken from me and that’s when I’ll relapse. Part of me wants to do some ceremonial smashing/breaking.

My dad was an alcoholic. Once he wrote me a letter from a hospital where he went for rehab. It was a long one, several pages. The gist of it was don't start. I was 15-ish then and it helped me stay off until I was 24. 

I started drinking at the age when you are a bit smarter, have more money in your wallet and more sensible company. I never binged, my attraction to alcohol had a mild gastronomic quality. Still by the time I was 38 it had developed a lot. I wasn't drinking too much, but rarely had a few days sober. I noticed that all my leisure activities were tied to alcohol. My hobby was blogging about cocktails and ordering rare spirits from all over the world. 

Then a friend read my blog and texted me ""you have a problem"". Nothing elaborate, just these words. It hit me hard, I brooded a day or two and then decided to quit. That was a year ago. It was hard for the first two months - a lot of triggers, angedonia and overall feeling of misery. Slowly it receded and with each passing social occasion it became easier - once you spent Christmas sober you know you can do it, once you go on vacation sober - you can repeat it. Same with business trips, dinners, friends visiting. 

My thanks go to this community. It helps to know there are people going through the same cycle, it gives do much hope and strength.

My tolerance is way higher than it used to be. I used to only need 1-2 beers to get tipsy. But now I need like 4 beers. 

Last night I was lying in my bed puking in a bag, because I got wasted the day before.

This is not how I wanna spend my life. Should I try to go back to drinking in moderation. Maybe only drinking 2-3 beers instead of taking shots? Or should I just quit altogether?
Also does this sound like alcoholism, or just that I need to be more disciplined?

I actually fracking did it! I'm posting the story i wrote about the day I quit for good. (wrote it while withdrawing),"The night I stopped

The night I stopped was within the first week of being in our new house. A lovely 4 bedroom mansion (to us), with a tin roof overlooking a porch perfectly suited for rainy days.

My wife, myself, and our puppy were lounging on the couch in the living room (TV room) staring at the screen. On either side of the television there were two full wall length windows beautifully cascading down from the ceiling, which was snaked in thick black wires having just been set up.

I looked at those beautiful windows through a fog of alcohol and thought about string theory. How any decision I made now would create new strings of time in which I could travel. I thought about how many other times I'd been faced with such a moment, and the role alcohol has played in each of them. The soothing numb grey cloud of spirits wrapped tightly about my body, dragging me down a path that, without its influence, I would not have chosen.

I looked at those windows and thought about how lovely they would look festooned with Christmas lights and garland. How they would provide the perfect atmospheric lighting for some far away Christmas party I would someday throw. Picture me, Mr. Fozziwig, having all my employees and compatriots flowing through the Halls of my house with lifted spirits in joyous exaltation. The home positively bursting with kinship and kindness.

Then I looked at those windows again as they were, and how they would remain save for effort on my part. They hung like sunken ghosts of what they could be. A simple white blind hung at an angle. Bookended with splintered wood amassed with haphazard white paint coagulating each corner. A bare wood floor between them, and yes, the horrid snaking of wires and cables unabashedly slithering across the hardwood floor and up the entertainment center.

It was in the view and thought of this that, for the first time that night, a voice echoed in my head that I need to stop drinking. I let this thought ruminate within me for a moment before brushing it aside. Much akin to Dickens' Ebeneezer Scrooge, it was the first of three such visits this night. 

Later on, the wife, puppy, and I made dinner and while it set to cool and soak up all the rich flavors of its cooking, we sought refuge upstairs in a spartan bedroom that was currently acting as a storage attic. It was there that I sat down heavily on one of our wedding chairs with a strong drink in my hand.  My beautiful new wife soon joined me, followed swiftly by the haphazard pattering of our yorkshire terriers nails upon the boards. My wife sat opposite on another one of the folding chairs her father had gifted us for use in our wedding just a few months prior.

We sparked to life a lighter, and from that a blunt we'd been smoking, and putting out, for a few days now. We would routinely sit across from each other like this and pass the same blunt for 2-4 puffs each before putting it out again and returning downstairs to our waiting dinner.

It was sitting in there, with the pup at my feet and my wife's knee a few inches from mine, that the true weight of my intoxication descended upon me like a thick blanket of static snow. Whenever I would drink, I would be fairly coherent until the 10th or 12th shot of whiskey. But mixed with Cannabis? It would explode into a kaleidoscopic haze that left me saran wrapped in a world that barely encompassed my frontal cerebral cortex. Were I to peer outside of this fog for a moment, I would catch particles of dust. Dots of microscopic insignificance flaming to life for a few short moments of glowing brilliance which punctuated an otherwise depressingly dull existence, as they floated lazily through a sunbeam streaming in through a window next to which we sat.

It was within this heavily sedated, intoxicated state that I heard the voice in my head cry out again even louder, ""I NEED to stop drinking.""

This too, I brushed aside after a moment. I then quickly rose to my feet and now from the thought I retreated. Awkwardly, I descended the stairs towards supper with my whiskey and fruit punch cocktail clutched to my chest with one hand, while the other dragged against the wall of the stairwell for stability. The drink was the 4th of the evening which were intermittently drank while preparing food and lazily browsing reddit in the 2 hours prior, along with 4 shots of plain whiskey to speed up the process.

That night we watched several episodes of a television show we both adored. New episodes of Brooklyn Nine-Nine which I had downloaded earlier in the day. A total of 5 new episodes of our favorite show! We were in for a treat. 

As I took my seat on the couch, and placed my dinner before me is when the true weight of my intoxication was felt. I could barely string together a coherent sentence in this state, but It was during this time that I got to ""enjoy"" the stretch of 4-6 hours in which I spent the whole day planning around. I meticulously ensured that every night was met with enough alcohol to get me precisely this drunk, and if I could manage it, enough weed to get me precisely this stoned. The combination was a cumbersome affair that demanded all of my attention and focus, and I was a practiced zen master in the art of existing within it. 

There were, however, some drawbacks to my condition, and I would speak at length about them in private. In public I would never mention anything, so it was always in private that any such displays of self reflection occurred. ""You see,"" I would wax, poetically,""...whenever I'm this intoxicated state and attempt to watch a live action show, I don't see the characters, or laugh at their punch lines. All I can see and hear are the actors hitting their marks. I can see the dialogue written out on the script they had memorized. I see the angle at which the scene was shot, and the lighting shining down upon a set."" The terrible affliction of not enjoying live action television was the limit to which I would travel when discussing the true nature my present state.

But due to this affliction, the episode of one of my favorite TV show could have been the funniest I'd ever seen, yet my impairment robbed me of the joy in its viewing. My food, which was celebrated in much the same way, was shoveled into my mouth in a frenzy. Each spoonful a hurried attempt to sober up quickly enough to hold a coherent conversation with my wife, as I hoped she wouldn't know just how drunk I truly was.

I didn't enjoy my food, I never did in this state. Each bite was immediately followed by another, force feeding myself in hopes of some semblance of stability. I guided my body towards the fridge in the kitchen and pulled out two Gatorades for the pair of us. I drank both of them.

As I sat on the couch, not enjoying my favorite show, nor my favorite foods, nor the company of my partner or that of our boisterous young puppy, I again found myself ruminating upon string theory.

Truly if there was a timeline in which my business failed, my marriage collapsed, and my friends were lost, this was it. If ever there was a timeline in which the dream of that far off garish Christmas party surrounded by friends and family were only a dream, this was it.

My small field of vision now lunged towards the undressed windows in which I held such hope and I, again, saw them standing naked before me. The walls loomed above as my surroundings collapsed within me and through the chaos of my own mind I heard him, myself, a final time, much quieter: ""I need to stop drinking.""

And this time I didn't hasten that voices dismissal. I allowed it to exist, and with each moment of shadowed, dulled thinking, clarity slowly emerged. This was the third time in a single evening in which I was humbled to my core by the power of this intoxicant over me. I didn't have to list all of the things that alcohol had taken from me, because the list was plain within my mind, as it was every single day. I thought about all those things I had lost, and began to add things that I had not yet lost to the list. My marriage. My business. My puppy. My friends. The remaining family members that would have me. The house. The far off Christmas party. 

I cried there, silently allowing each tear to travel the curvature of my swollen, red cheeks. I got up and, again, navigated the obstacle course of a single coffee table and a dog toy to the kitchen. I took the full bottle of shitty, cheap Canadian whiskey from the freezer, unscrewed the top, and set it upside down within the drain of the kitchen sink.

I stared out the window above the sink at a setting sun. The sky was losing its pink/orange glow, and traveling further down the visible light spectrum towards a deep blue that I could see above the neighbors house.

The sky was not dark yet, just very, very blue. I listened to the gurgled, choked whispers of that terrible siren, and I wondered to myself how many times I had seen a view as beautiful as this, and how many more I would have the chance to. I didn't notice that the TV in the other room had been silenced, and I soon felt my wife's hand on my shoulder.

I tried to articulate what was happening, but each attempt was only a harsh exhalation of breath. I managed, after a few tries, to say that the view was very pretty. Her reply was, ""it seems like you need a minute."" I nodded and she left me to myself.

And in my head I could finally see the lever very clearly now. 

An ancient 180° railway lever affixed to a steel grey platform. On one side, where the lever was positioned, ensconced in a menagerie of cobweb and rust, was my current alcoholic condition, and the other, the equally cobwebbed promise of sobriety. I watched as a small version of myself walked up to this lever slowly and deliberately. He/I stood before it and with great difficulty, managed to wrest it from its current state, reversing its position.

And for the first time in so many attempts, I saw and heard the lever firmly 'click' into place. Felt it, even. I had finally had enough. I was going to take a different path, a different timeline. And perhaps this time, I would stay within it.",88

The first 7 years were fine a struggle getting used to the new life for them but we got on with it and had a great relationship, being a dad and being a good dad was my top priority. After seven years my ex moved my girls from Texas where we lived and went to Long Island, NY. It was very hard to maintain a close relationship at this distance and I ended up missing most of their teenage years I could only afford to visit once a year for 12 days so that's all that I saw them even though their mom was supposed to send them back to me multiple times a year according to the divorce decree but that never happened and I could not afford to fight her and she knew it. So our relationship declined over the years and they moved on with their lives and did not want to share that with me no matter how I tried. Its been a bitter pill to swallow that threw me into a massive depression and drunk for ten years or so. When I finally got sober I had to make a choice for my own health and mental wellbeing and that was to not to continue to keep reaching out to them as that always broke my heart because of little to no response. I have been sober for a while now and think about reaching out again but I am afraid that it will be the same heartbreak and I don't want to risk picking up that first drink again and going through the depression that will follow. I have worked very hard to get to where I am in my life and its a really good place I just wish my daughters had a part in it no matter how small, I know it would never be the same but it would be better than nothing. I miss my dad every Fathers day and of course during the year as well he has been gone since 2004 we were close and he became my friend later in life as he was a recovering alcoholic back in the 80's and up until his death I was so proud of him. I was only 17 when he went into the program which made him 47 we had always had a good relationship for the most part but when he got sober it changed so much. He was a wonderful man and a great dad I love him and miss him. 
Not sure what will happen with my daughters I can only hope that it does not take me being at deaths doorway for something to happen. Being a dad was and is one of the best things to ever happen to me, it just seems that I am not one anymore and not by my choice, I am sure my ex has a big hand in this but I do not want to be that ex-husband that blames the ex wife kind of guy.
 Anyway I really just needed to drop this sorrow off here and get it out of my brain. Now I'll go for a bike ride in the park to get out of my head for a while. Peace to you all and Happy Fathers Day.",5

Ready for the long-haul,"Had to quit drinking in college after a day's drunken escapade landed me a skin graft and an overnight stay in the psych ward. Stayed sober for about 3.5 years. Started hanging around people who drank again, started remembering the addiction specialist telling me ""I wouldn't tell most people who come in here this, but I'm not sure you couldn't drink again. I think you have an anger problem. It probably would be best for you to abstain for now, regardless.""

&#x200B;

So I figured, ""Well, why not? I'm in a much, much better place emotionally, maybe I am fine to go and moderate."" And for the past couple years that's what I've tried doing. I realized in the past month that I never really did moderate, and that even what some people would call ""moderate"" drinking sucks. Also realized that I was absolutely drinking more over time, even if it was a slow decline. 

&#x200B;

Been reading Allen Carr and ""This Naked Mind"", it got me excited to quit! Being able to draw on experiences from my past stint of sobriety was helpful, too. And I've decided today's the today! I'm not afraid or anxious about it, though I know I'll probably have some spells of that, but that's only natural. More than anything, I'm looking forward to living the rest of my life without alcohol, and beyond grateful that it didn't take a rock bottom to find my way back to sobriety.

I'm also very grateful for this subreddit, which was incredibly helpful for me before, and I know will be incredibly helpful now as well.

2020-06-21 08:51:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hd6fk6/one_year_reflections/,One Year! - Reflections,"I made it a year!

When I first quit,  I remember feeling so overwhelmed when I'd think of all the things I was going to have to do sober.  I just couldn't imagine enjoying life,  or handling the difficulties,  without the crutch of alcohol. But as I reflect on everything I've been through this year,  I can honestly say that I have never regretted not drinking - through the good times and the bad. 

I quit in June of 2019, while I was drowning in my kids' 4H activities.  Shows and meetings and ever so much work.  Somehow I learned to relax without wine each night. 
July brought the county fair and rodeo season,  and my daughter became rodeo queen.  More stress,  more chaos, more exhaustion. I spent an entire horse show in tears - sobriety was more than I could handle. It all just felt like too much. I'd always proven myself by taking on too much and looking like superwoman from the outside.  The day fair ended,  my grandma was taken off life support,  and she died three days later. I wanted to drink through the grief,  but my mom and my kids needed me sober,  so I was. 
August was my birthday.  A sober birthday? I couldn't imagine it could possibly be fun.  But it was fantastic,  and I remember it! My husband told me that day that he was impressed with me.  That felt good. I found a therapist,  and started learning how to love myself. 
September,  we spent two weeks in Iceland. I couldn't imagine not trying the local micro brews while sitting in a wild hot spring.  What is a vacation without drinking? But I did it,  and when I got home,  I felt so strong and had no regrets. I did eat a lot of Icelandic candy and cookies. 
October, my husband started working out of town for two weeks at a time.  The loneliness was brutal.  Wine had always been my friend before.  This time,  I found new hobbies and I found new friends.  
November and December - is it possible to survive holidays without drinking? I was sure it wasn't.  My husband worked through Thanksgiving and Christmas. I stayed sober.  We made the best memories we could when he was home in January.
January,  my teen started driving.  'Nuff said.
February, my Father in law was diagnosed with cancer.  Life felt so heavy.  I felt like I was drowning,  but only in life - not in liquor. 
March brought Covid. Fear. Lockdown. Isolation. 
April,  my husband was laid off after 15 years with the same company.  Life turned upside down.  I sat down,  put my head in my hands,  cried,  and grieved over the loss of my favorite coping mechanism.  He came home from his out of town work.  We learned to live together full time.  Neither of us drank. 
May,  my father in law succumbed to the cancer.  We buried him without a funeral.  We grieved.  I learned to just allow myself to feel the pain,  instead of numbing it.  Turns out,  feeling it is healthier 
June,  my husband is employed again, it's not great but it will work.  Life is getting hectic again with my kids' 4H stuff. I learned over the past year that I don't have to take on too much in order to prove my worth.  It feels better this year,  more manageable.  In the past year,  I've learned to give myself a lot of grace. 

All the holidays. All the chaos.  All the sadness.  All the fear. All the stress.  I made it through every single bit without a drink. I coped, and in healthy ways.  I feel strong and proud of myself.  I'm handling life,  really living every moment instead of numbing half of it.  Without alcohol,  my life feels full. 

If only I could've seen what life would look like a year later, back when I started.  If I could've known,  with certainty,  that the hard times would be worth it.  That I'd still have fun,  that I'd still enjoy life.  I worried my way through so much of the first year, and I needn't have. If you're just starting,  and you're feeling overwhelmed when you try to imagine all the things you'll do without alcohol,  try to let the worry go,  and just focus on today. You won't regret waking up sober.

Instead of our usual pattern where I would take the bait and start a whole thing that would last for days, i handled it with tons of sober maturity and it went away and we both moved on.  Seeing healthier patterns emerge is one of my favorite things about this journey and the feeling of being bulletproof because these stupid things are never on me as I am no longer out of control is so great

I still have monster cravings BUT the nal helps me to stop and surf the craveing, and play the tape forward.
Without the help of naltrexone, i was powerless against the cravings. Alcohol would call and i had no choice but to pick up the phone. No matter how hard i tried, i would inevitably find myself at the till, sweating and shaking so hard i prayed they had tap so i didnt have to try to punch in my pin. 
Instead, i am awake, sober, enjoying a coffee and going to enjoy the hell out of spending time with my dad on this Father's day. 
I realize now there is no shame in asking for help. My attempts to control or moderate my drinking were clearly not working and it was high time to try something else and i am so glad i did.
Thanks naltrexone and thanks to this sub.

I was sober all of 2014. Well...I was crying and throwing up in the early morning of 1/1/14 from a very drunken celebration the night before. I didn’t drink that next day cycle and continued not drinking one day at a time. 

On 12/31/14 I had one of the greatest moments of my life. Each year previous our family got together to count down the new year in what can be described as a ‘move the furniture against the walls and dance all night’ kind of party. I danced but not anything like I had during previous years. What was so great about this night was some how I found out a way to get all of my family to stay up all night and count down to the moment that I would become 1 year sober. Actually, the entire world was going to do that...and we all did.

10...I thought about all the free drinks at parties that were handed to me that I had refused.

9...I thought about all of the sweets, caffeine and fast food I gobbled early January and February to feel something without booze.

8...I thought about making the decision to quit sweets, caffeine and fast food and become healthier.

7...I thought about all the mornings that were free from hangovers and regrets.

6...I thought about how healthy I had become.

5...I thought about how much mental quickness I had gained.

4...I thought about my first drink at 14 and how I really just wanted to escape and feel good about myself back then.

3...I thought about all my friends and family still addicted to an easy chemical release.

2...I thought about my SO that had gained so much respect for me.

1...

Everything was perfect in that moment. 1 year sober. The room erupted with screems of joy. Music was blasted. I hugged everyone in the room and so did every other person in a jumbled mess of euphoria and optimism for the new year. I will never forget that moment.

Another moment I will never forget is my next drink 195 days later. 560 days sober. Still on this sub bi-weekly. I thought I had it all figured out and could handle putting myself in a situation that would hand me my biggest test yet in sobriety.

I was on a trip a few hours away driving distance from my home with family for a birthday party. It just so happened that the celebration was going to happen on a party bus on the 2nd night. 

The first day felt off. Everyone was already drinking and I complained to my SO that I didn’t have anything that was going to get me close to the feeling that everyone else had. I was craving casual euphoria like many times before in that sober stint but this time felt different. 

I remember telling my SO an hour before getting on the bus that I was going to have a drink. I didn’t mean it. I just wanted to see how it felt to say it and see their reaction. They were thrilled. It was not the reaction I thought I would get. It pushed me closer and I decided to just do it.

Trigger warning...but I remember it was green apple crown royal and we all took a shot. I felt all the old familiar feels. I won’t describe them but my inhibitions were lowered for the first time in a year and a half and I enjoyed it in the moment. 

I drank moderately and served as the liaison to our party bus driver who was in his 50s, long flowing Fabio hair, dressed in a suit and had hinted that he was packing heat the first opportunity he got. I remember being really good at my job that night and thought “hey all this sobriety really straightened me out.”

Fast forward through several job changes and some cancer/chemo therapy and I think I feel cancer part 2. I know this is a huge plot hole but I’m trying to remain anonymous. Fuck cancer. I thought I wouldn’t be able to have kids if it came back because where I thought it was was needed for the act, they only give you 2 and they had already taken 1. So my SO and I tried for a month and got pregnant. 

I guess I have to say I’m a man because I drank until we were T - minus 5 months. I quit after another family party that I don’t want to describe too much but impending fatherhood hit me in the face. 

Now the little one is 7 months old. I quit so I could be there for the little one and be the dad I’ve always wanted to be. I want to be present for all the moments and be able to keep up with them. 

This 365 day adventure has felt like one long day with so many great memories that I remember fully. I have been the husband my wife needed to help with the baby and the father they needed. 

It took me 5 years from that party bus night to quit again. That is half a decade of drinking like nothing had happened during those 560 days. I don’t want that to happen again. 

Thanks for reading and good luck.",11

I managed to reach ~4 months at the end of February and tbh I had never felt better, I didn’t miss drinking really and was happy being sober of Christmas - my body felt less bloated, I had more energy and my mind felt fresh!

But as the COVID lockdown hit I found myself with not much to do and decided to have the odd drink again, just one or two at first, and I just started feeling bad about it - not guilt for stopping drinking, but the overall sluggishness and aches and pains came back slowely, the hangovers came back much stronger, and my ulcerative colitis flared up for the first time in a few years (not my reason to stop drinking in November). I put this down to work/life stress at first but then realised quickly that actually I was feeling stressed as I was losing motivation, putting on weight and feeling bloated - and the alcohol just did not sit well with my gut the morning after...

I decided fine - I’m just switch drinks to something less harsh, and no changes. I still got that urge to drink excessively regardless of the situation, and that in itself felt stressful, like it was something else I had to manage in social situations and when relaxing at home. It’s taken me about 4 months to realise that I’m really not happy continuing down this path as the benifits do not outway what I had before at all, and with the add health issues I’ve decided to refresh my badge and start again on the road more comfortable and fulfilling...

I went with my brother who I used to always get drunk with, but texted him ahead of time to let him know I wouldn't be drinking with him this time around. This helped so much with avoiding the uncomfortable pressure to drink with him beforehand and kept me from worrying about how I would bring it up once we met up.

Unfortunately, I didn't golf to much better than usual. But I remember the whole course, and didn't have to worry about being the unlucky one who ended up driving home afterward. I was able to enjoy the rest of the day afterward instead of the usual early passing out or blackout drinking that used to follow a round of golf.

I hit my 1 year alcohol-free at the start of June.  I honestly can't say my life has improved any.  I might be wrong but I think I wasn't exactly the textbook example of an alcoholic, in fact I didn't really drink that much at all.  I would only drink on a Saturday night and it would be 4-5 bottles of light beer.  That was it.  Maybe these other people had a worse problem than I did?

I'll be honest over the past year I ended up feeling deprived more than anything, I looked forward to my few beers on a Saturday night, sure I tried to replace the beers with food, eating out, reading, Netflix but nope wasn't as enjoyable as the beers.

I started drinking heavily when I turned 21 a few days after my dad died and realized if I drank, I didn’t hurt quite so much. I remember that first shot of vodka vividly. The pain numbed instantly. I started enjoying things again. I had found the solution to delay my grief.

Fast forward 9 years, struggling to fall asleep one night I realize there wasn’t a single time In the last 9 years that I felt happy. Every single experience I had was clouded by drink. Stumbling. Sobbing in public. Vomiting. Kissing strangers. Dating abusive people. Making a fool of myself. Once entering a situation where I was raped by a classmate while drinking with him (I understand this was not my fault, but I would have never hung out with that slimeball if he hadn’t offered me whiskey). Even once foolishly confronting a violent person in the street which ended with me having a bloody face and a concussion. Man, I could go on and on.  

Thing is, I am losing a two-faced friend. Some of my best times in the last decade involved drinking. My graduation party. Weddings. Date nights with my partner. “Unwinding” with wine and movie nights. Dancing with friends at bars. Concerts, Vacations. Alcohol was my support when I had nobody. It numbed me when I hurt too much. It put me to sleep when I couldn’t face the day any longer. It was a distraction for 30 days straight when my ex ended her own life. 

Today, and forever going forward, I need to face the reality that my life is no longer working this way. The day after I had my last drink, I went to work still smelling the alcohol on my body (15 hours after my last drink). I vomited in the staff restroom. I was shaking and anxious. I became frightened for my life and decided to make 6/12/20 my first day of sobriety. Please help me along the way. I am losing my anchor and just trying to make it to tomorrow.

I beat myself up because I couldn’t drink like a normal person. I couldn’t have one or two- I had to blackout or pass out. I read a couple books, read others stories, and really took the  time to understand myself...I am not defective, alcohol is an addictive substance. 

Society made me feel like I had to drink to be social/ happy/ fun/ adventurous/ etc. When I was alone I drank to avoid all the issues that life brings. Here is what I pledge to every morning:

“I can not live a full life and continue to drink. Drinking does not add anything to my life, it only takes away. I am staying sober because it is the only way I will be HAPPY, HEALTHY, and SPIRITUAL. It is my unconscious mind that desires and craves alcohol. My conscious mind knows that alcohol is simply an addictive substance that destroys lives. It WAS destroying my life. My mind and body are complete and strong. There is no room for alcohol.”

The first thing I noticed was how much you can smell alcohol on everyones breath (not good social distancing at this party tbh) you can smell it everywhere. Also, people assume you are drinking alcohol if you are consuming something out of a solo cup and offer you more booze but a simple ""i'm good"" is enough and requires no further explanation.  


I stayed for 3-4 hours just hanging out talking with folks, then left. I was the first to leave the party. This is when I'd usually hit the liquor store and pick up a bottle of whiskey so I could get my real buzz on when I got home.

Crossed the threshold holding my 6 hour old daughter.,"My wife remembered on the hour. I was walking back and forth with the baby and she was studying my face when my wife mentioned it. Took everything in me to not cry. 

When she was born, the doctors put her on a table next to me. I said something to a nurse and the baby turned to me and opened her eyes for the first time. She recognized my voice. Then, I did cry. 

I can't stop thinking about the alternative present, if I kept drinking. This winter, my grandpa went through a string of surgeries and I managed to drink secretly at the hospital overnight for days. I know I would've brought a water bottle of whiskey and drank here through the birth of my daughter. I would've thought ""if no one knows, it's okay"" and excused that horrible action by just not telling anyone. Which is what I did with my grandpa this winter. I drove him home drunk once. Had I not quit, I probably would've driven her and my wife home with a buzz at least, though I would've told myself I'd sober up before the drive until moments before. And I wouldn't because 30 minutes before, I'd take a few more swigs to calm my nerves. Then I just wouldn't tell anyone and I'd pretend I hadn't done something so despicable. That makes me sick. 

I feel proud of myself for 14 days, but it's also like I'm just now feeling all of the guilt I should've felt before. I love this kid more than I thought I could ever love anything. I can't help but think about how I'd feel if I were still drinking. Even if I'd quit just prior, I'd have day two tremors now and I'd be irritable. Instead my head is clear and I can focus on her and my wife and fully appreciate the best thing that's ever happened to me. It very much feels like I narrowly escaped. 

It still weighs on me now though. How bad it had gotten and how much denial I was in. This little girl opens her eyes and just looks at me and I feel so *much*. So much more than I have in years and it would be so dulled if I hadn't quit. 

Anyway, thank you guys for being the way you all are here. Without this community and all the love and support here, I would've held my first child with whiskey on my breath.",104

A lot has happened, good and bad, but I managed without drinking.  Celebrated birthdays, holidays, anniversaries, and everything in between.  
I lost a job, mourned loved ones passing,  had financial difficulties, marital issues, and everything in between.
I have done it all before, but this time it has been different.  
This time, I did all of those things without drinking.  Those are reasons and excuses to drink.  This time, I chose not to drink.  And guess what, it hasnt been all that bad.
I have realized the last year and a half I drank, it was to maintain.  Maintain what?  I have no idea.  It was constant sneaking around, hiding, driving myself insane wondering if they knew I was drinking or how much I had actually had.  It was exhausting.
Anyways, overall, it's been good.  Absoulte longest I have gone without alcohol since I was 19 or 20 years old.  Imagine going thru all this covid 19, this presidential shitshow, this racial disparity and inequality without drinking.  
Guess what, I am doing exactly that.  Because this world has enough problems, I dont need throw a drinking problem on top of it.  I cant control how other act and feel, but I can control how I think, act and react to things going around me without drinking.  It's possible, its responsible, and its change.

So as soon as they show up of course the wine comes out , which is normally not a hang up for me . I don’t mind people having a casual drink or two at my home when it’s an occasion .  They ask me as they always do , and as I have for the last 7 months declined with a smile and stuck with my new soda stream for the night. At one point I had a near beer and I could see her family trying to get a peek at the label but made no mention of it .  

I have told them a few times now that I quit drinking so they all know that I don’t consume any alcohol.  So present time comes around and they have gotten my father in law a bottle of very expensive whisky.  Like a very expensive bottle . I was kind of shocked when I saw the label.  I was sort of fixated on it , talking about it like i was talking about an old friend , thinking of the Smokey Peat in a glass .  Allllll that shit .  So yah before I know it I’m holding it looking at the label and then my father in law of course says well why don’t we have some .  Felt like I’d been hit by a train sort of . 

My mouth was wide open and I sort of snapped back to reality , the reality where I don’t drink anymore because Once I start drinking I don’t stop until I’ve had my fill, because I can’t take care of myself and when I drink and I fuck everything else up around me when I do drink.  So I put it down and declined once again with a smile but on the inside I was burning . I feel angry now and it’s something I’m gonna talk to my person about . 

Not going out on Father’s Day like that so here’s to another 24 and so much more . 

I won’t drink with you today!",7

I finally got the chance to work overseas this year , I started in January , what a fucking year to try this , I’ve learned a lot about myself so far and how I can’t run from what I’ve been suppressing and avoiding , I’ve realised I can’t solve my own issues on my own 

Looking back I’ve always had a mental health problem ever since I was a teenager but I never got help, I regret this now , ranging from crippling my  anxiety and almost being addicted to being in a state of depression, I could never almost let myself feel happy, and this leaked into so many other areas of my life,  Looking back I’ve never really fit in with people in general , I have a few select friends I click with but in general upon assessment I’ve realised I’m the person people like in small doses 

I’m in my late twenties now and I’m going to start getting help because I just cant cope with it anymore 

Things really started to unfold around the 24/25 mark, I feel looking I’ve back I’ve always buried my problems behind excessive drink and drug use and even though I’ve got no access to substances now I can’t drink just a few beers and relax I drink excessively on my own , and for days at a time , when I eventually stop I stop for at least a month until I tell myself “tonight won’t be the same just have a few and chill out “ and then after I’ve finished the initial 6 beers I’m straight back to the shop to get another 8 and pound them all 

When this all started I was crippled with anxiety , I didn’t want to go out anymore and be seen in public and all I wanted to do is sit at home and piss around on my phone and sleep and then go to work in the daytime , and even at work my performance was good but my ability to communicate started dwindling 

I did what I always did and worked out but I started taking at johns wort , which I still take and seems to at least help slightly but the anxiousness and the shitty feeling and thoughts and self questioning of everything is still there and haunts me most days 

Whenever I’ve hit these moments I’ve always dealt with them myself , I’ll stop drinking and I’ll throw myself into hard training as a way of trying to make myself better for a while , this isn’t enough anymore 

I’ve always lived my life in extremes , I’m either hard drinking and drugs , or I’m hard working and training hard , there is no middle ground 

During the quarantine in my apartment on my own while I’ve been stuck in another country by myself with no friends or family with me , the only comfort I have is being able to call people on WhatsApp every now and again to check in,  I’ve put myself through at least 3 stints so far of week long drink binges and they all end up the same , I drink anywhere from 10 to 20 cans of beer a night , wake up start working remotely at 9am , wait till lunchtime and start drinking while I work until I finish work and then I head to the shop to stock up on supplies , I then put my headphones on listen to music drink and cry and do weird stuff when I’m on my own in my apartment , then when I wake it rinses and repeats for a week until I can’t take it , I recover and start working out again 

I’m currently stuck in a foreign country living on my own and can’t go home yet to seek the help I need as i don’t understand the health care systems and I don’t  speak the language  , I’ve started playing in a local sports team which isn’t too bad so at least I’m able to socialise a bit so until I can go back I’m just going to have to ride it out 

TLDR : I’m at breaking point and it’s time to get help because I can’t solve my own problems",3

Somehow I don't think it's working.,"I only feel relaxed when I drink. It's the only time I don't actively dislike myself. That's why it is so difficult to quit.

I tried not to drink yesterday, and failed because I wanted a few hours where I didn't feel like crying. I get that I'm depressed, and that alcohol makes it worse. Now I want to cry because I feel so ashamed that I gave in again.

I am nowhere near rock bottom. Unlike the other times I resolved to quit drinking I haven't put myself in danger or humiliated myself. I go to work every day, I eat, I spend time with my family. I don't hide my drinking. I don't blackout. I don't do or say anything I regret the next day. And yet I drink 8-11 shots of rum almost every evening.

I have one or two dry days per week. When I needed to take antibiotics a few weeks ago I didn't touch a drop. I feel so proud of myself every time I go a day without drinking. I tell myself I must not be addicted for all of the reasons above. Then I drink again, even when I have decided not to.",7

I hope so because I danced too close to the line this time.  The past two months I didn’t allow myself hard liquor because, of course, THATS when you have a problem.  (Obviously being sarcastic) I was doing great after a really bad bender put me in the hospital with pancreatitis again.  Started back over in February, and then lost my job to Covid.  Perfect excuse.

The sneaky crap that our brain tells us to keep drinking is the worst.  It always starts with beer for me, then cider OR beer, then red wine, cider OR beer.  I can have a growler of beer and then stop right? Just because I’m white knuckling it to not get more after that...but I only had the one! So I can control it now like “everyone else”.  

On the positive side, I can have people over again without the paranoia of any indication that drinking occurred.  My place won’t smell like stale beer, and I’ll stop eating like a teenager.  Plus my pancreatitis will stay away.

Anyway, reset.  Thank you for reading this.  First night to sleep sober and I’m excited for tomorrow.",3

I've had chronic back pain for 5 years, and alcohol was my escape for it. Nights like tonight where the pain is crippling I still think about grabbing a drink. When I go to a family event and I'm the only one not drinking I feel like grabbing a drink. 

I've been sober for 18 months, and sometimes I feel like I've made no mental progress. I read a lot of stories on here how everyone's life has improved exponentially. Sometimes I feel like I'd be better off drinking. 

I know it's not true. My life has improved immensely with relationships, work, self-esteem, and overall dignity. But I can't lie to myself and say that I don't miss drinking or that I don't miss numbing my physical pain.

But that's life, you can't fix everything overnight. 

If you feel like your sobriety is a waste of time please dig deeper and really analyze and reflect on your progress, and keep going. Life is truly better on this side, even if it doesn't feel like it in every waking moment.",20

My SO has gone from drinking daily to 2-4 days a week. He now typically drinks less on the days he drinks. 

We have been together several years and alcohol was always a big part of our relationship.

We recently had an very bizarre argument where he went off the rails and exhibited lots of anger and unusual behavior. I think part of it was driven by his frustration that our dynamic has evolved, that he lost his drinking buddy (as we don’t bond in the way now), plus some Covid-driven depression.

""Okay I respect your opinion and I completely understand why you feel that way. Truly I do. I cannot imagine what you think of me cause I know everything I've done and I think very poorly of me. I cannot imagine how frustrating this is for you when the problems solution is literally stop drinking and I just can't seem to not do this simple task. Alcohol has taken so much from me, grades, my friends, my relationship with my family, and a girl I loved. I want so bad to stop, truly I do. Clearly I need some more extensive outside help. I hate to admit that and I always thought I could get back on track enough to lightly drink occasionally with Friends but time and time again that has showed me that's not possible. You said one time ""you have one of these revelations each week"" and that's definitely true. Alcohol destroys my life and I get super motivated to quit for a while but eventually I fall back into old patterns. I know this about my self and I hate it. It's time for me to admit I can't do this by myself but I will say I truly believe I will beat this. I really do. Perhaps I'm delusional (I know I've been that way before) but God I hope not. Stacy (not her real name) it's not fair for me to ask you to stay. I can't ask that of you and God knows no one would blame you if you left.  But I can't tell you how much I would miss you. Your my best friend and you make my life happier. I thought we had a future. However your happiness is the most important thing to me so do whatever you think is best. Just know I love you ""

Holy fuck I hope this is it for me. I want to be done so much. I hate the person I've become and the people Ive hurt. I use to be the happiest person I knew.

This was the deal I made with myself, and what I used to convince myself that I didn’t have a drinking problem. It was normal for me to kill a 6 pack or two of pretty high octane beer a weekend, or take a big chunk out of a bottle of whiskey or scotch. But there always came a point where I knew if I continued to drink I would become very, very sick.

As I mentioned earlier, I started drinking in college. It was like a magic elixir for me; it took that nagging voice in my head that told me not to say this or do that and shut it right up. I have always suffered from social anxiety and pretty much clam up in situations where I am around people that I don’t know well. Alcohol helped me to be the version of myself that I thought I should be (at the time), and he was often the life of the party. Imagine Chris Farley, but not quite as fat, not quite as funny.

As I transitioned into adulthood, my relationship with alcohol also transitioned. It became a reward for a hard week at work (middle school teacher here). About a year and a half ago I had gastric sleeve surgery and it completely transformed my life. I was able to lose about 130 pounds over about 11 months. I don’t remember exactly when I started drinking again, but I don’t think I made it 12 months. I think it was only about 6 months before I re-introduced alcohol, which I think is the minimum recommendation from my bariatric program. And that’s when the trouble really started.

Alcohol doesn’t seem to work the same as it did before. I have to drink a large amount to feel any effect, and it seems to last half as long. Also, there seems to be no limit to how much I can drink. I could easily finish an entire handle of whiskey and not vomit my face off or completely pass out. It’s bizarre. Everything I’ve read online says that one who has had bariatric surgery will feel the effect faster and harder on fewer drinks, but that has not been the case for me, it has been the opposite.  So I’ve been consuming more and more alcohol lately, and the days between when I am drinking and when I am not are dwindling. And I’ve started being dishonest with my wife, sneaking bottles in and hiding them (which I’m very ashamed of). I know enough to know that this is a clear indicator that I have a problem and I need to do something about it.

I don’t know if the gastric sleeve is the reason my alcohol consumption has escalated or if I have just simply built up tolerance, but I know that that’s really irrelevant. Something has to change. I am coming to grips with the fact that I can’t seem to drink in moderation Some seem to be able to, I cannot. I’ve been busting my ass, exercising, eating right, and my weight loss has stalled out about 30-40 pounds from my goal weight. This stall started in November/December of 2019, and I can only assume that the massive amount of calories in the alcohol I am consuming are at least partially to blame. My drink of choice is bourbon, and I usually kill a half a fifth (750 ml) a night, and then try to go as long as I can before I find an excuse to leave the house so I can stop at the liquor store, which is typically 2-3 days. Based on my calculations, that’s around 1200 calories every night I’m drinking, which can be at up to 3-4 nights a week lately.

I’ve seen a few others on here who had bariatric surgery and I would love to hear from you. To all of you, your posts are inspiring.

I’m on day 3 now, and I’ve definitely gone a few rounds with myself in my head about whether or not I should just go buy some whiskey. Physically the transition has been fine; I’ve had a little “hangxiety”, and some “hot flashes” and trouble sleeping, but that’s about it.

One of the biggest aspects that I’m struggling with is something I mentioned earlier: for years I have used alcohol as a reward, so now my brain is like: “ok, where is the booze?” anytime something good happens, or I reach even the smallest milestone (getting to Friday is a milestone in my head). So I’m going to have to rewire my brain to perceive something healthy as a reward. And as you guys know, that’s easier said than done. For now, I’m just taking it day by day. I have set myself a short-term goal of going at least two weeks and then I’ll evaluate how I feel. This will also help me figure out what effect the alcohol is having on my continued weight loss.

Cheers, with diet dr. pepper!

Edit - usually buy whiskey and consume in fifths at a time (750 ml), not handles.

Working during this time has been extremely stressful for me and to make matters worse at the beginning of quarantine my fiance got laid off. I like to think that I look at society with a somewhat satirical lens and don't take things to seriously, but I kept asking myself the above question over and over throughout the lock-down, and it really did not add up. Or to rephrase that, it added up to some of my worst feelings about how we collectively operate. Businesses and governments care more about profits from alcohol than they do about people's actual health and safety.

My line of reasoning went - wait, there's a deadly virus out and people are still consuming something that probably doubles their chances of being infected. Personally I'm not even in the demographic that would be in real danger, but this got me reflecting on my own life and just how manipulative alcohol was in general. 

I was one of those guys that barely escaped his twenties, was in complete denial about drinking, and commuted home on the subway with two fosters oil cans. Several blackouts, a rehab stint I can hardly remember, a portion of my face went missing one night, been fired for drinking, and the cops...

I've been a long time lurker here and didn't really appreciate how powerful community is until listening to This Naked Mind. Also, highly recommend listening to 'Cold Turkey' by Miska Shaluby (which is free on audible). 

So dear person who is struggling to hang on, keep going. I could expound on all the reasons you will be a better person sober, but maybe instead just play the skeptic. Step outside the box hold a mirror up to society and you will escape the alcohol trap.",4

For a long time my relationship with alcohol hasn’t exactly been healthy, but I convinced myself it wasn’t that bad. Sure, I had a tendency to binge when I drank, but when that happened only once every week or two it seemed normal. 

Then the pandemic hit, and I started teleworking all the time, and my drinking picked up. I rapidly went from drinking once a week, to twice, to nearly every day. I knew I had a problem when I started buying ‘extra’ bottles of vodka so my wife wouldn’t notice how quickly the levels were going down. Still, it wasn’t enough to make me stop. “It’s just for now,” I told myself. “I’m just stressed, once things go back to normal I’ll stop drinking so much.”

Last night I hit my personal rock bottom. I’m 32 and have been drinking more-or-less regularly for over a decade. In all that time there’s been one ironclad rule I’ve never broken. I have never, ever, driven a car after drinking. Didn’t matter how much or little I’d had. I wouldn’t have so much as a glass of wine at a restaurant if I was going to be driving after. Until last night.

My wife went on a long bike ride, and I took the opportunity to pour myself a drink. I was about halfway through it when I got the call that she’d been in an accident, and while she wasn’t seriously hurt, (just banged up a bit), she needed me to come pick her up. So I got in the car.

Nothing bad happened. I picked her up and came back home with nary a problem. But I still broke my one rule. What if she’d had the accident towards the end of her ride instead of the beginning? What if I’d been two drinks in, or three? I like to think I would have been concientious enough to admit that and ask a friend, but the whole reason for that rule was because I know drunk people are very bad at making those sorts of decisions. Hell, while I *felt* sober enough, maybe I wasn’t. Maybe getting home safely was a fluke. I don’t know.

What I do know is that I’m not willing to risk anything like that happening again.

Actively trying for probably 2 years. Recently I strung 20 days together,  before succumbing again when I was too tired to use the tools in my toolbox. 

A week later of relapse aka 'field research' I found myself on Day 1 yet again. One more beer in the fridge. 

I told myself this is the last one. So after shooting 200 mL of vodka in my wardrobe (picked it up from walgreens, yep I need to quit) I crack my last beer.  

This amber droplet of beer rolls around the rim, as I'm holding this crisp cold beer in my hand. 

And in that droplet I see it all. The countless advertisements from those 20 years telling me that a cold beer is my reward for working hard, for being a man. The days at the beach, on the lake etc where those few moments of joy with booze were bookend by shame and regret. The lies told by Big Booze but also perpetuated by my family and friends that booze is who we are and how we socialize. 

I saw in that droplet, everything I've learned on this journey.  

And I know that this might not be it. But it's another try. And as long as I keep learning and trying on this sober journey, eventually it will stick. 

I can't drink normally. I don't think I want to.  I am 38, with what, 40 years left on this planet? All of which could be taken from me in a split second. 

Let's live it, experience it. It sucks and it hurts, and it's beautiful.

I'm not sure what to write exactly, but I thought I'd write a post anyway to mark this occasion. This will be quite rambly hah. I've never viewed myself as a full-blown alcoholic, I like to think I quit before it got too bad. But, it was bad. I kept showing up to work really hungover, or still a bit drunk from the night before. I did and said really stupid stuff when I was bingedrinking, things that I don't even remember. I feel so much shame thinking back on it. 

At first, my friends thought I was joking when I said I've stopped drinking, and they still sometimes ask me if I'm ""still doing that sober thing"", and I'm still given beer by friends to whom I've told about my problem.
My problem was that when I started drinking, I couldn't stop. (duh) I rarely drank to cope with anything, I ""just drank to have fun"", and because everybody else did it, it's so ingrained in our culture.
I love beer. And I love that alcohol-free beer exists, it often helps me socialize and it keeps the hunger away. Sometimes I drink light beer, but only one or two. And I often feel bad when I do, like I'm letting myself down. But, I haven't had any liquor, blackouts or bad days because of it, so I see that as an absolute win in my eyes.

That is a huge trigger for me to drink one of my biggest actually.  Prior to lock-down when I was still only flirting with quitting I did manage to to attend 3 shows and just drink a sugar free Redbull and really enjoyed myself.  A question I had is have any of you been able to enjoy N/A beer, I was thinking maybe the next show I have to attend I could do N/A beer with some CBD oil.  Relax me, keep me sober.  The issue I tend to have is I am shy around my clients, and I realized when I was at the shows muscle memory of siddling up to the bar and ordering kept taking over.

Is N/A beer a slippery slope though? Have any of you had experience with it?

I am scared I will relapse but also excited at the potential to have a few days alone with my thoughts without alcohol weighing me down.   

&#x200B;

I used to LIVE for these days when my family would leave so I just binge drink for days on end without anyone the wiser.     Normally right now, I'd have a few hundred dollars in cash stashed away so I could hit the liquor store and stock up without any transactions on the credit card.    I would have already secretly taken a few days off work (salaried, so it's not noticed) and stocked up on pizzas and chips.    I'd be just a matter a hours before I'd hide the keys to my truck, close all the blinds, move my appetizer selection of 'good beer' next to the couch along with the first handle of rum and a large amount of food.    This would be my command center for the next 4-5 days as I worked through my   
 Rum and Canadian Whiskey supplies staggering from Kitchen to Bathroom to couch all while remembering none of it.   If I planned it out correctly, I'd sober up the day the were coming home and I'd clean up the house, carry out the trash and study all the text message I sent the last few days to make sure I didn't 'slip up' and let it be known I was wasted.

What really sucks is that today as they leave, I want to do it again.

So far in my (relatively short) amount of time sober, I have found that:

* **My moods have become more consistent** 

Not necessarily better all of the time though. I describe my moods as being a sine wave; if there's a peak there will be a trough. However, since I have been off the sauce, the amplitude of that sine wave has decreased, so things feel more normal, and less intense.

&#x200B;

* **I've been able to keep to habits**

In all of my drinking career, I've been able to afford max about \~4 days, maybe a week of commitment to something scheduled, be it the guitar, or exercising consistently or keeping a study regime. If I wasn't getting paid to do something, I wasn't going to be reliable. Since giving it up, I've found that I'm starting to enjoy these little routines, and have been consistently walking at least \~8 miles a day (Everything is shut down in Scotland still, otherwise I'd be back at the swimming).

&#x200B;

* **I've been better able to verbalise my feelings**

I suppose this is hand in hand with keeping consistent habits, as one of the things I've picked up is to write in my notebook whatever's on my mind at the end of the day. And from that I've been able to understand and even verbalise some long-standing non alcohol related issues in my life, relationship or work. It's really worked out aces.

&#x200B;

* **Time spent with others feels more meaningful**

Any time I have spent with people hasn't consisted of \~2 hours of actually having a good time, and the rest of it descending into a stew of poorly expressed feelings, thoughts and opinions until you're too tired and have to go home.  I think it speaks for itself.

&#x200B;

* **The fear is gone**

I've seen it referred to as 'hangxiety' but people here call it 'the fear', when you just have a brain like a bee hive just swarming with horrible thoughts and regrets and lazy behaviours. It's so much better that it's gone, it's the #1 benefit from all of this, and I love that fact.

&#x200B;

* **I can sleep again**

I'd normally have really bad sleep and often languish in a half-nap for a few hours a day. Now I can sleep 8 hours and wake up actually refreshed. I didn't know this could actually happen!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In Scotland there's a definite drinking culture, and it's sad to say that this is the most amount of time I've spent sober since being about 14. I'm 28 now - that's half my life!

Ultimately, the point behind this post is that I'm interested in hearing other experiences from people regarding their first experience with sobriety.

This is where it gets tougher to fight the cravings - on a workday, I can think about how awful it would be to go to work hungover, but there's nothing stopping me from lying in bed all day tomorrow if I so choose, nursing a hangover.

So, I've been thinking of the other reasons I choose not to drink - the hangover is a short-term reason, but there's plenty of longer-term reasons.

Here's one: mental real estate, and the mental hangover.

Right now, alcohol is off-limits. Alcohol is not an option. At this moment, the headspace taken up by addiction is mostly relegated to cravings. I don't like them, they're uncomfortable, they're somehow exhausting, but they leave enough space in my mind for me to do other things.

After that first beer, I lose that headspace, and it's flooded with horrible mental gymantistics: how many times a week is it okay to get drunk, how much is it okay to spend on beer, how much can I afford to put off taking care of myself, what lies should I tell this time. Should I drink, shouldn't I drink, should I drink... ad infinitum. If a craving is uncomfortable, and exhausting, losing all my mental real estate to that cycle is doubly so.

All that to say, even if I don't have to be doing anything physical tomorrow, and I broker peace with the hangover, the mind warping that follow would last a lot longer than Sunday, and I just don't want to waste my time with that sort of mental hangover. I'm just not ready to exhaust myself like that.

So, no nono juice today.",2

Alcohol Explained should be required reading for kids in High School.  I'm 57 without a partner and no kids.  I don't have enough retirement savings.  I wasted money on cigs, pot, and alcohol trying to feel better about being all alone and hating my job. Drinking and pot really took my life where I didn't want to end up.  I hope things start going my way.  IWNdWYT",20

Detoxes, suicide attempts, hospitals. I probably spent all of 2017 dopesick and guzzling valium, then I had hallucinations from the valium withdrawals. I almost lost my parental rights. My battle was not as long as some, but it was fierce. Rock bottom arrived quickly, and every time it did I found a trap door and went deeper.

Sometimes I said I would commit to quitting tomorrow, because I was too sick and miserable today. And I did exactly what I said I would. I quit tomorrow. Tomorrow just had a bad habit of being a day away.

When I was admitted to my first detox, I was so delusional that I did not understand why I was on the detox floor. I had just taken 40mg of valium before walking in the door. The seizures started not long after, because I had lied to the doctor about my benzo and alcohol use, and they had to rush to pump me full of librium. It was bad.

After I finally acknowledged my substance abuse predicament, I fought. I fought the cravings with clenched fists. I was going to power through them, damn it. Just another few months and my brain will be healed enough that I can finally move on and not be an addict anymore. Though I always relapsed before that vague milestone came.

Now I am clean and at peace. If only I could somehow show my past self how peaceful this life is, how beautiful the gift of sobriety... Maybe things would not have gotten so bad. But knowing how many of my friends did not survive their illness, I am simply happy to be here.

People sometimes ask me, how did I finally win the fight against my addiction? Quite simply, I didn't. I gave up. I realized that doing things my way would always lead back to the bottle or the needle, because if you do what you've always done, you'll get what you always got. It took an eloquent speaker at AA for me to realize that my addiction would always win a fight. So I stopped fighting, and I surrendered to my higher power. I took that first step.

I never thought a devout atheist like me would fit into AA. But I did. Because God is not an entity or a deity, God is an *idea.* God is humanity trying to see the best qualities in themselves, outwardly. 

I'm so glad the fight is finally over. Though I acknowledge that the *journey* is not-- either you are working the steps, or your addiction is working *you*-- but the *fight* is.

Six months of putting my wellness, mind~body~soul, at the forefront of my everyday. Six months of giving myself space to learn what that means for me. And I’m really proud of myself.

And I gotta say -
It’s amazing what you can accomplish once you get tired of your own bullshit.

I was constantly feeling like I wasn’t living in alignment with my true self and the life I envision for myself. So I decided to cut out alcohol for a year and re-assess. Welp, I quickly learned that I really love not drinking and have zero intentions of going back. It’s been the greatest form of self-care and the best decision I’ve made for myself. 

I’m not trying to pretend like I have it all figured out because lol I don’t and nobody does, but what I do know is: 
1) I’m growing, learning, and evolving into a more authentic and aligned version of me, and it’s really exciting and feels SO GOOD. 
2) Alcohol doesn’t fit into the above. 

So *insert cute mocktail* cheers to striving to be the best version of YOU and being gentle with ourselves through the process because it’s not always easy. And for other sober/sober curious babes doing the damn thing - I see you, I’m here for you, and I’m really proud of you.",34

She was really nice about it and said I was a good worker and hates to see me go (and wished me happy birthday lmao).

It's just a word, alcoholic, but the history and imagery give it weight. Even in this world of gender fluidity and obesity normalisation, the word alcoholic is still synonymous with defective. The threat of being a pariah in a world awash with alcohol lead me to not seek help. I thought I was too good for that label. It was beneath me. For I was, and can still be, a judgmental bastard sometimes. I assumed that the imagery of the word was the word itself. I walked a fine line trying not to be labelled an alky. I was delighted to hear during the twelve weeks of alcohol counselling that I had to attend on doctors orders due to my drinking that I wasn't an alcoholic, I was a ""problematic drinker."" It was like the golden ticket in Charlie and the chocolate factory. I was free to taste what the Wonka brewery had to offer. I would stand, swaying and drunk in pubs, defending my label of ""problem drinker"" against accusations of being an alcoholic. I wore it like a badge of honour. Like it meant everything was okay. Everything was not okay. Far from it. 

Eventually, I accepted that I was an alcoholic. 

To me, the term alcoholic means a person who can't stop drinking once they start. That's all. A recovering alcoholic is someone who figured this out! 

I have thought long and hard about how I got to be an alcoholic. Was I born an alcoholic? Or was I created over a period of misuse? I never figured it out. What I do know is that I was a sensitive soul and alcohol gave me an escape. It just fitted the bill. It was almost the piece that I thought I lacked to make me whole. It was a shortcut to completion while simultaneously denying me the knock backs in life that I needed to grow. I recently heard on a podcast ""If you are drinking to change the way you feel then maybe have a look at your drinking,"" I wish I'd heard that sooner. I wish I'd learned to face adversity and take the rough with the smooth. 

Thankfully, I got there in the end. It just took a while.
Recovery meant taking a chance at life without the warm security of escape. It meant taking a risk. It meant sacrifice. Thankfully, with sacrifice comes great reward. 

The sacrifice of alcohol has given me many benefits. The most important ones are behavioural and emotional characteristics that developed from living life sober.

I'm not just recovering from alcohol addiction. I'm also recovering from...


1) Self-seeking behaviour. An end to those manipulative lies and games I used to play, badly, to try and get my way. Or to get a drink. Scheming, befriending, associating with people I didn't particularly like just to hide in plain sight or get my way. 


2) Guilt and shame. Guilt for drinking and shame because I couldn't stop. I was guilty and shameful of my weakness. Not only around alcohol but my inner knowledge that I was using alcohol to escape life. It made me feel like a coward. Which then made me want to drink more. A vicious death spin.


3) Low self-esteem. Tied to guilt and shame but also just from not dealing with things. Assuming, falsely, that the future will always end up like the past because I didn't deserve anything... at all. My inner monologue was one of disdain aimed at myself. My outer world was built on lies, lies and damned lies. I realised that I am a small part of a big picture. As a result, I no longer have to carry the weight of the world around on my back. I no longer sit ruminating on the plight of the planet. I can make minor changes and offer help to who wants it. I don't have to feel inferior for not solving the world's problems.


4) Fear. God damn the fear. Recovery didn't turn me into a fearless warrior but it did make me realise that a lot of the fears I had were unreasonable. The biggest one being a fear of failure. I walked the circumference of my comfort bubble staring out at the unknown. Desperate for adventure. Fearful of failure. Each obstacle I overcame in recovery gave me a little more confidence to try new things. To hell with the failure. Until I was brave enough to venture into the unknown. I have danced in paradise. I have ventured places, both internally and externally, I would not have dared to venture before.


5) Trying to be who I thought I should be. I spent so much fucking energy when I was younger trying to count the beats that others were walking to so that I could fall into line. I knew I walked to a different drumbeat but I didn't want to. I have learned to embrace the beauty in my difference and embrace the quirkiness of my individuality and use it to my strength. I realise that peoples opinions are their opinions and are not necessarily true. ""You can't please all the people all the time,"" so trying to be everybody's version of myself was a waste of time.


6) Weakness. I used to believe that reaching out for help and admitting defeat was a sign of weakness. Strange then that I have grown since the day I admitted defeat. The obstacles and the setbacks in sobriety have made me stronger. I have learned the lessons and felt the pain that I tried to avoid by using alcohol. 


7) Turned hatred into love. From staring out behind a poorly fitted mask I would decry the problems of others and the world. For every solution, I had a problem. I would say anything to deflect the attention away from myself. The misdirection would have made magicians proud. I would jibe, judge and mock. I would use anything to be left alone. A hard shell protecting a beating heart. I did it because I didn't feel worthy of love. I never saw beauty. I only saw darkness. My poisoned brain made me see a poisoned world. Recovery made me appreciate the simplistic beauty in a world of madness. I began to see warmth and compassion. The distrust of people who were trying to help me melted away. I was like an abused dog fearful of a repeat. Slowly, I learned to accept help. Slowly, I accepted love. Slowly, I gave love. Slowly, I recovered from a life of avoiding life.

Last night my wife and I spent 10 minutes discussing the fact that we definitely watched John Wick 3 together when it came out. I could not recall a single damn detail about it. We watched a trailer and it all came rushing back and I recall major details of the plot, but still couldn't remember finer details like she could. I was definitely drinking beer after beer while we watched it at the time.

I started realizing that there were so many moments I'd be in a discussion with friends or coworkers about something we'd watched and I could never really contribute to the conversation like they could. Because I was drunk while watching it. I know I enjoyed them in the moment, but in the morning, all of the nuance is lost to the void.

Over the last 6 months, I've watched and re-watched so many things in my downtime and my ability to spot and recall finer details is ASTOUNDING! I mean it's probably that of an average human being, but it feels like I've unlocked a super power. Like if someone with a normal memory suddenly acquired a photographic memory. That's what it feels like.

He died Valentine’s Day 28 years ago, at the age of 63, from complications due to decades of alcoholism. I’m 60, and only now finally realizing that I was determinedly heading down his self-destructive path. 

An early memory:  my father is sitting in his chair in our darkened living room on a sunny Saturday. Beside him is a full box of 24 room temperature beers.  Throughout the course of the day he methodically cracks open and drains each beer. Sometimes the TV is on, but mostly he sits in silence, staring into space. By the end of the day, the case is empty, and my father disappears into the night.

Another memory, around ten years before his death:  my brother and I sit with him in a Chinese restaurant for lunch. He’s not eating, just orders a glass of red wine. Suddenly, he throws up, at the table. I’m shocked, mortified and angry.  He becomes quite irritated at my reaction. I shut down my feelings and we continue our lunch as if nothing happened.

I now know my father’s alcoholism was his response to a lifetime of undiagnosed, chronic depression. I now know that my desire to shut down my feelings and disappear into solitude with one or more bottles of wine is his legacy to me. I love him, but I don’t want to end up like him. IWNDWYT",23

After everything was said and done got some friends over and we all just played cards and sat by the fire. It was probably the best weekend in a long time.

I was wondering if anyone else remembered that post or had the picture just a side note I have been on this sub kind of lurking sometimes posting for 2 years. Never give up hope. I'm kind if down from drinking last night but I wont let it ruin today. I recently read a book called broken open. This guy David Clark went from a 320lb 1-2 fifths of whiskey a day drinker to an ultra marathoner. He says that he woke up almost every single day for 13 YEARS telling himself he was never going to drink agian knowing that was a lie until one day it wasn't. He has a number of years sober now. Well into the double digits I think. Never give up. IWNDWYT!!!!!!!,2

1. Stay in bed, in fetal position, for a few more hours regretting drinking that much and fighting the nausea
2. When i finally feel ready 2 get up i'd force myself to eat sth little (like some chips some bread or an apple) or depending on my hangover just a sip of water and a chewing gum (maybe a tea if my anxiety isnt so bad)
3. I slightly feel okay and normal again so i'd get dressed and go ""grocery shopping"" bc i have no (or only a few) beers left 
4. I'd drink the first beer on my way home
5. A little later and a little drunk id eat my first ""meal"" then drink more and binge eat while drunk af right before going to bed 

And somewhere inbetween getting drunk i'd get rrally depressed/frustrated/angry/suicidal and maybe hurt myself or maybe not physically but emotionally.

This is the longest period of time I have gone without alcohol since I was 19 (32f),"Hello wonderful people! Feeling a bit nervous as I never make posts on Reddit.

I started my sober journey 25 days ago, but relapsed on day 12 as I hung out with a drinking buddy who semi-shamed me for the ‘sober rainy Saturday’ we were having. Bad idea, but it made me realise I really didn't want to drink anymore, and I'm also proud of not having had a drink the last 24 out of 25 days.  

I’ve never been at rock bottom or had to drink every day. But I was binge drinking every week, being a person I didn't want to be and suffering from brown/blackouts and terrible hangovers and hangxiety. The drink would also lead to drugs if I was with other people, every time. And while I thought alcohol made me wild, exciting, charming and fun, it actually made me numb, stupid, sloppy and obnoxious. 

I can’t count the number of times I have said and done stupid things, upset people, hurt myself or woken up with a thumping head, racing heart and desert mouth wondering why. So many wasted days in bed wishing for death, and a £20 takeaway bill because I needed junk food to feel slightly better.  

During the last few weeks I have:

* Felt calm and at peace instead of agitated, anxious and meltdowny
* Enjoyed waking up hangover free and fresh. Never have I thought ‘Oh no, I wish I had 10 drinks last night, what a wasted opportunity!’  	
* Feel healthier. I look slimmer, less bloated, less red in the face, and no dead bloodshot eyes
* Been 500% more productive. I’m getting all kinds of projects completed and  I’ve read 3 books and listened to 3 audiobooks – more than I’ve read/listened for a long time
* The fog is clearing, and I have more energy – I’ve been doing daily yoga and going for walks - normally I hate exercise!  
 

What hasn’t happened (yet?):

* I haven’t lost any weight, probably because I’m eating whatever I want for now, including a lot more chocolate/cookies/sugar
* Better sleep. This is still iffy, but I’ve been abusing my body for over a decade now, so it needs more time  

I would not have made it this far without lurking on this sub and reading all of your experiences and thoughts. Also reading This Naked Mind has totally changed how I view alcohol. I always knew it was a poison and not good for you, but I hadn’t realised the extent of just how much it KILLS you and only takes from you, mentally and physically.

Especially women the recommended amount for women is no more than what?  

""The Dietary **Guidelines** also **recommend** that if **alcohol** is consumed, it should be in moderation—up to 1 drink **per** day for women and up to 2 drinks **per** day for men—and only by adults of legal **drinking** age.

The house was a disaster and I couldn't get ahead.  Then my husband calls me,  he's out in the pasture.  Says to check the dog,  she might have found a porcupine.  Boy did she - and shared it with the other three dogs,  too. Quills in her nose,  tongue,  lips, roof of her mouth. Over a hundred,  easily.  The others each had a couple dozen.  Spent a few hours picking them out with tweezers,  trying not to get bit.  Went to a new friend's house to do their chores.  One dog tried to attack me.  Another ran away - the one she swore was so sweet and would stick right by me.  It was well past dark before I found him.

Another +1 for The Naked Mind. I know it doesn’t do it for everyone, but it’s what I needed to hear. That book was the only thing that finally got me to quit and completely reframed my attitude towards alcohol. 

My biggest challenge isn’t the urge to drink. I have zero urge thanks to that book. I slip up under *perceived* — not actual — social pressure. My friends are 100% onboard my decision so non-issue there. My coworkers give me a little grief here and there but it’s either in good fun or, for a few of them, it brings their heavy drinking into stark contrast and they don’t like it. I get it. I was there.

It’s people I don’t know that sadly have the most influence on me. Drinking at a ball game (remember those?) or at a hotel bar during my numerous business trips (remember them?). I hate being the odd man out. It’s something I’m working on. 

But the big one? Dating. I slipped last time after months sober due to a first date. I didn’t want a perceived ding against me before the date even got started. So when the server asked if we wanted a drink while we looked at the menu, I caved. That was all it took to trigger months of drinking at least half a fifth a night.

That ended 31 days ago, but I worry about relapsing once in-person dates are a thing again. I’ll be looking to this sub once again to help me navigate that.

Somedays I feel like soberity is the easiest thing while other days present very heavy emotional challenges that just become exhausting. Everytime I feel like I am getting a hang of it the next day I'll feel it slipping away.

It seems that soberity comes with loneliness. It means more nights by myself with tea and a good book, I know what I missing is juvenilen and ultimately futile but I can't help feeling alone in this.

Alcohol helped me cope with emotions and process my feelings in ways that would make things easier, without of the use it of I feel as if I am a teenager trying to find how to deal with emotions again. I want to keep going and will for me and you, but getting a handle on this is just so strange.

I got a call from my wife a few hours ago saying ""come to this address, I got into a wreck. I think my car's totaled.""

So I get there and...yeah. The car looks like toast. Airbag deployment, bumper cover on the ground, radiator busted and leaking fluid, bent frame in the front, the whole 9 yards. She was leaving work, doing 40 (MPH - the speed limit) and the other driver didn't yield for the 2-way stop and she did her best to try and avoid it, but obviously couldn't. Aside of shot nerves and airbag rash on her wrists and knees, she's fine, by the way.

So why am I saying all of this?

Well, stressors. That's why so many of us are here in the first place.

We're in a bit of a financial dire straits at the current time (as many others in the world are), so adding this on top of it is most certainly not helping.

The 'previous me' would go bottoms-up to a bottle of vodka with this latest development, spending $30 on a bottle of DoubleCross that I should spend on something far better.

But 'current me' will not do this. I will not drink with you today - or any other.",189

Why do I do this - I had 14 days last month then just totally crashed. Binges. Phone calls I can’t remember making saying horrible things. Kicked out of bars. Making shit up for no discernible reason. Cutting myself with razors. Crying. Feeling close to just hanging my self and ending it all. The inside of my head is violins screeching, feedback. White noise. I lost ten whole days. 

Honesty and courage are what I need. I am a coward. A lonely snotty cowardly alcoholic. This addiction at this frightening level has been going on for 9 years now, since I was 18. I can’t keep this up. 

I see so many people who have gone years. Please god or whatever there is, just let me please become one of you.

I got clean from heroin last August but still drank up til December. I was homeless, incredibly depressed and going nowhere. I mustered up the courage to go to residential treatment, even though I kept telling myself ""well I've been clean for 4 months"" ignoring the drinking. I was there four months, I have a ways to go from here but I'm no longer homeless, I have internet and a computer!

i ended up in rez a little longer than I wanted because of covid (supported housing options had a freeze on clients for a bit while everyone was trying to figure out how to adapt),  So I had a lot of time to learn how to just sit with myself, and be comfortable in my own skin. My concentration and focus improved sooo much, I can sit and read a book now, I'm auditing a couple college courses on YouTube, I can meditate, I make my bed every day and keep my apartment clean, I keep a journal, and have been doing a poem of the day where I find one to copy down into a notebook. Getting work is going to be a challenge because I don't have any remote work skills, but I'm in a situation where I don't have to worry about bills so I can relax for a few months and really work on myself. I am incredibly blessed.

I'm going a bit stir crazy with the pandemic but I've learned so many ways to keep busy. Boredom was one of my biggest triggers before but I don't crave drugs and alcohol as much as I thought I would because of quarantine. It's still there though, but as long as I keep to my program, I know good things will keep happening. 

right now, my main goal is trying to build relationships and a support network. i'm not too thrilled about the 12-step meetings in my city, the recovery community here is very clique-ish and it's a struggle trying to find people I click with. We are still very locked down, which makes it even harder. I made some friends in residential, but lost a few relationships because of the dumb schism in the country right now over political views. Usually I can look past that, but I was ostracized for having the audacity to be in support of the Black Lives Matter protests, so those are relationships that I am not interested in keeping. So I figured the safest way to meet people right now is online so here's to a fresh start.",18

Just wanted to pick some of your brains and maybe get some advice. I’m supposed to go camping next week for 5 days with a really close friend, her boyfriend, and his best friend. (Never met her boyfriends best friend but they’ve been talking him up for weeks)

I’m newly sober, (just over two months) and am pretty nervous about this trip. I have good days, and other days I want to crawl out of my skin because of how anxious, and uncomfortable I feel. They all know I’m sober, but I’m not sure if they take it super seriously/know how bad my drinking actual was and what a problem it was. 

I’m not worried I’m going to drink, and I know they’re all supportive but I guess what I’m really worried about is seeming normal and fun while feeling so untethered on the inside. 

I know a lot of these feelings are probably irrational but I just feel embarrassed and kind of ashamed and know there will be awkward moments on this trip especially because it almost feels like a double date thing, and I’m just recently getting used to fully feeling things/working through some heavy stuff I’ve been avoiding. 

Anywho been feeling kind of unstable the last few days and just wondering how you guys deal with these uncomfortable feelings or have any advice for how to deal better in social situations? Thanks in advance.

Towards 4PM, the familiar thoughts came in in full force, and haven't backed down much at all.

""Just have one night of drinking, you've been doing so well."" Never a thought of ""just one drink"". Always one night of getting absolutely obliterated is how the craving goes.

Just about every single time I've engaged this ""one night"" plan, for a number of years now, I'm still drinking come Monday morning - not going to work, sometimes not calling into work, locked in my bedroom, drinking beer. There may have been once or twice where I instead showed up hungover, but those occasions were rare.

So, past evidence shows me that drinking tonight makes it exceedingly likely that I'll be missing work on Monday... and now is not a great time for me to be losing a job.

I knew in the back of my head this was true, however I had a craving being on my 4th day sober & also wanted to try it. I basically saw the chapter as an excuse and ran with it. So I did and I slipped. Not too bad, but definitely drank more than I wanted to. I felt terrible in the moment, so I decided to start writing down how I was feeling instead of enjoying my drunk. I wanted it to be a learning experience. Because of doing that, I don’t feel guilty today. I woke up this morning (hung over😭) and immediately read my notes. I ended a 3-4 page rant hating on my experience with “this would be more fun sober. Learn from this”

Alcohol is a giant bitch. Not because it inherently is some evil substance, it’s a bitch because it brings out the worst of us.. the parts of us that aren’t actually what define us. It brings out tears when your sad, it brings out anger when your insecure, it brings out lust when your alone. It takes our logical selves, rinses us of what it really means to be human, and leaves us with a dried out shell of our existence. It’s amazing that the human spirit is so strong and resilient and just within days of letting ourselves be clean from alcohol, our dried out shell is full of love and humanity again.

During the early days of quarantine, I barely went a day without drinking heavily and that was a huge wake up call in a variety of ways. I stocked up on beer just in case the store up the street closed and I would start drinking earlier than pre lockdown days. 

I also realized that checking out some AA meetings may not be a bad idea. This is coming from someone who used to get defensive and angry by just the mere mention of a meeting. 

So far in June, I have had 10 dry days. One the days I do drink, I try and limit myself to a 6 pack compared to 12-15+. To some it may not be like a lot, but I consider it a small victory in this long war.",11

I hadn't eaten hardly anything for the last week, nothing stayed down and it's like I couldn't... swallow food. Like I would chew, and chew and just... nothing. 

I resorted myself to fruits and pickles. 

Well anyway, Tuesday I stopped by to visit my mom when all of a sudden I woke up with her freaking out standing over me and 4 paramedics in her house. 

She said I dropped down and started convulsing and foaming at the mouth so she flipped me over in case I choked. 

I tried lying to the doctor but she said my eyes were yellow. She did an ultrasound and said I have the most liver damage she's every seen in someone at 22. 

They put me on so many sedatives they literally had to leash me and guide me to use the restroom. And honestly even after leaving I was still walking weird because of all the meds they put me on. 

And now everyone knows. I'm embarrassed and ashamed. But it's a blessing in disguise. I haven't had an urge to drink. I've been eating. 

Alcohol isn't fun when you need it to stop the shakes. Alcohol isn't fun when your family watches you have seizures.

I'd like to go hiking or swimming tomorrow, or at the very least hang out with friends and maybe go for a drive or something. The best part of all of this, of course, is that I won't feel like trash because of a buzz or a hangover.

Long term, I need to drop the 30 pounds I gained over the last couple of years because my friends are getting married in September and there's this beautiful burgundy suit I want to buy for it. Additionally, I'm trying to save money to take my Mom to southern England next Fall so we can attend the Battle of Hastings reenactment on Oct 14. All of this will be much easier without the calories in booze and the money wasted on it.

I used to struggle with alcohol and being afraid of losing my ""one and only friend who makes me feel better"", so even if I abstained from drinking for several months, I usually came right back to it with great pleasure.

Well, today I just hit two weeks of sobriety. The not drinking part hasn't been that hard, it's been a long time coming and I've been doing things to replace it and spending a lot of time with a partner.

I wanted to ask if anyone here has had a similar experience to me with this, because even though I'm doing okay mentally, physically I feel like shit.

I went from 12-15 drinks a day down to zero over a couple months, but two weeks at zero and I feel worse than ever. My diet has not changed, I would say I put thought into it and get sufficient nutrition but there's room for improvement, probably a 7/10.

I've been physically feeling weaker and more drained than when I was still drinking, somehow. I even feel more physically sore. I had to cut my workout routine down to every other day at most because it feels like I'm getting sore easier. I can't sleep particularly well still, I've been staying up all night because of insomnia and sleeping during the day.

I don't have the energy or drive to talk to or keep up with my friends, and I feel like a neutered dog. I don't wanna do anything, I just feel pretty drained and numb most of the time.

I'm not sure if I'm an alcoholic. Maybe I just don't want to admit it myself. Maybe I have my biases of what an alcoholic looks like because I watched my mom's boyfriend die of the horrible disease when he was only 35. I don't have withdrawal. I don't even drink every day.

I did not know it was going to be my last.

I had been struggling for a year to stop. I ended up in the ER, again, because I passed out and had no recollection of anything.

It was late in the night, but they wanted me to sober up before letting me go. They knew me. I had been there before. I was on a bed, in a corridor, because they had more important things to do than care for a drunk.

Around 3 in the morning, I asked a nurse if I could have a smoke. She actually agreed and came with me. She was nice, but real. I told her how I was drinking because I couldn't deal with the memories. I told her I had been abused. I just smoked, and cried. She listened. I told her it would be my last trip there, that I didn't want to be that person anymore.

The year has been tough. Finding fun things was tough. But it was also a rebirth. I had a promotion at work (after starting new in another place), I worked on my relationship with my family, and even though I still don't really have a relationship with my sister, I'm proud to say that things are getting way better with my mom... And even my dad !

I started taking care of myself. I'm working towards being happy and healthy.

I thought I'd never break the circle, I had been trying for so long. So many days one, so many days two. But the last one, the one that does count, was just another day one.

So, if you're losing hope, because there are so many days one, or two, or three, remember : It only takes one, the one, to start a new life. And things are not going to change overnight. It will require work, and help, and lots of self-forgiveness. But this day one ? It was so worth it.

Obviously, IWNDWYT. And I hope you won't either.

Lots of love.

At 4:23am I had three google searches:

""help""

""helpmme""

""it's important help""

When I read those messages I had wrote to myself during my blackout, I felt as though the wind had been knocked out of me. In my completely blacked out state, I was asking for help. 

It still scares me to think of that night (even though there have been many more frightening times in the past), and I am so happy that I listened to myself. I helped myself.

It only took a week without booze (and a sober stumble on an uneven sidewalk) for my neck to flare up. Bad. I'm doing PT and chiropractic multiple times a week. I'm on muscle relaxers by day and benzos by night. I'm getting a cortisone epidural next week.  I'm posting this at 3:45am because my meds are wearing off so I'm in too much pain to sleep but I have another hour before I can take anything. I haven't slept more than 3.5 to 4 hours at a stretch in over 40 days.

My house is a mess. My wife has really picked up the slack with me being near useless with pain and exhaustion, but we work from home and have a 2.5 year old home with us. She can't keep up with all of it alone. I used to drink and clean like crazy. I'd go sober into a messy kitchen and come out of a clean kitchen drunk. I tidied to hide my problem. No one as drunk as I was would be so on top of maintaining their home, after all!

I played a lot with my son. We'd go on walks with him in full Batman costume. We'd play lightsabers (""You're bad guy Kylo Ren!"") I'd read him books and build forts. Now I can hardly pick him up and instead of whacking sticks together and hitting off the tee in the back yard I try and keep him entertained while I sit on the couch or lay in the floor, unable to participate.

I've been over weight as long as I've been an alcoholic. Every time I've taken some time off drinking I've dropped at least ten pounds, if not a lot more. I'd been managing some weight loss even while drinking with healthier eating and exercise. Now I'm gaining weight. Inactivity, pints of ice cream and boxes of cookies. All the alcohol calories are being replaced with sugar and I can't do anything meaningful to burn it off.

My neck issues were years in the making. Moderate degenerative disc disease, perineural cysts, bone spurs both narrowing where the nerves come out between vertebra, and also narrowing the channel for my spinal cord. This shit would have caught up to me at one point or another and I couldn't go on drinking as much as I was without killing myself, but I can't shake the feeling that if I'd just kept drinking I'd be in a better spot right now.

I know that view is stupid and short sighted. I know sobriety is allowing me to address a health issue what would have only gotten worse the longer I treated it with alcohol. I know my son, my wife, my self, and my home are all be better off when I don't drink. But right now? This fucking sucks.

Anyway, off to try and sleep again, and IWNDWYT.",2

Just wanted to stop in and say hi. It’s been a while since I’ve posted in here but I pop in from time to time to read some stories from others. This sub has helped me so much. I can proudly say that I will be 3 years sober on August 5th of this year!!!! I can definitely say it’s so much easier to say no or not even think about alcohol than in the first week or first month. I never thought that I would get here considering my relationship with the poison ended me up in the hospital in the ICU and losing my job because I was drunk on the job. Now I’m a manager of a service desk  and it’s going so well. I couldn’t be happier. That being said I’ve been getting some notifications that the mods are updating my badge for how many days sober and I feel like I’m lying about my success. So I would like to ask the mods to reset my badge number. My last drink was August 5th 2017 and I do not plan on having another drop for the rest of my days. Thank you everyone for your stories. It gets easier I promise. If I can get to this point so can you. Stay strong. I will not drink with you today.

If I call him to discuss it I know he’ll say he doesn’t have it and how can I put this on him right now w pandemic etc.  for my sobriety should I just let it go and chalk it up to a loss as a consequence of my drinking or face my fears and call to let him know my feelings.

This really spiraled out of control at the start of lockdown although it has always been a problem.

I have gone from 4 cans a night a few years ago and bingeing at the weekend to hitting 10 cans per day through lockdown.

I thought I would share the diary I have been keeping on how I've felt each day in hope it may help somebody.

This sub has really helped me through and this is my first ever post. 

  

**Alcohol Free Diary**

**13/06/2020** 

Felt OK but a little subdued, probably due to the excessive drinking the night before.

Went to parents, turned down a beer from them.

Went for a long walk in the sun, turned down beers with friends.

Slept well, did wake up a couple of times through the night sweating but got to sleep well.

**14/06/2020** 

Mood was better pretty much all day.

Some simmering anxiety and a little down but definitely much better.

Turned down a beer from neighbor. He was very surprised….

Didn't sleep well. Struggled with anxiety at night, thinking of crazy scenarios that will never happen.

**15/06/2020**

Woke up with strange mood simmering in background.

Worried it's an onset of depression again, especially with being back at work today.

Did 11,000 steps.

Got frustrated with my son for being lazy (he was) but I probably got too annoyed by it and struggled to get back in a good mood after. 

This was irrational. 

Was bored and empty at night time so did some work. 

Really struggled to get to sleep, finally got to sleep around 3:00

**16/06/2020**

Woke up tired and grumpy. Around mid-day, finally started to feel myself. 

Still a weird empty feelings and not really sure what to do with myself but getting better.

If it takes 4 days for me to start feeling close to normal again, is it really worth me drinking at all?

Today was the first time I had a craving for a beer, perhaps this is because I'm starting to feel better. Definitely the most dangerous stage for me.

The amount of excuses my head can come up with to allow me to drink is astounding. I’ve heard them all before….

**17/06/2020**

Feel loads better today, great night’s sleep and much happier. Did a workout.

Did 11,000 steps. Found £100 on the floor whilst walking. 

Managed to find the lad that had dropped it. He was hugely relieved. This made me feel good.

**18/06/2020**

Good nights sleep last night, woke up once needing water.

Woke up feeling shattered though, I think this may be because I'm catching up on sleep or having deeper sleep.

My body is maybe ready to start trying to get to sleep earlier, I would rarely go to bed before 01:00 when drunk.

Weather was also awful after a few sunny days, this would usually make me down but I feel good.

Had a message from a good friend who is visiting tomorrow. He was disappointed because I turned down ""just one beer""

I explained that there's no such thing for me, I'm also at a BBQ Saturday and Sunday where people will want me to just have ""one beer"".

**19/06/2020**

Struggled to get to sleep last night, not as bad as previous days but had a bit of anxiety.

Woke up having dreamt about having a relapse. The feeling of relief when I realised I was dreaming was very nice.

Manchester United are on tonight for the first time in >100 days. This is a huge trigger for me.

Also have a friend coming round. Feeling confident about my choice not to drink and know I will not today.

&#x200B;

The thing I can say that has helped me so far is trying to hit 11,000 steps each day and working out every other day. I also have a very supportive wife which makes the world of difference.

Thanks to everyone that posts on this sub it really is a great help and I will be continuing to contribute from now on.",5

I stopped drinking last year for 5 months, and then I relapsed. Currently I am 5 days sober. I never really had bad anxiety before I stopped drinking, now after a couple of shitty things happened in my life (while I drank less overall) I have gotten really bad health anxiety (like I feel symptoms of diseases very strongly, last one is the symptoms of MS).

Have anyone of you experienced increased anxiety in the process of stopping drinking, and has anyone gotten better over time?

Looking for some encouragement, because times are a bit rought right now.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It seems like this is a common pattern for me to stop drinking for a month then get completely wasted and ruin or at least nearly ruin my life. 

I really want to complete quit but need some advice. I stopped drinking for around 16 days before this happened, the first week I felt amazing, Wanted to be productive, but then afterwards I felt extremely down and bored. Is this normal? Does it get better straight after you stop then get worse before it gets better again?

I went out on a motorcycle to a restaurant with a friend I have not drunk for 2 weeks at this point and didn't plan on drinking.

But then I had a beer with my food and I thought that would be it. Then one beer turned into 4 and a couple of shots, it was now really dark and I headed home. I drove to the shop to get water and snacks (my friend went ahead) before I went home and met some guy there who invited me round to his house for another beer which I stupidly accepted.

I then got completely lost on the way home (I have not lived in the area long, I am actually living in a different country) and the guy's house was a good 10km away from where I lived. 

When I was heading home I took a wrong turn, got extremely scared as I didn't know where I was anymore. It was so late everything was closed and there was no one around.

After 40km I then realised that I must be going the wrong way and turned around but after turning around I ran out of petrol and no was stranded in the middle of no where in a foreign country where I have no idea about the area I was.

After my bike stopped, luckily someone came to check if I was ok. He was able to help me charge my phone and contact my girlfriend who was able to follow my tracking information. SHE WAS WORRIED SICK.

This is the first time I have drunk and drove since I got banned over 10 years ago.

Mentally right now I feel the worst I have ever felt in my life. I am just thinking over and over, I could have easily crashed as it was pitch black and the lights on the motorbike were not very good, I could have been robbed easily and no one would ever know, also I could have hit someone and caused harm to them.

I just can't believe going to a restaurant, literally 5 minutes away from my home has caused me to have one of the worst experiences of my life and it has really shaken me up and I have been crying my eyes out every night since it happened and I am afraid to even show my face to anyone.

II just needed to tell my story as I feel getting it off my chest here will help me understand how bad my actions were, and to remind people 1 drink can cause a lot of trouble. 

I just need some help on how I can completely quit drinking as maybe next time I would not be so lucky to have not crashed and possibly kill myself and cause so much hurt to my family and girlfriend.

TL:DR - went for one beer, ended up having much more. Tried to drive home, and got lost. Had to call my girlfriend for help. Extremely depressed with my actions.",6

Game for a bit (final fantasy 7 remake is awesome) and hit up the gym before picking my wife up then home for the evening to spend time with her favorite sister up visiting from San Jose. Great day!
But on the way to my schwarma I was thinking about the kombucha I just bought (alcohol free) and was like...ya know that meze place has hard kombucha on tap. Try one while you wait. It’s just kombucha. It’s healthy. And I agreed. I got to the counter and I ordered it. I fucked up. Luck though was in my favor and their keg was out. None for a week.

I had my first drink after two months in May, I drank about 5 times in the last month. When the pandemic hit I was of course worried about my families health and safety. Over time I became less worried, my area has few cases but there is still a risk of course. I was starting to enjoy being home with my family and it was the two easier months of sobriety. Then we entered phase 2 of reopening in my city and I was back in a restaurant drinking first thing.

I first thought I don’t know why I drank I just wanted to so I did. But that’s not true I drank for my usually reasons I was scared and stressed and didn’t want to deal with my emotions. I hate change it’s hard for me to deal with. Everything changed so fast and I didn’t deal with it. I also don’t want to change sometimes, I feel like some of my friendships depend on drinking. I don’t think that’s the case but that’s how I feel. I’m scared to quit drinking because I don’t want to be an outsider. Deep down I know that’s the reason I haven’t been successful. I don’t want to be different.

Earlier on in my journey I was mad I couldn’t drink. But now I’m scared I’m scared I will drink and I’m scared I won’t drink and won’t have a social life. Drinking has been so tied in my identity it’s like trying to unravel years of losing my self and making sense of who I am now. But at the end of the day sobriety is what I truly want. I never feel better mentally and physically sober so I’m going to keep on going. IWNDYT",2

I was on my 3rd beer of the evening, a Mickey’s small mouth 40oz. (I had just finished 2 Pliny the Elder IPA bottles and wanted to get sauced for the rest of the night. I drove to the liquor store buzzed to get me my go-to beverage.) Sitting on my couch buzzed watching T.V., clutching my  green-glass / gold paper wrapped 40oz bottle, slowly sipping away, this angel appeared to me. I asked her, “What do you want?”. She asked me, in her soft yet slightly high pitched voice, “Daddy, Why do you drink so much beer?”.... 

    I cannot explain the feeling that came over me in that moment. It’s as if time had stopped and my brain was trying to make up some kind of excuse to keep drinking, a way to explain to my daughter the reason why “Daddy, needed his Man soda”. It was then that I felt a sense of clarity. I had no answer to give her. No reason. She walked away. I was done. I poured the rest of the beer down the drain, I promised myself I’d quit drinking.

It hasn’t been easy. But one day sober at a time has been what has helped me stay away from the booze.. That and a little angel...


If you’re struggling to quit, please make today your first day. Say that to yourself everyday. String those days into weeks, weeks into months, months and into years.

Which is about 1/3 of what I would drink everyday a couple years ago.  So im doing better. I been drinking literally about once a month for the past year. I seem to finally have a grip on alcohol. I learned the hard way.

So about 2-3 years ago is when I was a full blown alcoholic. I have that gene ""once I start I cant stop"". I mean nothing could stop me. Once that bottle hit my mouth my brain would not let me stop till im blacked out or passed out. Thank god I always lived walking distant from a gas station.

My friends and I is where it all started. We would drink. I had a good life. a good job. a wonderful social life u could say. But that all ended in a blink of a eye. The alcohol consumed me. I didn't consume it.  I just couldn't stop. After a few hours of drinking, I would get stupid drunk. Ill say it again, I couldn't stop. I would act so eradicate that I ended up scaring all my friends away. It ruined countless opportunities with beautiful women. Yeah I had some great times. But the bad out weighed the good. I ended up with no friends and still have very few till this day.

So after scaring all of my friends away with my never ending black out drinking. I ended up alone. In my apartment. This is were things got bad. Isolation and drinking was my life for about 2 years. I pissed on myself a lot and threw up everywhere in my apartment. It was a disgusting, miserable life. I ended up in the hospital about a dozen times. From being found passed out outside. Trying to walk to get another drink. Honestly I don't know how im still alive. I was a prisoner to alcohol.

Then my job was the next thing I lost. I ended up making a stupid mistake. I was always hungover at work so I had it coming. They probably smelled booze on me from the night before. I have a feeling they had their eyes on me for awhile anyway. They fired me. It was a great job. This is when I started to loss everything.

I ended up moving in with my grandparents because things were getting out of control with my life. I was down to nothing. Nobody wanted anything to do with me. So after a few more hospital trips my grandparents took me to the doctors. They ended up giving me a script of Antabuse. Even though anatabuse has a bad rep, I think it saved me. I started to take it and that's when the withdraws started.

The withdraws were horrible. I laid in my bed for about a month. I had mini seizures. It was bad. I had to lay there and think about how bad I just ""freaked"" my life up. But I got threw it. Even though my rep is still ruined, I don't think people would recognize me anymore. O boy alcohol makes you look horrible. So about a year later im here. Yeah I drink once in a blue moon, I aint gonna lie. But I will never, I mean ever, drink everyday. I really don't even like to drink once a month. So if your struggling out there. There is help. Trust me alcohol will destroy your life with heavy, everyday use. It will catch up to u, someway, somehow. Even after about a year with very minimal use, I still have scars. And my life is still in rebuild mode. But its gets better slowly but the damage is hard to heal. It just isn't worth it. I wish I had a time-machine.",9

Then I play it forward: it won’t be just a couple, probably. I’ll stay up way too late, dehydrate myself, get a couple hours of crap sleep and at best feel off the next day ( likely have major anxiety, heart racing, headache and stomach issues). Sometimes this goes back and forth several times. I have to play my tape forward again and again, adding more detail each time. This makes me really acknowledge what I’m considering. I’ve been there enough times that I can really visualize and walk through the ugly parts I know would come. Then I can play it forward with the non drinking scenario: go to bed hydrated, have good quality sleep, wake up early, enjoy my coffee, be able to plan my day and really enjoy my time off/away. My point is, don’t just play that tape once. Keep doing it over and over until you can almost feel that headache, that anxiety, that pit in your stomach.

I have been drinking since 16. Recently I came to the uncomfortable realization that I am most likely an alcoholic. I have never said that; indeed I don't think I have ever even typed it. My realization has come through a somber look back through pictures of me with my daughter: she is six now and I have been drinking more than I should for her entire life. I think a reasonable estimate would be \~30 beers per week during that span if not going back a decade.    Virtually every picture takes me back to a moment in which I was either tipsy or ""feeling it"" from having drank the night before or even earlier that day. Don't get me wrong, I have never been really drunk in front of her, and I (luckily) have not gotten into any trouble because of my drinking. My problem just seems to be that I enjoy several beers on a daily basis. I was able to stop for a period of around two months about a year ago, but I fell back into it. I always thought of myself as very strong-minded, but I just can't seem to stay sober on my own. I have lost count of how many times I have told myself ""this drink is the last one"" or ""I am just going to drink this weekend"" or something similar. And, as I am sure all of you who care to read this know, as soon as I give in to a single excuse or pretext, I end up continuing and drinking on the daily for a period of weeks. If it is in my house, I will drink it. Being in lock-down has certainly not helped. 

I don't exactly know why I made this new username to post here. I don't know what I hope to find, or learn, or accomplish. I am hoping to find a community. I guess I am really hoping for help of any and all kinds. It sucks to realize it, but I genuinely doubt that I can ever really kick this thing without help. I don't have the self-control to limit my drinking either: once I start it just becomes back to the old routine. I think I need to stop for good, and that is truly daunting. I am hiding most of this from my wife because I don't want her to think less of me or see me as weak. I don't think she believes I have a problem, just that I am ""a drinker."" I have used drinking as a way to escape from stress, anxiety, the usual list of stuff everybody has. Perhaps worst is that I feel that drinking now is essentially the only thing just for me, so I can have my own time doing my own thing. Booze makes mundane time-wasting so much more entertaining. I don't want it anymore, though. I am three-days sober (woohoo) as of the writing of this post, hopefully I can stick with it. 

So...yeah I don't know. I am writing this to reach out and appreciate anything that anyone would be willing to offer. Best of luck to you all, and I hope everyone achieves happiness and healthfulness without alcohol. I am not sure if I can, but I am hopeful that this time is the last ""this time."" ~~Cheers~~.

2020-06-18 20:33:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hbqjwf/paws_is_no_joke/,Paws is no joke,"So I have scanned this group for about three months. Never really posted anything but have commented from time to time. I am going to give a break down of my first (almost) 90 days.

I have been drinking for about ten years. Never been a heavy drinker as in like every day but i did binge. Sometimes a few nights a week. Sometimes weekends only. Sometimes for a month straight. It would vary. When I would drink it would be 7 drinks in a couple of hours or 15 (give or take a few) in an evening. My goal was to get completely fucked up, and do it fast. It was often times followed up with a joint or a bowl. (Going off green as well. Used for ten years as well but more frequent than alcohol). This helped the night continue. Gave me a burst of energy. Then crash in my bed and sleep like a champion (so I thought). 

I can tell you from my experience that the first three weeks of this recovery sucked big time. I had a lot of physical symptoms like head ache, nauseous, throwing up, clammy all over, no hope. It sucked ass. Had delirium tremens which freaked me the hell out. Felt an impending sense of DOOM! Total confusion and disoriented. Thought I was on the verge of death. Believed I was having a heart attack or brain was about to explode or something crazy. Seriously worried about it and on day 7 I went to the hospital. They did blood work on me because I was withdrawing and they wanted to take all the precautions. The blood work came back and nothing abnormal. Doctor basically said you are fine physically and these symptoms will go away. I thought to myself great, but I still want to die and I feel like shit. Also no warning of Paws. Days 7-21 the symptoms gradually went away, also no desire or temptation to drink or smoke. 

After three weeks I felt fairly good but still kind of meh. Had depression, anxiety, irritability but it wasn’t over whelming. I was enjoying being outside working in the yard and being somewhat active. That kept me sane. No desire or temptation to drink. It was like I was just coasting/auto-pilot. Work was going ok. Not thriving at it but not failing. This probably went on from day 21-65. 

Day 65-70. Felt like I had life by the horns. Happy go lucky. Enjoyed people’s company more. Very active and wanting to accomplish things. I was mentally in tune and became a problem solver at work. Took on work projects and personal home projects. Things were good. No brain fog. Slept really well. I thought to myself this is what being happy feels like. I had a deep sense of gratitude come over me. It was amazing. This is exactly why I quit drinking. And then on the night of day 70 I literally felt all of the good leave and the onset of hell coming on.

Day 71-present. I’ve never felt more depression, anxiety, insomnia, irritability, lack of drive, anhedonia and complete misery in my life. Unable to focus at work and falling behind, missing deadlines. No desire to see anyone. Everything bugs me. No energy to do anything. Nothings brings me joy. My hobbies do nothing for me. I feel like I am destined to feel like shit forever. So sick of how I was feeling that I went to the doctor. (Note: different doctor. I relocated because of coronavirus and could work remotely) I told him what I was going through. They did blood work again to make sure no vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. Found out today the blood work came back pristine.

So ive determines paws is ass. I can’t believe how shitty I feel. I’ve done periods of no sugar or caffeine to see if that helps and nothing noticeable when I refrained. I don’t eat out much. Once a week maybe twice. Eat fairly clean and cook at home. I eat fruits and vegetables. I don’t exercise much. I have asthma and that hinders that a little. I have inhalers and they work somewhat. I have to admit that exercising is one area that I could improve and would help my symptoms. 

Won’t lie, I see people’s posts with roughly the same amount of time of abstinence. They’re shitting rainbows and flying with unicorns. I know no journey is the same but just seems like I may be doing something wrong. It kind of discourages me. Can honestly say though that I have had zero desire or temptation to go back to alcohol this whole time. Occasionally I think a joint would be nice but I throw the thought away.

I welcome any comments or questions. Happy to talk about it. Would love to hear other people’s experience with Paws and things that worked for them. Live fast die last!

If I can do this, you can do this.","Hi y’all, I don’t post here often and I have no flair for counting my days. I read posts and comment from time to time, both to help others and to remember where I come from. 

Today marks 11 years since I’ve had a drink. I endured frequent, although relatively brief, periods of incarceration. I endured homelessness for months on end (the kind where I set up camp in a tent because no couches were offered). I endured the loss of close friends and the disappointment of wonderful family members. The despair, humiliation, and utter hopelessness of my situation was suffocating. 

I spent the first half of 2009 living in a tent along a creekbed. I stole to eat and to feed my habits. I lived in fear of dying alone and having my family receive news that my body had been found. I was broken in every way a human being could be broken. I felt relief when I would get arrested and looked forward to the comfort of shared barracks and warm food in county jail. 

My life, like may of yours, changed when I found help. I embraced AA and worked through my religious skepticism. I found comfort in a fellowship of people that could relate. I worked steps and participated as if my life depended on it. I sponsored men and gave freely of what was given to me. I continue to practice spiritual principles in my affairs to the best of my ability and I share freely when others are suffering in hopes that I might help them find what I’ve found. 

My life today would be unrecognizable to the 33 year old version of myself that walked into a meeting 11 years ago. I have stable employment with a fantastic company in an industry I love. I have friends and family members that trust me and share their live with me. I am a father to two beautiful daughters that have never seen me loaded. I have a partner that loves me and, while she’s not an alcoholic, understands what I’ve been through because I’ve shared openly with her about my past. I have a sense of peace and self worth that I never found in a bag or a bottle. 

If you can relate to any of this, if you’re struggling, if the idea of putting together any significant amount sobriety is intimidating, I’m here to tell you that it’s possible. Life can change, you can change, and recovery from that hopelessness is the greatest joy I’ve ever experienced. 

I’m grateful today. I am grateful for my past and my present. I’m optimistic for the future. I am content with my circumstances and I strive to be a better man than I was yesterday. Don’t suffer in silence. There’s people who are willing to help. Thank you to everyone in recovery that has ever helped me, the debt I owe is immeasurable.

I'm a manager, and my top team member came to me and said the staff weren't sure who would return; calm and understanding me (sober) or militant me (drunk/hungover). He was happy to tell me that everyone was very pleased that I'm still calm and understanding. 

It's a hard road but the rewards are real and come in many forms.

ETA: Thank you all so much for sharing your kind thoughts, experiences and advice with me. 0% beer is not as such a trigger for me however I am concerned that 0.5% alcohol may be, even if it's purely psychosomatic as I take a lot of pride in myself being free of alcohol. If anyone has any more summery cold savoury drink suggestions please drop them below.

I usually hang out over at r/cripplingalcoholism, but recently I've been trying to get off the bottle so I can keep my head straight and concentrate on getting my work done which is much easier to do sober than hungover!

Anyways, thought I'd just share an experience and ask a quick question: I'm on Day 6 of not drinking, the first 2-3 days were pretty bad, but it got a lot better and with the help of some melatonin I was able to sleep through my usual withdrawal insomnia.

However, for some reason this morning even though it's Day 6, I literally felt like I woke up on the wrong side of the bed. Now honestly there's a lot going on, especially due to the pandemic situation. There's an enormous amount of changes and upheavals taking place at my office since I'm considered an essential worker. Due to the usual office politics/drama/nonsense and plus COVID19 on top of all that, the atmosphere is considerably much more tense than usual. Hence why I've begun to try to stop drinking, so I can think clearer to help navigate the muddy waters!

But despite that, I honestly don't think I can put all the blame on that. Honestly, I have to admit I've been through this kind of thing before where after I've honestly analyzed it, it seems to be a major depressive episode where I'll violently swing between being insanely angry and silently cursing at everybody I hate (Goddammit!  Why the fuck do I have to take orders from this moron!) to just uncontrollably sobbing sad (Oh god why? Nobody loves me!), and then a huge torrent of negative thoughts (Well why would they ever love you? How could they? Just look at yourself! You're so fucking fat and hideous! You're just as ugly on the inside as you are on the outside! The only reason they keep you around is to make them money! The only reason they pretend to like you is BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW YOU! If they ever found out you're secret, if they ever found out who you really are, you'd get your ass canned from work in an instant!)

And this is sometimes preceded or followed by an insanely upbeat manic episode where I feel like I'm on top of the world and I feel like I can fucking do anything!

&#x200B;

**TLDR**; Is it normal even after the initial intense phase of withdrawal fades away to still have these kind of depressive episodes? Even up to the 6th day?

I’m 33, a high functioning alcoholic, no kids, and I just lost my job due to COVID. I was packaged out and decided to take the summer off to “work on me”. 

Let me tell you a bit about me (and maybe why I drink). I’m a great professional with multiple diplomas and certifications under my belt. I’ve built teams and managed them! All while under the influence. Working from home is a bitch. I’ve been drinking for almost 20 years but fast forward to 2020 I’m like “hey this is bad I need to change”. I need to add I have suffered from ADHD, anxiety, depression and borderline OCD( due to alcoholism? 🙃 who knows.)

So I got a team of physicians and therapist to help me identify my problems. I drink to much to stop. I consume approximately 16-20 standard drinks a day and I’m trying to cut down. It sucks and it’s freaking hard. I’ve been seeing a therapist and substance abuse doctor as well as my counsellor and GP to get help. 

I was referred to detox. I’m on the wait list. I am so fucking scared. I tried to stop on my own but I get the tremors, hot/cold flashes and what feels like a seizure/panic attack. My psychiatrist recommended I don’t stop abruptly and when I’m ready go to detox start switching from Vodka to beer (which I’ve done but it’s hard) and to lower my drinks by one per week, I’m trying....

I’m terrified. I’m a professional and I let it slip this far I feel like a failure. I’ve told everyone important to me the last few weeks about the alcohol abuse and they are super supportive but this sucks guys. My father was a full blown alcoholic who ruined our family and here I am....

Any support or suggestions for therapy/treatment/detox is greatly appreciated. 

I’m on the short list for detox.",5

I have had a somewhat complicated relationship with alcohol since the beginning. At some points, it felt like alcohol was taking over too much. I didn't binge drink, but when I started, I couldn't stop. You all probably know what I'm talking about. I couldn't do the classy glass of wine with dinner or just a couple of beers with my friends. It always led to me being the one, who lured my friends for another drink and another, just because I didn't want the fun to stop. Of course, it almost always led to no fun at all. Not only the hangover part but the stupid shit I said and did. It hurt me and people around me. So I did the mature thing and found an AA meeting close to me. I went there a couple of times, heard the stories, realized that I didn't have it thought at all, but at the same time, got really scared and figured that I didn't want to wake up in some ditch one day.

Didn't drink for around 2-3 years. But then I sort of forgot what I had learned - I thought I'm older now, I know what I'm doing. I can handle it. Till it was clear again that I can't handle it. While I was on a vacation, even though I had a legit reason (a creepy guy made a rapey pass on me at the beach) I didn't know how to handle the situation, drank whiskey like water, and created a huge drama.

The next day I felt ashamed, worried, and disappointed. 

Somehow I had tricked myself into thinking that I'm allowed to drink and it had almost cost too much.

So I've been sober for 449 days. 

Some people in my life still don't understand why - they think that alcoholism is a brand you attach only to the unemployed, homeless people, who have lost it all. That's not true. An alcoholic is any person who suffers from alcoholism.

I think I didn't drink because I craved fun. I wanted escapism from the worries, the sadness in life. And that sadness hasn't gone anywhere. It's still there, but without alcohol, I have to deal with it. And in the process, there is a chance to heal. 

I've been sober for 449 days.

And I realize that I don't celebrate this victory often enough. So this is me trying to give myself some credit and allowing to admit that it's good.

I dont drink everyday but probably 3-5 days per week. However once I start I just don't stop. Hell even last night I went to a friend's house for ""1 or 2"" and ended up back home 7 hours later after closing down the bar. 

I wake up every morning after drinking just absolutely hating myself and resolving that this time I'm going to quit only to end up back at it the next day. I am so frustrated with myself and just sick of it. 

I feel like I've completely lost myself to alcohol. I've always been really shy and had trouble relating to people but I feel like its gotten so much worse now that I've relied on alcohol to basically be my personality for the last 12ish years. The thought of going to dinner or coffee with anyone and having a conversation without the aid of drinks is honestly straight up terrifying to me.

I dont really have friends I just have drinking buddies. None of them are interested in doing anything unless it involves alcohol. My partner is the only person I ever hang out with sober but she also has no interest in quitting and often pressures me to drink sometimes.

I guess all this to say I'm scared that if I quit drinking I will be totally alone. I dont feel like I have a personality without drinking so I don't know how to make new friends. 

So all in all I'm just wondering if anyone dealt with anything similar at the beginning of their sobriety and how you coped and made it through. Just feeling like it's hopeless right now.",5

I'd say I'm having a good week.,"If you told me two years ago that I'd have 500 days sober some time in 2020, I'd never have believed it. Deep down I knew I should probably address my drinking but as long as I didn't think too hard about it, I could continue to ignore it and carry on. I've told this story here before but it's worth saying again.

I wasn't a bottle-of-vodka-for-breakfast sort of drinker. Really, I had just come to realize that I had become an almost daily drinker plus bingeing badly at parties, etc. One beer easily turned into two or three. I slept terribly. I had internal pangs at night (I thought was gas but may have been my liver complaining), I woke up at 3am with dry-mouth and a fuzzy sweater feeling on my teeth. Blech. In the morning I'd think ""why do I do this to myself?"" 

Rinse and repeat.

Like most of us, I'm in a few groups on Facebook. I'm in one that addresses building healthy habits. One woman wanted to discuss alcohol intake and another lady said she had just read Sober Curious by Ruby Warrington and it helped her. I immediately thought it was a clever title. It might be the answer to trying on sobriety to see what it felt like. It was also a perfect storm of my attempting a Dry January and when I tracked it, I only had four days that I didn't drink... I started reading the book and in it, she walked me through almost every situation where you would normally drink and deeply examined what that would look like without alcohol. It took away some of the fear for me. The longer I read, the more I looked forward to the challenge because sobriety seemed plausible. Besides, if I decided it wasn't for me, I didn't have to commit. I was just kicking the tires. I was being Sober Curious.

Fast forward a few weeks, I've not had a drink, I have an app on my phone, I'm facing those actual situations that I was previously mulling over while reading the book and I'd had joined a few sober living Facebook groups. Which is where I saw the recommendation for this sub. Checking in here daily in the beginning was so necessary for me. It was good to read, and digest and encourage. I could forgive myself for my drunken blunders and be proud of waking up in the morning and not worry that I was a lousy mom or if I said something I shouldn't have the night before. It didn't fix all the problems in my life but boy has life gotten better for quitting.

If you're on the cusp. If you're deciding if you should be giving this up or like me, you ""don't even really drink that much"" but it's more than you probably should... Try sobriety on for awhile. Be curious. Read a few books about it. Hang out here. Ask those questions of us and of yourself and be really, really honest about the answers.

Sorry this got a little longer than I intended but if you read this far, thanks! Have a good one, guys!",42

Three words that made me quit.,"It has been more than one year since I last drank alcohol. This phrase may be overused, but I could not have done this without all of you. Towards the beginning, I was checking in on this sub multiple times each day. I have probably posted more than 1000 times. Every one of them was worth it. I am indebted to all of you. Thank you.

If you are reading this post, you may have doubts. But I promise you that you can do it. And you’re worth it. You deserve to be sober.

Those are some of the most powerful words I read on this sub. I posted a while back that there were three words that made me quit drinking alcohol. Several people responded that the post was very meaningful to them, so I thought I would share the thought again. I’m not sure if I can capture it like I did before, but here it is.

I hate myself. 

I quit drinking because I don’t ever want to say those three words again. Towards the end of my drinking, I was out of control. I would wake up with that feeling all of us know. Those words were the only way to describe how I felt. Sometimes it was four. I fucking hate myself. 

I set rules for myself, and I broke them. I tried to moderate, and I failed. I came up with every excuse possible to continue drinking. Yet everything I did brought me back to those three words, each and every time. 

Now that I’m not drinking, I don’t have to say those words anymore. In sobriety, I have hope for the first time in years.

When I was drinking, I let myself go. I gained a lot of weight. I got into dangerous debt. Those were all behaviors of a person who wasn’t thinking of the future. A person who does not think of the future is a person who does not have hope. Hope is the belief that the future will be better than the present. At the end of my drinking, the only thing that alcohol reliably brought me was hopelessness. 

And because of that, I choose not to drink. I make this choice every day. I don’t know if I will ever drink alcohol again. I certainly don’t want to considering how miserable I was. If I had continued to drink like I was, I might not be alive. 

If there is any advice that made the difference for me, it’s that you only have to choose not to drink for today. Nobody can promise anything beyond that. Nobody. The beauty of that rule is that whether you have one day sober, or 20 years, everyone is in the same position. When your head hits your pillow sober at night, you have done all that you can do. You have won that day. 

When I chose to post this on this sub today, I saw that there are nearly 235,000 members in this community. I hope I have brought hope to at least one of you. You can do this. You’re worth it.",470

2020-06-18 11:06:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hbgcon/three_years_ago_today_was_the_last_day_i_had_a/,Three Years Ago Today Was The Last Day I Had a Drink,"Three years ago today — June 18, 2017 — I woke up on my friend's sofa in Washington, D.C. I had a horrific hangover. The night before, the 17th, I'd come to on the floor of his building's lobby after a day of heavy drinking. I couldn't remember how I ended up there. Later, I found out that I had gone to a bar — an experience I blacked out completely. I felt like shit.

My friend and I went to a beer garden for brunch, where I drank four more beers in order to ""take the edge off."" I would have had more, but I needed to catch my bus back home to New York City. It was a hot, sticky, summer day, and I can still remember how sweaty and gross I felt on the bus trip back. My friends were laughing, reliving the night, telling me how funny I was when I was drunk. But I wasn't in the mood. I just knew that I never wanted to feel that way again.

The next day, the 19th, was day one. Tomorrow will be three years sober. 

I had been thinking of giving up drinking for the previous six months or so, and had even completed a ""Dry January"" — with a couple of cheat days mixed in, of course. The experience taught me that I was capable of remaining sober on a given day when I decided that I wouldn't drink. In fact, I found it easier to have zero drinks than to try to have one, or two, or four.

But after January ended, I went back to my old routine. In early March, I went to Mexico for a beach vacation with a group of friends, where I proceeded to pass out at the dinner table multiple nights. A month later, I'd gone to a bar on a Friday after work to meet a friend, who wanted to introduce me to a couple of her girlfriends. I remember very little about this night — I even blacked out my Uber ride home. The next day, my friend told me that I had fallen off the barstool, offended one of her friends by staring at her breasts, and began babbling incoherently. Get your drinking under control, she urged me. If you don't, our friendship is over.

A month later, a woman I'd been interested in invited me to spend the day with her at a beach bungalow she'd rented. I desperately wanted to go. But I woke up so hungover that I had to cancel, filling me with intense regret. In desperation, I messaged two old friends who had posted publicly on Facebook about their involvement in Alcoholics Anonymous. Both urged me to check out a meeting. I thought about it, but didn't. A good friend of mine was having a party and I wanted to go. 

That night, smashed once again, I suddenly decided that I was starving and that I needed to eat a slice at the pizza place across the street. I opened my friend's door and sprinted across the road. I heard a car swerve to avoid me. ""You fucking idiot!"" the driver shouted. I was shaken, but only momentarily. I went in and got the slice and then went back for a few more hours of drinking.

I did go to a meeting a few days later, in the basement of a church a few blocks from my apartment. I was absolutely terrified. I sat in the back and vowed to say nothing. I had imagined that the meeting would consist of crusty old men, but instead, I found a representative sample of my neighborhood's demographic. I couldn't bring myself to acknowledge that I was an alcoholic, but when a fellow handed me the Big Book I gamely read aloud. I walked home and drank from this bottle of Mezcal that I'd brought from Mexico. But it planted a seed.

The trip to D.C. was that weekend. My friend had invited me down for a reunion barbecue with a bunch of our friends from graduate school. It'd be a full-day affair with plenty of drinking, and I was determined not to get too drunk. I worked out a plan to alternate a full bottle of water for every beer that I drank, and to take breaks. But after the first two or three beers, I abandoned my plan and just began drinking the way that I liked to drink: quickly and without interruption. Looking back, it was then that I first realized how powerless I was over alcohol as soon as I had that first drink. 

I got drunk for the first time when I was 15. I was 22 when I had the first inkling that I might have had a problem — that I didn't drink like other people. I shrugged and carried on for 14 years before getting sober at 36. I'm now 39, a full-fledged member of Alcoholics Anonymous, and grateful on a daily basis for my sobriety.

I just wanted to share my story in case it's of use to anyone who is still sick and suffering. Much love to you all.",120

But when others are drinking, I almost feel like I need to drink too. And trying to keep a caloric deficit is really tough when I'm just drinking beer after beer.

2020-06-18 10:24:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hbfk7c/90_days_thanks_to_sd/,90 Days thanks to SD,"This is my first time posting, but reaching 90 days feels like a good time to share. At the beginning of the pandemic I had reached a low as far as my drinking was concerned. 

For 15 years I was a heavy and daily drinker. My drinking went up and down over 20 years, and I thought I had figured out how to control it. I started at specific times, I had a limit of 8 beers per night, limit 1-2 drinks in sensitive social situations, purchasing enough supplies ensuring I would not need to leave the house, etc. I found myself anxious if I had to do things in the evening... dating, social/work events, and at the time I thought my anxiety was related to everything but my drinking, and I know I sure loved getting home and slamming a few beers to get caught up. Obviously, drinking had become the only way I felt normal. I no longer felt hungover, I also managed to lose nearly 100 lbs almost 2 years ago, this actually turned out to be an overlooked primer for the problem I eventually developed. I continued to drink like I was 100 lbs heavier, with periods of reduced drinking because of my health kick. I managed to reduce my daily total from 8-9 beers to 3-4. Still way too much for a 42 year old female, and I was never able to maintain that level consistently for more than a few weeks. It should have been a wake-up call that I had the willpower to eat well and exercise diligently, but nearly completely lacked the ability and desire to not get drunk. 

During those 15 years, I completed a very stressful PhD, moved multiple times for grad school and started an amazing job. I was incredibly high functioning, or so I thought because of my professional accomplishments. 

I wasn’t okay, and it became obvious after moving in with my partner a year ago. I was single for most 10/15 years of heavy drinking. We moved in together and I initially cut back considerably (although he was taken aback by how much I still drank, yikes!). About 6 months into living together I started picking up habits that I didn’t have before- hiding my drinking, drinking during the day, drinking hard liquor, and eventually needing to have several drinks before even leaving the house. During the last 3 months of drinking I was no longer super productive, and I was miserable. It wasn’t unusual for me to get up with every intention of going to work sober, then decide to just have a shot to get going, then just another before the shower, then another before leaving the house... the next thing you know I’m working from home for the day (& drinking more), and everything is good until about 3-4 hours later when I start to hate myself and just cry myself to passing out. During this time my short-term memory went to shit and my cognitive abilities were severely impacted, I was doing serious brain damage. 

After a series of drunken arguments with my partner and me saying some pretty horrific things (most of which I did not remember), and my partner planning on leaving (which was a reasonable thing for him to consider at that time), it had become so clear to me that the life I love was in serious danger. I knew that I may not be able to repair everything by quitting drinking, but I also knew that I was going to die if I didn’t quit, and that it would be much sooner than anyone would ever guess. My last day of drinking included such an incredible amount of alcohol, I can’t believe I didn’t get sick or die. 

Most people who know me really well know that I like my beer. My immediate family has always had some concerns, but rarely saw anything that  would raise huge red flags. My partner knew I was a heavy drinker, but had no idea about the amount and frequency that I managed to cover up my drinking. 

So, what do you do if you have to stop drinking right away at the beginning of a pandemic? Detox was out of the question, and any meds like benzos were out of the question for reasons related to having a child in the house at the time.  I decided to taper over the course of 5 days. The tapering was the most mentally exhausting summoning of personal will that I’ve ever had to call upon. I did it, and I did it successfully because of this group. My first few weeks were just waking up determined not to drink, and determined to deal with cravings. Not much really worked, except reading the posts on this sub. Every day I started out reading this sub, and just read until I felt like I was able to go about the next few hours of my day without a drink. Early on, I might have read SD, in that way 3-5 times a day. 

Right now I’m focused on dealing with my deep underlying issues related my desire to drink. I’m working on developing coping skills. I don’t really have any big insights about alcohol, I’m just sharing my story, just in case someone in those early days is reading and needs to feel a little less alone today.

It’s a beautiful day, life goes on, and life is meant for the living. I’m incredibly grateful for this community.",28

-appreciation: I appreciate everything far more (not that I did not before) - my wife, my house, my work, my yard, being fit, being stable. I did not lose everything to drinking ...yet. It needs to stay that way because I have so much good in my life. Why throw that away?
-inner peace: someone else posted this recently and i couldn’t agree more- that finding myself at peace has been an incredible leap forward. No self deprecation (unless as a joke), no self bad talk, etc. just moving forward everyday and looking forward to everyday not being hungover, an anxious disaster or some overture Of guilt. Just...calm. It’s beautiful.

Things I’m still working on and struggling with:
-emotional and mental issues: sobriety doesn’t solve everything. Just allows you to approach these issues head on. But issues nonetheless. 
-telling people: I’ve told nobody except a select few people. I still fear judgment and rejection, or how this may alter certain relationships. But am slowly coming to terms with what could happen...sobriety comes first and my well being and if people reject that, they never cared anyway.
-fear of relapse: I’ll just say this...I am not motivated by fear of failing, but by each and every success I have (no matter how major or minor). One day at a time. Sometimes one hour at a time. 

I also just want to give thanks to this thread for doing what you do and allowing me to resonate with most of what I read here and for those that take the courage to share. It’s a collective of incredible people trying to do the extraordinary and lead a better life. For the betterment of ourselves and others. So thank you all.

I have a good friend that we’d have our drunken get togethers, hook up and repeat. Things were never official so there were blurred lines (which was fueled by drinking). I was blinded by a lot of things but I didn’t realize how much alcohol was the center of me being attractive to them mentally and physically. 

My friend isn’t a bad guy but now that I’m no longer drinking I see how much he identifies with it and turns me off completely. It’s sad to see but I cannot change that. I can only show him how it’s improved my life and hopefully encourages him.

I never realized how many people identify drinking as a personality trait and unfortunately he is one of them.

My eyes are wide open now and I’m very thankful for that. Honestly many good things have changed in my life because I no longer drink but this has been very rewarding as I have a clearer judgement on people and my surroundings.

Well, how did I get here?

One year ago I hurt my back and was in bed for two days. I was reading everything I could find about syatic nerve damage. One thing I went into a rabbit hole 🐇 for was alcohol and how damaging it is if you have any long term disabilities. It causes constant inflamation in the body so you can not heal.

Holy shit. Was I go to be like this forever cause I was clinging to alcohol?!? I decided it’s not worth it and quit.

Turns out it was muscular and not nerve damage and I was okay after a few months.

When I gave up booze I quickly realized how much it took from me. I spent so much time planning to drink... drinking... recovering from drinking. I spent most days in the quicksand of a day long hangover.

Now, I fill my time with films, biking and yoga. I am fucking flush with money and energy!

I was caught in a loop of spending money on alcohol and bad food when hungover. So much money spent on that on a weekly basis. Crazy amonts of money spent to feel like shit all day. Jesus. It makes me shake my head at the wasted time sitting I my apt alone. Drinking. Sitting in my apt alone. Recovering from drinking. 

I’m so fucking happy now!! 
If you are just starting your sober journey, push tru the first two weeks.
What got me thru the first few months any time the craving was sooooo bad I was gonna cave ito it was this:  the feeling of craving a drink is a thousand times better than the feeling of a hangover.

I love this sub. It literally held my virtual hand for a year and got me here.

Thank you to everyone on this sub.

There's a million thoughts, questions, hopes and intentions I have at the moment. But to keep it brief for now, I was dogsitting for a friend two nights ago whose husband has a richly stocked and varied booze cupboard. Having abstained from the chocolate and crisps cupboard, i ""rewarded"" myself with a cheeky gin. Needless to say before long it turned into pints of gin and tequila with a splash of juice.

The next day I cooked a chilli and just stood in the kitchen for an hour in an absolute mind fog. A daze. I had a bottle of vodka at the beginning of the week too and have been very tired and sleeping excessively. I've just had this listless, restless, numb, slightly confused feeling, like the ""why did I come into this room again?"" feeling, but very prolonged. 

I've only just accepted that my dependence on booze is an issue. My weight is skyrocketing because of it which has been the alarm bell for some time. But now I'm conscious of it and more accepting rather than in denial because I ""don't drink every day"", I'm starting to notice how brain dead I'm feeling and everything is such a laboured effort.

I hope it gets easier... I want to be more mindful and address all the root causes of these addictions now, I'm tired of ultimately damaging coping mechanisms.

I clearly need it, but if anyone reads to the end, thank you.

I got invited to a party tomorrow night. I see two potential outcomes:

I go to the party. To do this, first I have to make it through the day tomorrow. Days haven’t been easy lately. My husband was informed he’s being let go from his job on Friday, which makes me the solo bread winner until he finds something new. Currently he has no leads. My job has also been relentlessly stressful the last few weeks; I work in a healthcare adjacent industry, and now that things are starting to normalize a bit everything has exploded. Some of my clients want out of their contracts. Others just think everything is an issue, no matter how small. Everyday has been like this for the last three weeks. Tomorrow will be no different; tomorrow will be stressful.

After that, I’ll have to cancel my yoga class. I’m already too late to cancel without a penalty, so I’ll be out $25 for a class I won’t be able to go to.  This has been my one hour of reprieve lately, one hour where I focus on nothing but my own body and my own mental health. I’ll feel the effects of not going, and I’ll miss my favorite class with my favorite teacher.

I’ll replace that time with stress about what to wear, making sure my makeup is done, whether or not I’ll be tempted to drink. I’ll be tempted to pre-game with wine the whole time. Maybe I will, maybe I won’t.

I’ll go to the party and tell myself I won’t drink. I just told these friends a few weeks ago that I stopped, but maybe this is an okay excuse. I’ll bring soda water but question whether or not I want it.

My husband’s ex will be there, that he still lived with when we met. They don’t talk anymore, but she still clearly despises me for ruining her relationship with her “best friend.” The back story to this would have been Reddit relationship_advice gold if I’d been on reddit a few years ago. It’s a small group, so I’ll be forced to interact with her. It will stress me out in ways I don’t need on top of everything else right now. I will end up taking a shot of vodka, and once that door is open I won’t know when to stop. She’ll say something snarky to get under my skin, so I’ll pour a couple extra fingers in my next drink. I’ll down a couple more while everyone is outside and no one is looking. I’ll feel like shit, but I won’t stop.

I’ll get mad at my husband for something stupid. I’ll probably get mad at everyone there for something stupid. I’ll sulk, and when I get home I’ll cry in the bathroom alone. Maybe I’ll have a panic attack, which I haven’t had in the 6 months since I quit. Maybe I’ll take a Xanax when I get home and feel even worse until I pass out.

Either way, I’ll spend $40 on an Uber home because my husband doesn’t have a job anymore and he can’t afford it. I can’t really either, because my husband doesn’t have a job anymore and I have bills to pay. I’ll seethe over this compounded with whatever small things I’ve assembled to get mad about over the last few hours.

I’ll stumble into bed and maybe I’ll sleep for a few hours before I wake up in the middle of the night to throw up in the toilet. Is this the first time? The third? It doesn’t matter. It won’t be the last.

I’ll lay in bed awake, feeling like shit, thinking about how I have to set my counter back to 0. Well, maybe tomorrow. A glass of wine at noon might help me feel better for today.

By the time my alarm goes off Friday morning, I’ll have fallen back asleep just long enough to feel groggier than ever. I’ll try to get away with as little work as possible the next few hours, putting myself more behind than I already am. I have an important meeting in the afternoon I won’t be prepared for. I’ll still be throwing up bright yellow bile by 3pm, so I’ll cancel Friday night’s yoga class too. Goodbye another $25. I’ll also shoot my husband $20 to go pick up another box of wine for the house, so we can “just chill” when we both get off work. I’ll drink all weekend. I’ll drink before our Father’s Day lunch with my in-laws and say stupid things I’ll half remember. I’ll keep feeling like garbage. I don’t know how long that feeling will last, but it’ll be at least three days into my next period of recovery, because I’ll probably go long enough to need to detox yet again.

OR. OR. I can take a different option.

I tell my friend I can’t go to the birthday party she scheduled on a Thursday night one day in advance. She’ll be mad, but I’ll remind myself I don’t need to drop everything for the whims of people who don’t really talk to you when they don’t want something anyway.

I’ll still have a shit day at work. There are some problems that not drinking can’t make go away, but at least the drinking isn’t there to make them worse.

I’ll use the time after work before class to spend some time on some responsibilities for my volunteer job that pays a good portion of my rent. I’ll be ready to finalize some deliverables for it this weekend, that I’d otherwise put off to next week.

I’ll go to my yoga class. It’s my favorite class style with my favorite teacher. I’ll sweat a lot and it’ll kick my ass in the best way possible. By the end I’ll be a heap on the floor, and I’ll have let go of most of my stress from the day.

I’ll come home, unwind with some video games, and eat some good, healthy food I feel good about. I forgot to mention the pizza I inevitably ate in option one, but no matter what I eat, I’ll feel better about it than that. 

I’ll still stay up later than I should, but when I do sleep it’ll be restful. I’ll be prepared for another day, making it through. I’ll be a better wife, more prepared to encourage my husband rather than getting mad at him for something out of his control. I’ll avoid a shitty confrontation with a person who did her best to make my life hell for years. I’ll spend some time petting my cats instead. I’ll be happy it’s another sober weekend, spent with my amazing in-laws, with only another week before I get to celebrate my sixth month sober-versary.

I think I know which option I want to pick. If you made it this far, thanks for reading, and I hope you’ll pick the best options for yourself this weekend too. Love you all and I’m eternally grateful for this space.",64

For 3-4 years I’ve considered myself a minimalist and have been rejecting the materialist, over-consuming society we live in for a more intentional life. I’m careful about my purchases and always ask myself if having an object will bring value to my life. 

For this reason I have donated things that do not serve me, like dresses I spent good money on but are not my style any longer. Or refusing to buy uni-tasker kitchen appliances. 

This is the same mentality that lead me to delete Facebook and other social media accounts; they do not help me love any better; they do not bring value to my life. 

I did not always apply this same way of thinking to my alcohol misuse; even though alcohol gave me anxiety on more than one occasion, or hiccups combined with heartburn that wouldn’t quit after consuming a little too much red wine. Or the fact I have some loved ones that are truly addicted to it. 

The truth is, alcohol does not bring value to my life. I started realizing this more and more over the past year or two as I’ve been tapering off of it and have done many 30 day challenges easily without it. I’m a reader and I see how in non fiction and fiction alike, drinking so often leads to the demise of a person. 

The buzz one feels after drinking is not anywhere comparable to connecting with a friend, getting closer to God, learning a new skill, or being a healthier individual.

Some things work for me in times of craving, namely a nice tasty non-alcoholic drink.  The thing is, I know the concept of mock-tails and have seen some pretty elaborate recipes.  I'm a simple guy.  A seltzer base or ice water is fine for me usually. Lately I've muddled fresh mint, add some crushed ice and a little squeeze of lemon, and then water.  Bam.  Refreshing and tasty.  Does anybody have any surprisingly simple drink tricks that aren't overly dependent on added sugar?  I like the refreshment of things like grapefruit, strawberry, lemons, but more as accents.

Had it not been for this group, I’m not sure I would have gotten past the first month. But after a few months it stopped being hard and I’ve just really enjoyed not drinking. 
So -What has changed? Well, I thought I would lose weight, I haven’t (so that’s my next big project). But people who see me, say I look radiant, happier and healthier. 
I feel much more stable emotionally and my relationships are all in a much better state than before. 
I’m still single, but also feel that I haven’t been ready to start dating yet (my alcohol intake and subsequent mental and emotional instability was a big part of why my relationship went awry, because alcohol brought out the worst in me).
My business is thriving and I have the energy for it, whereas before I struggled with patience. 
And best of all, my daughter hasn’t said anything, but she seems safer and happier, and we’re much closer now. 
The stability of sobriety was so new at first, that it would sometimes make me a little antsy, but now I just love it so much. This is the stuff of a good life. 
Oh, and with all those non alcoholic beverages out there, I think it’s never been easier to enjoy a drink without the personal cost.

My wife, daughter and I rented a camp for the whole month of June.  Early on I struggled.  Two relapses.  3 days and 4 days.  No structure here, camp neighbors drinking at the beach every night.  Party boats.  Fireworks.  Thought I could sneak and sip on vodka.  Made a fool of my self by the end of each night (well in my mind I did) and then hid for days to come off it.  

I really almost went home.  I wasnt sure if I could turn it around.  Anyway, the last two days I spent busy, working from home (camp) cooking dinner, running errands, brief swims and some kayaking in the morning.  

Front story

Tonight, I decided to venture down to the shared beach with the drinking neighbors.  Talked a little bit with everyone as they were getting a buzz.  My daughter wanted to fish at dusk.  Sober me is a bit anxious, on edge and wondering if I could really help her fish with all the nerves.  I swim her out a bit to a big set of rocks, she is 10 and wouldnt be able to get the rod out there by herself, and set her up to cast.  Everyone is watching, or laughing paying attention I dont know.  The guys are probably all probably better fisherman than me, at least when I'm not drinking anyway.

I went back to closer to shore to give her space.  I'm looking for another lure.  We haven't caught anything big yet, just a couple little bass and sunfish near the beach.  All the sudden she says DAD!  I got a big one I think!  I dive in the water to swim to the rock.  Her rod is bent right over.  Big smallmouth.  I climb up on the rock and guide her as she plays it toward me.  I am shaking at this point.  How can i handle this moment 6 DAYS off a binge?  I get the fish wondering if I am going to try to have her hold it for a picture.  Held it up and there was no way for a smooth pass.  Everybody is watching.  My wife is running for her phone.  

SLITHER... SLIP... MR. BASS IS BACK IN THE LAKE.  No picture.  Fuck.  Failure.  Ahs oooohs from the beach.  

I stayed down there for a bit.  Started to get pissed.  Thinkin that if i was drinking, i would've made that picture HAPPEN!

My kid was so excited.  I was lost for a few minutes, couldn't process at all.  I just put her to bed.  She is so happy.  

AND I AM STILL NOT DRINKING TONIGHT.",5

Before Covid I drank everyday, but in my mind I was still in control because I was very rarely drunk and was meeting all my obligations. I know that one glass of wine will turn into an entire bottle so I will no longer put myself in that position. My struggle right now is thinking about wine constantly.

I am (was?) a heavy drinker since I was 24 (I’m about to turn 30). It started out rather innocuously; I’d party a lot as a newly single lady and that meant lots of binge drinking with the occasional few sober days between. When my mother passed suddenly 2 years ago I really ramped up my drinking. It has gotten progressively worse to where I could drink anywhere between 1/4 of a fifth-1/2 of hard liquor a day with the smattering of a few beers/glasses of wine in between. I might take a few days “off”; ya know, no hard liquor *eye roll*...but very, very few days REALLY off. I did challenge myself to two weeks without a drink a few months ago to prove I wasn’t physically dependent, and had no issues other than cravings. This time, well this time I’m scared. The anxiety has me crawling out of my skin. I threw up for what seemed like the entirety of 24 hours. I shook relentlessly in bed wondering what “bug” I caught. Worst of all, I just feel that sense of impending doom, ya know? Nothing eases my mind and while I initially went into the ER for vomiting blood from what I assumed was a virus...I think I may have actually caught alcoholism. PLEASE TELL ME IT GETS BETTER. Everything I’ve read has said I should feel better by now...which I do ever so slightly because I’m not puking my guts up, but I’m also unable to eat and feel as if I’m losing my mind.",9

Now that I’m transitioning back home, to a place a place I’m unhappy with, and losing some of the structure I’ve relied on, I’m terrified I’ll fall off the wagon and have to start again.

What gives me hope - I’ve lost weight and starting to look pretty good again.  My confidence is usually up, and I’m chipper around others.  My memory and overall cognitive function seems to be better.  I’ve saved a tonne of money, and started some projects for me.  Namely letter writing and self reflection.

What’s giving me fear - how easy is it going to be to just have one?  One leads to more with me.    I’m expecting to mourn my team and the structure.

But... I didn’t self sabotage!  Being sober has allowed the clarity to even notice these triggers and thought patterns. My #1 fear is not being numb anymore and what that will bring.

Lately my mental health has gotten.. so bad. I can’t get out of bed, lethargic, no energy, no hope. Crippling social anxiety. I have been calling out of work because depression got so bad I couldn’t get out of bed or even brush my teeth. I tried various prescriptions and experienced no benefits. I had a plan for suicide and was wanting an escape.

I decided to drink instead of suicide. Now I have more energy, I’m hopeful, I get out of bed, no social anxiety, I feel better. I feel happy and motivated... but I hate it. I hate alcohol gives me meaning in life. I hate alcohol is my answer.

I understand the benefits of alcohol are short term and soon enough I’ll be back to where I was at. It started with a beer a day, but now I’m drinking vodka and had 4 beers last night when I told myself I’ll just have 1. I can see I’m drinking more and more each day. I’m hiding my drinking and bottles from my roommates. I don’t know if I can go a day without a drink, or even weed.

I don’t want to depend on alcohol for happiness. I feel trapped and don’t know what to do. I wasn’t happy sober, but I don’t want to be happy drunk. 

I guess I just don’t know what to do. I feel the only thing I had in common with my friends in sobriety was.. well, sobriety. Nothing else beyond that.

Took our kids to the park and we ran into a friend of hers. We will call her E. My friend asked E how she was doing and it floored me what happened next.

Her husband left yesterday for rehab until September. She started talking about her experience and how she got there and it was like someone was telling a bit of my story. It was eerily similar actually. So I was able to ask her questions, and how she got to that point with her husband and what all things led her to that. It was honestly eye opening. We all cried, we all laughed, it was something else for sure. Just the fact of we went to a park that was WAY out of our way, ran into her friend there of all places, and to just feel such a strong connection with this woman I just met.   


It gave me hope. I know right now our stories are different but I do hope one day that my DH can get the strength to quit. He has started and stopped many times, just like I have. I know the decision needs to be his. I know how hard it will be. I know that that situation may never happen. But talking with her gave me hope. So when I got home I started thinking about it more and thought huh, I haven't actually had a drink in a while now. It's been 2 weeks! I have had a whirlwind of the past 2 weeks that alcohol wasn't my number one thought on my mind. Its been actually nice to not have that nagging feeling in the back of my mind. It still pops up but there is a LOT to keep my mind occupied then think on those thoughts of, ""One drink wont matter. One or two shots are fine.""   


The universe really has a funny way of throwing people in our paths when we really need it.

2020-06-17 13:21:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/havoj4/im_new_to_these_online_forums/,I'm new to these online forums,"This is my first time posting on any online forum and I'm not sure what to expect so here goes....I'm 56,  wife and mother of 5 grown children; 30, 28, 26, 24, and an almost 18 year old. Two boys and 3 girls.  My husband and I have been married for 30 years and were high school sweethearts. I've been binge drinking quite a bit of late and it's been an ongoing issue the past year and a half, albeit not as often in the past which is why I've decided to seek out guidance.  I'm actively looking for a therapist for the many issues I have concerns with, but I thought an online forum would support me with this issue.  

My drinking has become problematic that now my children notice and are concerned which is the main reason I'm now seeking help.  Some background....our 24 year old daughter has had an eating disorder since she was 16 and been in treatment centers over 10 times now. We've almost lost her 4 times in the past 2 years. Because she is an adult we have little legal authority to control her health care and her weight got down to under 50 lbs. It's been a nightmare and we've tried every medical and legal avenue to help her to no avail.  She is recently out of another treatment center and living with us temporarily. (She can no longer live with us long term as we have decided it is to dysfunctional to have her here and to stressful watching her waste away.) She is looking for subsidized housing and hoping that happens sooner than later as she is already engaging in her ED behaviors. Much more of a story there, but that is an issue for my therepist.

Additionally, my husband had a long-term affair in the midst of all of this.  Affair was over a little over a year ago.  My husband has worked really hard to gain my trust and has shown deep empathy and remorse for his actions.  While this is going to take a long, long time to gain my trust, we are very slowly getting there.  His reaction to my binge drinking has been to ignore as he feels much sorrow for what he did to our marriage and feels that he is the primary cause of my pain and so it goes round and round.  He just tolerates and hopes I will get better. This is an entirely separate issue and i mention only because we have a co-dependent relationship. I drink to drown my sorrow and he enables because of guilt.  Not healthy any way you look at it.

I've looked into AA, however, I'm not a fan of their philosophy...I don't understand or agree that you have to always label yourself an ""alcoholic.""  I wouldn't label my daughter a forever ""anorexic.""  I believe one day she will rid herself of these ED behaviors and one day she will be able to live a full and enriching life and I don't want her labeled an ""anorexic or recovered anorexic"" for the rest of her life.  I would rather say she had an ED and she recovered and she is now a wife, mother, ""whatever.""  I know AA has helped many thousands, but I am looking for another program with a different philosophy.  I don't want to be shamed or guilted. Accountable, yes, but not shamed.

I've not binged drank for a few weeks, but I know I have a problem and I want to stop. I know I will miss many things about drinking...I'll really miss wine tasting as I have always enjoyed and been able to do in moderation. It's only when I'm home that I have been binge drinking. I think it's fair to say my husband should cut back on his drinking. I think it's that co-dependency circular behavior that keeps him drinking and encourages mine. I believe he has more self-control and if I cut back or stopped, he would as well.  

So, obviously many issues here, but what I'd like to know is how to stop the out-of-control drinking. I never drank in the past when our children were young.  Occasionally, a glass of wine at weddings and other special events, but it was a rare occasion.  It really began to be more frequent, a few times p/week about 5 years ago  to a glass of wine every night and then this past year to two glasses of wine or sometimes a bottle.  The more the aforementioned issues became worse, the drinking became by go to stress and anxiety reliever.

Its way more than dancing tweens, its chock full of information given in easy, digestible, and dare I say fun ways. Anyway, now that's off my chest...

I went down a rabbit hole of all kinds of people who are offering mental and spiritual advice to people (think a combination of therapists, spiritual ""guide"" types, psychologists, etc). They typically have a video about how their own personal journeys came to be. And almost all of them, if not all of them, mention how eliminating drinking was a big factor in reaching that higher, more peaceful state of mind and just overall vibrating at a higher level.  

Just something I noticed! Hell these people could all be total frauds, but whatever. I saw the pattern and it further validated my decision to not drink. I also found it so remarkable because I can't recall any other public place, social media or otherwise, where I've seen so many people say they're not drinking, and happily so. I feel like there's a bit of a stigma around not drinking, and these people are helping to get rid of that.

2020-06-17 13:17:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/havlmi/so_i_got_an_owi/,So I got an o.w.i.,"For some context, I've known drinking has been a problem for me for several years. At one point I managed sobriety for 298 days relapsed then reach sometime longer than the whole 365. Sobriety was the best time of my life. But after all that time looking back I guess I decided I no longer wanted to hide from alcohol convincing myself that being totally sober was still giving alcohol as much power over me as when I drank because I had a healthy fear of what could happen if I started up again so I avoided it. I had to prove to myself that I was the one in control. I tested my control with a one drink, only socially rule. This quickly slipped out of control and over the past year has escalated

A week ago I got an o.w.i. I have court on July 6th. This takes place in Michigan. The positive of this is I have been forced to be upfront with my family about my alcoholism and the other mental health issues I have that play into it. They want me to attend A.A. and get a psych evaluation. They think this will help my case.

While I have wanted therapy for a long time and know it would help to discuss my issues here and in group and with a professional I write this looking for advice. This is my first arrest. Research says I could be looking at up to 6 months in jail. What should I expect at trial? Is there any chance of leniency? My family is under the impression they will be able to testify to my character? Will seeking professional help actually help my case? Should I get my affairs in order with the expectation of jail time? 

I'm grateful I didn't hurt anyone and that this situation has brought my problems to light. I'm ashamed of myself but im not allowing myself to beat myself up because I'll just fall off more. If I go to jail my dog will have to live with my mom. I have fruit trees I might lose. I'll lose my apartment my job I know I'm losing my license but I'll probably have to give up my car too. My family will have to spend theyre own money to help me. I accept these consequences but I'm hoping to minimize the pain to my family and the drastic loses it will cause them and my personal life.

Any advice is appreciated thanks for reading",2

\- Your stomach will feel like shit tomorrow – you will be bloated, have heartburn, and eat horribly to try to feel better. Also a good chance you will wake up in the middle of the night with a churning stomach ache – completely nauseous w/ fire working its way through your belly – and you will need to race to the toilet to barf or shit or both. 

\- That anxiety that goes away when you stop drinking for any good amount of time? It will be back. General shakiness and unease, and if you are lucky a full blown panic attack as well. Disassociation, pounding heart, trouble breathing, and pure panic that you won’t be able to pull out of it. 

\- Those headaches. Waking up with a pounding head at 3 in the morning hurting so bad you can’t even get out of bed to grab some water. Throbbing, all-consuming headaches that make it impossible for you to do anything but lie in bed and suffer – no chance of sleep. 

\- You are going to be disappointed in yourself. You have already identified that you are a better person and so much healthier when you don’t drink. Every single time you drink you are giving up on what you know to be true. You are giving up on yourself. You are giving up on your family. You will not be present – both when you are drinking as well as when you are dealing with the consequences. You will likely say and do things that are not authentically you. And you will look at and interact with the world in a way that doesn’t represent your values. So much loss. 

\- You won’t be going on your morning walk tomorrow morning. One of the highlights of your day. You will be too tired to read in bed and unwind at the end of the night. Another highlight of your day. You will be impatient with your kids and your wife and your coworkers. Your relationships and your family and your career will suffer. Is it worth it even for one day?

She left peacefully in my arms and in her home. I wanted so badly to drink afterwards but my husband talked me out of it.

This morning I feel so empty without her tip toeing in the hallway to wake me up so she could be fed and then walk, although this past week she barely ate, couldn't walk, and I struggled to get her to take her medications.

I wrote her a letter this morning to try to lessen the guilt I feel for putting her to sleep. Guilt is normal, I'm told. Writing to her about all the great memories got me thinking how I wish I had been sober throughout our 10.5 year relationship. We would have gone on more adventures and I would have had more clear and meaningful memories of our time together.

Literally just sitting here staring at the screen trying to figure out what i wanna say. My brain is a bit of a twisted rope so bear with me. This upcoming Monday (in 5 days!) I’ll hit my 100th day of sobriety. Fkn crazy typing that. I don’t think it’s really hit me yet and I’m beginning to wonder when it will. I need to plan something to do that day but I can’t really come up with anything. Ideas? 

I’ve tried getting sober before, MULTIPLE TIMES but this is the longest I’ve ever lasted. I think at some point I stopped living and just gave up. Years and years of not dealing with reality and blacking out way more than anybody should. Kinda shocked I’m still alive tbh. One of my best friends would’ve turned 32 a week and a half ago. Jesus that week flew by, had no clue it’s the 17th (UGH). Anyway, I celebrate her birthday every year but this year was the first time in 15 years I did it sober. And, it was really rough. I need to let myself feel my emotions instead of pushing them down until I explode. I’ll never get over losing her and it really doesn’t get better as the years pass. Maybe it’s just something I’m going to struggle with but I’m trying to do it with a clear mind now. It took me years to come to terms with that fact that she’s gone. I don’t handle death very well, it’s getting worse as I get older. It was a complete shock when it happened and I hadn’t really dealt with that kind of death before. Well, once, her brother-in-law committed suicide a couple years before her. She died on NYE ‘05 and it wasn’t until 2010-2011 that I finally accepted it. I would come home from work, bullshit on my comp and just sit down and bawl my eyes out over her. I’ve been doing that recently too, emotional train wreck over here. I spent many years convinced that it was partly my fault. Everyone always says, “there’s nothing you could’ve done”, and I hate that phrase. It’s bullshit. The summer before she killed herself we went to the movies and she cried during the whole thing. I just held her. After I dropped off the friend we were with I pulled the car over and got her to talk to me about what was going on. She had been getting bullied at school (she was a Senior, I graduated 2 years before her), not just by mean kids but by her best friends and her boyfriend. It really took all of me not to knock him the fuck out when I saw him at Anna’s moms house. Yeah, her name is Anna, left that part out. She told me she had been cutting herself and she was just really fucking sad. I saw it, I felt it, I still fucking feel it. I told her if she ever did anything to herself I would never talk to her again. Which, actually doesn’t make sense seeing it typed out. I gave her my necklace and told her to keep it til she felt better and she did wear it everyday which made me happy. I thought I had helped, but I guess I just postponed the inevitable. The day before she died she messaged me and wanted to know what my plans were for NYE. Being the complete jerk I am I blew her off to hang out with my boyfriend. I messaged her later that night, trying to get her to join me and Brent at ihop but her mom said she was asleep. I was the opening manager on weekends at Mcds, so I went in at 5 am, got thru my shift, cleaned my car and took a nap. When I finally got up I went and picked up my boyfriend and his best friend and we just chilled and played games. One of my friends, Patsy, called me and I got this really uneasy feeling. I could tell she was upset and she didn’t want to tell me what she had to. She finally told me, said her sister Kelly heard that the girl that dated the guy with the green car shot her self. I instantly was like HIS CAR IS BLUE so this has to be a mistake. I told her I’d call her back and I called our other friend Cassie and told her what Patsy told me but I mean, it wasn’t her. Like no. She called her Mom, and it was true. I collapsed on the floor...my Mom ran into there to me and got down and held me. She kept asking what happened and I couldn’t say it. I just kept saying Anna...Anna....I hate reliving that night. I don’t think I’ve been the same since that happened and I didn’t really realize that until a couple weeks ago. On New Year’s Day Cassie, Patsy, Ashley and myself went to her moms, they had ppl in and out all day and her mom and sis were talking to the pastor outside so we just went in and talked to some of the other ppl there. I don’t know how long they were out there but as soon as her mom came inside she walked straight to me and we just hugged and cried into each other for like an hour. Her sister Jessica got up when we finally let go and did the same with her. It was so comforting and not at the same time. I’ll never get used to it. 

I was a pretty decent teenager, didn’t party too much or do drugs or any of that but I def made up for it I’ve the next 15 years. I found that liquor was the only thing that would numb me and I’d forget everything for a bit. Every bad thing that has happened to me since then I’d try to find the answer in the bottom of a Jack Daniels bottle. It got progressively worse as I got older, especially when I moved back home. Drinking literally turns me into the most vile fkn bitch ever. I knew what I was doing but I didn’t stop. I’d blackout, lash out at any and everyone and wake up the next morning wondering why everyone was always so pissed at me. I’d calm down for a little bit and then go right back into full Emilia mode (crazy drunk version of myself). I think I’ve pretty much hurt every single friend I’ve had, and there are some relationships that I’ll never be able to fix. And I have to come to terms with that and let it go. Oh but I wish I could’ve taken some of those things I did and said back. I’ll sit here sometimes and wonder why I’m alone, because I thought I was a pretty decent person but I guess ppl can only take so much. But, I’m giving myself a second chance and maybe one day they will too. I don’t want to let every little thing cripple me anymore. I want to learn and move on. And I’m fkn trying! 

I’m never going to turn my back on myself again.",4

“Let Fate find us prepared and active. Here is the great soul - the one who surrenders to Fate. The opposite is the weak and degenerate one, who struggles with and has a poor regard for the order of the world, and seeks to correct the faults of the gods rather than their own.” - Seneca, Moral Letters, 107.12

Whatever happens today, let it find us prepared and active: ready for problems, ready for difficulties, ready for people to behave in disappointing or confusing ways, ready to accept and make it work for us. Let’s not wish we could turn back time or remake the universe according to our preference. Not when it would be far better and far easier to remake ourselves.”This is the entry for June 18th (my soberversary) from The Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday. This holds so much significance to me and my sobriety, that I tore this entry out of the book and keep it on my desk for daily reading.

Not really sure where to even start here… but it feels incredible to be able to say that I am two years sober. Life has been FULL of adventure for me in the last two years. Not all of it good, some of it terrible, but most of it amazing. It's only now that I write this and reflect that I realize just how far I have come from the days where I was close to being totally alone, possibly homeless, or dead.

Year one was all about reclaiming myself. It was about getting back to who I am as a person, as a husband, as a musician, and a person in this world.  


Year two was about maintaining that and continuing my quest for perpetual self-improvement. It was about exploring, being connected with nature, traveling, meeting new people, being healthier, trying new things, and being easier on myself. There were NO 5k runs, mountain climbs, or triathlons, and way more caffeine, nicotine, and sugar than I'd like to admit.

However, I left the job that I hated. I got to travel North America in an RV for 10 months. I got to explore the natural beauty of this continent with my wife and dog. We adopted a second dog on the road. Appropriately named her Roadie. I got to see family and friends all across the USA. I got to swim in the frigid rivers of Washington state. I got to frolic in the deserts of the southwest with my dogs. I got to sleep on the beaches of the Gulf of Mexico.

Over the last 6-7 months, I’ve been having a difficult time sustaining my daily practices in my sobriety. It’s not that I don’t understand their significance or the massive impact they have in my life, I just fell out of routine, and have had a very difficult time starting again.  


In the last year, I have been struggling with my unchecked and unmanaged  ADHD that has re-manifested itself in my daily life and is now making my life unmanageable, just like the alcohol did. I think that when I was drinking, it made me subconsciously be all the things I was when I was medicated for my ADHD, because I had to remain a high-functioning employee, husband, and friend.

But when I stopped drinking two years ago, I saw the initial improvements, and then I plateaued HARD. My ADHD has been the one thing in my way of even more progress in my life, my career, my art, and so much more. So I’m happy to say that I have admitted that this was making my life once again unmanageable and that I need help. I have a re-evaluation scheduled for the end of the month, and I’m excited to be going back to a treatment plan of medication and therapy, and adding that to my arsenal of tools.  


Year three is going to be about actualizing all of the goals and begin building my dreams upon the foundation that is my first two years in sobriety. It’s about switching careers. It’s about being kinder to myself. It’s about sticking to my guns. It’s about continuing to explore. It’s about refusing to dwell on the past, old ways, and mistakes made. It’s about making my future instead of trying to reshape the past.

I've watched this sub grow from 140,000 members to what it is now, and it makes me so happy to see all of you in here each day. I'm grateful to be here with you all because at one point there was a good chance I wouldn't have stayed alive long enough to make it here.

Not so good news: My husband and I have been fighting over silly things but it would be so much worse if I was secretly drinking. I would “go to bed early” and we probably wouldn’t be having this many conversations to try to solve problems. 

He is stressed at work with a big assignment. His mother is acting like herself and trying to step in as mom to my kids, which upsets me and when I vocalize it to my husband he always takes his mom’s side. I’m wrong and need to just let her do what she wants because “she has always been the boss of her family”. But this is OUR family now, not his mom/my mother in law.  

On top of that, I work from home with two kids who I try to entertain and enrich without losing my job. My husband is pissed at the end of the day when he comes home physically tired and the house is a mess or kids aren’t ready for dinner and bed. I cry constantly I’m so overwhelmed (at least distance learning is done for the kids). 

Saturday was our anniversary. We had planned to watch our wedding video like we always do. After dinner my husband said he didn’t want to, he had work to do, and went outside. My daughter and I were crushed. I love watching it and my daughter enjoys seeing her mom as a bride (she’s obsessed with weddings like many little girls are), I get to see my mom and grandfather who have passed away, etc. It is Wednesday and we still haven’t watched it. It sounds so petty but it means a lot to me and even though I ask daily, I’m shot down. I just don’t feel loved the way I need to - even though I’m constantly doing for others.

Thanks for letting me dump all of that out. I feel better just writing it down and I’m afraid to be honest with my friends because it will make my husband look uncaring and he isn’t, he’s just having a really hard time at work and losing focus on the rest of this for a couple of weeks. We have a mini vacation coming up (driving, not flying right now) so I’m hoping that will snap things back in to place.

Normally, I would just drink to numb the hurt of all of this. But I’m not!! I’m staying strong! My kids are wonderful and the joys of my life - they keep me happy and keep reminding me of what I’m working for.

I know this sounds dramatic.. but if anyone has any advice as far as how to mitigate this so I can stop without the dread of knowing I'll be an irritable fuck that would be excellent. It is honestly the only thing that makes me apprehensive to begin the process which I know sounds silly but it caused issues the first time and I know the irritability comes from the lack of alcohol because since I've made the latest attempt to stop, every time the irritability gets to be too much I drink a beer and it goes away..

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

And if sun comes

How shall we greet him?

Shall we not dread him,

Shall we not fear him

After so lengthy a

Session with shade?

...

Shall we not shudder?—

Shall we not flee

Into the shelter, the dear thick shelter

Of the familiar

Propitious haze?

&#x200B;

Sweet is it, sweet is it

To sleep in the coolness

Of snug unawareness.

&#x200B;

The dark hangs heavily

Over the eyes.

from ""truth""

By Gwendolyn Brooks Full poem here [https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/54810/truth-56d2359ad24ba](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/54810/truth-56d2359ad24ba)

This poem is new to me but really speaks to this moment, both personally and in terms of current events and the wider world.  Right now seems to be a time of reckoning, exposing and expressing the truths of the past and present.  Needing the truth to guide us into the future.

But I can also relate to the comfort of turning away from the truth, from the sun or light as it is expressed in the poem. A funny confession: a few times when really tempted to drink, I thought about if I did if I could show up here, not reset my counter, and just act like nothing happening.  Basically, not tell you guys.  Whenever I imagined trying to do that, I felt the ""dark hang heavily"" over my entire body and heart and knew I could never do that. This helped deter me from drinking: the desire to be sober AND the desire to be truthful. I also know I can be truthful if I do drink.  In the end, I have to own my truth whatever it is.

What role does truth play for you in not drinking today?

I WILL NOT DRINK WITH YOU TODAY MY FRIENDS!",122

I honestly can not remember how long it's been since I've seen blood when going number 2. Fissures and hemorrhoids were an everyday struggle and nothing really seemed to help. I haven't really done anything different or better with my diet, but not having drank these past couple months has alleviated a lot of issues. I also no longer have constant heartburn or the feeling that I'm frequently digesting broken glass!

This is something that used to stress me out quite a bit. Even taking fiber supplements and trying my best to better my diet never really fixed the problem. I was always in pain. But, the problem just hasn't been a problem for me lately. It's like some kind of miracle.

I started crying my eyes out when I clicked on the video. The next day I asked my few remaining friends for help. 7 hours later I was shaking uncontrollably and throwing up every 15 seconds. The only thing that kept me from being hospitalized from the withdrawals was my friend pouring two shots of whiskey into a glass and locking up the bottle in his room. Of course he poured another two shots into some juice after my body rejected the straight whiskey. Man, nothing more painful then vomiting Kuntuky Burbon on a empty stomach. Watched this video again and again for the next two days till the withdrawals started to die down. I've stumbled afew times since then, but always found my way back in a day or two.

I read loads of sober blogs, and I get hundreds of e-mails and comments from readers of Mummy was a Secret Drinker.  


The ones that really make me want to cry, and yell in frustration, are the ones written by people who do the first few days *over and over and over again.*  
They do four days sober, then back to day one. They manage ten days next time, then go on a bender. Three days. Four days again. Ad infinitum.  


I get it! I really do. I've been there. We all have. And you do just have to keep persevering until one day it just sticks.  


But now, with the benefit of six months of hindsight, I just want to grab them in a big bear hug and yell ""*Nooooo! You're doing the hardest part over and over, without ever making it to the good bits!""*  


And the problem is, the longer you spend wallowing around in those early dark days of despair, the more you manage to re-enforce the idea in your subconscious that that's what sobriety is all about.

A month before my 19th birthday, I was raped. It was the single most horrific experience I’ve ever had in my life. I am 22, and the memories still haunt me every day.

I dropped out of college after the rape and returned home. This is where things really started to spiral. I met an abusive boyfriend, who smoked a lot of weed. I wasn’t much into smoking, so he started to buy me alcohol every time we hung out with his friends. One night, his friends plied me with a lot of alcohol and I was sexually assaulted once again. It really seemed like this was just going to be my life. I woke up the next morning hungover with the only memory in my mind being trying to push my boyfriend’s best friends body off of me but being too weak.

After all the abuse, I turned to sex work for a short period of time. Every time I met with these old men, I would be absolutely plastered. I would black out almost every time I engaged in these acts. I was disgusted with myself, I gained around 70 pounds. I had originally started with the sex work to get money for an abortion that I had needed when I was 19. I knew I couldn’t have a child because of how much I had already been drinking and I knew I wasn’t going to stop. I thought this would be the best thing, that child didn’t deserve the life that I could give it.

When I was 20, I had gone to a man’s house and I got drunk. I was going to meet another man, and I got pulled over on the way. The officer knew that I was drunk right away. I broke down and I told him my story. For whatever reason, he was a nice man and very sympathetic. He didn’t give me a DUI that night, but rather called my dad to pick me up. That was even more shame, honestly. Around this time, I met a friend. I learned later, that she wasn’t really my friend, she was buying me alcohol, getting me blacked out and then taking me to see her various older men friends. For this, she was getting paid a few hundred dollars each time. I didn’t even know what was happening those nights.

For a while, things stayed the same. The only way I could ever have sex or date is if I was drunk, usually black out. To this day, I don’t think I’ve ever had sex sober.

Everything changed one day this past March.I was in another garbage relationship, and it really was a one day thing. I woke up one day and I said enough is enough. I couldn’t do it anymore. I knew that I wasn’t going to see 23 if I didn’t change. I didn’t want to see 23 if I was going to live like this. I dumped the boyfriend. I dumped the shitty, enabling friends. I realized that I had to take responsibility. Yes, people have hurt me. Yes, I have endured unimaginable pain. However, my life will never change unless I start taking responsibility. Recently, I contacted a friend from high school that I knew was an active participant in AA. I’m going to start attending zoom meetings. I have been sober since April. 

Thank you for letting me share my story. IWNDWYT!",15

I Think It's Working,"I have struggled with alcohol for the past ... oh ... fifteen years probably. I've been up, down, all around with it. I have a problem. I don't have a problem and this is normal. I hate alcohol. I love alcohol and I just need to accept that it will be part of my life forever. I don't ever want to drink again (usually while in the throes of nausea and/or the dreaded puke-a-thon). Except I will drink again tonight.

I've chipped away at it. Was sober for a year around the time I turned 30. Have had sober stretches  of anywhere to a few days to a few months in the years since. Went to AA for a while, didn't really do it for me. Continued to maintain reasonably healthy habits otherwise. Progressed in my career, sometimes slowly, sometimes meteorically. Got a dog.

Then the pandemic hit. I was sick as shit early on (don't think it was the Dreaded COVID, although I didn't get tested so don't know for sure). All my healthy habits went out the window. I pretty much spent April drunk.

May 1, I read a blog post about how [we're all monastics now](https://zenhabits.net/monastics/) and decided to try to get my shit together. I strung together a few sober weeks, but more importantly, I started doing some actual work on myself, regularly, whether or not I felt like it. I took up meditation. I focused on getting outside for exercise at least four days a week. I kept a consistent sleep schedule. I wrote in my journal. I brushed my teeth and took my vitamins. I lurked here. I dove into my hobbies with reckless abandon. Sometimes I still drank.

Last week, I stupidly drank way too much on Wednesday night. I woke up in the wee hours of Thursday, sick as shit. I rolled around in misery for a few hours before sticking my finger down my throat, and was finally able to fall into a restless sleep for a couple of hours before I had to wake up and start work. Fucking waste of a day. I didn't journal. I didn't meditate.

However. The next day I did both. And the next, and the next. And all I can say is I think it's starting to work. I feel *different*. I was so stoked to see a Sylvia Plath quote in this morning's sobriety pledge post, because I've been thinking about another quote from The Bell Jar, which perfectly encapsulates this feeling: 

""All the heat and fear had purged itself. I felt surprisingly at peace. The bell jar hung, suspended, a few feet above my head. I was open to the circulating air.""

I feel at peace. I feel like, at the age of 40, I finally, FINALLY, truly understand what it means to put myself first, to put on my own oxygen mask before I can help others. I have to prioritize these things. I have to read your stories, and process my experience privately, and then share it publicly. I have to exercise in the open air. I have to meditate. I have to keep a consistent sleep schedule and write in my journal and brush my teeth and take my vitamins. I have to put me first, and that's the only way I'll stay sober.",12

While I knew eventually I would feel and see the returns, it's been hard. Sleep has been a struggle, I feel the pain of my worn out body from long shifts at the hospital. My back aches, my legs throb. It's been a fight to not be a member of the daily drinking culture of a high volume, truama hospital. I fell into the lifestyle as a student and it became my normal once my toxic SO saw the benefits of keeping me drunk. It's been a long hard struggle to prove to myself that life is better when I spend more of my time sober than drunk. My scrubs are finally fitting better. I'm less exhausted even when I spend 10+ hours constantly moving, putting in at least 7 miles a day. The pain in my own body is slowly fading away and I'm becoming more aware of my own physical limitations. It's not a big win as far as sobriety goes, but I can finally say I've made some wins.",3

&#x200B;

today was brutal, and triggering AF.  as many of you may also relate to, I began drinking as a trauma response.

I had to contact CPS to advocate for my daughter when she made allegations against my ex husband that he has been physically abusing her.  I believe her, he was an abusive nightmare when we were together and has been emotionally abusive for quite some time.

they asked her a bunch of questions and they asked me about my marriage with him, and I heard my daughter talk about being abused and I relived my abusive marriage.

and then they did nothing.  she has to continue to see him and there is nothing I can do about it.

my emotional sobriety became completely unraveled.   the desire to retaliate on my own body was so strong.

I am nine months sober today.  I cant imagine how poorly I would have handled this if I were drinking.

tomorrow is a new day, and I will wake up hangover free, and hopefully see things more clearly.",54

I only started drinking at the age of 18, and quickly fell into daily use -- and before I knew it, I was a fully fledged, non-functional alcoholic. 

Five years ago, I was 23 and had just survived *another* suicide attempt. On that day, I made exactly one good decision. I decided to not drink. 

Today marks the one thousand eight hundred twenty fifth day that I have made that same decision. One day at a time, or one hour at a time, or even one minute at a time. 

This anniversary is special for me, because as of today I drank for 5 years, and since then I have been sober for 5 years. Today, I stand balanced with equal time in either direction. And tomorrow, for the first time in my adult life, I will have been sober for longer than I drank. 

At the end of the day, all I have to do is keep making that one good decision. As long as I keep doing that, I can figure out the rest. And so, I will not drink with you today.",19

How do I ask people? I'm a tad socially awkward in general so I don't even know how one would begin a conversation like that...

Same with meetings, is it best to look for online (like Zoom) bases meetings or maybe preferable to check locally? Is it wise to even look up local meetings at this point or should I maybe just give up and try another time?

Have any of you managed to go to physical meetings, or is it online help only in the UK, or does it depend on where in the UK one is based?",7

In the subject line of the email I sent to invite them I wrote ""Camping June 14th & 15th"" Then in the body of the email I wrote 
""June 14th & 15th (check out June 16). ""
The wife of the couple quickly emailed me back to say they would love to join us. I then sent them a copy of our camping permits that had ""Expires June 16, 2020"" in big, bold letters on it. 

Late Friday afternoon my partner gets a call at work from our friends. They are at the campsite we told them to go to but there are already people in that spot. My partner had to break it to them that they were 2 days early. 
Turns out the camp ground was full so they had to drive to a different one, further away. They couldn't come back to stay with us Sunday & Monday night.

I do feel badly for them that they just assumed I must have meant Friday to Saturday...but I was quite relieved to not have to defend my sobriety the whole trip.  
Especially since most of the texts our friend sent to my partner prior to the trip all mentioned how much they were going to drink.

A friend visited Saturday and our relationship has always centered around drinking. I let her know that I was trying to give up drinking, but it was bulldozed over. Felt like I couldn't say ""I'm not drinking"" and rather ""we will just have a few"" Ended up having 6 ciders, a beer, and half a bottle of champagne. This was over the course of like 8 hours, but still! Anyway, no booze since.

I want to write about some of why I'm doing this just to get it off my chest. I don't know if anybody will read this. If you do, let me know if you connected in anyway. Feeling connection about this is something I'm really craving right now.

To start out, I have a lot of childhood trauma that still affects me to this day. When I discovered that booze could help me momentarily escape the pervasive pain and make me feel better about myself, I was completely sold and never looked back. Booze had a permanent place in my life.

I've been drinking since I was in high school. I'm in my mid thirties now. Aside from a tonsillectomy, I can't remember a week where I didn't binge drink at least two of the days, if not more.

I never have been able to drink with moderation. The embarrassment started early. I remember getting so hammered in high school that I puked all over myself and fell asleep in a dog house. I was completely out of control. I remember people thinking this was funny and it almost seemed like it got me positive attention. I was a party girl now.

Fast forward to college and my core friend group consisted of binge drinkers. Before we were old enough to buy alcohol, our nights consisted of plotting to find someone to buy us booze. Every time we drank, we took it too far. I puked a lot. Had lots of hangovers. Had lots of insane fights with the boyfriends that I had.

I'm really glazing over all the early shit, but just know it was bad. After college, I stayed with my boyfriend who was as much of an alcoholic as me. Our relationship was super passionate and our alcoholism mixed with that turned into horrible fighting. I cried constantly. We even came to blows one night shoving each other against walls. I had to get away from him and decided to move to escape it. Again, I'm glazing over that part of my life.

6 years ago when I moved to my new town, I immediately began dating. And what do you know, my search for a new dude involved tons of alcohol. And unsafe sexual situations. And failed relationships. I really liked one of the first dudes I dated here, but I royally fucked that up by being a drunk mess still unable to have a healthy relationship with anyone. Kinda happens when you don't ever see one happen in your life to learn from. I hooked up with a huge alcoholic. Brilliant guy who I stayed hung up on for a while but us together was explosive. I hit what I thought was my rock bottom with him. But no, it didn't stop.

Eventually I met a guy who was pretty stable. We met DRUNK, spent all our fun time drinking, but he wasn't like the other guys I was typically into so I thought it was okay. I am still with this person and now realizing our entire relationship has been centered around and formed from our alcohol connection. We have lived together for 2 years now.

Quarantine has really made me realize what a problem I have. Sitting on my porch drinking at 1:00 yet again, nursing a buzz in the sun (which I just consider one of the most fun things in the world and why??) I became super aware of how incapacitated I was. About how there were so many things I needed to get done and couldn't. The hangovers have been brutal. I've had at least 4 where I threw up so much I thought I was going to die. I'm the heaviest I have ever been in my life. I am disgusted by who I have become.

Now I'm reevaluating everything in my life. My relationship, my career, what I did with my youth, my relationship with my family, my friendships. The only thing I'm sure of is I am done with allowing alcohol to destroy me. I'm excited to see how sober me handles life.

He told me that he was not and could never be the reason I was quitting, but he wouldn't be any part of the continuation of my drinking.  Refused to be put in the place where someone could call him an enabler.  God I love that man.

Anyway - He asked me if there was anything else that he would find, and I said no.  I was so ashamed.  

Of course there were more empty bottles.  I had been caught, but I couldn't bring myself to show him the extent of how much I could drink without him knowing.  (or at least being positive enough to call me on it.)  

Last weekend I took the two bags of empty bottles to the glass recycling.  They've been sitting there in their hiding spot for weeks, months even.  Taking them out was the last piece before my sobriety could be real.  I have no fear of him finding any more bottles.  I have no stress about what follows,""I need to talk to you"".

I even pretty much quit smoking during that time. I was incredibly emotional and full of anxiety the last day, just hours before my flight. I think I was very worried about a lot of things like my job in the current situation and lashed out. I said a lot of hurtful things that I regret. On the flight home, I pretty much knew I was going to drink when I arrived. I drank two nights in a row and smoked both days. It didn’t help anything but let me forget the feelings for a little while. Now I’m anxious, depressed, and laying in bed all day. I want to stop the drinking and smoking and make things right with my father before Fathers Day. I think I owe him a heartfelt apology and to try to do things right from now on. I’m depressed about the whole thing and I don’t know what I’m really asking for, but maybe some suggestions or words of encouragement would help. Thank you!",5

The single biggest factor in my decision to quit was knowing that I was going to be a dad. I stopped when my wife was about 2 months pregnant. Then a couple of months later, and by this point knowing we were having a girl, I saw a video on FB of a fella I know dancing in the driveway with his young daughter, beer in left hand, and twirling his girl with the right. I could see she was itching to be picked up but he couldn’t do it due to having a drink in his hand. It broke my heart a bit. I knew right then that staying sober was going to be very important to me. Now, my daughter is almost 5 months old, and dancing around the kitchen with her in my arms, whilst we listen to music and cook, is probably the most beautiful feeling in the world. She can’t talk, but her smile says it all. I’m so lucky. Onward.",88

Says he needs me at [Insert non discriptive place here] to go over the project. The consultant and another boss are on there way. I say okay sure give me 30 minutes. I head out. I get there and the consultant already has a beer and this place seems to be a bar (i thought it was a restraunt). Well shit this is going to suck. Everyone arrives and the big boss says genitaldiddler youve been doing great we are having beer and steaks tonight to celebrate. This project will save the company XXXX some odds millions of dollars. Well fuck i raise my diet coke and cheers with the 3 of them. He gives me a weird look but didnt say anything. We talk and talk and im just rubbing the hell outnof this rock i got from rehab that says ""Joy"" on it. Everything is going okay and im not too uncomfortable. Then the conversation turns to whats your favorite beer, oh i brew my own, heres my favorite try this one... i feel obligated to take part in the conversation so i share what mine is and its makes me more uncomfortable. Well we finish eating and i head out.... successfully not having had anything to drink. Success. Now typically when i have been in uncomfortable situations before in sobriety my response is to bitch and moan and feel sorry for myself. But this time im just happy i made it through to the other side. Grateful and happy. So i guess im more happy about that shift from self pitty to acceptance. I think its cool.

I stopped drinking in January, and with quarantine and staying in all the time, it’s been relatively easy to stay sober. Most of the over-drinking I was doing was happening at home anyway, so it was easy to convince myself to not drink there because there was no reason to and I didn’t want to. But last week I went up to my family’s cabin, which I just realized has been a place where I drink a LOT historically. I usually didn’t feel bad about it because it was a vacation and I was with family. And there’s something so satisfying about a cold beer by the lake. I found myself fighting with myself about not drinking much more at the cabin than I’ve had to in the last 4 months. This weekend I’m going camping, and I’m anticipating more of the same. I bought some fancy root beer to crack open instead.

Summer, as well as all the drinking that usually comes with it, really snuck up on me. Let’s stay strong and keep something non-alcoholic cold in the fridge for when the warmth tempts us! IWNDWYT",4

Towards the end of March I relapsed. I relapsed on Antabuse. The experience was terrifying and shameful. I can’t remember the first half of the night but I can very clearly remember coming to and what happened as I began to sober up. It was a nightmare, my worst nightmare.
I truly believe that if I were to drink again it would kill me. I am the definition of Kindling. 
I have an incredible sense of intuition and I am very in tune with my body. I don’t want to drink. I never want to drink. I am absolutely terrified of alcohol. Good, right? How lucky am I to have, after all these years of trying to quit and after all of these years of relapse, no desire to even consider drinking. But the feeling I have of knowing, absolutely believing, that if I were to drink again it would kill me...it is scary. I’m scared. I’m scared because I have seen my death. I’m traumatized. I can feel and imagine my death very vividly. My funeral. My family. My friends. My obituary in my home towns paper. My daughter with out a mother. My stuff, all my stuff being taken out of my house and hauled off.
Yeah, I’m experiencing trauma.
I’m not sure what I am getting at with this, I guess I just wanted to release some of my fear on here.

2020-06-16 13:39:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ha8oxd/getting_sober_during_a_global_pandemic_while/,Getting sober during a global pandemic while doing a PhD,"*Day 46.* I’m hopeful that someday I can look back at this point in time and laugh about the fact that I chose to get sober during a global pandemic — but at the moment, I feel like I am losing my mind.

As a second year PhD student studying psychological science, I am lucky in the sense that my project has not been affected much by the global pandemic. Besides the focus groups that I conducted at the end of last year, all of my work is completely computer based. Technically, I could work from home whenever I wanted to, but I chose to go into the office because I prefer to interact with my coworkers and separate my work-life spaces. My supervisor has been so supportive since the beginning of the pandemic, but I hit a wall in the middle of May where I completely lost interest in everything I was researching for my project. I am just now starting to get caught up on the work that I put off for about two full weeks. Unfortunately, this coincides with a complete and total lack of motivation on my part due to working from home. I find it very difficult to self-motivate, another reason why I enjoy working in an office setting.

I believe that when I was drinking, I was just working to get the task done, rather than actually putting in effort. I think I was expecting that as soon as I quit drinking, I would instantly have hours upon hours of productivity, but it doesn’t work that way. I guess I needed to take a few weeks to throw myself into my sobriety in order to get a bit of momentum. I was listening to hours of recovery podcasts and reading endless sober books and blogs, that work was minimal and often fell by the wayside.

I am trying to improve my working habits, and feel that this week already I have done more in two days than I did the entirety of last week. I always work in ebbs and flows, but I am trying to improve the consistency of my work, because I am trying to be consistent in everything that I do lately.

I am becoming a little more settled within sober life, and the lockdown restrictions will be lifting soon so I will have to be prepared to re-enter the normal world as a non drinker. I very much take things “one day at a time” as it is, but I have found myself worrying more and more about the temptation to drink once bars open and social gatherings reemerge.

In a previous post I wrote about why lockdown was the ideal situation for me to get sober, but with that come a lot of challenges. If I had gotten sober before lockdown, I probably would have experienced more social events without drinking where I could have built confidence. Instead, I will be faced with new challenges and will have to find my stride when it comes to attending parties, going out to dinners, and seeing friends. In a way, I am looking forward to this opportunity to connect with people in a new and different way, but I am also scared. Scared that I won’t be as strong as I have been for the last month and a half.

Getting sober during a global pandemic while doing a PhD is definitely a whirlwind. I am experiencing so many new emotions and I feel as though my belief system has had a shift during my time here at home. As a psychologist, I know that affect and behavior changes during this pandemic will be studied for years to come.

There is a lot to be said about the *One Day at a Time* mantra that’s bandied about the sobersphere. As my mind shifts from worrying about my PhD, to worrying about the state of the world after COVID, to worrying about my sobriety, I am trying to stick to the plan: I will not drink today.

Just for today.

That’s all I can control.

I will do my work to the best of my ability and I will not drink *today*.",38

I know that when I was going through withdrawals and first on Librium I was looking up everything I could find here and other sites on info so I wanted to give my experience so far. 

I was given a prescription for 25mg gelcaps of Librium to take up to 4 daily as needed for 3 days for withdrawals after leaving the ER. I took 3 the first day (one right when I got home at 6am, then 6pm and again at 10 pm). They make you super tired, heavy limped, and just plain lethargic. It does help with withdrawals though. I slept that first night through without getting up once, had crazy dreams though and was still very lethargic all the next day. I didn't feel refreshed or well rested but happy to have slept the whole night. That next day I just felt off, tired, foggy headed, but hey no WDs so I was doing good. 

Second day only took them at night to sleep but took two. Mistake, horrible dreams, off and on sleep, and just not a good overall feeling. Too lethargic the next day to do much again. But again hoping that they are keeping the WDs at bay, which they are.

Third day only took one at night and slept well, got up once at 6am and feel back asleep until 10am. Feeling much better today. Not nearly as tired. I plan on only taking one again for sleep tonight if needed. 

Side effects are true for women that it does cause irregular menstrual bleeding (odd yes), drowsiness, dizziness, foggy headed, etc. Look it up on webmd or [drugs.com](https://drugs.com) for other user reviews. Overall I would recommend them mostly in the evening and hopefully if you don't have to go to work because it is hard to function or to be very alert on them. 

I hope that helps.

My laundry has a backlog, my work calendar is all over the place, paperwork is as organised as it needs to be I guess. I don’t really look too far into the future. I deal with things as they come up. I don’t really like planning much. Just go with the flow really. I’ll get to it when I get to it. 
You can bet your ass I’ll plan my day around drinking though! 
Wake up and it begins. I need 1 slot to get out the house alone so I can buy twice the amount of booze I pretend to drink. I need to get anything driving related out the way and be sure that I won’t need to drive after that time so I can tuck in. This can mean some slightly manipulative conversations with my wife. If friends are coming over then I need a good hour head start as being sober when they arrive is simply a no-go. 
Nobody is aware I drink vodka on the side. Usually mixed with something or other. If they see me with a random glass of Coke then I’ll get quizzed on it. I’ll make some trips to my vodka stash in the garage with a glass of juice or something occasionally. They’ll never notice. Hmmm, get juice from the shop. 
Finally, get some low alcohol beer and sip that when people are around between planned trips to the garage. 

I’m like 5 days in now or something (trying not to count) and all this is starting to sound silly. I’m an adult ffs not 7 years old. 
There is a huge amount of complexity that I have shrugged off by not drinking. So much admin. So much mind space just to “function”.

2020-06-16 12:29:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ha7bnd/one_year/,One year,"I’ve been thinking of this post for months now. One year free of alcohol. My two cents. 

Alcohol runs your schedule. I oriented and scheduled my life around drinking. Not consciously, but unconsciously it was there in the background. Stop for booze so we don’t have to go back out. Schedule the event/meeting in the early evening so we’re home with enough time to “relax”. (Relax = drink, just a papered over way to lie to yourself). 

There is a world after 6:00. People go places and do things in the evening after work. I live a few miles from Lake Michigan.  Since I quit drinking I have been to the beach more in one year than the prior ten. How insane is that? Stay home drinking and watching TV instead of sitting on the beach or hike up the sand dunes.  I take the kids for a walk and ice cream at 8:00 because I can. Because I’m not drunk. 

Quitting drinking will not solve your problems. But it will make your problems solvable. Addiction rarely acts alone. There is usually something else going on. In my case I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I’m taking meds and getting therapy. Without getting professional help I don’t think I could have done this.  Once the alcohol was out of the way I could finally see a path to something different. 

I could not have done this without my wife. She is my rock. She picked me up, forgave my drinking and lying about it, encouraged me to get help and celebrated every milestone with me. It was HARD to be honest with my wife and with myself about how much I was drinking. Hiding it around the house.  Earlier and earlier start times. BUT - once I was honest and laid it out there - the shame lifted a little.  I wasn’t alone.  Today I have a partner with a deeper connection than anything we had before.  And she has a partner she can depend on to be her rock when needed. 

r/stopdrinking is my A.A.  It’s not the same but it works for me. I can see myself in so many stories. I can see what I was and where I was going if I didn’t stop.  I’ve cried and laughed at so many posts and comments. And it stopped me when I thought, “maybe I can...” This is hands down the greatest, most supportive place on the interwebs.

We were checking out the garden and I must have let out a heavy sigh without realizing it - he asked me”What’s wrong?” I told him that I had never realized just how much I used alcohol to escape my feelings- and right now, with all the things going on in the world, I was feeling so anxious, and it was hard to deal with this “feeling my feelings”thing.  He wrapped me up in a big hug and said “I’m so proud of you. What you are doing is hard. I admire you for doing it.”  And I have to tell you guys, THAT felt awesome, and I was very happy that I could feel that feeling!! For all of you with a non-supportive partner, hang in there.

2020-06-16 08:54:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ha3fsj/need_an_outlet/,Need an outlet,"I don't have anyone to vent to. Not many people know I've stopped drinking again. I've been using this subreddit as a sounding board, but then I feel guilty that people actually have to read it and feel like they should reply. I feel selfish for taking up people's time. 

I'm just...still really struggling. I have little energy. I've been eating well and exercising a little bit, trying to do everything right, and I feel like I'm not thriving like I should be. I stopped drinking, aren't things supposed to get better? I suppose maybe I was drinking to cover up all the issues I was having before. 

My sleep is all over the place. At least every three nights, sometimes more frequently, I will start to fall asleep and then jump awake because of some small annoyance--hair in my face, a noise outside, uncomfortable pillows/blankets. And then I get the idea in my head of, 'Oh god, it's going to be another one of those nights where I can't sleep,' and I stress myself out over it, which makes it even harder to drop off. I try to meditate and it sometimes works. I either get a little sleep, but it's interrupted with vivid, disturbing dreams, or I get too much sleep and feel drugged and fucked up all day.

My work offered me some hours, which is great as I haven't had any money coming in. My kid just went back to 'school', and I was honestly looking forward to time by myself, but it coincided with work calling me up. Maybe I should have said no, or been honest with them that I'm dealing with recovery, but I didn't. And I'm hating it. I've been given a whole bunch of random jobs that have nothing to do with my job description because what I normally do is not needed at the moment. But... they're flexible, the pay is decent, and they've been nice enough to find me work. So not only am I not happy, but then I feel guilty for not being happy. I feel ungrateful, but feel stuck nonetheless. I looked for other jobs today and I don't like anything (again, feel ungrateful and picky). I don't want to go back to doing care because I burnt out so bad last time. I have no education other than my bullshit, useless writing degree. And if I change jobs now, I have no idea if there will even be childcare available this summer, so I might end up having to quit anyway. Ideally, and in a perfect selfish world, I could go to some retreat somewhere where I could actually switch off for a while and have no responsibilities and just...figure out who the fuck I am and what I want.

My marriage is still at a standstill. We are unofficially separated. My mind goes numb every time I try to make sense of it. It's all so, so much. I can't afford to live on my own, so we are just...making it work at the moment. I don't know whether my feelings are true, or whether they're influenced by sobriety/mental illness/stress/exhaustion. Again, I just wish I could run away somewhere. 

I keep wanting to go back to a doctor, but I've had SO MANY bad experiences with them just throwing some pill at me and chucking me out. I've been to counselling so many times that I kind of see it as a crutch now. I don't think anyone else can help me, but I don't feel strong enough to help myself. I know my body is crying out, trying to tell me something is wrong, but I don't know where to start. I only just got sober, I'm trying to get hold of my binge eating, I still pull my hair out (not huge amounts, but I search through to find the 'rough' ones and pull them out), I still pick at my spots/scabs/etc., I still spend way too much time on the internet. I'm overwhelmed by how fucked up I am and how many things I need to tackle and I'm overwhelmed by the thought that this is what sober life is--having to face all this shit for the rest of my life and actually work through it, or accept that maybe I'll always be fucked up. I know I could go to the doctor and get a pill and forget about things again, but I feel like that's treating the symptoms instead of the cause and that it will just prolong the journey to actually tackling anything. I've also had some really terrifying experiences on prescribed drugs and I can't afford to go through that again (weeks of constant paranoia, not being able to get out of bed, etc... I have to take care of my kid, I don't have time to 'ease in' to a drug.)

I know from my last post that a lot of people suggested helping others... I haven't done that yet. So I can't say that it's not working. But I just feel like shit. I feel like there's this little person in me begging to be helped first, but I keep pushing it down and beating myself up for being pathetic and selfish and immature. I'm fucking 35 years old and I feel like I have no life skills or emotional competencies. 

In short, I still don't like myself. And that's the hardest thing to deal with in terms of recovery, because why would you try to get better if you don't even like yourself? I feel like I could 'fix' one thing, and then there will be something else that appears that may not even be fixable. I've never felt good enough. I'm trying to read this self esteem book, but it's VERY CBT-based and I feel like I'm not smart enough to 'get' it, even though I did some cbt counseling and got on really well with it. So I just feel like a failure. Maybe I've permanently fucked my brain. I used to think I was smart, and that used to be my only 'redeeming' quality according to my parents, but I feel like alcohol robbed me of that. While I became dependent on it, all my friends sped past me and got degrees and actually did things with their lives. I feel really fucking dumb now. I don't know how to have an opinion about anything because having an opinion gets you instantly labeled and stuck in a box with some political alignment plastered on the outside and then I have to justify why I'm stuck there. 

Again, I'm not trying to host back to back pity parties. I'm not fishing for compliments or attention. I just need an outlet. I don't have anyone else to tell these things to because everyone is probably already sick of hearing my bullshit. Everyone else seems to be able to just get on with life. To go to work every day, come home, do what needs to get done, etc etc, and be CONTENT. And I feel ungrateful for not being content. I feel ashamed to say I'm unhappy and unfulfilled. 

It feels like there's no right answer. I need money to get by. So I need a job. Job then takes up most of my time, no more time for creative pursuits (not that I'm doing much of this anyway) or weekends away (I like hosteling), therefore I feel totally unfulfilled, start resenting my job, crash and burn. My whole life has been like this. Moving every couple years, changing jobs frequently, up until meeting my husband it was a different guy every couple months..sometimes every weekend. I have no idea what I want, what I'm good at, what makes me happy. If there was a way to kill myself without anyone getting hurt, I would seriously consider it. (I'm not suicidal, I don't have a 'plan', it just seems like an attractively easy solution, although I know it's NOT.)

I've cried throughout writing this, and it feels good to get it all out, but I don't feel like I've done anything productive or made any positive changes. I'm still right where I was at the start.

Don't forget what's ahead of you if you drink again. 
Your health, friends, family, and money. The lies, the regret, the pain and the fear. 
Remember October 18th a Sunday you awoke at a friends. The last 24months a blur. Your first thought; I need a alcohol. Is anyone awake? No. You grab a beer, drink it, grab another, done. Your friends get up so you played it cool, chilled like your only thought wasn't that third beer. Your friends go outside for a smoke so you sneak and grab the third... As soon as it hit your taste buds your body said no. Thank god they were still outside...you of course run to the bathroom and puke hard, like so many times before.  
In a blur of public transport you find yourself home with a 6 pack of Ensure complete nutrition drinks, because you know you need nutrition, but there's no way you can eat. Laying in bed forcing yourself to drink ensure you're scared you're going to call in sick for the millionth time, but can't because you’ve already called in sick enough you don't even know if you're going to make rent or pay bills. You won’t dare look at your bank account. You lay in bed all night only thinking about regrets, self hatred and suicide. Without sleeping you awake to the Monday you always fuck up, with the typical shakes and a brain that's running on it's absolute lowest level. You have to think about every action you take. Ok, there is the door; open. There is the shower; shower. At this point you start reflecting not only on your physical health but your mental health. Not even reflecting, just scared you're not going to figure out how to get to work and perform your job. Even with the worlds easiest job you feel it's impossible. That little voice in your head that hates you is screaming, it's the only thing you can hear as you try to remember anything that's literally happened in the last 30minutes.  You go to work and barely make it through. you talk to no one. You take all the easy tasks and leave the harder stuff to the people who have functional brains. your completely miserable and feel like everyone hates you.  After work you go home, crawl into bed and watch Netflix. You don't know what show.  You just lay there like a dead person. Night comes, one of the worst you've had. Liver pains; your liver is screaming for help. Kidney pains; your back hurts like the time you had a kidney stone, your pee is dark and bubbly. Cramping; your legs ache and your feet cramp constantly. Skin; Your skin itches because your legs are covered in eczema because your liver is so overloaded. It feels like something biting it all over....And the worst part, your brain; You absolutely lose it. Your mind is racing so fast with images and random words nothing's making any sense except for the occasional ""I hate myself's"" and the ""let's just kill ourselves"" mixture. You literally can't chose a thought, your brain is not your own. You try to tell yourself you'll be okay, but you know somethings different this time. Without sleep you awake again wondering what day it is. Nothing's changed. You repeat almost the exact day again... The only plus is you ate some solid food. You still can't read very well and are on complete auto pilot, a very shitty auto pilot. You can't even hold a conversation with a human, At all... it's sad, but more scary than sad. Did you ruin your brain? Your having trouble operating at a 4yr olds level. You're scared. You say this time is different. You say you don't want to lose your brain, your health, your job...but what will you actually do?",8

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

""I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked...I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet."" The Bell Jar, Sylvia Plath

This quote, from one of my favorite novels, beautifully captures the array of possibilities in life, as well as the terror of commitment and decision.  For myself, the fear of loss or making a wrong choice has often paralyzed me and made me an Olympic-grade procrastinator, including in regards to my sobriety!  What I love about the Daily Check-In is that it is a manageable commitment to myself, to a way of living for a day, and a pledge I can make an honest effort to keep to others.  Not drinking is a choice I make everyday, one fig from the tree, one day at a time!

That said, this book is about a teenager and her perspectives are those of the extremes of adolescence.  As I have matured, I have come to question whether choosing one fig means losing all of the others. Maybe in degree and priority, but not entirely.  And also, do we really just get to pick one fig?

What's growing on your fig tree today?  Which figs are you grabbing for, and which ones are you letting whither?

There’s been so many words I’ve been unable to say to my friends and family. I’ve been scared to say the things that I’m able to write in the subreddit. I’m finally  starting to understand that not owning who I am has contributed to the drinking problem in the first place. So I finally feel ready to respond to the question “why did you quit drinking” with the truth. Yes, I want to be healthier, more active, and save money,  but also, I am
an alcoholic. 

If you’re just starting out and you wonder when things will get better, know that each day of sobriety is like putting a penny in a jar.

2020-06-16 00:36:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/h9wp4i/almost_2_months/,Almost 2 months,"I've been sober a little less than two months. This is the second time since turning 18 I've been sober for more than a week.

I decided to stop drinking when my relationship hit a breaking point. Literally, I guess...it was the first time he said he wanted to break up. After all the times I've woken up coming-down and shaking, thinking we were over after a particularly bad drunk argument/black out, I'm not entirely sure why this one got me to quit. I was honestly convinced our relationship was failing and we needed to just bite the bullet and end it.

I felt broken. We were arguing at least once a week and had been doing so most the time we had been together (5 yrs). I was depressed. I felt like something essential in me was slipping away or gone entirely and he was just...watching it happen. Covid hit, I wasnt working, and I finally decided it was time to get back on meds. It was do-or-die.

First night on meds I polished off a 12 pack and we fought. The next day we had the same talk we've had a million times: what did I feel like? What did he feel like? What the hell can we do to save this? I sobered up as a last-ditch effort to get him to change. 

A little less than 2 months later, I am in the best relationship I have ever had in my life. Theory: i was always in that relationship. He didn't need to change, I did.

I cannot tell you how strange it is to get sober and medicated (first time I've done both at the same time) in a situation where I have a decent enough life and an amazing partner. It's like a freaking allergy commercial: the same image seen through a blurry lens vs a clear lens. We laugh more. We fuck more. We talk out issues and solve them together. We share our hobbies. We care for each other.

The speed of this change is what makes me think it was more of a perception problem. Maybe I was always in an equal partnership with my best friend; maybe I just wasn't seeing it? Or maybe things had just been so bad for so long we were just...ready for this. We've been friends over 12 years. Maybe when I took alcohol out of the equation we reverted back into older, better habits?

I'm not entirely sure what happened and I don't know that I care to over-analyze it. We've been through so much together. It took us so long to even get together because I didn't want to fuck up his life with all my shit, but for the first time...for the first time I feel like maybe I can be good for him. Like we can be really, really good together.

I want to share this because, 2 months ago, I was pretty convinced I was a dud for a lot of well-founded reasons that currently fill up most of my notebooks in drunken scrawls. I don't know if I'll be sober the rest of my life--i would like to be, but after relapsing at a year the first time around, I'm trying to take that pressure off myself--but just under two months has made such a huge difference. I'm not a walking bundle of exposed nerve-ends anymore, I'm like, a real live girl. And I don't know, I think that's neat.


Quick shout-out to anyone sticking it out with an alcoholic loved one: no idea why you stick around, but thank you for doing it. If they decide they can quit I hope they see you for the saint you are, you are so strong, you are so beautiful, you deserve all the love and kindness in the world.",6

I started having drinks with friends around 18, experienced getting actually drunk with them maybe once a month. Went into my 20s with a solid group of friends and we loved to have parties at least every other weekend. Met my bf in this group, fell in love. The past couple of years (I’m 29 now) I’ve noticed that during the parties with friends I’m often apologizing for something the next day. I fight with him. I get emotional. I usually go through a bottle of white wine. I’ve ran away, said mean things to him, acted in insecure and accusing ways that I truly don’t feel when I’m sober...and it’s always when I’m drunk, usually off white wine. My friends are now concerned for me. It’s been going on for two years but I always just thought ah man, I got too drunk, gotta apologize, try harder next time. I don’t think it actually hit me until this month that it’s ... a problem? It just seemed normal to me. It’s like I’m realizing it’s not and I’m like “why didn’t anyone tell me..” furthermore during the pandemic I’ve started drinking alone. Again, a bottle of white wine. Once a weekend but it’s enough to ruin my weekend because I physically feel gross. Well my partner isn’t happy, he’s scared of a future with me because I don’t have control over myself when I’m drunk and he’s scared to have a family with someone like that. When he told me that my heart split open. And it was like I could see through clear glass again. That parties hadn’t been fun for anyone for awhile. I’d humiliated myself and our relationship many times. I’d physically been feeling awful and was in a cycle of feeling shame and self-medicating over and over again. I think the alcohol actually made me feel depressed lately. Well when he told me all that (end of May, I was drunk in front of friends told him to go away and was so mean to him..) I decided I had to do something. So it’s been a few weeks and I feel good, I can jog for longer, I feel clear headed when I wake up and honestly I just feel really empowered and motivated. The problem is that I don’t really want to never touch alcohol again, I just don’t want to get drunk anymore. I don’t want to lose control ever again. It’s too risky. But like, I enjoyed a craft beer on my patio yesterday and it was amazing and that was it. We also went camping last weekend and I had two beers. I knew we had his parents RV and we needed to take care of it so that was motivation (plus motivation in general due to all these new realizations..) next weekend is beer-olympics. I want to have a couple. I honestly think it’s okay. I do believe in myself and have trust in myself. I do think it’s possible to come back from an issue like this. I want to enjoy a glass of my dads homemade wine at xmas. I want to enjoy a margarita on a patio. I just don’t want to get drunk anymore. I don’t want to feel that out of control feeling ever again, I don’t want to wake up humiliated ever again... tell me am I wrong to be optimistic and think that I can give up my weekly wine bottle chugging and just try to be more of a social drinker? My relationship is on the line and if it comes down to it, of course I would give up every scrap of alcohol forever if it meant I could keep him. But I’m just trying to find another possibility here. Words of encouragement. Words of caution. Everything is welcomed, this is all so new to me, funny thing is, my mom had a completely identical experience as this at my age. I remember being little, she would chug a bottle of wine and become mean. She gave it up completely when I was around 10, she said she couldn’t stop after just one and couldn’t risk being a bad mother so she literally never touched alcohol again... my friend group and our activities are so centered around drinking though. And I enjoy the taste and so badly want to just be able to have one or two. Is it possible?",5

2020-06-16 00:03:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/h9w72b/book_movie_tuesday/,Book & Movie Tuesday,"Hello fellow Sobernauts!  I'm your stand-in Book and Movie host for the next two weeks.

I like to have a few books going at once.  I normally have a reading specifically from my recovery program, another book that covers self-help/recovery/personal growth in general, and a fiction book.

For personal growth, I recently finished _Daring Greatly_ by Brené Brown which was _very_ powerful!  A lot of my drinking was a misguided effort to drown and numb out my shame.  Looking back, that's like using gas to put out a fire.  _Daring Greatly_ isn't about sobriety per se, but about learning to be vulnerable as a means to combat shame.  I'm discovering that shame is pretty much my default emotion and response and I gained a lot of great insights and techniques from this book.

As for fiction, I'm a sucker for Space Opera.  I just wrapped up the second book in Peter F. Hamilton's _Salvation_ series and I *can't wait* until the final book is out!  Most of his work ends with a Deus Ex Machina-type solution which might rub people the wrong way, but I've always enjoyed the over-the-top journey I'm taken on, regardless of how it ends.  A lot of the sci-fi I read is just about exploring new ideas and possibilities and seeing the world in a new way, a lot like my non-fiction reading, but done in a bit more fun way ;-)

Movies?  Haven't recently seen many that I can recommend.  My wife and I have about...oh, 25 seconds of free time to ourselves at the end of the night, so there's no time to sit down and watch a full movie!  But we do binge-watch TV series pretty regularly.

Last month we discovered and *devoured* _Schitt's Creek_.  It is, by far, one of the best series, I've ever watched.  It's not only consistently hilarious, but full of great, loving moments without being sappy.  The series ends in a very nice way as well.  It was nice to watch a cast of characters find gratitude and grace in rough situations and grow as people.  It bolstered my own desire to keep moving forward no matter the situation while filling my heart with good feelings at the end of a long day.  I can't recommend it enough.

I'd love to hear what fun or thought-provoking things you've read/watched lately?",13

I am working from home but barely; I’ve probably worked an average of an hour a week for the past two months. There just isn’t much for me to do (work wise) while stuck at home. The first month, I was exercising regularly and eating really well, but my sleep got worse. Lack of sleep led to stress and caving in on the exercise and food. I have so many things I could be doing around the house but I have zero motivation. 

I know so many of us are struggling during these strange times. I feel lucky. I am financially stable and family life has been pretty good. My marriage is actually thriving during isolation, unlike many stories I have heard. So I feel bad venting. I just don’t know how to get my ass in gear and get going. 

The cravings to drink have become a nightly thing again. They were mostly gone for so long... I want that back. They aren’t unbearable, but I’m not foolish enough to try and pretend they aren’t there. So I came here.

I'm(f) 21 years old and I have never been a fan of alcohol, I could drink one or two if I was dragged to a party.

My first semester in University was a little crazy cause I was depressed so I started drinking every weekend, just like my das, so I decided and got psychiatric help and stopped the social drinking, I'm better now but I can't stop with the ""oh, maybe I can have one drink, it doesn't hurt me"" (like every two weeks, approx), when it does hurt me, I feel guilty doing it, I feel sad when I drink, I feel angry.

I want to post about how my life has felt from the inside and see if anyone has overcome while being similar. I feel like theres a few different ways your inner voice or conscience can sound and how you respond to it can vary greatly depending on the person so I'm just looking for some help. sorry if that sounds stupid. It's a long story but everyone's is I guess.

When i hit my teenage years it felt like my brain went crazy. I was always shy and I froze up in confrontation and as I hit puberty it seemed to get worse. I felt disassociated from society, I was so shocked at how people could just live through everyday chaos and uncertainty, the horrors of humanity, all the horrible things we do to eachother. All day every day i would dwell on existential life questions, why are wee here? what is consciousness? and why did so many people believe in god when life was so terrible for so many innocent people. It got to the point my inner voice would always creep in saying that death would bring answers, life was uncertain and the only way to know was to die. I started driving myself crazy thinking about what happens after we die. I took a morbid curiosity to death, turned into a metal head/almost goth. I spent my time judging others and making horrible jokes just to make people uncomfortable. All the while my inner voice would tell me the answer came in death and it tell myself to shut up.

It went on for a while until in the summer before 8th grade. My brother brought me to my first high school parties. I started drinking quickly as and I found it shut up my inner voice and allowed me to relax. I wouldn't argue with myself, instead I would do crazy stunts for attention or crack jokes to make people laugh, something that really made me happy. When i finally showed up at high school I found that a bunch of fake rumors had been spread about me (by friends of my bro) being clinically crazy and killing people, i thought it was hilarious so i played in to it. No one would bully or confront me and on the weekends we would party. I would ace tests but never do my homework, i took summer school every year for a random class I gave up on and failed and just didnt care. Teachers would try to reach out to me for not living up to the potential they saw but i never listened. 

I still hated my inner voice when sober, but when id drink all i could do was have fun. I wouldn't argue with myself. Instead i would just go crazy for the reactions. After a couple years my brother graduated, at this point I could drink a 30 pack and half a fifth in a night, I was drinking daily. I was mostly able to stop when I found a toxic girl who didnt drink, the arguments with myself came back but i replaced it with sex and fights with her. I let her move in after 2 months and found I could get out of my head if i had sex 2+ times a day regardless of how horrible we were to eachother. When that relationship failed after 3 years it was right back to booze. I turned 21 shortly after, spent 5 days a week at the bar and the weekends at house parties.

I just spent over $2.5k on my motorcycle so I can go off-road and carry my camping gear. After being able to save my money, that usually went to booze and drugs, I finally am able to spend it on things that will allow me to achieve things I couldn't before. I went camping over the weekend with my old friends. And they pretty much just spent the entire time drinking. So many jokes about being hydrated with beer and white claw, to the point of absurdity. But lets take a quick step back in time. Just a couple of years ago I went camping to the same spot, same friends. I was already hungover from the night before. So in hot desert heat I started chugging vodka, beer, drinking very little water. I couldn't urinate, but kept on drinking. As the night went on, we took psychedelics. As we watched Milky Way above us, I always had a vodka soda in my hand. As the night got cold, I was just drinking vodka...""to stay warm."" By the morning I woke up with alcohol poisoning, throwing up every 10 minutes, dry heaving. When everyone was packed up, I was puking out of the car. There's even a video my friends took of me puking out the window, puke turning into mist at highway speeds, with my head sticking out the window. Skip to this weekend. I was able to take my bike out and go exploring. Took a lot of photos of the landscape. Went back to town to get more fire wood. Then it dawned on me that this is what we usually did. Go to a place, and get drunk. Seeing my friends hungover in the morning was a good reminder why I quit drinking. Listening them repeat themselves, slurred speech, smug behavior. I still love hanging out with them, but at the same time felt like we could have done a lot more. Something to really remember the weekend by. I am very glad I didn't decide that I could have a beer to cool off. Because my friends would have probably welcomed it. And that would be an easy way to turn this camp out to a sequel of puking and feeling like shit again. Plus I wouldn't be able to ride my own bike home, so probably would have been stuck in the hills for another half day.

Just as each of us has our own journey in sobriety, we also each have our own gains. I'm not one of those who got a lot of positive life changes after stopping drinking.

What I got was being able to see me without a bottle in the way. The actual act of not drinking has been the easiest part. Remembering the piece of shit that I was when I was drinking has been a bit harder to handle. 

I turn a year older (already in my mid-40s and that's as specific as I will get) in a few days. And I was an alcoholic, smoker, and drug-user for close to 30 of the previous years. So, looking in the mirror is a long line of mistakes. Broken lives, ruined relationships, lost chances, squandered opportunities. Oh, there's a couple good points, but those can probably be counted on one hand, and even then, they all usually include alcohol somehow.  And, let's not get started on what the future looks like after having wasted literal decades of time, health, and productivity.

Now, this may sound like I think stopping drinking wasn't worth it. But, that couldn't be farther from the truth. Here's the important part: sobriety comes with challenges and the road may not always go the way you want. However, it is always better than the alternative. 

Being sober and having a lifetime of regret behind you is still better than drinking.

There is one person in the world who truly knows of my problem and he doesn’t even know the extent of it. After many failed attempts to quit, this last weekend was the final straw. I have been attempting to stop on my own for the past year now, but it’s clear to me that’s not enough. I’ve been lurking through the posts on here all morning, and I feel so blessed to have somehow come across this when I did. This will be long, but I need to finally breathe and let it out. Even if no one reads this, I feel as though if I write it out, it will show me the side I’ve been downplaying for years. 

I started heavily drinking a couple years ago when I turned 21. It was harmless at first, as most stories start out. Then I started drinking alone as I would use it to relax after work with whatever show I was watching. At first, I felt like an adult and cool to be able to drink whenever I wanted. My work wasn’t effected or my energy, so I didn’t care. About 6 months into drinking every night, I started to feel the effects. After months of never having a hang over, I started to come into work and people would point out that I looked rough or tired. I knew what it was, but once the hang over subsided, it was back to drinking that night again. As if I forgot how bad I felt that morning. This continued for years. Progressively getting worse with what felt like each month that passed. The worst part is that I have a job that requires a steady hand (not like I would hurt anyone if I was a bit shakey) but on bad hangover days my anxiety from drinking and simply drinking itself would cause me to have such bad shakiness. Additionally, the anxiety would cause terrible stomach pains. Still didn’t care enough to stop. 
I would go out with friends and black out, I would either fall DEAD asleep (more often than not) so they would have to take care of me, or just take on personality traits that they didn’t like. I lost friends, and I used whatever bad traits they had as an excuse of why I didn’t want to be their friends anyways once they stopped talking to me. If I did anything embarrassing, I would drink by myself the following days until I didn’t care anymore. 
It wasn’t until about 6-9 months ago (memory issues), about 2 years into heavily drinking, that I realized I had a problem. I would wake up after a heavy night of drinking laying in my own piss. Sometimes on the floor after passing out, to my brother asking what was wrong. I would tell him I was sick and took too much NyQuil. “Must have really did a number on me”. I would be late to work, sometimes call in saying there was an emergency but it was me just too hung over to come in. Then once I was told I could stay home, I would take it as a free day to day drink. Any time I would have days off from work, I would get excited as it was an extra day to drink. Which is why I hated quarantine. I took it as a vacation to drink, and ultimately became the heaviest I’ve ever been putting on 20 pounds. 
I would frequently skip meals to drink as that’s all I cared about. Would lock myself up in the house and drink instead of going out with friends, convincing my extroverted self that I was now introverted and it’s why I wanted to be home instead of out doing things that mattered. Oh god, and during these times I would get on social media or call people. Make an ass out of myself talking about nonsense, just to wake up and be living with anxiety about what I said. 
My father is an alcoholic, and after visiting him one time a year ago, I blacked out. Went to use the restroom and passed out on the floor. Woke up to him giving me self help books he used. I always saw him as a hypocrite because he still drinks every night. So I didn’t listen regardless of him being right. I probably blacked out in front of my dad 3 or 4 times after that. Oh and I threw away the books because I “didn’t need them”. 
I didn’t realize the real problem for awhile. After researching this a lot, I realized I was high functioning. My job started to become severely affected but it was more because of personal reasons, like losing my drive. But I adopted a friend group that didn’t drink and started to focus more on my job to make up for my drinking. It doesn’t feel like a problem if you don’t drink with your friends and you’re excelling at work, so that was the type of alcoholic personality I took on. If I ever had a heavy night drinking, I would deep clean my apartment and throw out anything I was hoarding. Go for a long run, play with my dog, all things that made me feel like a well functioning human in society. This was the cycle I took on that made me feel the least shittiest about what I was becoming/doing to my body on a nightly bases.
Quarantine was when I decided I wanted to cut back. Sadly it wasn’t even because of the things I listed above. It was the weight. I wish it was because I cared about my health, but it was just because I felt I looked ugly. I cut back. Instead of going cold turkey, I would have a beer or two a night. And it was going great as some nights I wouldn’t drink, the longest timeframe being 5 days with absolutely nothing. I felt so good after those 5 days and realized I mostly drank out of routine. I lost some weight, a lot in my face and neck that I thought I would never lose. Apparently alcohol goes straight to your neck? I don’t know, but I looked great. I would continue to drink at most two beers a night, and tried not to focus on complete sobriety as that made the urge worse. Then my memory came back. Holy crap, that was the best feeling. My brother would always remember so much of the shows we’d watch, and after cutting back I was telling him things he couldn’t even remember. But I digress. My brother is an alcoholic, too. And we love to drink together. One night of heavy drinking with him lead to two...and I was back before I knew it to being on day 4 of drinking heavy again. That was a week ago. This last weekend I did embarrassing things in front of my friends who don’t drink and then proceeded to almost get myself killed. This isn’t even the first time. But I know I’m overdue with the chances I’ve been given. At this rate, it’s just one night away from something happening. 
I’ve always wanted a healthy relationship with alcohol and hope to in the future, as in those couple weeks of moderation/abstinence I did really well. But I’m also hoping that by 6 months or so, like I’ve seen a lot of you say on here, that I won’t want to go back. I think I say that I want to have a healthy relationship with alcohol because I’m still in denial. I still see it as more of a dependence....but the difference is that dependence goes away. 

I’m just ready to take my life over again. Get my finances straight....appreciate what life has to offer instead of living in a constant haze missing out on everything. I’m still young, but I feel like my life is passing me by and it makes me depressed. Not to mention the people I’m losing or pushing away. 

I’m sorry this was so long. I don’t expect anyone to read it. But if you do, thank you. And I could use any advise you have to offer. Although, I want to say thank you for posting your stories. They have already helped answer many questions I’ve had, and even motivated me to post myself. Something I never thought I would do in a thousand years. I’m so thankful for y’all. 

Question: what is your opinion on slowly stopping versus cold turkey? Slowly stopping for me resulted in the longest moderate/abstinent period of my drinking. However, I still obviously failed.",25

For most of lockdown, I've actually been doing well. I stopped drinking, I've been taking better care of myself, killing it at work, and overall feeling better. However, I've let some of my better habits slip and I was anxious and stressed  today so much so that after barely making it through the work day, I ordered too much take out and ate a pint of ice cream as I just sat on the couch watching Netflix. I realized that as I thought I was trying to ""relax"", I was really trying to numb myself in some way to cope with the rough day (and previously rough days of work). I know if there was alcohol in the house, I would have been very tempted to drink it to get that numbing feeling that I used to get on these sorts of nights. Alcohol is how I used to cope with these kinds of days. 

But I did not give in. And I'm using this post as a means of accountability to not give in. I came to this group for support in my earlier days and every time I post something here, it's like I'm talking to you all and making myself accountable to each one of you.

So, I'm using today as a lesson that I need to get my old healthy routine habits back (i.e. the ones that made me feel so great during lockdown) and I'm continuing to fight and not drink today. 

Thank you all for being in this community and for sharing your successes and struggles. It saved me today from going back where I didn't want to go.

I’m pretty down to earth. Head strong. I had a challenging childhood but am generally a master of my own mind (such a naive thing to say but whatever).
Anyway. 
I once had a hangover. 15 years ago. I was in work. I was edgy and felt ill. Nauseous, headache. The classics. I went to the loo and locked the cubical. I thought I was going to pass out. I think the fear of that started what became several years of crippling panic attacks. 
Many people, when asked what an anxiety attack is like, say that you genuinely feel like you are going to die. I felt that every time. Mine sent my hands into spasms, my face froze, jaw locked shut. When asked if I was ok I could only murmur “mmmrffffthshh”. Like I had a stroke. 
It all started with a hangover. 
This meant that... you guessed it, if I felt one coming on (mostly from hangovers), I’d have to smash a few drinks to release the grip it started having on me.
I had these on my honeymoon, I couldn’t go to the dentist, the hairdresser, the supermarket, I couldn’t drive sometimes. In the end, when hungover, I’d walk funny. Fast, fidgety, head swilling. I kinda got used to it. 
It always started with a hangover. 

Sitting here now, even though I am early on in my sobriety, it seems crazy that I put myself through that. I think if I’m honest, it was another excuse to keep drinking. 
Today I stretched, worked out and wrote this post. I did not drink and couldn’t feel more peaceful.",15
2020-06-15 16:06:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/h9nryc/strangely_having_access_to_alcohol_makes_it/,Strangely having access to alcohol makes it easier to choose not to drink.,"I don’t drive (because it scares me, but it was probably a blessing that I don’t drive) so my only ID is my passport. My fiancé used to hold onto it so that I had no opportunity to drink. I look exactly 15 so I wouldn’t be able to buy without an ID.

I used to scheme when I could sneak my passport from my fiances desk to go out and buy a drink. I’d obsess over when I’d take it and how I’d get away with it. I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

103 days ago I found an opportunity to snatch my ID, buy vodka during work, and return it without him noticing. He did however notice I was drunk with ONE look. But I held it together. The next day I acted like a fool. I was too drunk to get on the train after work so I asked my fiancé to pick me up. Waiting in the freezing cold for 2 hours. I also acted a complete fool, and the next morning I realized I was calling people up and sending nonsense texts. This was a Friday. I was so fucking humiliated I thought I was going to die.

After that I just said “please let me hold onto my passport” my thought was: if shit hits the fan at work at least I’ll drink the pain away (great idea, right?) I wanted to drink so bad, but simply the thought that I could drink if I wanted to took a lot of anxiety away.

Since then I’ve had my ID every day and I haven’t drank even though I can buy alcohol if I want to. I don’t obsess over thoughts like “how can I get my ID without my husband noticing?”

Probably not a good idea for everyone. I’m going to get my license eventually and don’t want to go crazy when I finally have my ID on me all the time.

It kind of empowers me to make my own decisions. I don’t want to drink therefore I don’t drink, not “I don’t drink because my fiance has my ID”

I drank a lot of red wine last night, one minute I was ‘fine’ and the next, well I can’t remember. I had a nice dinner with hubby, remember the chats we had...but I had drunk a bottle of wine to myself before he even got home. As soon as the kids were in bed I opened a bottle knowing that I would probably drink the whole thing. Apparently he had to tie my hair back and this morning I woke up naked (where he had stripped me), sick next to my pillow (!) and then a bowl (empty) and towel next to the bed too. I had to jump straight in the shower and wash my hair. I’ve spent the entire day feeling like utter crap, a sore throat and a very sore tummy. The shame, the guilt, the anxiety, the fear. I’ve done this for 20 years now and I’m fed up. 
I don’t even like drinking really so I don’t know why I bother. It’s not fun any more, I drink to ‘relax’ and loosen up, have ‘fun’ and zone out. Escapism. I drank 4 x beers Friday and it did nothing for me, no buzz, it actually pissed me off thinking of the calories I had consumed ‘for nothing’. My husband doesn’t understand why I can’t just have a couple of beers and then no more, like he does. I just can’t! I had some gin and tonics on Saturday evening, stopped after 5 because again, nothing, so I switched to water. They were my measures, so not measured, and strong. It made me tired so I just went to bed. Clearly, I subconsciously wanted to get black out drunk yesterday because I hadn’t achieved this on Friday or Saturday. It absolutely horrifies me to think I am behaving this way. And my mind is acting like this. The realisation that this isn’t normal, that my relationship with booze is not normal. I don’t drink all week, neither does hubby, just a rule we have and I eat so healthy, exercise etc. I don’t know why I am jeopardising my health at the weekend and sabotaging myself. 

This is my first post, I joined today, I’ve ordered the Allen Carr book off amazon and I just really want to break the binge drinking chain. I grew up with a binge drinking mother (who is now 70 and hardly ever drinks, but when she does, she’s black out). My father died years ago, he was an alcoholic and drug addict (absent for a lot of my childhood, but present enough to leave me with not very nice memories to look back on, thanks Daddy). When I was pregnant I never drank a drop, it didn’t bother me at all. I had a purpose and a reason then, the health of my unborn children. So why can’t I just not drink now?

One is never enough and I don’t have an off switch when I start. My drinking never used to bother me, I’ve always drunk hard and kept up with the boys, pints of strong lager, wine, gin... Yeah I can ‘handle it’. Or I could. I don’t struggle to not drink, I struggle to stop drinking when I do. 

No point to this post other than to vent really. I would love to be alcohol free and not crave the weekend escapism my brain keeps tricking me into thinking I need. I’m devastated to have behaved how I did last night and the havoc I wrecked on my body. Really hoping this community can help me stop this dangerous binge drinking, and break the cycle that I can now see I am becoming. I do not want my kids being around binge drinking and thinking it’s normal. I’m fed up with this. Day 1 🤞",13

Yesterday night was the best night without alcohol I’ve had in ages. I belly laughed with my husband as we played with our pets and made them dance. I made a keto meal and stuck with my diet. I had insomnia but took benadryl to help. Today I have a Benadryl hangover but it’s exponentially better than an alcohol kind. I don’t have a headache, nausea or shame.I remember all my actions. I didn’t fall or hurt myself. 

I’m typically a “happy drunk” but I manage to do something embarrassing most times I drink. Falling, farting, making fun of myself in a very unflattering way. This morning I did sleep in and was groggy from the medicine but.... I greeted my kids with no shame. I talked to a friend for an hour (socializing sober has always been a concern bc I erroneously perceive myself as being boring while sober). We made plans for her to come over (eeeek a sober get together??!). She doesn’t drink bc of being on pain meds for back problems. She’s getting surgery in 2 weeks so we will just chill. I invited another friend for coffee this week as well. I’m a loner, recluse who hides with my bottles and reads on my time off. This time, I’m doing the opposite. No more night owl. No more hiding and reading (or playing sims). No more dodging social events that don’t include booze and carrying a mommy glass everywhere. I’m funny without the booze. I’m better without it.

Ive had my sponsor for about 8 months now, and she is really pushing me to do online zoom meetings where we have to show our face. I feel really uncomfortable doing this and I simply won’t participate in this setting. In person meetings are out of the question for the foreseeable future. Ive heard of people recording and making screenshots of meetings. Not to mention data storing concerns etc. No reasonable expectation of privacy on zoom.

She texts me multiple times each day telling me about meetings I need to go to online, tell everyone my life story, memorize prayers and things of that nature. She told me she talks to her sponsor about me too, which makes me feel like what I tell her isn’t confidential; despite her telling me it is confidential. So clearly I cant trust that she keeps things private. She told me that I cannot reveal that she is my sponsor in these Zoom meetings either. 

Why is it okay for her to discuss my personal stuff with other people, but I cant reveal her as my sponsor? Shouldn’t it all be anonymous? I am going to tell her why I won’t do the online meetings, but I already know I will get pushback and continued pressure. 

Im so frustrated, the only thing that is truly helping me grow is this sub.

2020-06-15 13:58:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/h9lb99/i_slipped_well_kind_of/,"I slipped.. well, kind of","So yesterday I was at 20 sober days and got home and I am alone for a week, kids and wife are away. So I decided to give whiskey a try, as a test to see how it will go and how This Naked Mind influenced me so far. 

Well... When I bought a bottle of whiskey I told myself - I will not drink more than around 4 shots give or take. Shot glass I have is 30ml.

Well, fast forward to today and I ended up drinking 14 shots (9.57 standard drinks according to an app, at least I dont forget to use it before each shot no matter how drunk I am). Thats about half 0.5l bottle. And I was throwing up since 13:00 till about 18:00 when nausea finally stopped. 

Ugh, well, I dont conaider this experiment a failure, because now I know that no, I cant moderate, at least not in these conditions. I now experienced how tolerance changes first hand, when I was daily-ish drinking I could drink about the same amount and just have a dry mouth, some headache which would go away after aspirin and slowed thinking. But nothing like this. 

I also know that apparently my body can adjust. I did black out but it was much later than when I was drinking often, and my body's reaction is also the same it was before I started drinking often. 

So no, screw this. I sure as hell not going to drink daily again, and without daily drinking's tolerance there is no point in torturing myself like this. 3-4 hours of ""fun"" and then a whole day is out the window. Its not worth it.

So I poured the rest of the bottle out, ordered some KFC chicken and sticking to pepsi and mint tea (If I have some left...) this evening. And as many evenings from now on as I can.

Curious if I'll get a craving this evening (unlikely after feeling so bad) or this week. Either way I wont drink. 

I remember last year when I was in the same situation, home alone for a week, I drank for 3 days straight, without sobering up, had the worst migrane on day 4 AND 5 only recovered at day 5 evening. And in my mind I remember this week as 3 days when it was a whole week. Jesus. No, this week I will stay sober, work and do as much stuff on my todo list as I can. 

Anyway. I am sorry in front of myself and all of you, guys and girls, IWNDWYT and I am going to reset the counter soon.

PS: Fried Chicken > alcohol
Yes I know its not a healthy food, but I'll rather treat myself with some tasty junk food now and then than that poison shit. 

Non alcoholic versions of cocktails also taste a lot better without alcohol in them, as a matter of fact.

EDIT: btw, anyone knows any ways of quickly stopping throat aching from being burned by stomach acid and vomiting?

Also, what do you guys think, should I reset my SD badge or leave it and keep counting from 20 days? I saw someone else's post in simklar situation and they dont reset their badge",4

But, I do really want to get sober. I have some antabuse left and have scheduled out AA meetings for the week. 

Something I’ve noticed when I stop drinking is how empty and repressed I feel. The only outlet I seem to have (that is not alcohol) is music. A good song allows me to feel so much, the good and the bad, and I crave it. The emotional freedom it gives me is amazing.

Can anyone else relate? Are there any bands in particular that helped you through this time?

I’m writing this while sitting in my shower, in the middle of i the afternoon, eating slices of apple and drinking ice water and soaking in a body scrub while the hot water washes over my legs and belly. I have 57 days sober, I spent all day yesterday biking and paddle boarding, and then I spent all morning working on my college coursework. I re enrolled in college this summer,  something I put off for years and definitely couldn’t do drinking. I’m sitting in the shower because the hot water feels good on my achey muscles (aches I earned through exercise instead of drunk shenanigans) and because I wanted to take a break from working on school stuff, and because I love sitting in a hot steamy room. It just struck me this morning, what a nice feeling sitting in the shower and having a snack can be, when you’re not fighting a hangover and racking your brain trying to remember in what new and horrifying ways you embarrassed yourself the night before.

The part that jumped out to me was when he spent 2 hours with an addiction therapist and then went home and drank more that night than he had been all year. Next day he was prepping in the kitchen, agitated with himself and not understanding why he did that. All too familiar for me. Put a proper face on, then go home and drink out the steel it took to act normal and reasonable.

Feeling informed, validated, and optimistic heading into this week.",25

I shrugged and told him, ""honestly never"". He and his wife were so shocked! 

He said ""wow, that's quite a committment"". I was like yeah, but I don't enjoy the taste of alcohol, so I hide it with sodas, which now I just can drink by itself. That's when his wife remarked, ""Same, that's why I only like to drink one or two drinks"". I replied, that sounds nice but I don't have an off switch to drink one or two drinks, and I hate that getting plastered is always my end goal. They both nodded their heads and then we started talking about something else, but dang it was so liberating to just be honest with people I know for a change.

I relapsed back in October for about two months until January 3rd I think? I was five months without a drink before that. This is my longest time without a drink and the last three days I’ve felt just a wave of emotions. Thinking about my past and my past actions. Thinking about where it landed me now and how I am as a person and where I’m living. I have an amazing girlfriend who has stuck by me for 13 months and has seen me almost 11 months without a drink. But she dealt with my relapse and she dealt with me hiding my drinking when we first met. I went to detox for a fifth time after and really wanted to improve myself because I felt like this would be an amazing thing for me. I wanted to do it for myself first because I’ve attempted it multiple times, but something clicked. Im starting to remember and having flash backs of things I did drunk... I’m starting to have anxiety attacks again and stress from out of no where.... I have had cravings again out of no where as well but I never cracked. I keep reminding myself of those things I’m starting to feel again and knowing that if I go to the liquor store and buy a few shooters. It will be disgusting. I’ll have enjoyment for about an hour. Then it will be all down hill again. I’ll lose my amazing job I have. My amazing girlfriend I have. The relationships I’ve rebuilt. I know I’m in a positive direction but I feel completely stuck. In my head, in my chest, in my dreams. I sometimes just feel like a complete failure because I wasted away 6 years of my life in a complete fog of addiction. I dropped out of college my last semester in the last month and tried continuously going back and dropping out where I’m on academic suspension and in debt with the university. I attempted three times and my disease wouldn’t let me finish. I have so many dreams and ambitions and some days I have the energy and passion and others days I’m in a fog of remorse, regret, disgust, and dissatisfaction. I was going to post this on my other account but this is the one I use on here. I’m not miserable or unhappy. I feel there is just a lot of distortion and tunnel vision right now. I’m not weak or I would of been at the liquor store today. I took off work because I needed to clear my head, try and shake off the last three days....  even during the lockdown and what not I was still able to do this. Idk if things are triggering me or the “pink cloud” vanished..... Im not fearful of my future. I’m not fearful of my past. I’m not fearful of my present. I’m not fearful of relapse and regret. I’m more fearful of this wave of the last six years that just smacked me across the face randomly. I broke down crying this morning randomly. I needed to vent. Much love to everyone out there struggling everyday and maintaining their will. I love all of you. One fucking day at a time.",4

I haven’t made a new friend in this journey yet. This question was one I feared the most. How to approach the I don’t drink scenario without feeling ostracized, judged, ashamed (?), lame, out of place, awkward. I know I project these thoughts and it could just be a “you know, I don’t drink much” (aka none because of the terrible downward spiral it causes me and my life) and move along, but MAN it caused me some anxiety and triggered my brain. 

Sucks making new friends, especially in the parent game when it seems just about everyone (including past me) is cool getting semi loaded around humans that assume them for all responsibility and proceeding to buzz drive these small humans home. It’s horrifying in my sobriety but it’s a pot calling the kettle black situation, as I was right there with them not all that long ago. Makes me proud, and jealous at the same time. And wondering if I’ll ever fit in with a new crowd again. It’s strange. 

It’s been a triggering week. Just a small reminder to myself that some days and weeks are just harder, some triggers will pop up without me even knowing it, and that I am strong enough to sober on. Hard stuff sometimes.

I stopped drinking four days ago. I saw what it was doing to my spouse and kids. I am short tempered. I say no a lot. I am constantly correcting and chasing the kids to do what they should be doing after asking nicely five times and being ignored. What's difficult is my spouse is the fun parent. My spouse is the one the kids listen to once. 

I understand being irritable is part of the problem and stopping drinking will help this. But I am so, so frustrated that every single thing legitimate or not is attributed to this or being depressed, particularly since my spouse is ... depressed.

For what it's worth, I stopped drinking without saying anything to anyone. I just stopped. I would say I drank too much recently and caught myself. I used it as a crutch, particularly during COVID-19, homeschooling, and working a demanding job remotely that is hellish but pays our bills. I was juggling but I see that the balls could be dropped any moment.

My spouse is taking our kids hiking and I am now going to spend three hours in meetings where I am going to be grilled. I don't want to drink, but this is the first time I've ever felt like if I fell over and died of natural causes (because life insurance) everyone would be better off.",1

I wake up not feeling like absolute garbage and i actually feel kinda happy! Honestly its such a change in such a short amount of time i cannot believe it.

Weed is not legal where i live, so i will try my best to stop it when i feel strong enough. But for now i am already really proud of what changed. I do crave a beer occasionally, but its not like i miss it enough to actually buy some. It’s still a bit hard to walk past the alcohol ilse though.",6

In my defense, my current circumstances aren’t easy, for I own a coffee shop slash bar, so I actually sell the stuff we all try to avoid getting into our system. And I am not talking about caffeine, as you already guessed. 
Up until recently, I was doing good. On and off the wagon the last four years, this time I quit in the beginning of january after making a total ass of myself for the umpteenth time and badmouthing to my girlfriend of twelve years, who is also the mother of my eight year old daughter. 
That’s what I do, I badmouth. I have a history of verbal aggression when I am drunk, really scary Jekill and Hyde stuff. I have insulted a lot of people, not remembering any of it the day after. You get the picture. 
The bar had been closed for three months due to the Virus, but I reopened this weekend, along with all the other bars and pubs in my area, a resort town on the seaside. Along with the reopening, the sunny weather and everybody’s  high spirits came the cravings. 

The idea popped into my head that I was going to drink. And well, I did. 
Three days ago, sitting with some friends at a beach bar, sipping sparkling water, I couldn’t stop myself anymore. Everybody was drinking and I couldn’t. I actually did a crazy thing, class A addict behaviour. I mumbled an excuse about having to put money in the parking meter, left the terrace, walked to my own bar, which was closed, let myself in, gulped down two (or three, I can’t remember) strong local beers, and made my way back to my company and my sparkling water. It felt weird, it felt planned out and I was plastered, but no one seemed to notice. Shortly after, my girlfriend, my daughter and myself left for home. I actually drove my car. It was only a short drive, but I managed to find another excuse to stop at my bar one more time, so I could quickly drink one more. Once we got home, instead of getting some q-time, I retreated to bed, vaguely aware that I was undoubtedly acting suspicious. When I woke up in the morning (very early, when the booze had worked out) I was glad to find my girlfriend asleep next to me, indicating that I hadn’t behaved too badly or been a jerk to anyone. 
Although I obviously felt shame, remorse and guilt, I decided at this time NOT to reset my SD badge. I had reminded myself once again that I was an alcoholic, I reasoned. I made a mistake, got lucky that nothing bad happened and was going to get back on my horse straight away. No reset, lesson learned. The next day I worked at the bar, slightly hungover, and didn’t drink. 

But the seed had been sowed, you know?

Two days after these events (yesterday) the urge to drink hit me at the ending of a long day of hard work. As I was closing down and cleaning up, I poured myself a beer. And another one, and then one more. I followed up with some wine, and.....

Next thing I know, I woke up in the middle of the night in my bed to the realization that this time I was sleeping alone. I immediately knew that this time I hadn’t been so lucky. And neither had my family. 
Of course, I remember nothing of the events that occurred last night, but the blank has been vividly filled in for me, so I can tell you now that I:

Couldn’t find the keys to my bar and my car, called my Gf to come and get me, which she did. 
Acted weird during family dinner, rambling on about my lost keys. 
Acted as though I had no idea what she was talking about, when my gf kindly offered to go and look for my keys. (The bar was not locked). 
Called my girlfriend a ‘stupid bitch’ and other lovely names. 
Further insulted my lovely girlfriend in front of our daughter. 
Continued shouting at her whilst she was on the phone to her dad for father’s day. 
Woke up in the middle of the night, alone. 
Found my girlfriend asleep on the couch downstairs. 
Broke a glass and a plate. 

You get the picture, again. 

Because I completely blacked out, I also was amazed to not find my car in the morning when I wanted to drive my daughter to school. She had witnessed my drunken rage towards her mother and was just super sweet to the both of us in the morning, adding to my painfull sobering up. 
On the subject of father’s day, I also got a text from my own dad thanking me for my kind words for the occasion. Obviously, I forgot. 
The fact that my daughter gave me a present last night is also something I found about this morning. 

O boy did I fuck up. 

So this is the morning after.  Luckily, a slow day at work, so I had time to type this confession down. Sorry it got a bit lengthy, I felt the need to spell it all out. After I post this, I am going to reset my badge and continue.  Maybe I should try and participate somewhat more on here, I always find it easier to lurk.  Maybe that will be what I will do different this time around.  Maybe I need to sort myself out somewhat better than I have been doing.  Maybe just ‘not drinking’ isn’t good enough. Maybe.

There are those people that eagerly suggest getting some food at the start of a night out. I have been known to shout those people down like they are fucking idiots. Food!? What the hell is wrong with you? Let’s get wasted and stuff our faces at breakfast with some paracetamol and lashings of anxiety and guilt.

I realized how much I’ve been neglecting my health and got to work meditating, yoga, stretching. With my mobility back and working with a therapist on my mental health stuff, I feel changed. Not overnight and I know I have so much work to do and will always have work to do with my health. But I just didn’t feel so weighed down with pain, mental or from the Bells. I felt like I could cope without it. I nursed a glass of wine before pouring it out. Then I tried a mixed vodka drink but that tasted awful too. Finally, I decided I was being ridiculous trying to find the right tasting poison. I poured out two bottles of liquor tonight- wine and vodka. My staples. My go-tos. I didn’t want them. FIRST time that’s happened. EVER. Since I started drinking, I’ve never left a drink unfinished, let alone an entire bottle. But I didn’t need it. Or want it. It really wasn’t even a tug or pull. It just felt... stupid and a waste of time. So rather than force myself to drink, I forgave myself. I was beating myself up about my alcohol consumption but was becoming dependent on it for *pain* relief. I wasnt the weak loser I labeled myself as. I was just in A LOT OF PAIN and desperate to make it stop. No more. This is such a reminder to stay vigilant. It’s astounding how quickly old habits come back.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.  ---

where the bedclothes lie in stagnant coils on the bed

and the open valise speaks of flight…

between bitterness and hope

turning back once again to the task you cannot refuse.

Lines from “XIII (Dedications)” from an Atlas of the Difficult World” By Adrienne Rich (Full text here: [https://www.loc.gov/poetry/poetry-of-america/american-identity/janehirshfield-adriennerich.html](https://www.loc.gov/poetry/poetry-of-america/american-identity/janehirshfield-adriennerich.html))

Warmest greetings everyone!  Whether you are on day one, day 100, or day 1000, welcome and I am so pleased you have decided to not drink with all of us today.

The lines above are from one of my favorite poems.  In it the poet Adrienne Rich speaks directly to a ""you"" who occupies many places, positions and identities but are all connected by reading the poem, looking to the poem for healing, hope, compassion, understanding.  Throughout my life, whenever I read it, I feel ""seen"" by the poem especially in my longing, disappointments, struggles and loneliness.

Today I relate most strongly to the line about ""the task you cannot refuse""- I interpret this as the thing you know you must do even though it is hard.  Or as a calling, vocation or decision that must be made even though it involves change, pain, growth and loss. At this stage in my life I think of my sobriety in this way.

Do you have a ""task that you cannot refuse""?  How is not drinking today related to this task?

Sending love, support and my firm vow that I WILL NOT DRINK WITH YOU TODAY!!!",109

Well I did moderate this last week. By drinking just on two nights. Only 3/4 bottle of wine no more. (That’s what I used to have every night.)
But now I feel like shit. My skin was getting perfect, my mind felt clear, I was happy at the thought of being free and doing 30 days. But this morning, even though I have no hangover, the old dull feeling has returned. I have spots on my face, my ears are ringing and I’m miserable. I’m no longer waking up knowing I’ve done yet another day alcohol free. That was a great feeling. I can’t have that if I moderate can I? 
I want that feeling back.

I’m new to reddit and wanted to come to a community that could help me in those dark times. A buddy of mine recommended this forum, and I’ve read through many people’s stories and it’s truly inspiring.

I recently just got dumped from a 4 year relationship, and one of the biggest reasons why it ended was because of my obsession with alcohol. Every night off of work, I had a bottle in my hand and when I was dumped I went on a 4 day binge that I blacked on on in the start of day 2. I’m lucky enough I didn’t get alcohol poisoning and when I finally came to, I realized something: I have an issue, and I need to fix this for myself.

I’m starting to get back into fitness as a means to keep myself preoccupied and on a road to a healthier lifestyle. I’m getting back into powerlifting/bodybuilding, and back into Muay Thai. Any support and motivation is greatly appreciated from y’all on here. I hate to sound like I’m begging for attention and help, lol. But in these dark days, it’s always nice to hear positive words of kindness and support.

Thank you for your guys’ time! Stay safe and take care!",4
2020-06-15 00:00:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/h98jdk/acts_of_kindness_aok_monday_radical_acceptance/,Acts of Kindness (AoK) Monday - Radical Acceptance,"Hi everyone!

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we check in about any AoK that we have participated in, received, witnessed, or heard about during the week which have touched us in some way. It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game.

My AoK for this week for myself has been practicing some [radical acceptance](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/pieces-mind/201312/three-blocks-radical-acceptance) around my health. I got sick at the end of March, a couple of days after going to see my sister. We were sheltering in place, but I went to see her because she was having a total emotional meltdown. I've never seen her like that before, I sat and listened to her for several hours, she was in bad shape. As it turns out, she was melting down because she was coming down with COVID. (Yes, I got sick because I ignored the sheltering in place restriction. I feel dumb about that. But I've got a compromised immune system so I sorta figured I'd get it at some point anyway.)

I didn't get tested because there weren't huge numbers of tests available at the time and my symptoms weren't severe. I did a telemedicine appointment with my doctor and he told me that even if I got tested and it came back negative he'd tell me to assume that it was a false negative, so just treat it like I have COVID.

It wasn't that bad at the time, I hunkered down for a couple of weeks and then just tried to get on with life. But I'm realizing that I never really bounced back, and I've been in denial about how much I've been struggling since then. I'm still not feeling totally great, but I keep fighting against it. 

In a perverse way I think that I prefer to beat myself up for being lazy rather than accepting the reality that I'm just not well because then I retain the illusion of control. I have a lot of fear around my health and my ability to function, it's hard to even talk about it, it gets really tied up with my sense of self-worth. And I also just straight up have a ton of crap that I need to do, this is not great timing.

But I've realized that fighting the reality of the situation is just making it worse. I'm not giving myself permission to rest, which is definitely not helping me any, and I'm not actually getting much done anyway. Being in near total isolation hasn't helped any of this either, I don't really have any feedback on where I'm at from other people, so I’m left with my own alcoholic thinking, which means a lot of denial and trying to force my own will onto the situation.

Anyway, this week I've been practicing accepting that I am where I am right now, and I can only do what I can do, and it is what it is. I've been giving myself the opportunity to rest, since I'm unemployed anyway. I'm accepting the boxes that haven't been unpacked and the various bits of work around the house that are half done. And there's probably not a whole lot of point in applying for jobs right now anyway.

I talked it out with my sponsor and I'm working on using my recovery tools on the issue, including actively staying focused on where I'm at today and what I can do today, instead of freaking out about the bigger picture. Just for today, yo.

Anyway, that's me for this week, sobernauts. I feel like that's sort of a downer, but it's what I've got. And I feel like I should probably talk about where I'm at instead of pretending that it isn't happening, that's an AoK too. How about everyone else, any AoKs that you'd like to share?",22
2020-06-14 23:59:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/h98jbh/enough_is_enough/,Enough is Enough,"I can't get last nights poor decisions out of my head...I had just stopped drinking a few days before but found out my regular bar was open again as I walked by. I looked in to say hello and they already started pouring me a drink. Many drinks later I'm making terrible decisions...again....

The regret is killing me. The hangover is killing me. The drinking is killing me... I'm only 32 and I can literally feel the toxicity that the alcohol is having on my body. My weight is at an all time high. My liver is crying out in pain. The amount and frequency I drink has increased steadily over the past 11 years.

Every poor decision I have made has been tied to alcohol 95% of the time. I can't let this go on. I've tried in the past and the longest I have gone without drinking is 2 full weeks and picked up a new poor habit instead.

This time is different. I can't live like this anymore. I'm scared of the change and what's to come. I'm scared of how it will affect my relationships and my lifestyle. I'm choosing the path of the unknown over the path to certain death.

Please share how you avoided going into another addition.

I had already called in sick for three days in a row for the second month in a row. My job and my life were at stake. I started drinking at 8am barely making it to the store for a four pack of wine as my taper. Well as usual that ended up being another 4 and a not very successful taper. I stopped drinking at 6pm but the night continued with sweats, anxiety out the roof, horrible thoughts of my possible death alone in my apartment, unclear vision, tingling arms and legs, puffy eyes, the dark circles from many nights of no sleep made it look like I had two black eyes. It was about to storm outside but I decided to go to the ER.

I looked up the closest ER less than a mile away and pulled up at 3am. The people were the nicest I have encountered and got me into a bed in less than 30 minutes. I was given an IV bag of fluids, Ativan, some nasty tasty potassium liquid and other vitamins. I had and EKG and blood work done. I was treated so kindly and taken good care of and was able to leave by 6am with a prescription for Librium which I filled the next afternoon after going home to sleep for 6 hours. Luckily I never had a seizure but I was worried that my 15 years of daily drinking up to 2.5 bottles of wine a day for a 125 lb female plus the kindling effects I had been experiencing during my past many attempts to quit could end up bad.

They say it takes what it takes. And I hope this is what I need to end this cycle of addiction for good. I wanted to write this down so that I remember what it feels like to be on the edge of death and/or insanity.

The librium is making me very lethargic but has helped me sleep a whole night through without getting up once! I don't remember the last time that has happened.

I reset my BADGE. On day 2. IWNDWYT.

EDIT: To clarify how much I was drinking:

I was drinking 2.5 bottles of 13%  wine a day and sometimes vodka shots in between depending on what time I started and if I was trying to hide the smell. So my drinking varied but I had become a morning drinker that needed to drink some all day. I didn't really binge drink in the evenings. I even drank at work for years. I think it was mostly due to kindling because my attempts to quit in the past never caused wds over the years with bits of sobriety here and there they got worse when i would go on a bender again. I hope that helps. Everyone is different.",141

Then I heard another thump and I got nervous, so I ran downstairs to see my BF staggering around clearly very out of it and see him pass out and fall down. He was unconscious and unresponsive and I called 911 right away. Fortunately he came to while the ambulance was on its way, and was able to sit up and explain that he had terrible stomach cramps and pressure and was on his way to the bathroom when he started feeling heavy and woozy. 

The EMT's came but I sat with him and got him a robe, found his medicines and got them ready for the EMTs to read, got him some pillows, talked him through what the EMT's would do and say, and asked him all the questions I could think of (did he take any OTC medicines, did he eat anything unusual, did anything hurt, etc). I was also able to explain everything to the EMT's and answer their questions. 


Turns out he's fine, a vasovagal response can be triggered by too much pressure on the intestines and bowels and he overate a few hours earlier, some stuff that didn't agree with him. He blew up the bathroom a few times and slept it off most of the day today in between promising he would never eat an entire bag of cookies at midnight again sheepishly. 


...and the EMT's didn't ask us if we were drinking since it was apparently clear to them that alcohol wasn't a factor. I was prepared for them to ask, but I mentioned ""we don't drink or smoke or use"" and they just nodded politely and left it at that. That's the first time a medical professional hasn't asked me 5 different ways how much I had to drink (actually going back to when I was sober in my teens!) and/or am I SURE I'm not pregnant (sigh). Small win there. 

My BF told me that he was instantly relieved and grateful as he was in and out of consciousness to hear my voice as I came down the stairs and I'm INTENSELY grateful I wasn't passed out drunk or hungover and barely functional. 

THESE are the moments that make being 100% sober worth it. Sure, hashtag gainz and losing weight and sparkling eyes are great. But helping your loved ones when they are scared, vulnerable and can't advocate for themselves, that's the REAL win.

Edit: I wanted to address a comment I got. When I say ""that's the real win"" I mean FOR ME. I have posted here before about losing weight and body recomp and some other appearance related wins. So while that may not have been 100% clear in my original wording, I'm only talking about me here! Wins are wins whatever they are for others!",918

Did 21 days in March and didn’t last long after getting out. It wasn’t bad at first and I had the “I can control it” mentality. 
Last week my brain broke and I did nothing to talk it out with anyone so I was having a couple shots in the morning all over again. Closed up work early on Friday cuz I was buzzing. 
I hope I still have a job come morning.

35 mornings of waking up without a hangover and being a better mom, wife, colleague, friend. 

Clearer and brighter skin. Noticeable in my face but also my chronic eczema has improved. 

Definitely lost some bloat but not really any weight; possibly even gained some 🙈 (LOTS of snacking and eating whatever I want will do this)

Much more patience and perspective generally, both in my personal life and at work. Still lost my temper a lot. Still human!

Rediscovered my love for Diet Coke. Also crushing 12 packs of sparkling water and the occasionally kombucha treat. 

Didn’t have to worry about ‘not showing up,’ I.e. canceling plans, taking a sick day after lots of drinking, etc. Also if I didn’t want to do something, I was just honest about it. 

A few tough cravings but they did help me narrow down my triggers (boredom is a biggie, as is hunger) 

A road trip where I did all of the driving and voluntarily took one of my small children with me. 😅

Stronger and more consistent exercise. 

Quite tired still and needing a lot of sleep. 

A lot of saying ‘at least it’s better than booze’ while eating ice cream and fast food. Turns out, it is. 

Also saying ‘just don’t drink today.’ 

Thanks for all of the support on here. Looking forward to the next 35 days where I can say IWNDWYT.",40

I’m not afraid, I'm not afraid (yeah)
To take a stand, it's been a ride
Everybody, I guess I had to
Go to that place
To get to this one
Now some of you
Might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me
I'll get you there
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From ""Infinite"" down to the last ""Relapse"" album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king
You lied through your teeth, for that fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last ""Relapse"" CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack, blow 'cause I ain't playin' around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today
I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now (now)
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't realize what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand come (Come take my hand)

My father's drinking was always the cause that me and my siblings were told when talking about our parents divorce.
 I've been afflicted with the same demons as my father, and covid lockdowns have exacerbated both of our addictions. 

I wasnt planning on this, but I think having my family near and my father present, the most impactful thing I can do is to bring family together and admit my addiction; and hopefully have a double dip effect with my father present. 

The idea of this makes me sick with anxiety and uncertainty as to, if I can/will follow through with this, and if this is the right time for me.

This morning, I spent 2 hours finishing the wood chip project and went right after to the gym to lift for another hour.

My god, I think of how pretty much every weekend for years I would be anxious from heavy binge drinking on Friday and Saturday night. I would spend my Sundays thinking to myself why do I do this to myself and that I should stop. Most of my weekends were spent drinking and recovering from drinking. I was so content to go into bed by 10 last night and fall asleep by 11 because of how productive my day was. It felt good just relaxing and listening to music.

So I’ve been working hard labor about 12 hours a day since I started day 1 - (fully ready to back off if needed); we had a TON of projects that were time sensitive and needed to be done - and it was a great distraction. Plus, I sweat so much during the day - no night sweats (not scientific, but hey, to me it worked). 

If anyone saw my post last night, it was the first time I seriously wanted a drink. My nearly 17 year old daughters were being absolute shits, and my husband was only making matters worse by going from unaware to super-angry. I finally got to tell him last night that our daughters don’t feel comfortable talking to him because how he flies off the handle and is so impatient. He just started shaking his head at me (not the first time I’ve tried to tell him this) but I stopped him & said “Hey, DH, this is me, 12 days completely clear of alcohol telling you this. You always said I was only saying that because I was trying to make an excuse for drinking - well, now what?”. Yes, the girls are being shits - but raging at them only puts more pressure on me to try to strike a balance - and especially right now when I am trying to put my sobriety first.

So I’m working my butt off for 13 days - on outside projects - and I look around this morning. The house has gone to shit. I’ve kept up with tossing stuff in the washer/dryer - but there is a mini-Everest size mound of clean clothes in the family room. What picking up I’ve managed to do has been to keep fast food wrappers and dishes out of my daughters’ rooms.  These two are almost voting age. I’ve also kept up with their work clothes for them - which working is only a few hours each week.

My husband & I are from two different generations - I do not believe in physical punishments, and he’s respected that since they were born. And I AM NOT saying that the lack of smacking them has led to this attitude - I get that my constant rescuing of them, and doing for them has set this up. But a big part of my doing that has been to offset the rage-monster that comes out in my husband. 

What hurts the most is that all three have wanted me to stop drinking (more my husband, one daughter said “just not every day”), and my husband in particular knows the challenge I would be facing - my daughters to a lesser extent, just that I may have to take it easy, etc - and I did ask them to respect the daily reading time I was working on leading up to day one. So in 13 days, I’m still bending over backwards to make their lives easier daily - no appreciation - and add to it their fights over who is getting more attention, including DH complaining about attention he is getting - and I’m like WTF?! THIS was why at 9 pm I poured a hefty drink and settled alone in the family room. I wanted to blank out from the stepping in the middle of ridiculous fights - because they all knew that as I got close to 10 pm and passing out, their mild-mannered mother would snap over the stupidity and it would get ugly. So that was my time that all three tried to leave me alone. Did alcohol help? No, no it didn’t. I’ve learned enough to know it was just slowly killing me. 

It hurts right now that for all I do (that my friends have expressed is ridiculous amounts), they can’t even try to support me in this. When the BS started this afternoon, and I was just feeling worn down, my husband actually had the nerve to tell me I needed to pep up so I didn’t ruin the day. 

So, no, I’m not going to drink. But some other crap is about to need to change too. I think my guilt over nightly drinking kept me from demanding changes that healthy, normal people would consider no brainers.

Haven't missed going to bars at all and no FOMO in that arena for me. 

What's going on in the world right now is alot to take in. I wish I could be peacefully protesting for BLM but I live with two vulnerable people at home and do not want to put them at risk. (Even though one of these people is my alcoholic father who is putting himself in this category through his lifestyle choices). It is stressful seeing so many people avoiding guidelines and recommendations to slow the spread of COVID-19 since I live in a tourist town but I'm coping with my stress and anxiety in healthy ways. 

I even started exercising for the first time consistently since high school which has been a great outlet for me. I've definitely been a little sloth-like these past few months but I am so proud of myself for continuing my journey of sobriety and I am proud of each of you as well!

Loaded up on some Spindrift, and it turns out the strawberry flavor kind of tastes like a sour beer. It was nice to hang out with my friends and not have that voice in the back of my mind asking when the next beer was coming. 

I also got a chance to really see people who drink their alcohol responsibly. I usually get too drunk to notice but it seemed like a pacing thing. They all had a tendency to take their time on drinking their drinks so by the end of the night most of them had only had about 3 beers. I probably would have finished a 6-pack and then started looking around for more. But not last night!

The weird thing is that I had a dream that I got extremely drunk at home and hit my head on the counter and had a concussion for the rest of the time. So I was tired while I was dreaming which was a strange feeling. Also got sleep paralysis for the first time in years. Plus side is I’m not hungover today (yay!) but downside is I’m tired and uncomfortable with what went on in my sleep. Anyone else have unsettling dreams during their first week of not drinking?",6

I think I’ve known for a while that I needed to cut out alcohol. I don’t think I am too far gone, maybe drinking 3-4 drinks/night. But it doesn’t seem to inhibit my life- I still am cycling 40-50 miles/week, I have a PhD and am an engineer in big pharma, my work performance isn’t suffering. Sure I have a headache in the mornings, sometimes a hangover, but I always feel fine by the evening. I’m probably about 15 lbs too heavy, but I have been chalking that up to my metabolism slowing down in my late twenties, not the empty calories.

Sometimes I go 2-3 days without alcohol, and I feel great but invariably I “reward” myself with one drink and it ends up with me knocking back a six pack, passing out watching netflix, and feeling like shit the next day.

I decided exactly a week ago to try going sober for a while- no real timeframe goal, I just need to know that I can quit. Well this week was so surprisingly easy to not drink. I picked up a case of sparking water, and everytime I got the itch for something fizzy I grabbed one of those. One of my favorite things to do is sit on my porch after work with a cocktail and read. Well this week I made mocktails instead- they’re just as tasty and I could focus more on my book.

My real test was last night when some of my friends got together for a party. Everyone got absolutely trashed, while I stuck to a red solo cup filled with ice water. The first couple hours I really wanted to grab a beer, but honestly after people started to get sloppy I was so glad I was sober. Why did I ever like getting to that state? People broke glasses, fell over themselves, one girl puked at the end of the night, several others looked like death.

Waking up on a Sunday morning without a hangover is *amazing*. I went on a long bike ride and cooked breakfast before those folks at the party even got up. Our group chat is full of them complaining of massive hangover and I am not jealous at all.

I think I can do this.",12

The way I see it pinning out is that I stay sober for like a month or 2 then just tell people I don’t drink. On the one hand, this seems cowardly and like I’m giving myself a silent way out. On the other hand, this is all new to me and I want to be secure and few strong in the early days.

But I feel like this is a large piece of my sobriety that’s missing. 

Here is my hang up, I’m not a religious person. I venture to say I’m not necessarily spiritual either. My beliefs run closest to Daoism- there is a force and you can either go with it or fight against it. But how do you connect with a force? How do you pray to something with no name? I’ve tried praying to the Christian God but I end up feeling like a intruder- like a phony. 

If anyone has information you’d like to share about your spiritual connection, how you found it, what do you do if you don’t “pray”, or if you do - who do you pray to? I would really appreciate any and all input.

I keep finding things that I have had forever, but it seems like I'm actually seeing it for the first time. I was intrigued at seeing various collectables, kitchen utensils, etc., and all sorts of things going through my garage, shop, and art studio, each like another tiny crack in the paralysing shell I built around myself. 

Then there is the doozy of the day: For months I thought about ways to install some ladder forks on my truck while keeping the roll up cover in tact. The tracks run right where I would need to drill and install, so in drunken obscurity I engineered all sorts of ideas that I would build to make it work.  I did this for a long time, always wanting to be able to carry longer ladders and stock without as much hassle, but saving the accomplishment for a time that would never come.  Yesterday, I'm recalling my ideas and gathering materials, taking measurements, figuring it out for several hours, even went shopping for a special tool which HD didn't carry thankfully. I say thankfully because when I got home and turned off the monkey mind to figure out a different way it hit me. One, I was missing parts that I knew I had, and two, I didn't need to do anything special, or build anything, the fork mounts can be installed as they were intended only not in the specific way I was trying to wrap my pickled head around. It's so simple, so obvious but I was too foggy to get it just a few weeks ago.

This is an issue I've been dealing with for awhile now and I've been able to hide it well, especially through quarantine. I just wanted to tell someone.

So I've gone back and forth with heavy drinking and sobriety for quite a few years now. I'd be sober for 3-4 months, then one day, break it by binge drinking with some friends. I'd wake up the next day with a massive hangover and then ""cure"" it with more alcohol. Then the cycle begins again. It would start with a ""cure"" of a few beers, then the next day some vodka, then the next more vodka and within about a month I was back to drinking nearly a 5th of vodka every day.

Here's the thing though -- I was highly functional, which was scary. I had no reason to stop if I was still succeeding. I've nailed interviews, gotten better jobs and even raises/promotions, all while being intoxicated at work. For some reason I can still get shit done, even around the house while I'm trashed. My drinking never hurt any of my work, my relationships or anything else in my life (that I can tell). But I'm doing this now, mostly for my health.

In the past when I was trying to get sober, I went cold turkey, which I know is a really bad and dangerous idea. I've had the DTs twice and it was the worst I've ever felt in my life. I wouldn't wish that upon anyone. This time I tried something different. With a little self control, I was able to ween myself off slowly and to my surprise, not only did it work, but it really wasn't that hard. Last Saturday was the day I decided to start trying. I still drank heavily on Saturday. Then on Sunday I drank about 3/4's of a 5th of vodka. Monday about 1/2. Then Tuesday, I drank about 1/4, but I had a couple of those Truly flavored seltzer things. I continued this until Friday when all I had was 5 Truly's and then yesterday I only had 3 the entire day. Last night I slept better than I have in a long time and I woke up early this morning feeling like a million bucks. I now have no liquor left in the house and I have absolutely no desire to get more. It feels absolutely amazing to wake up feeling ""normal"" again.

Anyway, I just wanted to share this with someone, because I can't even tell my family. I was so good at hiding it that they didn't even know and I was too embarrassed to tell them. I have been lurker of this sub for a long time and have gotten a lot of inspiration from you all, so a big thank you to everyone. Here's to being sober -- this time it's for real.",4

I apologize for rambling, this is the first time I've ever actually outwardly said this to anyone. I have a wonderful fiance who will definitely support me, I just don't want her to feel like I'm trying to keep her from drinking ever again because she doesn't have any issue with it.

William Porter said that “alcohol can only give back what it takes”. I used alcohol to numb my feelings, emotions, things I couldn’t stop thinking about (like did I say the wrong thing? Or are people talking about me behind my back?). For a few hours, alcohol did numb my mind& I loved it.
But, the next day, alcohol had given me back all the things I stuffed down, along with more anxiety about what I did when I was drinking and SO. MUCH. SHAME. 
if you’re not sure if you should stop drinking, just remember that quote above. Alcohol is only a temporary relief. 
If you’ve been sober for awhile, you probably know exactly what I’m talking about, and you should be proud of yourself for choosing to be 100% present.

A couple of years ago I attempted sobriety, with good results for a month or two. It makes me wonder why I ever chose to drink again but I did choose to, over and over again.


I'm stuck in a cycle of drinking in excess once or twice a week, it's damaging my relationships, my finances and my career. The problem with this cycle is it takes 3-4 months to hit ""rock bottom"" again and to realise that I have a problem and I can't just handle a couple of drinks.


The drinking culture in Australia is very strong, and even my partner has always said that I should just have one or two, rather than overdo it. 

Yesterday I blacked out and embarrassed my partner in front of her friends, I spent an extortionate amount of money and made a series of bad decisions. This isn't an uncommon experience for myself but it is uncommon enough to be sustainable.


Today I don't want to drink, ever. I feel defeated, because I've felt like this before and yet here I am again.


This time I am committed to exhausting every possible option.

It sucks being back here but the only thing that keeps me going is the hope that this is the last time.

Drinking is so deeply ingrained in our culture and society and it took me a long time to see what a problem it really was because of that. When I’d talk to my friends and family questioning my drinking the response was always that, sure maybe I should cut down, but it wasn’t a PROBLEM. The alcoholic label really allows people to separate themselves away from the reality of problematic drinking - as if that’s some oddity only used to label people whose lives have spiraled out of control. But my life HAD spiraled away from what I wanted it to be. I was drinking almost 6 beers every night and my life was a cycle of hangover/drinking, rinse and repeat. I’ve seen it posted about but the clink of the bottles in the recycling, the shame of your own trash, the physical trauma of hangovers and all that comes with them. I’d quit a few times for short periods to lose weight, but always slid back into it again. One morning my boyfriend at the time   (Who was my drinking buddy and in retrospect it was a big reason we stayed together) woke up throwing up. I felt like garbage and was fighting my usual hangover panic attack, walked outside to find his sister (also a drinker) puking in the lawn, and he laughed at this - like she’s like us too! And I walked away seeing it all for what it was. I took 100 days away and had never felt better - changed jobs, left toxic relationships, got in amazing shape, and on and on. But I slipped back into it again, to a lesser degree, but still with the same desire - drinking to get DRUNK to feel free and numb and open and empty and loose. My entire life ultimately revolving around the 3 hours of that “perfect“ feeling. On my birthday I decided enough was enough, I missed how I’d felt without alcohol. And now, 50 days later, I know I want to stay like this. My skin looks better, I’ve lost weight, I’m flossing, I’m working out, I’m thinking about my future and my career in new ways, I’m happier, I don’t have panic attacks, I’m not hungover, and everything I want feels reachable because I can trust myself to stick with things and stay focused and be whole and solid. 

This reddit page has meant the world to me in this time, it’s the only place I can come to where people are seeing what drinking really is and looking to make their lives better without it. If you are on the fence or struggling with the first days or weeks, it gets better, it’s the only way it CAN get better. Not drinking is the base for everything that you want to see happen. I will not drink with you today.",95

My sleep, weight, relationships, etc have all improved. But, for some reason, I still feel the urge to drink. My mind plays games and tells me to cheat here or there. “Dont tell anyone, that way you can go back in moderation if you want”. 

Im happy about this, but dude is anyone else frustrated that they have to deal with this? That there are people who can drink happily and sparingly without thinking about it? That alcohol is built into every ad, show, and media, making it even harder to resist?

Still-
I wont drink with you today",7

I moved back from New Zealand to Canada. The plan is that I have to move back into my parent's place because I have nowhere to go. 

My sister is addicted to meth. 
My dad binge drinks on the weekend. 
This is my first night here and she's screaming, yelling, crying at 2am. I've been asleep for one hour. This is my first night here.

My mom took her to a rapid access addiction clinic to get her meds yesterday. It was either that or get kicked out of the house. She's 22 and has never been able to hold down a job, and she's been kicked out of school because they found out she was using meth. 

Some guy shows up at the house and tries to convince her to leave. I wake up because I hear the front door open. I wake up my mom so she can convince her to take her meds. The guy sticks around in our front yard for hours. 

When I arrived here the room I'm staying in isn't clean. There's shit everywhere. I spent the day removing all the items from the room. I washed the floors and the walls. I cleaned the entire kitchen. The basement looks like a traphouse because of my sister. 

It's 4am now. 

I was supposed to apply to jobs today. I have to physically hand in my resume to restaurants, but it's 4am now and I know that I'll look like shit from lack of sleep. I guess I'll try tomorrow.

We had hung out 1 time and after getting back from the bar we started taking shots of whiskey and next thing I know he is attacking me and I'm bleeding out of my eye and forehead and trying to fight him off but I'm too drunk to even land a punch. I saw a kitchen knife on the counter and before I knew it I had stabbed him in the chest twice and he ran away. I 20 minutes later I answer the door and I'm in a cop car on the way to the police department.  I sat in a room for 3 or 4 hours and a cop walked in and said I was being charged for attempted murder.  I couldn't believe it. I said I probably need to talk to a lawyer. After 3 days in jail my parents bailed me out.. 50,0000$ bail. I got a lawyer and 6 months passed when they were making the case. I was on uas and stuff and freaking out looking at 14 years in prison.  I was sober and seeing a therapist at the lawyer's advice and started a job during this time, which was insane to try to act normal. I went in to court for the pre trial conference after several other court appearances after 6 months. I walked up to the stand and the district attorney said she was dropping the charges  and the judge dismissed the case. This was less then 1 minute of talking in the courtroom.  The guy had a long record of assault and had drugs in his system and they could not get ahold of him for the last 4 months and had no choice but to dismiss the case. Just like that I was free. I drove home and stopped at the liquor store and have been drunk for 2 years almost every day with 3 or 4 day breaks 11 days being the longest and haven't left the house or done anything since that day. I sleep with a 40 cal handgun and a 9mm on my nightstand,  a shotgun by my couch and a 308 rifle on by my computer. I have been extremely paranoid even though the guy moved out of state and his mom told my lawyer he was afraid of me and didn't remember what happend even though he pressed the charges on me. On Monday I was vomiting blood and dumped out my vodka and cut up my debit and credit cards. My parents have been trying to get me to see a therapist but I was too scared to talk to anyone or leave their basement. I've been an alcoholic since high school, dropped out of college 5 times, 2 DUI's and can't stop. But my body can't handle any more. 4 handles a week plus beers. I haven't had a drink in almost a week and can't believe I survived detoxing by myself. But I'm done with this evil shit now. And looking at going to AA but am too scared to talk about myself. I have been lurking reading your guys stories for almost 3 years. I thought it would be easier to tell my story here before I go back to my therapist. I hadn't been in a fight since my early 20s and am 33 now and was always a happy outgoing person but now I'm miserable and barely say 20 words a day to anyone and am trapped in my mind. I can't sleep at night unless I drink myself to pass out. I am feeling better physically already but when every time I get sober I can't fathom what happend and where to go next but I dont want to drink ever again.",101

I finally came to the conclusion it was time for sobriety. 

Alcoholism runs in my family. I ended up in a psych ward last summer, actually exactly a year ago today. It was for a suicide attempt brought on by drinking. It was ugly and scary. I still did not want to stop drinking, I tried but it was for other people not for myself, which made it very hard to follow through with. 

Now I’m not drinking because I chose it. Which feels right. I haven’t had any major cravings thankfully. Gave my box of wine to the neighbors, then gave anything my partner didn’t like to family. I bought three cases of my favorite seltzer, topo Chico and drink a lot of them each day. Which helps when I want something fancier than water. 
I have been feeling withdrawals. Mostly fatigue, a little insomnia, headaches and irritability. I’m really hoping it goes away soon.  I kind of compare it to giving up sugar, withdrawals sounds scary and I was thankfully not at that level of drinking.

Ashamed I put her to sleep cleaned up her throw up moved her car. And started to talk to her friends. Apparently they weren’t concerned because “she always gets like that” is that they all said. I was in shock. “Wait She always gets like that”?  I repeated to them?  But that’s not right something could happen she’s not even herself I tried to explain. They didn’t think it was a big deal.

I’ve been watching this subreddit for a while, calmly admitting to myself that I have a problem with alcohol, trying various ways of fixing that problem and always feeling like I’m running but stumbling; not ever falling  too far across a finish line that was set as a goal. Forever? Awesome, but hasn’t happened. Three months? Obtained once during my attempts to stop. 

I have always dealt with really bad anxiety, something that I took medication(s) for long before I found that drinking was a seemingly cheaper and an easier fix. I understand that for a decade I’ve actually been making things worse but the thought of dealing with my issues is simply scary and not-so-simply scarier.

I’ve found some solace here. I see many people that post things that I relate to: sexual identity, counter cultural punk participants, and nurturers that get down on themselves for when they can’t do what’s best personally even as they exhaustingly give hope to others not in their same shoes. 

That last part is really important to me. I myself am a Montessori teacher for 3-6 year-old children. Montessori is all about developing “the whole child” but I’ve done very little in the last 10 years to develop an iota of self. I want to be the adult example on and under the surface of what I tell these children daily: “tomorrow is a new day, choices have impact, you are a good person, we’re all in this together,” and with that, hopefully finding true inspiration within is culminated and acted upon.  With over a decade of teaching, I’ve brought in to the focus with these young children that homophobia isn’t mandated, sexism isn’t mandated, racism isn’t mandated, lack of understanding isn’t mandated, being a fucking asshole isn’t mandated.  But I can’t forgive myself- I’ve whole-heartedly treat myself like an asshole.  I honestly have more faith in them than I do me. 

I put out my thanks for all of you here as you have already inspired me. I am, to put it mildly, looking forward to continued inspiration, enlightenment and common grounds. 

It’s hard for me to ever focus on my parts-of-self that are worth mentioning but I do want to do better for the kids and families I serve. I know, a lot of this change has to start with me, as I commonly preach to the kids and their families. So here goes it.

We ended up turning flights into more travel and replacing VRBOs with beautiful campsites so we could keep ourselves secluded Our plans were mostly all nature trails and outdoor stuff, we aren't afraid to pitch a tent and start a fire. This is my first summer not drinking and my first vacation not drinking. I have a good number of days under my belt so it's usually fine when he has a few and gets buzzed. Today is his Birthday and the second time he has drank, both while camping. Not only are all of these things triggers for me but he is the only person to talk to and the only source of entertainment and it's rather annoying. IWNDWYT",3

I've spent most of my time on here just reading/lurking, but I did write posts and engage more a few years ago. It's just amazing to have a community where you can read about other people's similar experiences and not feel so alone :)

I recently decided that I would make a new Reddit account and start writing/engaging on here again.

A quick intro about me - I'm 26 years old, live in the midwest, have alcoholism running deep through my family tree, and have struggled with alcohol ever since I first started drinking at age 15 (along with opiate addiction and other compulsive habits). I've had many failed attempts at moderate drinking, but have also had many successful periods of complete sobriety of various lengths, and have currently been able to refrain from drinking for the last 3 months (huge silver lining to this pandemic).

I'm really excited to start interacting on this sub again, and being able to trade experiences/perspectives with people of all ages and backgrounds. I hope to provide some valuable feedback from my own journey thus far, and am looking forward to our future discussions! Feel free to say hi and introduce yourself :)",8

My story. I am 16 I know im young but it all started in Freshman year. (I'm now going into Junior year) I remember the first time I drank I was with a friend at school. He offered me some rum in a flask bottle and some friends and I we sipped. I remember feeling it burn down my throat. We went to go to class and all of a sudden it hit me. I got super drunk. 

(I am not proud to say this) I remember how I felt. I felt super euphoric and happy for the first time. In Freshman year I was super depressed and sad. Like everything was hitting me all at once. Home life, school, and people bullying and just not wanting to be in school. 

I drank quite often at school. I'd do it alot this was near the end of the year. I remember once a the guy who gave me the rum had to help me walk my way to the classroom. Then it was the summer of 2019 and my dad was drinking and I asked if I could have one and he said yes. That night I had 7 bud lights and I believe my BAC level was 0.28% that night. I could have easily died. I remember the next day my stomach hurt and I thought I was going to die. Over the summer I'd drink every time my dad and grandma would drink. They would drink every 2 - 3 days and I was super addicted. Over the course of the end of 2019 I was still drinking alot.

 I remember it was December and we went to a vacation house for the weekend. And my dad got drunk so did my grandma and I joined it too. My mom was quite literally in the other room. I could handle myself well when drinking like you couldn't even tell I was under the influence. 

Then it was New years. I said I'd stop drinking I drank out of a bottle of wine with my grandma and dad. Then I didn't drink for 100 days I didn't know how I did it. It felt good but then one night I started really stressing about school and I was like I'm just going to out there to talk to my dad and I ended up drinking without thinking about it. After I drank I felt like shit. 

How I'm here and it's June and since then I've Drank alot. I'm ready to finally end this. I'm tired of drinking to cover up my problems. You may be asking your young what problems do you have? Well my parents don't pay much attention to me, School stresses me out, and I have really bad anxiety. But I'm not going to make these excuses anymore I'm tired of them. 

To anyone whos reading this thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope we can all stop drinking and better ourselves and finally kick this habit. 

We all got this",6

Quitting was the best choice I ever made and I would not change a thing, and I fully support anyone who is trying to quit and I really don’t want to make sobriety sound like it’s not fun, because it genuinely is. I just am having a bad day and need to rant a bit. I’ve been sober over 2 years now, and while it has been amazing, I feel like I really struggle with connecting with people. I’m in my mid 20’s, so it’s especially difficult at my age because drinking and partying is pretty much all my age group does for fun. I’m working on making more friends with interesting hobbies, but that is hard to come by. It’s really hard to fit in and find a good solid friend group when all the other girls my age just want to get together to drink. I feel like kind of a loser asking people to go for coffee or go for a walk when what they really want to do is get drunk on tequila shots and stay out til 4am. I’m just tired of feeling like an old lame person. I know I still can be fun, I just feel like people don’t give me a chance. As soon as people find out I don’t drink it’s like they lose all interest in me. Dating is hard because a lot of guys just aren’t in to a girl like me, they’d rather have some wild party chick. Drinking just bonds people together, and I feel like I’m on the outside looking in. I do a lot of stuff on my own. I travel alone, I go out alone, and I enjoy being alone, almost too much. I want to have more of a social life, but whenever I ask people to hang out i feel like they don’t really want to because I’m not a party girl. It has been especially hard lately with the lockdown, as restrictions have started lifting it seems like all anyone wants to do is drink in the park, drink at the beach, drink at the bar, drink at someone’s house. I’m working on meeting people I have things in common with, and I’m learning to embrace my independence and the things that make me unique. I’ve also started meditation recently and that has really helped me cultivate unconditional self love, and I’m getting much better at managing my expectations and not over analyzing. I’m accepting the fact that this is always going to be an aspect of my life and I need to be okay with being alone, but I just really hope it get betters as I get older. It’s hard feeling like I dont belong anywhere.",19

* I'm happy
* I'm unhappy
* I'm anxious
* I'm looking forward to something
* Something good happened
* Something bad happened
* Nothing at all happened and I'm bored
* I'm going out to dinner
* I'm cooking
* I'm watching someone else cook
* Someone on TV is drinking
* It's sunny out
* It's cold and rainy out
* It's starting to feel like summer
* It's starting to feel like fall
* It's a holiday
* I had a shitty day at work
* I had a great day at work
* It's ""almost the weekend""
* It's before or after 3:00 PM on a weekend day
* I'm hanging out with people I love
* I'm hanging out with people I don't like
* I have to do chores
* All my chores are done
* There's a pandemic and everything is terrible
* There's not a pandemic and everything is great

Edited because I thought of another one:

* I've achieved my goal and deserve to celebrate
* I didn't achieve my goal and I suck and deserve to wallow in self-pity",70

Some days I do feel scared, but some days I feel that the only thing that truly scares me is my disease. Because my disease means life or death. 

But mostly my optimism in sobriety has made me bold. My boyfriend and I bought skate boards today and I heard myself say to him in the shop: “I’ve never skateboarded, but I’m sure if I take my time and slowly get comfortable, I will avoid most injuries.” Learning to skateboard at 33!!! I trip over my own feet!!! But, if I can get sober, I can do anything! 

But I’m not scared of bruises or broken bones, I had plenty of those in my addiction that accompanied not funny stories! I only fear death at the hands of my disease. 

This is one of the promises of the program that I never would’ve expected for myself.

Ironically I’ve always found myself in the middle just trying to make sure everyone is happy. My nightly drinking was my way to just erase myself from the day of always being in the middle (and to be honest, my anger that I feel wasn’t kept in check after enough drinks - so I could usually count on being left alone and not dragged into whatever drama they wanted to start at 10 pm). They all wanted me to stop for various reasons - I told my husband what could possibly be expected, I think the fact that I’ve been pushing myself so hard for the past 12 days (so I can fall asleep exhausted) has him forgetting what I’m really trying to tackle. He hates it when I’m on the phone while we are driving - but I told him I really needed to check in here - that even annoyed him.

I knew the time would come when social gatherings would happen again and all my long time drinking friends would be surprised to hear I'm not going to get wasted with them.

However, I didn't think my first experience would be with my girlfriend's parents. 

They broke out a bottle of saki to celebrate visiting family. We had a ""socially distant dinner"" and I successfully politely declined the first offer for a beer.

When the saki came out, I said no thank you. I was asked if I ever had ""good"" saki, and I said I've gotten way to drunk on saki before, and I am all set, laughing.

My girlfriend's mom proceeded to increasingly pressure me to have some to the point where I felt so awkward I was going to explode. My girlfriend, who doesn't drink, (and NEVER has) took the glass from me and was going to drink it instead??? And her mom got excited??

Thankfully her sister took it and said she would drink it.

How do I tell people I don't drink anymore? Why do I feel so much shame in saying I'm sober? What do you guys do when you feel pressured...by someone who is as significant as your girlfriend's mother? Who you just want to impress?


I'm shaking with rage, embarrassment, sadness, anxiety. I almost left without saying goodbye.

I started running a couch to 5k app with my partner and have been really keeping up with it. I also have been putting in serious work on my cross stitching hobby.

Just last week I realized the progress I’ve actually made. [This](https://i.imgur.com/LopptDz.jpg) picture solidified that I can do it, and the more I resist the better. The top is after over a month of getting drunk alone during the day attempting to stitch. The bottom is after 40 days of serious commitment and hard work. 

I can do this. I may not do it perfectly right now, but my relationship with booze has definitely altered. It’s scary but I’m willing to work through it.",2

Parenting is the equivalent of having an 18-year hangover. The symptoms are the same. 
There’s vomit, there’s anxiety and you can’t wait for it to be over.
 
My hangovers were terrible. I drank heavy and fast, consuming more than most people, so I suffered. I’d lie in bed unable to move my head and I would spend my recovery trying to talk myself out of panic. I’d pad around the house in grubby tracksuit bottoms willing the sun to go down so I could sleep the pain away. I’d shut the blinds and hope to do better next time.
 
I feel the same way about parenting. It’s as relentless as a hangover. It drags, on and on. There is no sign of a pretty sunset here. In-fact, I forecast rain, especially as the dark cloud of the teenage years floats nearby.
 
If I could shut the blind on parenting, I would, just for a few hours. Just to get a bit of kip and a facial. Just so I can pop to the plaza to but some new clothes. My track suit pants, the ones that were saved for hangovers, have now become my daily wear. Their soft lining and holey crutch comfort me in the same way wine used to. Being comfortable has overtaken my need to be cool. I'm functional... but catwalk ready? Perhaps if ‘Dog walk prepared’ becomes a  trend, then I’m ahead of the game.
 
When I drank, I was always trying new drinking techniques; Water between wines, lining my stomach with a carbohydrate filled meals before sessions, never mixing the grape and the grain. I was hoping I’d find the perfect formula so that I could become a better drinker. A drinker that didn’t suffer.
 
‘I will get better at this. I will find a way to be a good drinker, a controlled boozer that can party all night and never feel hungover!’

Of course, I never succeeded.
 
I’d try moderation, only to overdo it. I’d be at the bar getting into the vodka jellies while my friends were still staring at the wine list. If I promised to slow down, just have two. I’d find myself making excuses as to why ‘I deserved’ a third. And we all know what happens after a third..... total annihilation. Inhibition lost, self-care exterminated, and my knickers end up hanging off a chandelier somewhere near Piccadilly Circus. 
 
I repeated the same mistakes for years.
 
My moderation challenges have spewed over into my mothering. I try moderating my anger and fail as soon as the TV is too loud. I try moderating my voice but growl when they discard the veg and are then demanding Cola icy poles.
 
I can’t moderate my love either. I’m overbearing. I want  kisses, often and I squeeze them so hard sometimes that I feel like their eyeballs might just pop out of their tiny heads. I love them more than I loved booze, it's a different love, it’s real but these relationships have similarities.

My children make me happy like vodka did
and sad like gin.
They make me feel joy like the perfect peak after two cold chardonnays
and emotional, like too much red.

My love for my children makes the reigns tight. I'm over protective. I want them to live at home with me forever...My love for them is overwhelming. It hurts  

When I think about my it too much, anxiety kicks in. Just like it used to on a dusty Sunday morning.

Being a parent is as frightening as a blackout. Motherhood makes me scared. I’m in a constant state of fear. 

That fear triggers self doubt and not only does my brain jump to worst case scenario about my children... I also think own death more. 

It stops me doing things I used to enjoy. I can’t go on rollercoasters, I don’t like boats that much, I can’t watch films in which children get kidnapped and I certainly wouldn’t go camping, too many snakes, fires and other weird antipodean deathtraps. 

The children get confused about my love and my anxiety. The two are blurred. They can’t differentiate between me telling them off because I care or as they would put it,

being  ‘A mean mummy.’
 
‘I’m not mean, I just love you so much’

My live shows it’s in anger,
I hear my voice echoing  words from my own childhood,
 
‘Don’t jump off the couch, it’s dangerous’
‘Sit up when you’re eating, you’re going to choke to death’
‘You didn’t look when you crossed the road just then. You’re going to get run over!’

They don't know that mean mum is a result of love. They will have to wait until they have kids of their own until they understand that.
 
I can’t moderate in most areas of my life, it’s not just mumming. I promise to be vegan but before the animal kingdom lets out a communal cheer, I’m shoving slices of salami in my face. 
I try to get fit and fart at yoga. I get camel toe sweat at boxing and I look like David Brent when I do Zumba. I tend to go all or nothing in sport. Mostly nothing. Either I’m doing it or I’m sitting on the couch munching on some chocolate covered pretzels feeling guilty. No in-between. No moderation.
 
And then there’s sleep, or the lack of it. When I was a boozer I didn’t sleep. I used to lie awake with my heart pounding as sugar pumped through my veins. I used to feel grumpy and tired for days after as my body recovered from the battering it had taken.  Sometimes if felt like my sleep mechanism wasn’t working. The thing in my body that switched me off was broken and no matter how desperate I was to nod off, the hangover wouldn’t let me. Booze punished me for over doing it.
 
Sleeping and parenting aren't great buddies either. I’m up early doing lunches and burning raisin toast whether or not I have slept a wink. I can’t lie in bed. There's shit to do. 
My general state is that of someone that’s been out on a huge  bender. I look like a zombie, I have pale skin and  black bags under my eyes, I wear torn; bleach stained clothes and I’m usually dragging a leg behind me because I’m too exhausted to walk like a normal human. I am the living dead.

But this living dead is functional. I've crawled out of my hungover grave and am pacing with my arms outstretched, ready to meet the demands of my little monsters.
 
A Hangover with children is not an option. The two lives are not compatible. That rockstar mother, preoccupied with the party is not the mother I want to be. 

She is a disaster zone.

I had to make a choice. Hangover or Mum.

It wasn't easy. I chose the hard, bumpy road instead of the smooth inebriated one. I have times when I wonder what I'm doing? wonder if I can really do this?

But then I reminisce about those long days in bed feeling like a shit parent and my faith in myself is restored. In the moments I feel like giving up.....thats when I remember my struggle.

I get up and I get on with it.
 
I chose the 18-year parenting hangover rather than the 24 hour booze one. 

A hangover spread over time is more bearable. More doable.  I’m clear to face all the unexpected obstacles head on, rather than hide from my family in my darkened room and even though burying my head in a bottle of Prosecco is very appealing at times, I know those two worlds don’t mingle.

Unlike a real hangover, parenting hangovers are rewarded. Like today, I didn't lie in bed and hide. I got up and made cookies bigger than my babies head. I achieved something.
 
So, good or bad. Shouty or tired.
 
Drunk mummy or sober mummy?
 
I have made my choice.",7

I live by the water too, so it's a major spot for people to come and drink, especially since the bars are still closed here. 

I was really, really close to caving. Like, I nearly wanted to snatch the beer from some stranger's hand, it was that bad. I started pointing out drinks like some sort of alcoholic where's waldo. ""Look! That guy has a corona! Do you think that woman has wine in her water bottle? Oh god, look at them drinking cider, I fucking miss cider.""

Luckily my amazing fiance helped me remember why I stopped drinking to begin with.

I've always had a problem but during the lockdown I got worse very quickly and very destructively, many of my worst days were in private where I was able to hide how bad my problem was.

I was so wrong about their reaction. They were supportive of me, we drank decent coffee, cracked jokes and had ice cream when the ice cream man came by. I had a slight mental wobble part way through where I nearly made my excuses and left but I haven't laughed and smiled so much in so long and I'm glad I stayed.

Regardless of context it's so glamourized...it could be biker dudes looking all cool and badass with their beer and cigarettes, or middle aged women in their Malibu oceanfronts with the chilled white wine and the beautiful clothes.... 

It's a sneaky form  of marketing that works even when you are aware of it. I do find myself getting at least an inkling of a craving if I'm not mindful.

Of course these shows are heavily funded by the alcohol industry. And they do a pretty effective  job of making us crave through the subliminal messaging: 'whatever life you want to lead, it'll be cooler and sexier if you are drinking!'

The only time I find this works against the industry is reality TV...I definitely do not aspire to be a drunken real housewife flipping tables or a some tanorexic GTL dude falling on my face in the club....but now that I'm not hungover I have no time for reality TV. I don't watch a lot and I love really well written shows...it's a shame to see they still rely on booze. I look forward to the day when it is as taboo as cigarettes and not heavily featured unless it really is necessary for building the characters and the story. But just drinking for no reason just to have some booze in the shot??? FUCK THAT MAN. It's annoying and kind of detrimental to recovery depending on where you are at.

If these characters were REALLY drinking that much they'd be leading far less cinematic lifestyles. Of course, being sick, tired, depressed etc doesn't move inventory.

I decided to talk with my SO about it and told her that I just really wanted to stop altogether. During quarantine I have increased my alcohol consumption and the duration of my nightly binges since I’ve had nowhere to go and nothing to do. 

I recently turned 31 and had been telling myself for years that I would stop and it just never happened. I struggled with heroin in my early 20s, scaled it down to other opioids in my late 20s and got off the needle, then when I stopped that I became an alcoholic. Even though my life has improved I have noticed it has been really affecting my gut health and as I’m starting a difficult school program in the fall I didn’t want to continue. Hopefully this time sticks.

I’m just grateful I’ve made it to the second day. I feel very sluggish and tired and dehydrated even still with lingering nausea and a general ick feeling... but here I am. Last time I got two days I turned it into three months. Hopefully this time I can just keep the ball rolling.

And lately like I said within the past week or 2 I’m drinking less and less however. I still get up and can tell I’m definitely completely dehydrated. My urine is still always like darkish yellow when I get up and for like half the day. Only drinking about a 6 pack of 16oz beers or less now compared to a 12 pack of 12 oz beers i used to drink everyday. I know it is probably a good thing that I’m drinking less and not “needing” more to get me relaxed or to sleep but I find it strange I’m still waking up feeling Groggy and still being completely dehydrated when getting up and for half the day,4

I’m not an “alcoholic” and I can easily go without alcohol for months. I hadn’t drank in over a month and I hadn’t really thought about it. However, when I DO drink, I turn into a completely different person and my depression and anxiety become 100 times worse. I’m so ashamed of how I acted last night. I had 3 drinks and I ended up sobbing on the bathroom floor, slamming my head against the ground and screaming that I wanted to die. I almost had to be taken to the hospital. My poor boyfriend had to deal with all of this.

I don’t understand why I can’t just have a few drinks and have fun. Why can’t I be one of those people??? I want to be SO bad. I want to let loose, dance, be more confident and have a great night, like most people do after 3 drinks. Instead I end up suicidal. I’m so scared that one day when I’m drunk I’ll actually harm myself in a way that isn’t fixable. I can’t let it get to that. I have to stop telling myself this lie that I can drink and have fun.",7

I still have to get 10 more weekends in sober before I can say that. For a moment I felt defeated and hopeless, like I’m never going to get long term sobriety wins. I’m never going to get this. But here’s the thing: One day at a time is exactly that - one day at a time. I realize that I have to live every single day, get every sober moment in to earn my sobriety wins.

My once athletic and slim figure had become an amorphous, pudgy mess.
For me being a guy and somewhat concerned about my image, I knew that the damage I was doing inside was reflecting on the outside.

I never had problems with my weight in adulthood, although I was a fat kid and lost 60 lbs during my sophomore year of high school.
I never had a problem with drinking, until I did.
Drinking for me became a compulsion.
It was something I did on my off days.
It made me lazy, depressed and complacent.
It fooled me into thinking it was my best friend and my only solace.

I would starve myself all day to offset the calories I'd consume from drinking.
If I hadn't done that, my weight would've spiraled out of control and I'd be on my way to diabetes or fatty liver.
I decided to stop drinking after climbing all the way from 168lbs to 192lbs(I'm 5'8) in just 4 months.
I knew that I needed to just drop it and stop fooling myself that I could ""moderate""

So I just stopped.
And every night after work (stressful sales job), instead of drinking, I'd embark on a 2-4 mile walk with my favorite comedians guiding the way.
I knew that I had a compulsion I needed to break, so staying at home was not a choice.
I decided to stop weighing myself because it was upsetting me and I knew weight loss was not linear.
I had started my walking habit 10 days prior, but used that as an excuse to imbibe afterwards.
No more.

I consistently have stuck and continue to stick with this protocol as it is still helping me.
I had intense sugar cravings so I gave into those frequently and let myself pretty much go crazy.
Despite consuming fruit gushers, fruit rollups, Klondike bars, ice cream, kind bars, and constantly snacking.
I weighed myself today and saw the number
178.

I knew my clothing was fitting way better and I didn't feel bloated and gross all the time
Plus my sleep was immaculate and people were asking if I had lost weight and saying my skin looked great.
But I had no idea the impact seeing that number would have.

I have a bit of an overactive imagination, and I'd like to think of that weight I was carrying as a monkey that was weighing me down, sinking me into the couch, and telling me I wasn't good enough.
It was convincing me that alcohol was the only solution to my problem when in fact it was the problem.
I feel great to have shed that monkey and to have dropped him completely and I don't plan on ever carrying him around again.
The fact that I was gaining weight so rapidly should illustrate to you just how much I was DRINKING NIGHTLY. 

Do I plan on never drinking again?
I can't say whether or not I won't have a beer with a friend or champagne on new year's, but I will say for the first time in a long time, I am hopeful about the future.

My name is Anthony and I will not drink with you today or tonight when the cravings tend to kick in. Lol",93

So, I've been drinking pretty steadily since I was 16-17. (I'm 33 now) in my 20's it wasn't much of a problem. I worked two jobs and partied every night. I woke up and had a beer (I drank s*** tons of PBR) if I was too hungover and even had a beer or two on my hour and a half breaks in between jobs. I would get off at 9 or 10pm get a 30 pack and drink and play beer pong till I passed out, then do it all over again. I'm amazed I had so much stamina. 

Don't get me wrong, there were intermittent bouts of sobriety for a week or two just to take a break from it all, but I always went back to my same old pattern. In my late 20's I made a career change and still had alot of the same habits, but just drinking in the evenings. Weekends were still a party, though. When I was 30 I started my own business and that same year my wife and I had a beautiful baby girl. At this point I was still drinking the Pabst, but was also drinking 1/2 to a pint of fireball in the evenings. I knew I had to quit drinking for my family and business to work. It just wasn't sustainable. 

I was drunk for the first 10 days of her life. It was really hard to stop. I started attending AA meetings once or twice a week (I'm not the biggest fan of AA, but if it works for you, go for it!) And it helped me see I wasn't alone in my struggle. I was sober for one year and one month. At this point I decided I would try and drink like a ""normal person. (Ha!) I started drinking wine a couple nights a week, but that quickly turned into every night, and when my spouse wasn't happy with it I started drinking in secret. Jameson at first, then I switched to vodka because the hangover wasn't as bad and it didnt smell so distinct. (I still haven't had another PBR or any fireball since I quit FYI) This went on with repeated attempts to get sober and constant fights with my wife.

Fast forward to now: I decided I couldn't trust myself to get sober, so last week I checked myself into detox for 48 hours. I had been taking Naltrexone, but not correctly, and when I got out started taking it properly. It REALLY helps with cravings, but since I couldn't trust myself to take it I just got my first Vivitrol shot yesterday. Its the same thing, but it lasts for 30 days. (And is also covered by US Medicaid) I've been sober for 10 days, and have zero desire to go back to my old ways. This sub has really helped the past 2 weeks since I found it. This is a great community! I will keep you all updated on how the Vivitrol works. Thanks for being here, and stay strong!

I thought I would share a success that I am rather proud of here because it taught me something and it may help others here. 

I have been on the roller coaster for awhile now. Sober-drinking-sober-drinking...you know the drill. I haven't suffered from drinking, but I feel really unhealthy when I am partaking and I do have a problem stopping once I start. Anxiety is my true enemy and alcohol is the salve that I have used for 30 years to keep the enemy at bay. Of course, this is a false sense of peace. I know that and I am working on it daily.

On to the meat of the issue: I am a retired Merchant Marine and I was offered a one day gig as a door man at this little local bar/restaurant down the street. Prior to this shift, I felt my social anxiety ramping up to the point that even 30 minutes prior to beginning the shift, I had devised numerous excuses to blow it off and I kept thinking that I should drink some whiskey (I didn't). I managed to go to the gig sober and my anxiety faded quickly, as I knew it would.

After the shift (I made 100$ cash and got a free sandwich) I was offered a shift drink. I thanked them politely and said NO THANKS! 

I am awake and feeling proud of myself. The two things that I knew but were reinforced last night are:

1. Anxiety can be insidious, but often can fade if one can push through past the point of critical mass. 
2. People respect sobriety and view you with more seriousness.

Like many, COVID has exposed for me how unhealthy my relationship with alcohol has become. Working from home and being and stuck alone inside all day had really ramped up my daily intake.

Today I take off on a two week, cross country road trip, and I'm going to take it as a chance to stay sober. I've recently been successful at stopping for a few days at a time, but staying sober for the entirety of this trip will be the longest I've been sober in years.

It’s like physically senses/sensations that were numbed or deadened even when I wasn’t actively drunk start to flicker back online. It feels incredible, and I’m wondering if anyone else has had that sensation, of sort of...coming back into your own physical body.

I’m trying to quit. My life is not in tatters like many that are less fortunate. I am able to function in all aspects of my life. Well...I fear it might be more ticking over than functioning. 
I don’t drink til I black out. I am not violent in any way, I don’t drink at work and I rarely drink in the day. I have a good relationship with friends, my wife and my kids. Sounds ok right? 
The reality is that I drink to get that drunk feeling. My first and second drink is a gulping situation to get to the plane I desire. I don’t give a shit what it is. I’ll neck whatever I can. I also drink in secret and have a private stash somewhere so while it looks like I drink half a bottle of wine, the truth is that it’s 1.5 bottles. 
I think I drink to escape. Escape what? I have more than I could ever have wanted in life. So what do I need to escape from? Ah yes...me. 
I don’t have a therapist or anything but I think I will pursue that at this point. I’m 40. I feel wise and old enough to know now that I’m my own worst enemy. 
Aaaaaaaaanyway, to my point. 
I did not drink on Wednesday. Felt good obviously. 
I did not drink on Thursday. Felt amazing. Had some great energy at home and at work. Probably the most productive I’ve been for a long time. 
Friday rolls in (yesterday). I drank some wine. Almost a bottle but not quite. I woke up at 3am this morning with a headache so bad I just couldn’t sleep. My body was appalled and angry with me. I managed to take painkillers and get sleep but holy shit. After 2 clean days, my body was not up for that at all.

When I finally gave in and decided to leave, on the drive home I wanted to die (suicide has become the new fun thing being drunk has started to throw my way) so I tried to throw myself out of the car, this failed thankfully to my partner. Once we were home he went to collect my children from their dads and I proceeding to take an overdose of multiple different painkillers. I spent 3 days in the hospital and they saved my life, I am riddled with guilt and shame that I did that, I don't want to die I have amazing things to live for so my decision is to cut out the trigger - alcohol. I have to admit that I do not an off switch and it has complete control over me. Thank you for reading and any feedback/advice is so welcome",5

The best students, the ones who learned as much as possible, studied all day and were completely committed to their sobriety failed. The ones with every reason to stay sober failed. The ones who had children to lose, marriages to lose, the ones who were on the brink of death...still went out and drank. Why? 

From what I've seen there is no reason, they've got a broken brain. There comes a point where our brains just want to drink and all negative outcomes, logic, and knowledge of the fallout disappears. The next morning; sitting in a hangover, our brains come back online and we don't know why we drank? 

This scares the shit out of me. I don't want to drink again, but I'm not fooling myself that ""I've got this"" no one has this. Even the people who've got 25 years relapse. 

It's depressing, I know, but it's also sobering. We've got to make drastic changes in our lives and stick with it every day and every night.

I'm not nervous I'll drink. I have no desire to do so.  

Just worried about having to explain myself. I usually just tell people I don't drink anymore because it makes me feel awful, that my body just doesn't handle it well any more, and I have more fun when I feel good and am present.

I am Australian and most social gatherings here have a HUGE drinking culture which is one of the reasons I guess I drank quite a bit and also why I don’t think many people here really consider binge/excessive drinking as a problem. 

What has suprised me the most is just how amazingly supportive and accomodating my friends, family and colleagues have been. Sure I got a few questions at the beginning asking if I was pregnant (lmao) or if I was feeling okay but aside from that every one has been really kind and going out of their way to make sure they have diet cokes (my favourite, lol) on hand for me. 

I don’t know it just makes me feel grateful  to have good people in my life. I guess I am just shocked because I thought I loved being drunk but now that I’ve been to more things sober I realise it was the company of my family/friends/coworkers that I enjoy, not the drink.

This subreddit has changed my life.,"Hello everyone, I checked in earlier this week and got an amazing out pouring of support. Thank you.

I mentioned that I was struggling with drinking and anxiety, and the loss of my long term relationship falling victim to alcohol-related issues. While I won’t be able to regain that relationship, I have been able to mourn it without A SINGLE DROP OF ALCOHOL.

WOW, these feelings are CHALLENGING. I was able to express myself to friends about it, and go to bed at a reasonable hour too! I feel like I’m experiencing what a regular sitcom character experiences after a relationship, not what a hungover, suicidal, nauseous depressed man child feels.

Ok, maybe that’s an exaggeration, but I drank heavily for 6 years, all throughout university and I worked in breweries so drinking was normalized. Now I’m out of everything alcohol related and I feel like I can experience both happiness and sadness at the same time. I’m serious when I say this, but I FEEL HOPEFUL. I’ve never felt that dichotomy of emotions, that range of hurt and happiness, real and healthy mourning. I don’t hate myself for feeling this way, I feel HUMAN.

I NEVER EVER WANT TO CONSUME ALCOHOL AGAIN. To think that I was dampening my spirits and self-destructing relationships by sneaking in beers or mixed drinks before meeting up is sad, depressing, and pretty embarrassing. 

I’m learning to love myself for who I am, and I’ve lost 10 pounds in 2 weeks because I’ve axed the extra calories.

This is a long post, but despite losing a serious love in my life, I’ve added myself to the list of loves I can turn to in times of need.

I truly mean this when I say this subreddit changed my life. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. I FEEL LIKE MYSELF FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OVER A DECADE.

Truth be told, the worst thing I did was say some silly stuff on the phone.... and puked in my sister's sink... and dirtied her house (we've been living together since I was hospitalized/there's no point in us having seperate houses during C19). 

Somehow I've managed to be a raging alcoholic for 5 years without any accidents/DUIs/ruined lifelong friendships.... And I don't know why I'm beating myself up for THIS unremarkable slip.

I did not want to be trans. I did not ask to be trans. And I hated it, I tried to run from it, and part of that running was through alcohol. I tried to drown my own horror at myself and my pain of being something I was ashamed of by being blackout drunk. Maybe I could be comfortable in my body if I was never sober. Maybe I could tolerate living as something I am not if I never allowed myself to feel anything.

But ultimately, as everyone here knows, that didn't work, and through my alcoholism I made everything so much worse. I humiliated myself again and again, I was constantly sick, or drunk, or both. I pushed people away from me by acting like a drunken asshole over and over until people thought I was a garbage human. I thought I was a garbage human. I went through a fifth a day at the end and part of me, I do think, hoped that I died that way.

And then I got fed up with it. I had never fully given myself a shot at life, so after a long time of struggling to get sober, I thought to myself: okay, let's do it. One last ditch attempt to actually give myself a chance, trying as hard as I can, being as true to myself as I can, and if that doesn't work, I can come back to alcohol and kill myself with it.

I've been sober for fifteen months. I have been out for four. Today, I got into a horrible, gut-wrenching, all-out fight with my mother who thinks that by being trans, I am throwing my life away and being brainwashed into joining a cult. She told me I am tearing my family apart. She told me I am delusional. She told me a million ugly things and mocked me and laughed in my face.

But do you know what? I did not once today want to drink. In the past, any time something was hard, I would run for the bottle. Two years ago after a fight like this, I would have been in the liquor store immediately and passed out drunk by the time my partner came home. I would have thrown up every fifteen minutes tomorrow. To me, staying sober through this means that I am doing the right thing for myself, and that I am strong enough to know that standing up for myself is a strong thing, not a selfish thing. I don't need to run to alcohol to hide who I am.

I am 482 days sober. Tomorrow I will be 483.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hi, SD Family!

My turn to host has come to an end for this round. I've really appreciated all of the participation and interaction this week, and I appreciate you all letting me tell my goofy farm stories. 

I find that weekends are especially wonderful to sort the posts here by ""New"" and offer some encouragement for each other. There are a lot of us, and even if we can just comment on a few and offer kind words, it can make a *huge* difference.

If you have at least 30 days sober and would like to host (I *highly* recommend- it's a lot of fun!) then please message u/SaintHomer and let him know.

Love you all and I will not drink with you today!",101

Happy though that things are getting better gradually. Thinking has changed, as have my relationships with others (and myself). It's all for the better. Despite having a fair amount of time sober there are times I feel very newly so. It's a journey of discovery, and it's fraught with both peril and beauty. I can be enjoying a bike ride or watching birds one minute- and the next a craving hits.

I've been lurking on the sub for a few months now. Finally decided to make another account so I could post comfortably on here (a few of the people I work with know my main reddit account, and I'd rather keep this chapter private for now).

I think the fact that I've been following this sub for some time now tells me more about my drinking habit than I ever told myself. I knew there was an issue. I knew it wasn't normal to make every evening a drinking occasion, down from playing a card game with a friend to watching a movie. I knew it wasn't normal to find reasons to go to the store every day, just to pick up alcohol 'while I was there'. I knew it wasn't healthy to pass out from drinking and wake up at 3am feeling glad, because it was better than waking up drunk at 7am when I had work that day.

It's time to admit that I've got a problem. I've wrestled with it for a while, but I've got a problem. Days without drinking feel tougher than days I do drink. But it took a great friend of mine, my flatmate, to point out to me that maybe I was crashing into bed intoxicated a few too many times a week. I've been good at hiding my problem; he saw maybe 60% of the iceberg, and thought it was worrying enough to call me out on it. So I took stock of the last few months, and realized I'd probably been drunk for 3 out of every 4 evenings.

Tonight I said enough was enough. I feel motivated, committed and empowered to finish drinking for good. If not that, then stopping it from being a daily occurrence.

It's going to be hard, I'm sure. My sober mind has always frightened me -- it's what made the drinks so appealing in the first place. But I'm feeling positive. It's time to put the 6 hours of trashy sleep every night aside, and get to know the real me.

To all the lurkers out there, stay strong. If it's not your time to be vocal, that's fine. To the regular posters, I pour my heart out to you. Though you may not know it, you might have helped countless people spend just one night away from the bottle, and that's an amazing thing right there.

But I’m working on not ranting and get to the point. Big thanks for the ones who do read through.*

Edit: I tried. Got away from me. TLDR: DONT drink, hammock instead.

The first time to took my sobriety seriously I had a camping hammock that I loved but other than festivals, didn’t use it. So I created through a bit of thinking to take a “living on the river” kayak trip on my birthday weekend in the fall. I had no clue on anything in regards to real camping, kayaking, outdoor survival or any gear but that hammock.

I was released from the hospital on January 20th 2017 after my liver bounced back from 3% functionality.

I saved my not drinking money to buy a fantastic barely used kayak package on April 4th. 

On April 20th a coworker wanted to start running with me and became one of the best friends I wish I could see more often.

Together we worked, ran and yak’d. He joined the hammock hotness and we just figured everything out each new trip. 3-4 hours a weekend, on unknown rivers with lunches in our hammocks.

Looking back I was always so incredibly careful to plan each trip. Leave a copy of the map with two different people. Our estimated start and finish times. A rough time we’d call or text at lunch. Emergency and Park Ranger numbers. Load outs with any first aid, snacks, dry towel - light but we were ready for anything. Something I knew nothing about but proceeded with extreme caution.

Alcohol disease, death, the fact my genes had an extremely high risk or alcoholism/addiction? Yeah right. Bunch of bull as I guzzled handles of Jager countless times.

This to me is insanity! Why the difference in attitude?Maybe I knew nature didn’t give a flock but everyone drank so it’s gotta be fine? I’ve never suffered from alcohol but nearly drowned? I digress....

But alcohol was furthest from my mind as what started with a hammock and a desire to change gave me amazing adventures with a great friend (and family that welcomed me in as well), THE MEMORIES that I still have and the knowledge that if I’m serious I can do this, 7 days in but only today matters.

It wasn’t until I decided to get my hammock out today that I remembered any of this. But as I laid back and watched tree tops sway, I was genuinely awash in natural chemical bliss. Sober and grateful for this day.",11

Last night, however, I was listening to a podcast, and the speaker was saying how this is just HARD sometimes.  Hard doesn't kill you.  I just chalked it up to being one of those hard times this afternoon, came home, made myself a fizzy alcohol-free concoction, and lived to tell about it.

The first few nights I was having a lot of trouble sleeping, which I guess is pretty common. A couple nights ago while falling asleep I experienced Exploding Head Syndrome which absolutely ruined my night, and made it even harder to sleep. Luckily it hasn’t happened again, but it was traumatic for sure. 

I’ve felt a lot more clear headed this past week than I have in years, and last night I even went for a run (I didn’t make it far but everyone has to start somewhere). 

The days seem to be passing faster than they did when I was drinking them away, which to me seems absolutely bonkers. I’m grateful though. 

I don’t have any real cravings or urges to drink, in fact there are still seven beers in my house from the last case I bought, and I rarely even look at them. When I do look at them its only to ponder dumping or donating them. 

My marijuana intake has been extremely minimal, and I’m pretty sure I’m on the cusp of giving that up completely. More for the girlfriend, I suppose. 

The girlfriend, by the way, has been absolutely floored by my progress and has been very supportive through this process. It’s really nice to hear someone tell me they are proud of me, even though I’m also very proud of myself. I used to tell myself that getting sober would be a nightmare, but I see now that was just the addiction trying to keep it’s hold on me. I know I can do this, because I’ve gotten this far.

The only problems I’m experiencing are the occasional recurring chest pains, anxiety, and irritability. Obviously those all suck and worry me, but I try to tell myself that those are fairly normal consequences of my years of binging.

It's been 31 days without a drop of alcohol.  I won't claim I haven't wanted to go get a drink or even get drunk, but I just let those thoughts pass (and drove by the convenience store I usually get my alcohol from and avoided that aisle in the grocery store).

This has been the longest I believe I've gone without alcohol in 6 years, I believe.  I started drinking regularly when I took a job as an elementary school teacher.  Before then, I'd only drink socially and seldom got drunk.   Teaching wasn't for me (and I was shocked at home many teachers drank regularly).  But like so many, I turned to alcohol - not just to deal with the stress of teaching (parents and administrators really were the problem, not the kids!)  When I went on an antidepressant, I was not warned about not mixing it with alcohol.  To be honest, most of my blackouts started at that time and continued even after I stopped the antidepressant).  I was also avoiding dealing with my maritial problems.  Since then, I've divorced and got back into my choses field.

After my divorce, my drinking really slowed down, but I had gotten into the habit of drinking alone.  A year after I left, my teenager told me of his mental health problems and I've spent the last 2 years trying to help him.  I continued to drink when alone.  While I was still able to moderate my drinking socially, I didn't when I was alone and often would 'destress' with a six-pack.  Last fall, I filed for custody (I had to move for my job and let my ex have custody) and tried to back off again . I was doing well until quarantine and then it turned into an almost daily thing.  I was drinking to numb and not think.

For a month I was like ""tomorrow I'll stop"" but tomorrow never came. I guess it would be cooler to say there was some major hangover that caused me to get on here and commit, but there wasn't.  I just recognized that I had a problem and when I started, I couldn't stop.  BUt by coming on here and committing to just not drink today, I was able to put together 31 days.  YAY!

The first few days were rough in that I had to change my habits.  I did some yoga, read books, watched Netflix (and series that I HAD watched while drunk but didn't remember.)  What I've found is that drinking didn't pass the time, it made it drag out.  Today, the days pass by quickly. I'm more productive with work and am able to be more present for my teenager (who is spending the summer with me).   I wouldn't say life is sunshine and roses.  My problems I have to deal with are still there.  And although I've made it a point in the last six months not to drink in front of my son, just drinking regularly had made me less attune to him.

I think alcohol was a lot of things for me. A friend, a transformative tool, a salve, a comfort. It stopped the hamster-wheel brain. And it numbed, if not completely erased, difficult emotions, namely fear and anger.

I think my problem now is probably more related to my anxiety, and to the fact that I haven't kept up very well with my meditation...but it still gets me down. How do people deal with normal life and not need something to take the edge off? 

I was thinking today about the general dumpster fire the planet is experiencing. I was thinking about feeling helpless as a human to address any of the major issues in the world. I feel like there's never any happy medium in life. I'm either pro-this or anti-that. 

I try not to pay any attention to the news, because I feel like it's all manipulated and motivated by money. In fact, everything is motivated by money and I feel like it cheapens EVERYTHING. For instance, I did a Masters degree in Creative Writing and Publishing, and it completely annihilated my desire to create. We learned all about crafting an online persona, changing our names to suit specific genres, pouring over amazon meta-data to find what was trending in the literary world, and so on. I learned that if I didn't have a social media presence, I may as well not even think about approaching publishers. 

That's totally besides my point. I feel so nihilistic. Everything I read about the environment tells me we've already fucked it beyond repair. I hate that living sustainably costs money. The only place to buy produce not wrapped in plastic is at the farmer's market, and their prices are unreal. Ok, I could garden. Do you know how much time gardens demand? I am barely keeping myself and my kids fed and watered. 

Things are going back to 'normal' around here. I'm supposed to go back to work next week. And I just....don't care. I've never worked anywhere longer than two years. I haven't found my passion. I don't really know my strengths. I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I want to do something meaningful, but I've never had a job that didn't involve making money for some dodgy asshole at the top. I would LOVE to go back to school, but a) I like too many different things. It literally changes every week. b) MONEY.

Anyway, I digress, again. Honestly, how do people cope with all the negativity in the world and not need some sort of substance to get through it. I know some people say to 'choose' positivity, or to change what you look for, but that seems like ignorance/privilege to me? I don't see how ignoring all the bad stuff is going to help anything. I very often dream about running off to a commune and living simply, with no fucking iphone to listen to my conversations, no tv with mindless entertainment, no 9-5 pointless monotonous job...

I've had some thoughts lately about helping others. I'm still very new in my recovery, and I am still dealing with a lot of anger and depression (evidently!), so I'm not sure I'm the best person to be reaching out to other people right now.... but I think it may help me to shift the focus away from myself. I used to work in care for a few years and I got so disillusioned by how fucked the system is and how big the problems are...I kept getting completely burnt out. And then hating myself because I felt like I shouldn't be complaining.

I don't know. I just needed to rant, I think. I sound like a spoiled brat now that I've read it back, but I think it's good getting all this shit out so that hopefully I can look back on it from a better place later on. 

Anyway, thanks for joining my party.",5

I did have a moment about a month ago where I pulled into a parking lot, but I turned around and drove away.

Some days are harder than others, but the hard days are becoming more rare. It feels like I am approaching -- if not already at -- a new normal. One that isn't me feeling like shit and being mostly useless on the weekends. I'm still lazy, but that's marginally better than being useless.

I started my sober journey back in December, but did drink during an away weekend in February (before the pandemic). So while I didn't consider that a massive relapse, it was definitely a reset -- but one in which I don't feel like I lost any progress (outside of an arbitrary number).

I texted him asking what happened last night and he sent me this. 

So, i showed up. Everything was good. Then after about an hour or so, you were trying to give me a pep talk about how you think im an alcoholic and i was telling you i wasnt which was the truth. You were pretty much telling me to my face that youd lie to me in a heartbeat as i was telling you id be honest with you in a heartbeat. Then i proceeded to tell you that my mother elaine was given 6 to 12 months to live and that info flew over your head. Fast forward about 30 mins. Were playing beer pong and then you dove for the ball. Idk why. And broke one of Nicole's glass spheres. Honestly you kindof made an ass of yourself. Fast forward another 30 mins, you and nicole were talking in the kitchen while rosie and i talked and you told nicole essentially that you wanna fuck her. That in turn made her very uncomfortable. You dont do that. I then called an uber for you while you napped and i
 looked back and you are NOT the sebi i became friends with. I couldnt confide in you, i couldnt tell you anything, i didnt recognize you one bit.

I never reached for the bottle during the lonely evenings of April but I felt as if there was a demonic presence within my head telling me to stop being so f---ing ridiculous and have a drink. I've read that a lot of people call this voice 'the wine witch' I simply call it 'the addict' because it is telling me to consume something I don't want, which is a neat definition of addiction. 

Part of the difficulties is that there is a lack of literature, either online or in book format, that targets those in their 20's (I turned 26 last month) who have made the leap of faith, not because they want to be a better spouse or a better parent, not because they are flashing red on the health warnings, but because they have drank hard for 7-10 years and have reached the realisation that they 'just can't do it anymore.' I mean, I'm sure these anecdotes and podcasts are out there, but I have looked for a long while and I can't find them. There seems to be an overwhelming abundance for those in their 30s-40s, particularly for those with kids (a massive amount of journey's I've read about appear to start with people wanting to be better parents before their relationships with their kids is damaged beyond repair.)

Each and every journey is a triumph and a noble venture. But the lack of stories that sounded anything akin to my own story, one of binge drinking, shameful one night stands and cocaine use when drunk, made me feel alone. This loneliness also fed 'the addict' who would tell me that I am being absurd and that I can start enjoying myself again in moderation. It is untrue. For some reason I simply cannot do anything in moderation, be it alcohol, chocolate, gaming, porn or football watching. As a result, this meant that either drinking had to be stopped, before it destroyed me, The manner of my drinking meant that I was likely to die by my own hand more than any other method. I simply could not drink anymore.

Our society as progressed sufficiently that there is general acceptance that some people need to quit booze. I think there however is a caveat to this, only quit once you've lived a little! As such, to quit in your 20s is 'TOO EARLY' when there is still so much fun things to do. Let me tell you this, there is nothing fun about being sick in taxis, spending a hard earned weekend with a hangover so bad you can't leave your bed, and your mental health in a permanent state of disrepair because of the depressant that is coursing through you.

If you are on here then you've probably thought about quitting or are just starting out. Don't be worried that you are too young to quit, nobody is too young to quit. If you cry when you are drunk, if you feel hopeless, if the physical act of drinking is no longer enjoyable and yet you feel powerless to control it, then it is time to give it the boot. I am 6 and a half months in now and the weeks are going quicker, I'm in great health and despite Covid my mental state is the best it has been since I was 16. Don't worry about what people will say about you, they are the losers, not you. Give being sober a whirl, I guarantee you will feel better, healthier, richer, more attractive and more confident!",10

I discovered cocktails when I was 32, and being an impulsive person I typically never have just one. But I was always able to keep it under control...a few drinks a few times a week. Had a couple minor hangovers that were unpleasant but manageable.

Not sure why...probably the stress of parenting and working during the pandemic, relationship issues coming to a head...but Wednesday night I went to town. Probably had 10 total shots within the span of about three hours. Puked a lot and then more or less passed out at 9:30 on a pile of blankets my wife made me on the floor. Legit felt like I was going to die, and still feel like shit two days later. My wife is still furious and I scared the shit out of my son who struggles with anxiety issue.

I'm happy to report that I no longer have strong cravings like I did my first couple of weeks. My desire to get intoxicated is practically non-existent. I still have an urge every now and then, but it doesn't last long and is easy to deal with. One caveat - I was at Publix the other day and went to checkout the Redbox selection, which takes you right past the beer aisle. I noticed that there was a caramel cream ale draft that sounded delicious. But I denied the craving and went about my day.

As good as that beer might've tasted, the taste of regret by having to reset my day counter would've been worse. I got some butterscotch beer/cream soda type thing and that was just as yummy. 

This is the longest I've been sober by choice. A deployment to Iraq had me around 200 days, but I don't count that because sobriety wasn't my decision. This time it is. I haven't woken up with a hangover and in shame of my actions in over 100 days and it feels great. 

One of my biggest fears was having some friends down memorial day weekend and learning how to be social with a group of friends where we typically drink like it's our job. I told them I was cutting back and working on some recovery and they supported me and chose not to drink that weekend as well. One of them got trashed the night before and it was a great reminder to see him hungover that alcohol is a poison and can really wreck some havoc on you. We went fishing at the pier, rented a pontoon boat for a few hours, and went to the beach. All of these activities I would've done drunk or spent half of my time trying to get drunk. Not worrying about how much beer to bring or if I had enough or what if I ran out was a great feeling. I think I'm starting to believe that **you don't need alcohol to have fun.** 

Anyway, to the single digit members - welcome. We're glad to have you. To the double digit members - welcome back. Good on you for sticking with it. To the triple digit members - thanks for having me. I'm glad I could join you. To the quadruple digit members, well done! That's truly impressive.

I did not really enjoy it and was upset that I would have to reset my counter (ha ha, SD is now in my dream world!).

2020-06-12 09:45:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/h7kypo/back_on_day_1/,Back on Day 1,"This is actually a story about winning.  I went 17 days without a drink.  Earlier this week I was emotional and that was a huge trigger for me.  My car was getting repairs done and was in the shop for a few days, so I ended up walking to 7/11 to buy wine.  When I got home, I made myself wait until after dinner was prepared to drink, and I poured myself a glass.  I had a full stomach and I took a sip and then, just, I don’t know, didn’t drink it.  Poured out the glass the next morning.

Last night I had the weekly Zoom happy hour with my friends.  Last night I finished that bottle of wine.  I’m starting over today, but here are some good things that have come of it:

1.  I drank less than a bottle, slowly.  Much less than my usual two bottles with a pack of cigarettes and a raging hangover.  

2.  I was mindful.  I wrote down how I was feeling during each glass, and I noticed that as soon as I was tipsy, I didn’t really want to continue drinking, but there was an argument in my head to keep going.  It’s like I talk myself into doing what I don’t want to do.  I can find a tool to refute that argument and I will.  I can dismantle that disordered habit.

3.  I didn’t like how I felt last night.  I don’t feel bad this morning, I’ve somehow escaped a hangover, but being too drunk to follow a conversation sucked.

4.  The smaller amount of wine had a larger effect after 17 days.

5.  I don’t want to rest on the concept that I can sometimes drink and it will be okay just because sometimes I actually can.  It’s not the place I want to approach this from.  I have to keep coming from a place of complete abstinence.

6.  Every time I start over, I get more days sober.  I went from 7 to 10 to 14 to 17.  Maybe this next streak will be 20 days.  That will mean that in 37 days, I drank one time.  This is a HUGE improvement from my average 3 blackouts per week.  A HUGE improvement.  I’m fucking proud of myself and I’m going to keep going!  No beating myself up here today.

This is a journey to a better life for me and I’m not giving up or wallowing, I’m doing well and I’m strong.  IWNDWYT SD FRIENDS!!",6

I was homeless living in a cut of woods behind a Church’s Chicken in Fl. and went to a meeting. A man there brought me to a sober house and gave me two weeks free to get a job and get on my feet. I found a job cooking in a breakfast restaurant and detoxed in an over 100 degree kitchen while trying to cook eggs for the next 5 days. Seeing I was a deadbeat dad and had not seen my son in 5 years I decided I had to try to make that right. Around a year sober I was reunited with him. He’s 27 now and I speak with him daily. I married another sober person and we have another son who is 15 years old now. I opened a sober living facility to give the same opportunity to homeless men trying to get sober and until the city shut me down was running a day shelter out of it for about two years. I’m amazed where I am today as a result of aiming towards a sober ideal in my life and encourage anyone who is struggling to stick it out. It’s worth it!

I am so happy that I made it 1 month sober. Four weeks ago, I was preparing for my 30th birthday party and had already purchased alcohol. I was prepared to drink. 

And drink I did. I drank during my party and during the first few days of my week-long vacation, but I knew that I was about to be done. Luckily, I didn't go overboard and I didn't have any bad withdraws (like I usually got). I didn't get sick, blackout, drive drunk, or any thing ""bad""; and I am happy for that. 

A few minutes before the clock struck midnight turning the current day into my 30th birthday, I sat outside with my last drink in my hand and my last smoke burning, and knew that I was pleased to be done. I finished both of these, went to bed with a clear mindset and a pledge, and I'm here 30 days sober. I haven't had a drop of alcohol or a puff of smoke since before I was 30. 

That sounds nice, but it'll sound even better when I'm 35. I pledge to stop drinking, and to become healthy once again.",64
2020-06-12 08:09:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/h7jj89/hes_dead_at_the_bottom_of_a_long_slippery_slope/,He's dead. At the bottom of a long slippery slope.,"""Jails, institutions, and death.""  That's where alcohol can take us.  It's a phrase from AA literature, and, say what you like about AA; there is no disputing the fact that some of us die - some of us are incarcerated in jails or the loony bin.  They do know what they are talking about in this instance at least.

He, I'll call him Dave, was a really nice guy - at least when he was sober.  On the surface he had all the advantages, white, very good looking with an amazing smile, athletic (football scholarship at division one college), personable, intelligent... except when he drank he did terrible things.  Things they locked him up for, to protect society, and even he would admit - for good reason.  We needed to be protected from drunk Dave.  He deserved to be punished for the things he did.

To whatever degree possible his victims were avenged.  And yes, they should not be forgotten - this story is tragic on all levels.

His privilege and position had gotten him many second chances including parole from prison for something quite bad.  **And then, as many of us have experienced, he went out and did it again.**  The IT was again terrible and this time they ""threw away the key"".

And Dave knew it.   He'd more or less resigned himself to staying in prison far beyond the  20 in 20-to-life but he had hope that some day, maybe when he had 30 years of sobriety...

But it was not to be, this big healthy strong guy got cancer, and over the course of a few years it ate him up.  The state did try to cure him, surgery, chemo, whatever... and it worked, for a while, but the cancer came back and he was eventually confined to the hospital wing of the prison.

It took him a couple of years to die, they continued to treat him, though at one point he refused a surgery that would probably not have helped.

Dying in prison sounds like a miserable way to go.  Probably marginally better than dying of active alcoholism, maybe.  Maybe not. 

So why am I telling this?  Quite frankly I'm trying to scare the bejesus out of one or more of you who are thinking ""maybe I can control it.""  ""Maybe I wasn't THAT bad""  

And it's true, you most likely were not nearly as bad as Dave, BUT **it's also true that there was a moment when Dave picked up a drink and blew his last chance.**  Committing a violent felony will use up last chances pretty quick. It wasn't something he set out to do, ""things just got out of control and then went bad"" he once said in a meeting I attended as a volunteer.

How many of us I wonder have been to the edge (or beyond) of things getting out of control?  I know I was, more times than I want to admit.  I somehow retained my footing on that slippery slope and am here to write about how lucky I am.  If you are reading this, you are lucky too.  

Again, to those who are thinking, ""yeah, but..."" is a drink worth rolling those dice again?",132

Not because of you all, of course, but because I was still drinking. 

I was in a vicious cycle, after being laid off (like many in today's world) I yo-yoed harshly between resolving to stop drinking, to get my shit together and take care of myself, be a better me. That would last 3 days, max, before I drank more heavily than I ever have. I would come here for day 1, day 2, day 3, the rare day 4 - before the loop reiterated. Deep in my drinking I felt unworthy to be here as more than a humble approver of posts I hoped to be making someday. 

Today marks one full week of not drinking. I can't remember the last time I went 7 whole days without getting embarrassingly drunk. Without a phone call, text, or facebook comment I don't remember making. 

Being laid off, though painful, may have been the best thing to happen, as cliche as it sounds. My past work environment, as a cook, was not exactly conducive to my sobriety. And being presented with nothing but time inside the house, I enrolled in a 9 month career change course that I'd always wanted to pursue, but said I ""didn't have the time for."" I'm so happy with what I'm doing there, it's challenging and fascinating. The time of my day it requires is a positive side-effect. 

Lately my biggest struggle has been the cravings I get when I've finished my classes for the day. The assignment is turned in, I worked through the concepts that were a climb for me, or I finished a project in just the knick of time - of course my brain tells me ""You deserve a drink."" 

But this whole week, I didn't let them win.

Some good news is that physically I feel quite good right now (apart from the sleepiness). Headaches have eased up and I had a bad knee that seems to be getting better. My appetite is also coming back and I feel stronger. 

I've been struggling a bit with getting enjoyment from my hobbies this past week. I downloaded a game I've been eager to try for ages yesterday and now I'm wondering if I can be bothered to play.

No one else was involved) and I was charged with my first DUI and court is set for tomorrow afternoon. Fortunately my state has a rule that will let me avoid the worst of the penalties, no jail or ""actual"" probation but something like it… idk, but it's not a guarantee. I got a lawyer I'm paying too much fucking money to - so that I feel like shit about that because I wasn't exactly doing awesome financially pre-wreck. I am extremely nervous. I just want to get tomorrow behind me so that I know what my penalty is going to be and I can start serving it. Really, really hoping that I get into the accelerated rehab program. Even then I think it might be awkward for me to get around for a little while but at least it wont be the worst outcome (which would frankly be a gigantic win for ya boy since my life has been in bit of a tailspin since 1/1/19 so I could use a win).

I don't know I just wanted to put this out there to you like-minded folk and ask you for your thoughts or whatever.

This dream involved kindling—where my withdrawal is only triggered by small amounts of alcohol. In the dream, I took a few shots at a family function. It was only maybe two or three shots.

Well, later in the dream, I began hallucinating and experiencing the same stuff I experienced when in detox back in March. I felt the “fear” I felt then, too. 

It seems that my brain was letting me know what could happen if I go back to the booze, and it was giving me a very real reminder. 

I woke up in a panic, thinking I actually drank, but I was so relieved when I realized I didn’t.

For most of my life, quite frankly I didn't understand what all the fuss was about. I never drank in high school. I have always been introverted and wasn't comfortable around large groups of people. When I was in college I began to drink socially at parties in order to feel more confident, relaxed, etc. I thought I was in control but I wasn't, because quickly it would go from dancing, to puking, to blacking out. But that was college, I'd grow out of it right?

Wrong. Now I'm in my late 20's and alcohol had become an ever-present part of my everyday life. After getting home from work, I'd ""unwind"" with a glass of wine, that would quickly turn into two glasses, and then the whole bottle. I loved the feeling of being relaxed and not caring about a thing in the world. But, all too often, the next morning I wouldn't remember going to bed the night before. I'd get myself ready for work the best I could, but I was always paranoid that my coworkers would just look at me and know. I think at this point I recognized that I was developing a problem but I just ignored it or tried to rationalize it.

Then COVID came along. Since I couldn't go back to work due to the shutdown (and still can't!), I lost all inhibitions. I downed multiple boxes of Franzia, numerous bottles of wine, and several expensive bottles of hard cider. But this was normal- right? Everyone else was posting on social media about how it was ""Wine O'Clock"" and how nobody knew what was in their cup on the zoom meeting. So if everybody else was doing it, it had to be normal. 

My breaking point was when I woke up a month ago and I knew I had an argument with one my friends the night before, but I couldn't remember what it was. I was too ashamed to ask them what had happened. I just knew that I couldn't live like this any longer. I was ruining my own life by continuing to drink. So I decided that enough was enough, I downloaded an app that tracks your sober hours, and I started doing research online. Then I happened upon this group. It was crazy for me to read the stories on here and to be able to relate to so many of them. I had no idea that so many people were going through similar issues.

Now I'm 31 Days sober! If you'd ask how I'm feeling, I'd say I'm alright. I guess I thought it would be an Earth-shattering difference, but I don't feel like a completely different human or anything. I was slightly overweight a month ago, and now I have lost 6 lbs, the first few pounds from stopping drinking, and the rest from a change in my diet. Now I am back to a normal BMI but I definitely still have a lot of work to do when it comes to feeling confident & comfortable in my own skin.

Because I primarily drank at night, the temptation is still there in the evenings. It feels almost like I'm breaking my routine? Instead of drinking wine or cider, I sip on a bubbly kombucha or seltzer & cranberry juice. I love the fizziness and I also love that I still get to enjoy a tasty drink, just without any intoxicating side effects. Now that restrictions are beginning to ease, navigating social situations has definitely been more difficult. First, I went to a family pool party where everyone was drinking. I drank water for a couple hours while laying out/swimming, ate dinner with everyone, and then politely excused myself to go home before things got too rowdy. Second, I went on a double date. I wished I could get a class of wine, but I got a soda instead. I realized that I was hypervigilant about it though- I noticed every glass of alcohol everyone else in the restaurant was drinking. 

Next month I am due to go on vacation and I am definitely starting to get nervous. There is so much I want to do and see that have nothing to do with drinking. Unfortunately though, many of the events/activities that are available are paired with wine-tastings or revolve around bar-hopping. I would \*love\* to go wine-tasting, but I am afraid if I put myself in that situation, things could easily go downhill. I know that I don't want to jeopardize all the progress I've made so I am going to try my best to have my first sober vacation since I was like... 19?

So that's my story. Newly sober, dealing with temptation one day at a time. It is difficult but I am encouraged this far.",12

Yet, I have to admit my spirit doesn't get lifted like it once did. Drinking me was always happy, ready for anything, and seemed to achieve great heights of joy.

I try to fill my hours with family, gardening, woodworking, guitar, and work, but I'm often bored. Weekends used to feel like a celebration, now I try to manufacture things to be excited about, but over time, I've realized its just not the same.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hi, SD Family!

Today I am going to keep it short and sweet. It's Friday, and for a lot of us that's a tricky night. For me, I like to look at my sober weekends as a blessing- I get so much more done now and I can also use them to get some healthy rest instead of nursing all those hangovers I used to get.

My plans for tonight are simple: make some seafood, bake some kind of dessert, and probably watch a scary movie since they are my favorite! I've learned that my plans don't have to be elaborate, but it *does* help for me to have one. It keeps me focused! I say we all get our plans around and meet back here tomorrow!

I have posted on this sub before a while back on a throwaway I unfortunately lost access to. So here I am again, on day #1. Quitting drinking has been very hard for me, in ways that I have tried to convince myself weren't problematic. Well, no more lying to myself. I have a problem. 

I was looking for advice for those who have stopped drinking with their partners or have had to leave/divorce partners because of drinking related issues. Both my husband (32yo) and myself (29F) started as social drinkers but over the last year our drinking has really brought out some ugliness in our relationship. For me, I have prioritized drinking over my family and got into a really destructive routine of going out drinking frequently. Thankfully with the current pandemic and not going out that behavior has stopped and now my goal is to not drink at all and strive for complete sobriety. For my husband, his drinking has led to black outs where he can be cruel and so unlike the person I met and fell in love with. A dear friend to us that has witnessed his black out drunk behavior described it as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. 

I guess what I am wondering, is for couples who have both been alcohol abusers (like in my situation) has going sober with your partner healed your marriage/relationship? Are the scars created by alcoholism able to heal properly? I don't want to give up on my marriage. I just feel like.... is this something I need to do on my own? I am just feeling a little lost and discouraged and sad that alcohol has ruined my marriage.

1. I binge to black out by excuse of seeing a drinking friend.  We have supposed fun.  Hopefully no terrible things happen.  I wake up at 3 am , try to calm myself down by saying
 oh dont freak out its not a crime to get drunk and try,try,try to sleep.
Wake up again feel awful, feel so muchh shame, my great friend that i got drunk with feels like someone to avoid now, a shame in our relationship  Feel over the top gratitude that i still have my family.  Struggle through my day, miserable, maybe dry heaves, definetely very upset stomach, not even pretend to be ok.  Read here all day
2. Drink only 3 glasses or a bottle of wine, most likely by topping off all night by myself,  wake up at 3, try to keep myself calm, count up the extra calories.  Wake up again feel terrible, pretend to be ok.  Read on here make myself promises while feeling so hopeless
3. Only drink 1 or 2, groggy though dinner, head back to the couch as soon as possible, feel vaguely resentful that i cant drink the way i want, that my husband is not fun.  Still feel badly in the morning at half mast.  Probably drink again that night, since im so in control until the night i go back to option 1

Instead i just didnt. I read here instead.  I ate with my family and went grocery shopping and ran into a friend and chatted.  Came back, played with dogs, laughed with my teens, and ni2w relaxing with Netflix.

I was also sad that I had not made any new friends since moving here at the beginning of 2019 to begin my PhD. I was crying while I was walking and doing a little prayer to God asking him for some support- not something I do that often.

I have a sober Instagram account, and later that day I started a conversation with a girl who has the same sober date as me and a lot in common. It was great!

Later in the day I commented on an event page (on Instagram again) that hosts events for girls to make friends in the area. Paddle boarding, hiking, that kind of stuff.. I commented saying I was a PhD student who had moved here recently and was interested in meeting people and doing these outdoor activities.

THEN!!!

A girl replied to my comment saying that she was a PhD student in my area too! I went onto her page and was looking through her photos and they looked oddly familiar... Turns out she lives IN MY APARTMENT BUILDING!! AND her PhD is at the same university as me AND the same BUILDING as me. How weird!?

I see you, God. Lately I’ve been feeling like getting sober helps open me up to other things I’ve been wanting for a long time (new friends, weight loss, passion projects). What a crazy day.

So glad I didn’t drink 😄",146

Back when I was active in this sub, I used to look back at old, old posts and then click the usernames and see who was still active. I always felt inspired when I could see the people who had been struggling years ago still on the subreddit with counters now in the thousands, going strong. And I always sent some well wishes into the void when I saw an account had been inactive for a long time. I don't want to be one of those /r/stopdrinking ghosts.

So, hi! I still don't drink. I want to share a little bit about my experiences since I've left this sub and where I am now, and how it's been staying sober in the years since I've been gone.

I really loved being a part of this sub. I think this is the most supportive community that I have ever seen in my life. I think the folks here are absolutely incredible. For a long time, I found that visiting this sub often kept me on track. Reading the experiences of folks who were in their early days especially. I loved offering support, and selfishly, reading stories of fresh, shameful experiences of drunken moments helped me keep my focus on my own painful memories, which was a good motivator for avoiding alcohol.

But eventually I realized that I had developed some negative patterns of thinking that were amplified by being active on this sub. It had been two years since I had stopped drinking, and I was spending too much time going over those painful alcohol-related memories, keeping shame close, encouraging the mistakes of my past to cause me emotional pain in my present even though I had done so much to work on myself since then. It's not the fault of this sub, but reading all of the stories was triggering this internal feedback loop that was harming me. So, I logged off.

Logging off helped. I am finally in a place where shame is not a part of my daily life. Shame was definitely a motivator for me, so I needed (yet again) to put more tools in my toolkit. I got pretty lucky with that. When I left this subreddit, my life was about to change into a life in which alcohol was just never really an option for a lot of reasons. First, my partner-at-the-time and I started trying to have a baby, which of course is a great motivator for not drinking. Then, we starting running into infertility issues, and he finally dropped the bomb on me that he had never really wanted a family, but he had pretended to for years because he was afraid I would leave him, and really he was happy that we weren't able to. He was right: it was a dealbreaker for me, and I left him. I started dating an amazing person, B, who I found out a few dates in has actually never had even a sip of alcohol in his whole life because he saw his dad struggle with alcoholism and die too young. The fact that I don't drink is as delightful to him as the fact that he doesn't drink is delightful to me.

Alcohol, and thoughts about alcohol, are just no longer a part of my life. I completely missed my four year sober-versary earlier this year. Me and B moved in together when quarantine started happening. A few weeks later we were talking with a friend of ours who was saying that he'd been drinking a ton of wine to cope with isolation. When he said that, I realized that since B and I had been cooped up together alone, I had basically forgotten that alcohol even exists, much less thought about how it must be really tough to avoid right now.

I got lucky. I think that isolating from the sober community was potentially a very dangerous choice. I am glad that my life is structured in a way right now that I can feel safe in relaxing my focus on sobriety. And I miss the positivity of this subreddit and have so much love for all of you.

Woot!,"June 11th 2019 I decided would be the first day I stopped drinking, permanently. Nothing is special about that day and no major events lead me to that decision. Simply, I was tired; tired of being tired, feeling sad and allowing myself to be weighed down from achieving the lofty goals I strive for. 


While the decision was swift and backed by the strong resolve to never repeat this past mistake, the road has been far longer, more complicated and fraught with landmines I never knew existed. Hindsight has highlighted that quitting was and is the best decision I could have made for my family, health and career. 


Life isn’t suddenly and magically perfect and nothing is solved. However, I have unlocked clarity and strength (physically and mentally). Additionally, the introspection to lean into my feelings as opposed to avoiding them, something I am humbled by on an ongoing basis. Despite the incredibly challenging few months that have brought many of us to our knees, my resilience and full on stubbornness to persevere is stronger than ever. 

I spent the last year moving through much of this with the help of a small support group and resisted talking about it to many people at all. I had concerns that I would be judged and be seen as weak. The more I opened up about it, the more I felt support. If someone wants to judge me, that doesn’t matter. I am not defined by the mistakes I have made in my life. Like many people, I have many examples, and drinking is one of them. Thank you for listening and IWNDWYT",94

I had gone 33 days without a drink, and loved it. So much more energy, so much more productivity. I woke up refreshed; my body felt healthy and alive. My head was clear and I was killing it at work. 

Most of all what I was loving, though, was what I was learning about myself: turns out I have a lot of feelings I'd been drowning in booze. Sometimes they weren't great feelings—a lot of frustration, boredom, grumpiness. But I'd spent the last decade low-key worried that something was wrong with me because I used to be a very emotional person in my youth, but in my twenties I felt like I didn't ""have any feelings any more."" Turns out that probably was the booze. 

So that's where I was: newly sober and loving it. But it's been an exhausting week, and I really just wanted to relax and zone out the way I used to do when I was drinking. I'd been doing all the things I'd been learning: going for a walk, spending time outside, reading and watching TV instead of drinking… and I was curious to see how I'd feel if I had a drink. I kind of wanted to test it. Would it be as relaxing as I remembered? Would it feel good to have a drink?

Spoiler alert—and y'all probably know this already—but it did not feel good. I did not like it. I did not like the taste. I did not like how dozy and out of it I started feeling. I did not like how little I was able to do—sitting there drinking, I was trying to do some writing, and could barely manage. I did not like how forgetful I felt. I did not like how poorly I slept. Did not like waking up headachy and tired. 

So: note to self. You do like being sober. You do not like drinking. That little voice in your brain that says, ""hey, have a drink, you like drinking!"" or ""why are you giving up something you like so much?"" That voice is LYING.",10
2020-06-11 13:31:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/h13tj2/three_years_without_alcohol/,Three years without alcohol,"Last week I celebrated three years sober. I struggle with celebrating this accomplishment because it still feels so fragile, but I know that it deserves to be recognized.

What I have learned over the past three years is that nothing is certain, nothing is easy, and nothing is forever. My daily mantra has become ""I can do hard things,"" because that's the truth. I can and I do - every single day. Some days the hard thing is getting out of bed. Other days it's an assignment for school. Still other days it's talking myself through the still present impulse to reach for a coping mechanism that is unhealthy. But each and every time I do something difficult, it adds to my ""bank"" of accomplishments. Each and every time I do something difficult, I prove to myself that I CAN DO HARD THINGS. And that is something to celebrate.

As part of my third year of sobriety, I have made promises to myself regarding my continued recovery. For me, sobriety is not recovery. Recovery is a whole other beast of which sobriety is a small but important aspect. 

Three years ago my life fell apart. I left an emotionally abusive spouse, found myself at the rock bottom of my drinking habit, had no career or prospects to speak of, and was contemplating suicide daily. Putting down booze didn't magically solve all these problems. But three years later, as I celebrate another anniversary sober, I remind myself that *I can do hard things*. And you can, too. And I remind myself that maybe my life fell apart so that I could rebuild it in a way that is more meaningful, rich, and positive. So if you're sitting at rock bottom wondering where do I go from here... reach out. Those of us with some time under our belt might not have it all figured out, but we can help lower down a ladder.

We would drive around in my friends blue Dodge Dakota and drink a fifth of Jim Beam and smoke a bunch of black and milds.  Whilst through my 20s drinking was mostly fun on the weekends but as you get older and life gets tougher, well, that's when the drinking really starts. 
      I got married had a little girl not even 4 months old when I woke up to my wife kicking me awake on the kitchen floor.  The cops were at the door.  They had been called cause I almost ran a father and his child over driving through my neighborhood.  I was devastated and promised my wife I was never gonna drink again.  Ya right.  
     I was managing a 3.8 million dollar job and it was my favorite thing to come home and do something I wasn't supposed to.  Drink.  I hid most of it from my wife but she knew.  I would black out every night and not remember going to bed.  Finally I had a day off of work because I had hurt my knee on the job.  I went to the liquor store and bought a pint of vodka.  Then I drove around, helped a friend mount a speaker at his house, and drove back to that store two more times for more booze.  Apparently I went to a local big boy, stole a bottle of seasoning salt and then drove to a bar across the street.  I woke up in Jail.  
     I was scared out of my mind. I didn't know if I killed someone or what condition my car was in or if my wife was gonna leave me.  The story goes, I bumped a car in a parking lot and then fell asleep in the diner attached to said parking lot.  Cops dragged me out and gave me a DWI.  I don't remember a stitch.  That was rock bottom for me.  I spent $12k and a year on probation.  Hardest year of my life.  I'm almost 3 years sober now and I couldn't be happier.
     The thing I'm happiest about is no more shame.  I would wake up every morning with a headache and a guilty conscience.  It's been a tough road and I've wanted to drink on many occasions but it's NOT worth it.  Thanks for listening to me.

I never thought I would experience the **Delerium Tremens** (DT's)... But I did.

Yesterday **(day 4)** I was feeling great for once in my life, mental clarity, creativity exploded, etc. I thought I had beat the worst part of **Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome** (AWS) but I was wrong. An interesting thing about when you quit drinking is it's the evenings when bad symptoms manifest. (My guess it's due to your **GABA** system as in theory your brain either uses up all it's **GABA** during the daytime, or it doesn't have enough stored for night time (to cause you to fall asleep and not wake up). So basically our ""**Braking system**"" is damaged and dysfunctional (but the brain DOES heal given time).

Anyhow, here's what happened and btw,  I have a blood pressure machine handy and a thermometer ready to go in case I get DT's. If you are doing cold turkey at home please make sure you check your blood pressure and temperature avidly! (**It may save your life!**). I went to sleep around 9:45 pm due to extreme fatigue and my only symptom was hot flashes. I actually managed to sleep until I had a extremely terrible **nightmare** which awoke me at 1:50 AM. The nightmare included old room mates basically assaulting me and when I woke up I instantly had hallucinations, I could see two black figures staring into my gaming computer (which emits some light from the RGB LED's on the motherboard). I felt a chill down my spine as all I could see was **darkness** that wanted to devour the only light in my room. My body felt awful, muscle spasms, nerve pain, aches, you name it. (It really does feel like being **trampled by pink elephants** as they say) 

So, I checked my blood pressure and temperature and both came back good surprisingly (HR elevated). I proceeded to turn the light on and drink water with added calcium, potassium, magnesium and sodium chloride (salt) to help my symptoms. After 30 minutes of hell and thinking I was gonna die my body finally felt better (ish). I had to leave the light on for the remainder of the night because my vision was playing tricks on me. This was Delerium Tremens, and I don't want to imagine what severe DT's is like. 

My thoughts and prayers go out to anyone else quitting alcohol and enduring the withdrawal syndrome. We are all fucking warriors and stronger than the delusion itself. I want you all to know that it WILL get better and **WE WILL BEAT THE DELUSION!**

I’m worried for tonight, I have a social engagement which I’ll be attending for my sons friends birthday.. just about every one there will be people I have had drinks/drunks with before, this will be the first time I’ll be around alcohol and drinkers since quitting.

And what may not simply just ""go away"". So I hope this post helps you stay on track, especially when you're in the beginning of the journey.

I want to end on a positive note, so I'll start with what did not, most definitely, ""fix itself"" as a result of not drinking:

* dealing with loneliness and depression which came from
* **my past.**

It's ridiculous when I think about it, but most of my attempts to feel better with ""self-medicating"" boiled down to me trying to either convince myself my past wasn't that bad (and therefore I'm not that royally f-ed up), or to forget about it/neglect it. In a way I was trying to remove a big part of myself. In my case it was my first 20 years of life, so effectively 2/3 part of me so far.

There's no other answer to it than the fact that whatever happened in the past, it's irrelevant. What is relevant is what will you do with what happened (to you). What will you do from now on?

It's a decision that needs to be made. 

This is what happened to me:

1. People noticed - I had people comment on my appearance telling me I look different, better. They couldn't exactly pinpoint the difference, but it's there and it's visible.
2. My skin has improved - I wanted to emphasize on it, because my face really looks nicer. It's less red all over, less ""patchy"" with discoloration, occasional breakouts heal much faster etc. 
3. I almost don't have nightmares anymore and get really great dreams instead - I always had a very vivid imagination (I have a job that's creative as well) and I truly missed my dreams. They're my supply of ideas, some even inspired me to write short stories, create comics or write visual novels. But while drinking, I'd have a really hard time with constant nightmares that would focus mainly on my past. I was afraid to go to bed, I couldn't sleep well anyhow, and I'd be extra depressed with the images I was being bombarded with at night. Right now I'm saving the world and having interesting story lines with layered meanings.
4. I became better at my job - mind you, I was never bad at it. I was pretty high functioning, doing what I was supposed to do and being damn good at that. But being sober let me realize how stale I was at my job, so I could take some more proactive actions to actually improve my own (and others) work. I started taking risks and those are starting to pay off.
5. I have a clearer vision of who people around me really are - and I even came so tome surprising conclusions. Like my bff is not really my bff, not at this time anyway, more like my past drinking buddy, entangled in his own issues. And my ex is actually a very good friend of mine at the moment, he's very supportive of me going sober (he veeery rarely drinks himself). And the person I fell for and let my heart get broken over is actually a very good person too; we're maintaining a friendly relationship. I couldn't ever hate him, I wish him all the best. 
6. I learned a thing or two about myself - like the fact that I get obsessed over insignificant things and there are areas of my character I really need to work on. That I'm actually more introverted that I thought and the loud, extroverted me is mostly a product of me being drunk. That I enjoy peace and quiet, but I also enjoy being among people and not be in the center of attention (I used to feel very insecure and fear being ""ignored"").
7. My cat likes me better - I heard that alcohol is extremely poisonous to cats, so it would make sense for my dear feline to prefer me when I don't reek of something that's deadly to him. He's even curled up right next to me as I'm typing it down. He enjoys cuddling with me and sleeping next to me now. Feeling him close really helps calm me down when I get extra anxious over stuff. He even senses it himself and comes over to me to sit on my lap and purr. I really earned a new friend.
8. This point might be controversial to some, but I really feel it was necessary for me - I quit the unproductive therapy I was going to for years now. I often found myself very triggered to drink after the session. I felt it became unproductive, circling around the same things over and over again, things that didn't even matter to me, no matter drunk or sober. I felt I never focused on what I wanted to focus on, and despite my therapist's need to ""challenge why I don't want to talk about certain things"", she never referred me to a addiction therapy, which in my opinion, she should have done a long time ago. I may have been a good liar and hid my addiction well from her, but it's only the more reasons for me to change the therapist. For now I'm using the money I saved from not going to therapy (and it's a lot of money mind you) to buy books and educate myself, do some workbooks I purchased that focus solely on the issues I want to focus on and do anything I can in terms of self-help to get myself back on track with the tools I can find. I think I may try again with other therapist when the time is right, for now I need to let my head deal with itself without the unwanted external interference.
9. I regained the feeling of control over my life. Even if not everything is good right now, I know I can at least be hopeful. I can trust myself to create a plan and follow through with it.

So this is how it's going for me so far.

I hope you have a great day today and that you find it in your heart to stay close to yourself and away from the booze.

2020-06-11 10:07:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/h0zypc/thoughts_on_200_days/,Thoughts on 200 days," 

It seems like my day 1 was ages ago. I honestly don’t think about drinking anymore. I’ve told people in my immediate circle- dear friends, my husband and kids, a coworker who probably still thinks it was just a ‘dry January’ experiment long abandoned, but otherwise, I have kept it to myself. Most of my siblings don’t know. The pandemic certainly has cut down on social events so it’s not been a focal point, even on family “happy hour” zoom calls. Either they don’t notice or don’t care. 

On the other hand, on a recent “mommy happy hour” zoom call I re-connected with a casual acquaintance who was drinking during the call. When I lifted my glass of sparkling water with lemon, she said “I hope there’s something strong is in that glass.” as if drinking is all we need to survive motherhood, the economic crisis, the pandemic, you name it. When I told her I was off the sauce the immediate question was “WHY??”. If I told her I quit smoking I’d get a “Good for you!” but with this, I get a “WHY?”- Hmm. I know its more about her than me, but I can still hear the inflection of her voice in my head. The “WHY” has so much wrapped into it. As someone who hit the high rocks, I think often that other people think that my stopping must have resulted from something breaking bad. My high function is both a blessing and a curse. 

I basically said I feel so much better not drinking, and considering all I’m doing to fortify ourselves against the virus, that drinking is counter to all of it. Sanitizing everything, taking daily does of vitamin D, washing hands constantly, wearing masks for protection- why in the world would I do all of that and then weaken my body and mind with alcohol? I think that resonated. It helps me anyway. 

I’m down 20 pounds. For most of the earlier part of my 200 days, I didn’t focus on my diet at all, as the goal was to just get to the end of each day without drinking. I let myself indulge in whatever I was craving. These days though I feel like I finally have the wine witch in a box in the corner and I can focus on getting my good greens in each day and can meet calorie and step goals. The warmer weather seems to help too. It’s odd to think back at how feeling miserable every day was normalized to me. Horrible bowel pain and unpredictability, intense food cravings, guzzling gallons of water- it was all so extreme compared to how balanced I’m feeling of late. 

So if you are looking for inspiration- I don’t have any miracle words to share with you. I can only say that I owe much of my solace to being able to share my thoughts and feelings with a whole bunch of internet strangers. I’ve learned so much from each of you. For anyone just getting started, look for the audiobooks and podcasts that are mentioned here. Having those outside resources and an inside community of like-minded people is a real game-changer. Be open to suggestions and know that you have the strength to change. I didn’t think I’d like who I was without alcohol but each day it seems things keep getting better. Thank you all for your encouragement.

It all started on my birthday of 2019, my mother tried to take her life, then later that same year my grandfather had a stroke,my father had a heart attack and my uncle (who was like another grandfather to me) passed away. It's crazy enough to think that this could all happen in such a short period of time, but to cope with it I drank to get myself to sleep and away from my own thoughts. I'm pushing myself everyday to steer clear of the booze because I now know that is is only making things worse not better. I could feel my body just giving up and my mental state getting far worse. I had a dream last night that really gave me some motivation, it was of my Uncle. He told me that he was at peace and that he loved me, it gave me some sort of weird closure.

I immediately regretted my decision and started pleading to the staff to let me go home. It was probably the best the thing I've ever done for myself. It might have even saved my life.

The out-patient program I've been in since my hospital stay asked me to pledge sobriety for the duration of the program. At first, I thought I could just lie when they ask me about drinking or using. Of course, it's not a good step to start lying when you're getting mental health treatment or self-medicate when you're getting daily wellness checks. I also realized meeting the co-occurring patients that I'm not too different from them and if I waited a couple of months more to get the help I might be just like them. I also took an inventory of my family. I realized that some of my family members who have been written off as drunks are really just depressed and never got the help they really need.

In the last three months, I've had some really dark times. Not every day has been great but not all have been bad. I'm actually starting to enjoy life more. I do let the negative self-talk overwhelm me still. When I'm in that rut I start to list to myself the things I've accomplished that I'm proud of. Sobriety is useless the first thing.

I didn't intend to become sober on March 13th but I also didn't intend to work through all these demons during a once-in-a-century pandemic but that's a different story.

I woke up at 8am this morning  after a long but unhelpful night of sleep, and my last drink was at 9pm last night. I am fighting the craving to pick up again so hard right now (it’s 2pm where I live). 

It’s like my brain is split between knowing that picking up one drink is going to eventually lead me back to sleeping in gutters and receiving furious messages about things I don’t remember, and the idea that I could just quit tomorrow if I can quit today.

When I was in the deep darks of drinking a shower beer seemed normal. very normal.

Sure, I'm brining a glass bottle into the shower, sure I'm drinking in the shower, but it was a guilty pleasure.... I guess I drank everywhere else so why not in the shower?

In hindsight what is even more shocking to me is that I couldn't imagine changing. I couldn't imagine what my life would be without drinking.  I couldn't imagine even taking that first step of saying, just for today I won't drink.

For me taking that first step was a blind leap, believing that somehow life would be better without a shower beer, or a morning whiskey, or bottle or two of wine.

And I’ve had a series of minor dramas with my teen daughters (including today daughter 1 scraped the side of her truck at a drive thru - called panicking) - each of these dramas happened at times I normally would have had at least two in my system, if not totally useless. Tonight, I had time to talk my husband down as we drove to help daughter 1 dislodge her truck (for the record, I was never a fan of her driving something so huge) - I got him laughing about how we BOTH had trashed our cars as teenagers (hence why we bought SAFE, used cars - not new), and immediately pointed out that the scrape could be buffed out - and hey, at least she hit something that had clearly been hit by hundreds of others vs involving another car - all upside. Had I been drinking, I would not have been able to be the partner or mother that was needed in these situations. And I know for a fact the genuine time I had with friends would have been shallow and forgotten.

I’ve been approaching the past nine days by working like a beast - I’ve not sweating at night - probably because I’ve been sweating sun up to sun down. The headache is really backing off - but I still have little appetite- which is fine. My goal was to loose some weight to get off blood pressure meds by the end of summer anyway. But I warned my husband tonight that I think I might be hitting a wall - and may need a day to just rest. I’m also probably staying so busy to avoid mental crap right now - but it’s working and cravings are pretty easily swept aside right now - I’ve got a future to seek guidance on why I felt the need to escape each night - for now, it’s enough that it’s day 9, and I’m still AF.

These are pretty bad.  So order pizza.  This is pretty good.  

OH.  AND.  Run into a guy at the bar who is already deep into a few, talking loud, inviting me to party with him and his friends. Later.  Reflect.  I do not want to be That Guy anymore. 

Normally, I would be 7 or 8 drinks in by now.  And in the morning I would be struggling to make my flight.  

Not tonight, thanks to all the encouragement from you all.  The comments especially are motivating me to keep going.  I won't be able to thank all of you individually while I'm enjoying this time with my kids, but be assured every comment has been so helpful.

My life is an unmanageable mess. I’m starting fires and then stoking them with booze. My mental health is at a low, not altime because I’m not suicidal, but pretty fucking low. My health is definitely deteriorating. I’m lying, so much lying, to family and employers and now my therapist. Jesus. Truthfulness was always an important moral for me, and then booze came along and the hiding and subterfuge began. In fact, many of my morals have been compromised. Sad to say. And this has been going on for years. And it’s just getting worse. 

It used to be fun and breezy, now it’s hellish and terrifying. Yet, despite all that, I don’t know if I want to quit drinking. 

I know this is stop drinking but hear me out, I’ve relied on alcohol for so long to cope and “function” that I have NO idea how I could live without it. It’s my social. It’s my solace. It’s my only friend right now. It’s fostered so many friendships. It’s the calm at the end of the day. It’s the way to go to sleep at night. Just to name a few. 

How the hell do I do any of that without booze? Especially the coping part. I know I know, just sit with it. But god damnit, I don’t want to!

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hi, SD Family! Guess what? It's my birthday today and it is my second sober birthday in a row!

Getting older has some advantages I suppose, and one of them is learning to understand yourself and be okay with who you are. Being sober has helped me in that goal tremendously. So today for your consideration, maybe you can think of what you've learned about yourself since you've been sober. Or, perhaps it's a goal of what you *want* to learn. Either way, I think it's a good mental exercise to focus energy on!

Also, I think I FINALLY learned how to put up photos. So, due to popular demand, here is a picture of [The Pirate](https://i.imgur.com/YWCRgjT.jpg) and of [Matty.](https://i.imgur.com/T3b0Bk8.jpg) IWNDWYT!",91

At the time I was just over 2 years sober and am now approaching 3 years. 

Plus: quarantine/WFH has happened. 

Without discounting the very real suffering of others, quarantine has been a major, major improvement in almost every area of my life and has allowed me to make HUGE strides in my health and wellness. 

I WFH full time, and that alone allows me to get more sleep and avoid a long, stressful, public-transpo commute. 

I am no longer getting Starbucks breakfast every morning, a fast food/gas station lunch and a thrown together dinner. 

I am doing Pilates every morning and taking an hour+ walk every night. 

I'm also watching my calories. 

I'm no longer negatively comparing myself to others, or obsessing over looking perfect for my coworkers or others who might see me. 

I'm no longer stress eating or over-eating because I'm not sure when I'll get another chance to eat. 

I have seen BIG changes in my body shape in the last 60 days---toned legs, more slender waist, more sharply defined face, dropped a dress size, and this is on top of all the benefits of being sober. My skin is the best it's ever been, and my mood is stable and healthy. I'm over the moon, and want to keep this going. 

I think part of this journey was seeing a picture of myself when I was still drinking and comparing it to a picture of myself at about 18 months sober (after I made the post I reference here) and realizing WOW---I look so much better. This inspired me 
to make the most of my sober gainz and really go for it. [you can see those comparison pics here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fn4jad/going_through_old_pictures_and_clearing_things/)

And now...new comparison pics! 

[Me the other day](https://imgur.com/HalOT7Q)

vs. [about 9 months ago](https://imgur.com/0F63Eji) tried to find a roughly comparable pose and an outfit that shows my body somewhat and where I'm wearing heels, which always helps! 

Now these aren't jaw-dropping changes but I feel I can see the difference especially just in the definition on my waistline. 

I just wanted to write this because another member of r/stopdrinking contacted me privately some time ago and asked about body image and quitting and I felt bad that I was so negative. I wanted to add the next chapter to the story and I hope to share some rays of positivism to all you stoppers out there.

And those horrible nights only come around a few times a year, but we're all here because once is too much, right?

Reached out to a friend that's 500+ days and she gave me that quote, which she saw 500+ days ago. ""There was never a rock bottom for me, but I was headed in the wrong direction and the bottom is just where you stop digging.""

I don't know if abstinence or controlled moderation is where I'll end up, if anyone even can do the moderation thing. But I know the cravings, and the urge to walk the tightrope of ""just drunk enough to feel good, but not enough that anyone realizes I'm having more than they see,"" have got to stop. I'm on this train with no identified stop, and excited to see the good it leads to.

The money I spent on booze was like a thief in the night for our savings to buy a home next year.

I'm kind of pissed off that he knows I identify as having a problem with alcohol but will still suggest it to me.

After more than 10 years of varying degrees of drinking, the last year of which was the worst, I've finally been able to hang on and get away from it long enough to think clearly again. Pandemic has helped, no bars or clubs for people to invite me to, no liquor stores open to tempt me into getting a bottle. I'm healthier than I've ever been and in the best shape of my life. Shit, I even got hired to a new job during this pandemic which is nuts. I'm still struggling though, I feel like a completely different person now but not always in a good way. My emotions are all over the place, I'm generally depressed but I at least have meds for that and this depression almost certainly existed before my drinking got out of control, if not contributed to its escalation. I knew my emotions would be fucked up for a while and I had an idea that I would have to deal with the depression I had been drinking away for a decade. What I wasn't prepared for was my personality change. A huge issue right now for me is confidence. I was confident when I was still drinking, I was assertive and unflinching. I don't think I am meek or a pushover now but I do not have that same confident personality. It doesn't help that the event that got me to quit drinking was probably the lowest point in my life, I hated myself at that time and still resent the person I was before. I was so embarrassed, sad and desperate for relief at that point and I think it's just crushed my self-esteem and sense of self.

I just wanted to share an epiphany I had last week when I was all consumed by my post-binge self-loathing. 

It was a Wednesday morning and I was so terribly hungover but had to go to work. Due to the pandemic, working from home makes hangovers much, much easier to hide. I thought this was a good thing until I came across my epiphany... which was this. 

**Alcohol makes me set such a low standard for myself.** 

When I'm not drinking, I start the day wondering what I can accomplish. 

If I'm hungover, my only goal is to get through the day. 

It seems so simple, but it really hit me. If my hungover days are a bleary-eyed slog where all I want to do is get to the end of it so I can stop physically and emotionally hurting, then WHY would I do that to myself? Why would I want to set such a low, low standard for myself. 

I don't have any answers or any solves, I just wanted to share this with you all because you deserve to wake up in the morning with hope. With an ability to handle whatever the day throws at you. And to open your eyes with more than just the desire to simply get through the day. 

**You deserve that.** 

We all deserve that.

Now that I’m into my late twenties I have stopped drinking cold turkey for the last 5 months and I have absolutely zero urge to start again. 

I had tried to stop or cut back dozens of times (usually after a shameful binge) and always felt myself crawling back to the fifteen pack Friday’s or blackout Saturday’s. 

Until I went on a booze fuelled fishing trip with a dozen of my friends. I brought with me a large bag of mushrooms to share with the guys. I had dabbled with psilocybin in the past but nothing more than a few giggles while intoxicated. 

After that fun weekend of debauchery, I started microdosing here and there.  My gf and I would stay in and eat a bit of mushrooms while watching a movie or going for a walk etc. Nothing crazy. In the matter of a couple weeks I became more in tune with my life and future and realized the harm alcohol was causing me. The unproductive weekends, the terrible hangovers, the SHAME. I told my self I was gonna quit drinking for awhile. No set date or anything formal. Just decided to stop and let my body and mind heal. 

I still indulge in small doses of mushrooms occasionally and I absolutely love them. They’ve opened my eyes and let me become a better person that I had locked away for over a decade. 

I don’t feel weird going out with the boys and staying sober, sometime I take half gram and just enjoy myself. I love the taste of carbonated water now (bubly) as a substitute for beer and I feel like a million bucks. 

The best part- I don’t have an urge to ever start drinking again. This isn’t like all the times I tried to quit before. This time I know I’m sober for good and it feels like I’ve started my life over. 

If you have any questions please comment, I’m forgetting lotsa details but I just decided to write this post spur of the moment while on my lunch break.

I MADE myself drink to get there. The process getting there was terrible. The trauma of antagonizing my disease must have made some kind of imprint or impression on my brain because now in almost a “Pavlovian” way, my body contorts in a moment of passing nausea when I think about that feeling I got last time around after even considering a sip.

""In the same way that it's not shameful to talk about my mistakes and where I'm struggling, it's not bragging to talk about what I'm doing that's positive and to acknowledge that I feel good about my personal growth.""

As someone who has always been excessively hard on myself and painfully aware of all my mistakes, I never realized I was severely unbalanced in my self awareness, never liking to acknowledge when I do good things and frequently downplaying my own growth and value because I felt like I didn't deserve praise. It's like ""What's the big deal, right? Get off your high horse, you didn't cure cancer or end world hunger??""

If this sounds familiar, try to recognize and acknowledge what you do right just as much as you admit to yourself when you fuck up. I hope this helps you all as much as it did me.",31

You may think AA members are “irrational lunatics.”

I agree with you to an extent (I am working on tolerance and respect for the religious beliefs of others) and I still benefit tremendously from many if not all of the principles of AA.

Here’s what I do: replace the word “god” with “nature,” and recognize that nature is a part of my own self. My ‘highest’ nature is the one that wants me to be sober. It’s the part of me that drives me to take action and seek help.

So why do AA at all, why not just find a solution that resonates with you if you have to change the language around so much?

Because there is a ton of good shit to be learned from the twelve steps. In particular what has benefitted me is the part about learning how to generate loving kindness toward the people that I hate. The language they use in AA is you need to “pray for that son of a bitch.” But do it genuinely. I have hated my dad’s fucking guts for so long I didn’t think it would be possible to forgive him, I thought it would violate my sense of morality to condone his behaviour, and it does, but that doesn’t mean I can’t hope that he gets better. 

Over time, I feel confident that by intentionally taking a moment to hope he gets better, and by remaining open to the possibility of feeling forgiveness to him without trying to force myself to forgive him, I will be able to get past my feelings of resentment and anger toward him. 

This is just one of several examples of ways that AA advice can help me. There have been some studies about forgiveness that back this advice on forgiveness.

My point in saying all this is that any help we can get is great. If you can manage to benefit from reading about AA or participating in it, why not go for it? You might be surprised how much truly beneficial wisdom there is in AA- I am actually shocked and chagrined at how much it is helping me as I consider myself “anti-religion” for the most part.

* Healthy relationship with alcohol
* On a bad path (e.g. drinking too often)
* Struggling/moderating (e.g. thinking about next drink)
* Full-on (e.g. drinking when I should not be)
* Abstaining

I did this mostly by looking at photos and I can remember where I was emotionally at that time.  A couple things are apparent.  

1. It was clearly progressive issue, getting worse over time
2. My issues correlate to some important events in my life
3. After over a year of sobriety and then trying to moderate, it didn't take long to slide back into very unhealthy behavior

None of this is surprising, but it's interesting (and difficult) to see my whole adult life laid out like that.

for several years now. It hasn't affected my professional life, yet, but it's
beginning to affect my health.

I don't seem to get strong withdrawal symptoms, probably because I drink lots of
water alongside alcohol, tend to eat lots of food when I'm drunk, and only drink
at night. However, I recently begun getting ""heart / diaphragm fluttering"" each day after drinking. This fluttering can get intense, especially when lying down. During
these episodes I have an intense feeling like I'm on the verge of falling
asleep, and if I indulge this then the fluttering gets much worse and scarier. I
get this paranoid feeling like I'm on the verge of having a seizure, so I need
to stay awake at all costs. I haven't been able to find any documentation on
these kinds of symptoms online, so I have no idea what's really going on or what I've damaged. I'm guessing it's nervous system damage of some kind.

It was terrible last Monday, so I stopped drinking all week. I felt fantastic the
rest of the week and got a ton of sleep. But I picked the bottle back up on the
weekend, thinking I had just needed a ""break.""

Nope. I need to quit, now. The symptoms just come back again very quickly, and I
spend hours a day suffering with the fluttering. Today it's bad again; currently
experiencing it. Alcohol is not worth what's happening to my brain and my body.

I live in rented accommodation with random people. The house isn’t the best quality, neither are the appliances.

Loads throughout my room, on my clothes, hiding in the damn floorboard gaps, but thankfully no nest.

I’ve spent the past six hours cleaning, hoovering (I bought a new hoover lmao), mopping, scrubbing, squishing, pulling out all my furniture, washing all my clothes on high, lavender and cedar wood all over the place.

2020-06-10 11:07:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/h0cu8s/my_experiences_with_smart_recovery/,My experiences with SMART recovery,"I've been in recovery since 2017. As we all know, 12 step programs tend to dominate the recovery landscape, and they've certainly helped millions of people. However, if you're not the religious or theistic type, you may find some aspects of 12 step meetings to be uncomfortable or inauthentic.

It was this discomfort that lead me to try SMART, a program with no religious or theistic trappings. SMART basically centers around addicts helping addicts in a roundtable way, with a volunteer facilitator that moves things along and provides input. Most of the techniques seem to be derived from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. 

The SMART meeting I attended was at the local hospital, one Saturday a week. I attended for eight weeks.

I will start with the positives. Everyone there, from the addicts to the facilitator, was very nice and polite. The meeting was pretty laid back. I learned a couple of new things. And... Well, that's actually about it.

I must say, unfortunately, that I could not help but become aware of several things that I regard as negatives. In the interest of frankness, I feel it is necessary to share them here.

A big issue I noticed immediately is that the facilitator was not an addict herself. Now, *this is not necessarily a bad thing,* in and of itself. My favorite addiction counselor of all time was not an addict. But she had a big heart, and a gift for connecting with addicts. When I shared my struggles with her, I could feel that she knew my pain, and the pain of addiction.

But this SMART facilitator... did not have that gift. She was very polite. But she clearly could not connect with us. Sharing my story and my struggles with her felt like show-and-tell with a polite but disinterested schoolteacher.

At one point, she attempted to share her own struggles with ""cravings"" by relating her ""Reeses Cup addiction"" and the mental techniques she used to ""overcome"" it. I could not help but feel insulted.

I think it may be relevant to note here that the founder of SMART, Joe Gerstein, was also not an addict.

As for the actual content of the meetings-- it was basically a roundtable discussion of people sharing their stories and struggles. The atmosphere was very quiet and subdued. Even when I shared a particularly painful part of my story, where I attempted to hang myself after tucking my kids into bed, everyone just kind of nodded along.  

Maybe I'm just too used to the Bible pounding passion of AA speakers, but the SMART meetings were just so sterile, so light-hearted. I felt like I was in an Adult Ed class learning about pottery, rather than coping with an intense, life-or-death, family destroying addiction. 

I also sorely missed the sponsor system so prevalent in AA/NA. SMART does not have its own warm line; I was given a list of phone numbers, plus the national suicide line. I was also advised that I could call any one of my group mates, or my Reeses loving facilitator, but those were not appealing options for various reasons. Long story short: I felt I did not have much support once I walked out of a meeting.

Beyond any internal issues with SMART itself, there was also the issue of availability. I can whip out my phone and find an AA meeting in any city in the country, almost at any time. It is much harder to find a SMART meeting. They seem restricted to Saturdays, once a week. The ""30 meetings in 30 days"" approach simply does not work with SMART.

Before I stopped attending, the facilitator, somewhat presciently, lamented that SMART was much smaller than AA or NA. That 12 step meetings continued to dominate the recovery landscape and that SMART doesn't seem to be growing all that much. Looking back on my experience, I think there are good reasons that AA continues to reign supreme.

Yes, the theistic stuff can be weird, though I've never had trouble finding atheist or agnostic AA chapters. Yes, some of the sayings and dogma can seem ""cult like."" But AA has something that SMART, in my opinion, simply doesn't: soul. These people are passionate about recovery, passionate about the program, and passionate about YOU getting better. SMART, on the other hand, felt like a pottery class with addiction instead of pottery.

I will end this by saying that I deeply respect anyone who goes out of their way to help addicts, and I appreciate Mr. Gerstein founding a recovery program that is distinct from Abrahamic symbolism and the 12 steps. That said, SMART just wasn't for me.

I'm curious to hear from others that have tried the SMART program, though. I wonder if my underwhelming experience was due to an underwhelming facilitator, though naturally my AA peeps insist that it's because SMART doesn't have God. Or ""Good Orderly Direction"" as I call him. ;) I look forward to hearing from you guys.",6

I think I'm having a mental breakdown. Three weeks ago I overdosed and woke up in a puddle of my own sick. I used alcohol to exacerbate the effects of the overdose.

I'm 26F and have a long history of blackouts. I have said and done insane things, including but not limited to sex with strangers, accepting drugs from strangers and sharing awful secrets with anyone who would listen. I've said things I can never repeat. I am riddled with shame. My mental health has always been fragile, but I'm not sure anything has ever caused me as much anguish as post-blackout anxiety. 

I started thinking I had a problem at about 23. I wish I had stopped then. I am worried about how my social life and relationship will be affected. The difference is, I think I have the strength now to let go of things which don't serve me.

Wednesdays weren't a normal drinking day for me, unless there was a Liverpool match being played or if it was in the middle of the festive season. They were usually in between the weekends of drinking I would put myself through and by this point I was still feeling some of the effects of the previous weekend. Drunk Helen, back when I worked, felt a lot of stress working in a busy, noisy office couple with long commutes in the mornings and evenings, yet would never touch a drink (except for the Liverpool matches or the Christmas/New Years period) outside of the weekend (Friday nights included). I remember that I always had the resolution that, if I was to ever wake up craving a drink, I would stop drinking but I doubt I would have stuck to it.

My drinking was both controlled and uncontrolled - controlled in that I rarely drank outside of the weekend. Controlled in that I often waited until the late afternoon or early evening to start drinking. Controlled in that I made sure not to spend too much money on alcohol.

Uncontrolled, in that once I started only tiredness or simply getting too drunk were the only things that would stop it 
 - I rarely finished my drinks on the same night I had so much. Uncontrolled, in that I wasn't pacing myself or drinking water in between drinks. Uncontrolled, in that I would often not care about spilt alcohol or where I put my cans and bottles.

525 days ago, after many falls I decided to stand back up and so far I have not fallen again. If I do, then I'll pick myself up and carry on, because even if I never make it to day 526, I take it one day at a time and every day I don't drink is a victory.

No matter what, I'll still keep posting on here and I'll still keep reading posts because one of the biggest reasons for Sober Helen is this community.

I matched with this really cute girl on the dating apps and we're supposed to go on a first date this weekend, she wants to go to a brewery for our first date which under normal circumstance sounds great, but I kind of gave up alcohol during quarantine and haven't had a drop of alcohol since March 7th. 

The reality of the situation is I'm not an alcoholic, but in 2019 I partied hard with my friends, was super hungover all the time, I felt miserable and I got fat AF. I really just wanted to stop drinking and quarantine was the best thing for that because I felt like a loser drinking alone, so I just didn't do it. Now that things are opening back up and I can go out and about, I don't want to do it anymore. I'm already passed the temptation phase, to the ""no thank you,"" phase.

And then I relapsed March 2019. And I can’t find my way back to a sober life. I can’t string more than 2 or 3 days. I don’t understand how I am the same person that was once embracing and loving a sober lifestyle. I’m miserable and I don’t know what happened to the motivation that drove my last sober journey. I just don’t get it, I’m not happy. At least in the mornings or as I near the last drink of the night. I’m just caught in this struggle.

I feel much better physically than I did 120 days ago. I have to focus on that right now.

I’ve attempted to stop drinking on and off for a year before I had enough. I was stuck hard in the mommy wine culture as well as the alcoholic chef culture. I had a “rough” day I better drink a bottle of wine. I just want to unwind; better have a bottle of wine. I was still functioning at work but not always feeling the best. I had slowly gained 40+ pounds over the last few years. My physical health was poor compared to my late 20s when I was working out 5+ days a week and running all the time. My doctor was getting on to me about my health and that I needed to do something about it; but I don’t have the “time”. I knew I wasn’t being the best mom I could be to my son. Mommy’s tired let’s not read tonight. Just not always present and I didn’t want to lose that time with him.

Last October my best friend and I started a 90 days challenge to end the decade better than you started it. I quit drinking for a month but of course had to have a drink on Halloween. So I started drinking again. I knew I could make 30 days (I did it in November the year prior as well) but could I make it further? I continued to drink through November, I had the worst hangover the day after Thanksgiving how did I drink so much? I was the one getting Thanksgiving dinner ready so my glass was always full since I was in the kitchen. Finally 6 months ago I was sitting in a restaurant with my family having dinner. The margaritas were so damn strong that I had instant regret drinking once dinner was over. I swore to myself that that was it. 

I have been coming to this sub for a couple years just lurking. I was ready to quit. In the beginning I was here daily/hourly. Reading everyone’s stories. I listened to This Naked Mind and that was the turning point for me to know this was the time quitting would stick. The cravings are further and fewer than they were 3 months ago. Whenever I get one I think of all the positives that have come from not drinking. I’ve lost 40 pounds (my doctor gave me a high five and had me take a new photo for my file because I had lost so much), my skin and hair are much healthier, I’m a better mom, I enjoy cooking and baking again, I’m working out daily and it feels so damn good, my relationship with my husband has improved tremendously! 

I’m currently working on 10 goals for 10 years and one of my goals is 10 years alcohol free. However, I still have to take it one day at a time and eventually that 10 year goal will be here. Slow and steady! Thank you to everyone in this sub for helping me quit drinking! I will cheers you with a Topo Chico! IWNDWYT!!",120

No one who knows my problem seems to understand why I don’t see that as an option...

I’m starting to get weird shit stuck in my head when I stop booze for even 8hrs now though.. loops of songs, bad past memories, self hate to the max and then I start shaking and sweating. A few sips of vodka or rum makes it all disappear almost instantly and then I’m back at square one depending on how much I have over what time. Maybe the pressure of changing jobs and industry completely for the first time in my 15 yrs of work, I dunno..

My stomach is fucked, I wake up coughing up my guts every morning and I have one or two smokes (weed or cigs) at most on any given day.. 
I find it hard to keep down any food or fluid before having a coughing fit and throwing it back up but I’m still fat as fuck. That’s making work pretty hard. Pretty sure everyone thinks I’m on meth and that I’m the fattest crackhead ever..
I really need to get out of this..

I forked out and I saw a shrink who wants to get me on naltrexone but my doctor won’t prescribe it to me because my liver enzymes are over ten times what they should be and apparently the quit drinking drug is bad for your liver..
Does anyone have any form of advice for me?

After a long battle with alcohol I've found this forum and got enough wind behind me to go sober for 14 days. Reading this forum daily, books about recovery and keeping a private count was/is working for me. I'm more productive at work, I exercise more and my sex drive is through the roof (fun times!). 

Being in isolation with my family has been key to my progress. Unfortunately, hanging out with my friends has resulted in a relapse. An old buddy called me up for support and met me with a six pack of beer. We drank a few, talked about his problems and he went home feeling better. But my night was only starting. Even though my attitude to alcohol has changed, the physiological addiction is still there, and I ended up picking up a bottle of vodka and rolling on alone. 

Last night I had the usual 3am anxiety wake up... but it was worse than ever before. All the information I've learned in the last few weeks ran through my head. My heart-rate was through the roof. Shame, self loathing and anxiety tore me up from 3 am until early morning. I'd close my eyes and try to meditate through it, but every bit of me was screaming. I knew this wasn't what I wanted. I'd let myself and my family down. The physiological effects of the hangover were nothing compared to the mental anguish. 

I'm back for another run. I have a lot of faith in my ability to hold off my cravings because the drink doesn't compare to the joys of fitness and sobriety. I also know that now I need a plan for external temptations. Thank you all for being part of my recovery journey. Thank you for the stories, advice and support. Because of you I have faith in my ability to stop.

I was doing really well, following a great, healthy diet, getting a ton done in my life, seeing hope and possibilities...

Then

My ex GF invites me over for dinner (here's how that goes:  I go out;  I buy all the food.  I come over. I cook it).    I don't mind; I'm a decent cook.

We have a wonderful meal and conversation until the ""You always hate me so it will never work; if you don't love me for who I am (a person with an untreated anger management problem, among other things),   then you can't really love me, ever,""    part. 

My line in the conversation is supposed to be:  ""Oh no, you're not like that!!!  You are a wonderful, caring and empathetic person \[instead of the hissing, spitting snake headed gorgon that is sitting in front of me\].""

I have a couple of glasses of wine with her.  Stupid.  I flub my lines a little.  Instead of ""empathetic,"" I say ""pathetic, "" or something less savory like that.   

We get into a fight because, really, that is my highest and best use: a hay bale for her verbal arrows.

I then leave because, after 13 bulls eyes in my chest, and the William Tell Overture playing in the background, I know enough to get out of Dodge. 

I have lost her again.  I know the ""US"" isn't a good thing.  It is like a recurring cancer that goes into remission from time to time. 

......And then

The restaurants / bars reopen because the COVID virus has miraculously disappeared.  Time to toast  the eradication of POLIO, right?  So me and the rest of the morlocks crawl to the surface and clomp our way to the nearest watering hole, following the ""all clear"" siren.

These things are not the perfect storm but a gale force wind for sure.

So what to do to recover from the setback, even if it is not  a full blown involuntary civil commitment to a psych ward?

I feel bad because I have slipped and lost ground and have circled the event horizon of at least two black holes in my life.",4

2020-06-10 06:16:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/h08166/blackout_fear_manifested/,Blackout Fear Manifested,"I recently relapsed during covid quarantine. Last week was my last drink, I'm starting my badge to 6 days ago. I lost a little over 24 hours of time, I have no recollection of it (that is SUCCESSIVE hours... and not including all the other little blackouts I've had). The last thing I remember is my roomie's friend coming over and coming in to my room so I could play some music for him. I know he has a crush on me, and I have a boyfriend.

Anyway, I have had this impending sense of dread for this withdrawal. 

As I was cleaning my room today I found the corner of a condom wrapper wedged behind my bed. I think I had sex with my roomie's friend while I was blackout, but I don't remember it. I have spent the last several hours in complete panic, nauseous and shaking. Wondering how I could possibly betray my boyfriend—who I love—that way.

My roomie rushed home after work because I said I needed to talk to her. So I asked her, ""did I have sex with someone while I was blackout last week?"" she responds ""not that I'm aware of... and nobody was over except *****. When would you have had sex?""

I explain the condom wrapper I found, and she says ""...oh, that must be mine. was it purple?"" 

YES IT WAS PURPLE. AND YES IT WAS HER CONDOM WRAPPER. I completely forgot that she had been staying in my room for weeks; I was at my boyfriends, and her cousin was staying in her room. Just to make sure, I had her text her friend and ask. His response was ""No! I wish I could though. Why would she think that we did?"" Roomie of course explained I was blackout, and he assured her nothing happened.

Okay, HUGE relief I didn't ruin the best part of my life right now over a stupid blackout hookup. 

But also, WHAT THE FUCK. I very easily could have cheated on my boyfriend and I would have absolutely ZERO recollection of it. And what's worse, I wouldn't be surprised. Obviously I thought it very possible, because it was my first assumption when I found the condom wrapper. I like to do stuff like that when I drink... even simply inviting him into my room was inappropriate, but I didn't care because I was drunk.

Why do I keep doing this to myself? Every time that I drink I do something fucking outrageously inappropriate or embarassing or stupid... usually a combination of all three. I spend days in agony during withdrawal, and tell myself I'll never drink again, but the cycle continues regardless.

Before quarantine I had 9 months+ of sobriety under my belt. I know I can do it again... I HAVE TO. For my own sanity.",15

I was doing well. Got to Day 5 or 6 without a drink. Friday arrives. I sat down with my parner and told them that I can just have a few beers that night as a treat. I end up drinking 6 beers (which is still too much) but then I drink Saturday night, Sunday night and yes, you guessed it - every evening including last night. 12 nights in a row getting drunk. For what?

I'm just disgusted with myself now. I'm extremely overweight. I crave junk food constantly because I'm drinking every night. I'm depressed. I'm anxious.

I've contacted my doctor who has prescribed me a new antidepressant. I've done this for a reason. I know that if I drink, the medication just won't work. And right now, I'm desperate to get my life back.

I've been reading a lot about my drinking patterns and it turns out I'm a 'problem drinker' or a 'binge drinker' which is extremely bad for your health.

I'll always wait until about 6pm and when the children are in bed. Then I'll drink 4-6 beers AND wine AND/OR rum. It's too much, I'm slowly killing myself. I used to pretend that I didn't have a problem because I didn't day drink, I didn't blackout and that I didn't get physical withdrawal. But I was kidding myself. I'm obsessed with the idea of being a moderate drinker which in itself is a problem because a 'normal drinker' doesn't obsess over drinking.

Anyway wish me luck, here we go again. I pick up my new medication today so that will hopefully help along with posting here, exercise and positive thoughts!",11

My last drink was pounding three beers at 6 am Saturday morning after a bender that started Thursday after work.  

Thursday my wife went out of town and my usual two hour stop at Buffalo's for 5 to 8 drinks turned into a 6 hour stop for a lot more than that.  So a. Couple of ultras friday morning turned into skipping work and drinking 16 beers and 12 seltzer s all day.  

Marriage Note...this is second wife. First marriage ended by my drinking after 21 years.  History Note...I'm 58 and didnt start drinking until I was 43. Got sober 10 years ago in AA but after a couple years started again and here we are. 

Saturday around 11 am when my wife saw me she said we have to talk.  Social Note... there is no human situation in which those words mean you are about to have a good time. 

She noted how I have been drinking every day after work for a couple years and it is getting worse.  Let me note here that she only sees about half my drinking. You know how that is.  

So after actually a pretty good talk ...I'd seen her sister too who asked her what was wrong with me...giant hangover with dry heaves pretty clearly popped into my head as the answer....I agreed to come straight home after work from now on.  

So after a stressful day at work yesterday...the 4:45 witching hour began.  I've read The Odyssey a couple times and while I dont get most of it my experience with 4:45 on a workday is pretty clearly what Homer was talking about when he gets to that part about the Siren song.  Ulysses doesn't want to go to them so he has his crew tie him to the mast while they put in earplugs.  Hes ok and then when they start singing...boom!  He'll do anything to get loose dive into the water and swim toward the Siren song where hell be dashed against the rocks and killed.  

But he wants it anyway.  Just like I wanted a beer.  I know it will kill me.  But I wanted it anyway.

Not having a crew to bind me I instead told a friend I'd go look at a tree he wants cut down.  So I did that.  Not to the bar. Then I went home.  

Once home I called my brother who supports my quitting drinking.  Then I packed for a flight this morning to see all my grown kids and their wives for a long weekend of hiking in Utah.  My kids live in three states now so this is pretty special.  We were supposed to do this in early May but it got knocked off by The Wuhan. 

I did my packing ate some chicken watched some TV read posts here and went to bed and read until I fell asleep.  Woke up and decided to post on my progress to you my fellow sobernauts and found myself...two hours from starting day 5.  

Wow.  Thanks to God and you who post and pray here. 

Ok and here's something else. My kids are great.  I have four, two are married and their spouses are great.  On a four day vacation together I can already tell you I will be the only one who might possibly turn on the tv.  They play board games cook and talk.  They dont party and the dont drink.  My son in law might buy a six pack of craft beer for seven of us  and after 4 days there might be three left.  These are super interesting people...they all climb rocks hike and explore.  
I love being with them.

I dont drink around my kids because...well I just dont. See History Note, above.

And heres the thing.  A week ago I realized I'm thinking I dont want to go on this trip because of how I knew it would interfere with my drinking.  This was an unpleasant realization and finally a real wake up call.  And I think a trigger for my binge. And I finally had to (was given the grace to be able to) admit that I had a problem. Again. It took the Friday binge to deal the deal but hey it takes what it takes. 

Now instead I'm looking forward to it and hopefully will hit a week of sobriety early this coming weekend.  Cant wait to get on that plane in a few hours and blast off to enjoy some of simple and best pleasures of this life.

Aaaaand that is how my day four is ending.",57

I know it's not time to bust out the champagne just yet (so to say) but OMG after so long of nothing I'm beyond thrilled.  It's really hard not to celebrate with booze, but that'd be just too ironic, right?  lol.

I still can't talk to him, but hopefully this will relax things a bit so maybe at least he can talk to our friends more.  Who knows.  Luckily everyone has got my back on keeping in touch with me if/when he talks to them.

My family has gotten a lawyer and hoping that'll give us an edge so I can speak with one of his doctors or a social worker.  His mom is insane and I'm fed up with her threats and hearsay.   She refuses to contact us about any updates and has blocked my email from him, any and all news I get is through his sister who luckily is chill, lives close by, and can talk to him.

I need some help finding motivations to stop drinking, I can’t think of any that work for me. I’ll list a few I’ve seen people use and explain why it doesn’t really fit my issue. 

for less pain, no hangovers, not waking up everyday with a headache 
This doesn’t motivate me. I have chronic pain, I’m in pain every single minute of every day, so I don’t see too much of a difference when I drink and when I don’t. So this motivation doesn’t help me.

To mend relationships broken due to this addiction and to not make stupid mistakes. 
I don’t go out when I drink, I’m always at my house. Sure maybe one of my texts might sound a little more mushy than usual but for the most part I don’t have huge embarrassing moments while drinking. Also, I’m a very high functioning drunk/drinker. I can competently carry on a conversation and most of the time people don’t even know/realize I’m drunk. I have a fucking bloodhound of a cousin who is very over concerned with people doing things she disapproves of (she hates drinking) I’ve been super drunk in front of her and she never notices. I don’t find there’s a need for this motivation either. There’s no one affected by this but me because I don’t tell people and they don’t notice. 

To be more healthy. 
I already have super shitty health without the drinks I’m probably going to die early and tbh I don’t care I’ve been suicidal for a decade now so that doesn’t motivate me. 

look better 
I actually look better when I’m on a drinking binge because I lose my appetite and therefore look thinner. 

To make you a less angry and better person. I like myself better when I drink. I open up more I’m not riddled with social anxiety and thoughts of dying 24/7 I’m more fun to be around when I’m not constantly thinking about how depressed I am. 

Overall I just don’t have a lot to look forward to in life, drinking is usually my prize for myself when I’ve done something well or good. I need to replace something in this reward system but idk what to use. The only real thing I can think of is money, but I usually factor in my alcohol spending into my grocery budget so I can usually get by. I’ve fought depression, PTSD, anxiety and suicidal thoughts so long that it feels like there’s no hope for my future, but even if there is a glimmer of hope I wanna be better in that future but it’s hard to motivate myself when that future seems so out of reach.",4

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hi, SD Family!

Today's idea comes to us courtesy of my bull calf named Matthew McConaughey (hey he's a Longhorn cow from Texas, my hands were tied on this). Matty talks *mad crap* to a cow in my neighboring farmer's pasture any time this one particular cow comes near the fence. And I mean *every single time*.

Cows hold grudges for a long time, so at some point this one other cow said or did something to make Matty mad. Today, he missed half of snack time because he was by the fence yelling at his offensive neighbor. I tried coaxing him over for treats, but he wasn't having it and I thought ""what a silly calf- wasting his time being mad instead of eating.""

So I thought about grudges in general and how during early sobriety especially, I seemed to be holding a grudge against *myself.* Sometimes I would think about stupid decisions I used to make or embarrassing things I had done. And that kind of energy simply wasn't good for my sobriety or, frankly, for my mental health in general.

With that in mind, I just want to remind you that we've all done or said things that we regret, especially when we were drinking. It's okay to move on from that, to forgive ourselves, and to allow ourselves to become better. We don't have to hold grudges against ourselves- we are strong and we are improving!  IWNDWYT!",93

2020-06-09 22:19:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/h01ul1/well_i_guess_almond_extract_in_my_coffee_is_out/,Well I guess almond extract in my coffee is out..,"I lost 75lbs a couple years ago on keto.  Once I got off it, I maintained pretty well, but my weight crept up 10-15 lbs over the last year, so I jumped back off the carbs a couple weeks ago to knock it back down over the next couple of months.

I've fallen in love with homemade iced coffees that use Torani syrup, but since they'd knock me out of ketosis in an instant, I've been looking at making my own syrups with extracts and sweetening them with stevia.  I've tried the Torani sugar free syrups, but they taste like chemicals, so I thought I'd do some DIY.

I always knew extracts had an acohol percentage, but I guess I just never equated it to the alcohol I drank years ago, so it just didn't cross my mind that it might affect me.  I've had alcohol in my mouth two times (three now, I suppose) since I quit over 12 years ago.

The first time (8 years into sobriety), my boss shoved a rum filled chocolate ball in my mouth and told me to bite.  The second time (10 years in), my hibachi chef squirted sake in my mouth when I thought it was water.  

Both times, my immediate instinct was to spit (I didn't need that ginger salad anyway lol).  But even after spitting both times, I distinctly remember feeling a familiar tingling through my veins, like my body had realized what I had done and it was trying to soak up every molecule it could.  I was terrified that I'd be facing those early-quit demons again.  Luckily, I was wrong.

About halfway through my coffee, I felt that same tingling and it took me a minute to realize what was happening.  I poured the rest of it out and groaned at my stupidity for not thinking that one through.  The feeling passed like the other two times, as I'm sure less than a teaspoon of extract in a 32 oz coffee is a laughable amount, but it's not a game I want to play.  My body has proven he's a traitor.

And that brings me to the core of my sobriety.  What do I *want*?  My sobriety isn't defined by the amount of time that's passed since my last drink.  It's defined by what I truly want for myself deep down inside.. when nobody is looking.

I could have taken that mouthful of sake and swallowed it, and nobody (not even my wife who's seen me at my drunken worst) would have blamed me.  I could have finished that coffee--knowing full well that it was affecting me--and nobody would have known that I chose to do it.  

...Except me.  And I'm the one who *wants* to be sober.  I'm the one who *wants* to not drink.

I don't have cravings like I used to early in my quit.  I haven't for years.  I don't have the nightmares and night terrors and sweats.  Those days seem so long ago.  It's gotten so easy over time that the struggle that I fought so hard to win remains all but a faded dream.  

That's not a boast.  I *need* to be reminded.  I'm *here* to be reminded.  It's often under the guise of offering support to others because I've been there and somehow made it out, but you absolute beastmode-rockstar-champions with 3, and 14, and 29, and 103 days by your names are why I come here because you give me strength and inspiration beyond what you could ever know.  

So while our bodies may betray us in an instant, it's the battle with our *minds*.. with our innermost *desires* that have to be won to truly escape this poison's grasp.  

I hope you find that same want.  Once you do, you've all but won.  I will still be here cheering you on.  I will not drink with you today.",198

Started off “innocent” enough but more and more found myself in situations that my right mind never would have chosen, and surrounded by people who say they care about me but act in heinously self serving fashion. Basically my judgement dissolved in a mortifyingly short time, I became dependent on people and substances for my happiness in an equally alarming duration, and once again found myself behaving and feeling like a person I do not care for.

I fear lack of joy and purpose, but I’ve yet again been reminded that a life of chemical indulgence is far more horrifying and painful than a life of radical acceptance of the fears and doubts that everyone has. I’m ready to be whole again. It’s damn hard work, and I also fear that I will fail again. But I’m gonna try anyway. Thanks for listening! IWNDWYT

I know that a lot of other factors come in to play such as genetics and mental health. However I found this really interesting because I have always been an EXTREMELY impatient person since childhood. I can totally see why I use alcohol as a crutch for stress or social interaction - it’s just easier to have a drink and get the instant gratification than being patient enough to improve myself in the long run. 

Anyone else feel like a big part of their addictive personality is because of their impatient personality?",3

A quick background: I was always the ""fat girl"" in high school and college. Never drank much because the few times I did, I felt out of control. I'd rather sneak an entire bag of Ruffles in my purse.

In 2007, at the age of 35, I had a Roux-n-Y gastric bypass. In eighteen months, I went from 385 lbs to 165 lbs. I was suddenly ""hot"". I was suddenly ""popular"". I was also suddenly ""single"". I left my husband halfway through my weight  loss and started drinking. A LOT.

After many major fuck ups, I got sober on March 10, 2010, with AA. It lasted 7 years, 10 months, and 3 days. I saw an ad for a bloody mary at a local Mexican restaurant. That's all it took.

Since then, I've been to rehab twice. I drink every day. I've ballooned back up to 275 lbs. 

I hate myself and I hate my life. Sometimes, I really do want to die.

I guess this is a cry for help.

But more recently as social distancing loosened up I’ve been seeing friends more and started drinking more and I don’t really want to be doing that but I’m struggling not to...it’s a social thing, it’s just what we do together.  And it’s not a lot, I’m not getting blackout drunk but it only takes me a few drinks to get drunk and then I’m hungover and it affects my mood.  She asked me why I can’t just not drink or just have 1 or 2 drinks and the gist is even when that’s my intention, once I have a couple of drinks in a social situation I just keep going....not excessively but my inhibitions are less and I will drink more than I intended to and get drunk. That really only takes 3-4 drinks for me. If I get l reeeallly drunk I have a hard time stopping I will just keep drinking but that only happens a few time a year.

And I told my therapist the idea of not drinking is really hard for me, I’m very attached to it as kind of a ritualized thing (have a glass of wine to relax) and a social thing.  And I really like trying new and different beers and cocktails.

Anyway my therapist told me It sounds like I’m an alcoholic and it would be best if I stop drinking.  I’m just not sure...I don’t feel like my drinking is severe enough or frequent enough for me to consider myself an alcoholic.

I also want to be clear I’m doing my very best to portray my drinking accurately in this post and Not minimize anything.  Other than hangovers, and occasionally making bad decisions, I haven’t really had any negative consequences from drinking.  I drive when I probably shouldn’t - I know this is a really really bad and potentially deadly bad decision to make. I don’t think that bad decision is necessarily exclusive to alcoholics though?

I only drink more than one or two drinks socially and when I do I’m not getting totally wasted I’m just drinking more than I wanted to.  I drink by myself maybe once or twice a week if that and usually it will be one beer or glass of wine. 

I’m also specifically not drinking to get drunk, I enjoy trying new drinks, I enjoy it the same way I enjoy trying new foods.  And when given the choice I will intentionally choose lower abv drinks.

So idk what to think.  I really don’t want to stop drinking all together I just want to stop getting drunk as often. 

I’m not convinced I really need to stop but I also know it’s not normal to consider whether you have to stop drinking.  I just kind of think my issue has more to do with being a lightweight.

Was anyone else in a similar boat before they stopped and what was your experience? What advice would you have for me?",3

I woke up today at noon after yet another night of me spending all my money at a bar. Before everything opened back up here, I was spending my nights getting drunk. A night for me is draining a whole bottle and turning into the person I hate yet again. Once I start, it doesn't stop until the money or the booze runs out. I'd like to blame this on my dad passing away recently; I'd like to blame this on depression or something else. But I'm the one picking up the drink. 

I missed work today after an old friend called me up last night. One or two beers turned into 6, plus shots for me then after he left the bar I kept drinking and getting wild drunk. I didn't even plan to drink last night; I just wanted to sit home and relax after work, but I always seem to find my way into the drink. This isn't the first time by far that this has happened. I like to delude myself in saying that I don't drink every night so I cant be an alcoholic. I am clearly wrong. I know where this path leads and I am afraid that I am going down that path to my own oblivion.

Today I finally had to admit to myself that I have the family curse of high tolerance to alcohol and alcoholism. I grew up watching my dad and family get pissed wasted and I grew up to be just like them. I have to go to my dad's celebration of life in a few weeks and I know its going to be a massive drinking party as that's how he lived his life. I don't want that life anymore. I'm sick of the pain and suffering I put on myself and I am sick of being a drunken idiot. I don't want to snap back from a blackout and find my car wrapped around a pole or something else terrible that ruins my life because I can't control myself over a stupid liquid.

PROS
- My skin looks amazing compared to my drinking days.  (Rested, healthy, clear, hydrated)
- I made the biggest sale of my career (real estate)
- My anxiety drastically decreased within the first couple weeks and has continued so.
- I cut down, then stopped smoking cigarettes (the last couple years I mostly smoked while drinking.) The longer I’ve been sober, the more disgusted I’ve been by them
- I’ve spent a lot of time self-reflecting— with a clearer mind.
- a lifelong friend told me that I’m not the same person anymore (in a good way)
- I’ve been super comfortable hanging with my friends while they’re drinking 
- I feel more capable and I have better control over my life
-My mental health is so much better 

CONS
- My marijuana use is becoming a concern (I love my MJ but if I’m going to be honest with myself, I’ve been over-indulging quite a bit).
- I don’t usually crave alcohol, but at times when negative emotions have run high, I’ve wanted to get drunk.
- I’m still heartbroken.  I’ve been trying to reconcile with my ex boyfriend of 2.5 years, who I dumped during a drunken fit.  (Both of us were at fault) Even though I’ve made all of these positive changes, have sat in my shame, cried myself to sleep for several months, have taken accountability for my actions, and prayed prayed prayed, I have not been successful at reestablishing a relationship.  We are “friends” but I’m totally getting the cold shoulder.  I guess time will tell.



Thanks for reading.  Wishing you the best on your sobriety journey.  Remember— one day at a time!  If you can’t do that, scale it back to one hour at a time.  If that’s still too much, then take it one minute at a time!!!  Peace ✌🏼",5

I couldn't understand what he was saying. Finally, something I understood: Buster is dead. He killed himself. The words came out before I could stop myself, ""You're lying! This isn't funny! It's a joke! Stop it.""

Three years ago today my best friend killed himself. He had been consumed with drugs and alcohol. I didn't, rather WE didn't, have any idea how close he was to ending his life until he did. It was too late for him. 

Buster was the life of the party. The second he would walk into a house, everyone knew they were about to have the time of their lives. I'm talking dancing on counters in the kitchen, saying up all night long, spending the next day on the couch too hungover to do anything but laugh about the shenanigans of the previous night. But little did any of us, myself especially, realize how much the lifestyle consumed him. It wasn't until I was closely walking the path he was before he died, did I understand. In the throes of my addiction, I thought about him. I thought about ending my life. How alone I was. Its how I imagine he felt. 

Committing to living a sober life, I can't help but feel like I'm living for him too. Like it's the path that would have saved his life, because it's saving my life. Every day that I choose sobriety, is a day I choose to live. A day I choose to show up for myself. 

I just wish he knew how much I loved him.

2020-06-09 12:21:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gzqcl5/not_a_great_start_to_today/,Not a great start to today.,"I had major back surgery about 5 weeks ago and was being taken care of by some friends when I was asked to leave because I had been taking a few drinks here and there and they didn’t like that so they asked me to leave. I was healed enough to make my way back by bus and Lyft rides to my old apartment where I still have a lease until August. That’s when I decided to get sober again, when they asked me to leave and didn’t care where I went as long as it was out of their house. So, I’d say I’ve made pretty good progress in my sobriety and been putting my life together but today has started out very hard and which is why I joined this group.

I woke up with terrible back pain after a restless sleep, waking up every two hours or so until 5 am which I was able to sleep a solid 4hrs, that’s where the pain came in. I took Tylenol and laid back down then decided to get up. First I saw an email from the people who asked me to leave saying I owed them $600 for my weeks rent and the 17 bottles I drank. There’s no way I drank that but why bother arguing? Then saying I need to make arrangements to get the rest of my stuff. This put me in a ashamed mood cause I did still drink which pissed them off and probably lost years of friendship. I was even best man on their wedding. So not letting emotion take hold I decided to wait to respond and went to wash my face and my glasses broke, in the middle. I have no other pair. 

So now, I’m kind of reeling. Not so much wanting to drink but just in despair which I know could lead to wanting to say eff it anyways and drink. 

I know if I just calm down and think rationally, something I can’t do while drunk I can figure out a solution and part of that calming down is writing this post. Getting my feelings out of my head so they don’t eat me alive and the monster doesn’t feed on something. I pledge now that IWNDWYT.",5

(First acknowledge all the negatives and future probabilities of continuing. Then acknowledge the benefits of quitting and create constant reminders as to not forget).

When I would drink my personality would change drastically, I had thought it was a good thing but from an objective view it was quite the contrary. It would make me a full blown hedonist and indulge in anything for pleasure. Science would probably say it's the ""animal"" brain taking control, otherwise known as survival mode. I don't necessarily believe in spirits and demons, but if they were to exist; surely being inebriated would make it much easier to possess someone's body and ""take them for a ride.""

My brain always seems to convince me I can moderate, and I listen even though I know it’s a lie. Had a massive panic attack a few days ago because I got too drunk. Had a really hard think about how I’ve been living. My terrible habits seem normal just because I’ve had them for so long.

I like to think I’m a good partner to my fiance because I’m affectionate and do nice things to her. I’m not mean to her or anything when I’m drunk, but I can’t be treating her well if I lie about my drinking and am not sober for her. She is concerned about me. My friends are concerned about me. My family is too. I’m going to lose them, and I can’t lose them.

Right now, I’m working on day 3. I’m still too ashamed to have a craving, but I’m still dealing with the hanxiety from drinking a few days ago. I have to do something different this time if I want my quitting to be permanent. I don’t want to go to AA...I honestly don’t know why. I don’t need responses, but I’m hoping that I can just treat this like AA for accountability. I have to be less selfish for my relationships.

I was drinking a lot. Mainly beer, so I put on some weight. My husband and I can be toxic if we start drinking together as he wants to order about every unhealthy thing possible. So, now I’m working to get the weight off. I just want off of the roller coaster.

Oh, this is another crazy part... the day before yesterday I did aerobics. It was difficult and I was sore yesterday and still sore as heck today... I was in great shape before my relapse.

That all the hard work over the past couple of months, all the sleepless nights and health fears, and all of the slip ups and fears of being doomed were leading somewhere. 

Saturday morning I went fishing with a friend and his family. I personally had a wonderful sober time, but was surrounded by people drinking on the river and also having a good time. I explained to them I was quitting drinking, and was only offered a drink once before they got the idea and left me alone about it. 

That evening was rough. Once I got home and was alone, the urges hit hard, but I fought them off. ""this is exactly what we talked about a couple days ago, this is the make or break moment."" I remember telling myself, and honestly that worked. I fought off the urges and made it through the night. 

Sunday was a different story unfortunately. Long story short, I slipped up and drank myself to sleep. Woke up with the usual shame and guilt. However this time I had a different idea in mind. I could turn this into a victory if I just didn't let it become a multi day binge like I normally do. Normally, I go three to four days drinking essentially a bottle of liquor a night, until my body literally won't let me anymore. If I didn't let that happen, in at minimum still cutting two days worth of drinking out of my month. That's a win! 

So I didn't drink last night, and I have no intentions to drink tonight either. Make every failure a win. Make the demons realize they can't win. Even when they have you down, flip the table on them. At this rate, I'll go from 25 nights of drinking a month to 4. I imagine at this pace, I'll be completely done with the stuff any day now. Completely free. 

As a closing note for today, as many people tend to do, I wanna thank this whole community. Never once gas someone told me ""it's not that big of a deal,"" or ""all you have to do is quit."" You people have been nothing but completely understanding, loving, supportive, and empowering my whole journey. That journey is not over yet, but had it not been for you guys, I would never have made it this far. From the bottom of my heart I really appreciate it.",32

1 YEAR
365 DAYS
52 WEEKS

I have pieced together months and even a year before with past attempts. But it wasn't real, I didn't really want it and it just didn't feel the same. This year did, though. It was the most eye-opening, painful, joyus, messy, scary, rewarding year of my life. 

Months 1-6 were a nightmare. I didn't have physical addiction. I had mental addiction. Stress drinker. It is terrible for both types. These are the hardest months, everyone. If you are out there still in these early days, HANG IN THERE. It gets better, I promise. And IT IS WORTH IT. Even though it doesn't feel like it at the time. I was suicidally depressed in this stage. Only 4 months and a few good therapy sessions later, no more suicidal thoughts or boredom. 

The past four months have been a gift. The past three especially, even though the set the world has been set on fire. Quarantine was beautiful. I made some of the most precious memories of my life with my children. I thank God every day. Not just for my sobriety, but for my sobriety at this exact moment. I have been able to be the rock my children needed and I am so grateful to be facing the challenges of the new world we are entering with a clear heart and mind. 

I love not drinking. I love not being hungover. I love knowing and believing I am a good and worthy human. Mostly, I love discovering the resolve and strength that lies inside of me. 

Today marks the first year of my new, best life friends! Thank you for being there over the past year and thank you for sharing today with me.

I am not an alcoholic, I have a great job nice house and so on. I drink MAX once a month but when I do.. Well.. that's the issue. 

From 18 - 24 I could go for a night out and have absolutely no issues. I had a child 2 years ago, all of a sudden bills and responsibilities took over my life. When I've drank the last 2 years I've done the most embarrassing things. Drunk drove, posted the most embarrassing things on social media, put my best friends down telling them they are worthless, started fights, took pictures and videos of friends using drugs and posting it for their families to see. Really stupid things. I've noticed the last year they've stopped inviting me out to places and secretly drink / party without me now. I went out this weekend with a buddy I havent seen in a long time, took cocaine smoked weed and drank a shit ton. I went to my friends house uninvited to find them all drinking and they of course acknowledged my arrival but could tell them were disappointed when I turned up. I don't know why I am like this when I drink now. Its every single time and one day I'm going to do something so stupid I'll not be able to come back from it.

So I'm posting this as off today to remind myself I clearly have an underlying issue that has developed quite recently and alcohol is bringing it out. (Also I don't know how to set this thing to day 1.) 1st post!",2

I haven't even looked at mine in weeks now, neither the ""to read"" nor the [past tense] ""read"". What's on your list this week? Movies, podcasts, books, music-- share please!

I'm finally getting around to reading *Shogun* now, the 70s megahit novel by James Clavell. It's very good but I'm struggling to stay with it because of everything that's going on in the world. Both my personal world and the larger world are full of distractions right now. As I read this book with all it's huge glorious battles and ancient feuds and heroic deaths and stuff, I find myself thinking ""why do we humans insist on forming factions and fighting each other? Like, always everywhere? Why is their always some caste of elites lording it over everyone?"" Stuff like that. I'm not in the right frame of mind for it, I suppose. 

You know what I've really, truly, absolutely loved lately? *Bojack Horseman*. I've talked about it before here and now that I've finished watching it I love it even more. I actually cried at the ending. I cried at the ending of a goddamn cartoon! 

I cried because I was moved by it and I also cried because there was no more of it to see. But that's part of what's good about it. It stopped while it was still great. It didn't hang around to jump the shark. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet and are considering it but I will say this: it handles mental health issues and how they accrue and repeat through generations of some families along with addictions better than most serious highbrow live action dramas do IMO, but without becoming too depressing because the jokes in it are so utterly charming and delightful. 

It seems trite these days to say ""stay safe and be well"" to end a communication and yet, what else is there to say. I hope you all are safe and well. If you're here reading this, it means you're either sober or trying to be, and that's a win, folks.",17

I don't feel good about that.

The reason was to get weed. I have to go to Copenhagen and it can be stressful because you never know if the police might show up. 

So that was my excuse. It's pretty stupid because alcohol doesn't make you smarter or quicker. It just makes you feel like you are. 

But now I have it. And now I have no excuse to drink. 

I have to start with the alcohol and later I can ditch the weed as well. 

Most important is that I don't drink. I can function on a little weed and it takes my anxiety. It doesn't change my personality like alcohol does.

How do you keep the motivation to stay sober?","I’ve been drinking unhealthily for years, at least since I was 17 (I’m now knocking on the door of 35) and have tried several times, sometimes seriously, to get and stay sober. I’ve even tried 12-step programs, but the ‘higher power’ stuff always puts me off. The longest that I have managed to stay sober was for about 3 months back in 2018. 

I drink a lot (binge levels) most nights. Normally, it doesn’t affect me too badly; I wake up on time, I get to work, I do enough to not get in trouble, then it’s home again and more booze.

Recently, my drinking has become much worse. It used to be just beer that I would drink; now it’s only whiskey. I don’t drink until the evening, but I will often start the day absolutely dead set against drinking, then 8p.m. rolls around and off I go again, like clockwork.

There has been a distinct escalation in my drinking patterns in the last few weeks. On Saturday, I blacked out for the first time in almost 10 years through a combination of drink and drugs; I have no recollection whatsoever of the evening. Then, last night, I passed out with the oven hob on. Thank goodness it was on the lowest setting and I did not torch the house, but that’s just pure luck. It was burning, untended, for almost 10 hours.

It is clear to me that, if I don’t change, alcohol is going to kill me one way or the other. Today I am super motivated to sober up and stay that way. But. I always, always relapse. So here is my question: what genuinely useful, practical things do you guys do to keep your motivation to stay sober high?

I’ve got the logistical side of things down; no alcohol in the house, recognizing triggers etc, but my motivation is what always fails me. So how do you do it? How do you keep that focus and avoid a constant cycle of relapse, nearly burn the house down, back on the wagon? 

Thanks and be safe,

(I needed a fabulous, glittery rainbow chip because I’m hella queer and it’s Pride month 🌈 ✨)

I was going to write some lofty, profound wall of text, but maybe I’ll save that for Year 5. 

How about 4 pieces of advice instead of me yammering on about myself? 

ONE DAY AT A TIME: You can handle today. That’s all you’ll ever have to handle is today. Keep doing that and the days add up. 

Therapy: My sobriety game changed when I dealt with all the trauma that had kept me in a dark drinking spiral for so long. 

Accountability: Getting sober in secret is like playing with a hot stove. If no one can hold you accountable, what incentive do you have to be honest with yourself? I went to AA meetings, I told my closest friends I was in recovery. I knew that if they knew, they could support me. If nobody knew, it would be too tempting to be dishonest. 

Loving yourself: This one is HARD. I hated myself for so long. Drinking was a form of self-harm for me. Sobriety really gives you a chance to get to know yourself, define who you are, change your inner self-talk, and discover all the ways that you need to heal. The clarity is life-saving.

I've been binge drinking for 15 years.
I was diagnosed with depression 8 years ago but  I think I have it for 11 years now. 
For a long time I have fought with being depressed with medication, exercise, socialising.. anything. I've even been hospitalised twice as suicide prevention.

A few months ago I realised that the habit of drinking is not what lifts my mood and helps me get through the day.. it's what has caused me all this misery.

Alcohol works for me like an energy boost and it lifts my mood. But after I get sober.. after the hangover.. it never gets back to feeling like before drinking. I like to imagine a graph that spikes up as you drink, plummets down on the hangover and rises slowly back up but never to the level that you were before. 15 years later of inching lower and lower on that mood graph is where I am now. Always tired. Always bored unless drunk. Always irritable. Always.. dissatisfied with my life.

With a lot of reminiscing I understood that all my actions have been driven by seeking the booze high.
Any event was dismissed as boring if there was no alcohol involved. I didn't want to do much with friends if we were not drinking at the end. An evening without beers felt wasted. In fact.. all my relationships revolved around alcohol. My friends were more like drinking buddies than meaningful relationships. I hope I get to know them better now.

If by any chance you are underage and reading this. It means you probably have problems already. But let my experience warn you. I started when I was underage too and it messed with my brain's chemistry as I grew up.. probably forever. You have heard of dopamine and what effects alcohol and other drugs have on it. When you're young and developing, those hormone systems develop problematically if your brain is constantly flooded with poison and dopamine spikes and other garbage it doesn't need. So.. obey the legal drinking age law at least.

I hope I get better after a while.
And I hope someone who's thinking about quitting gets pushed over to the sober side.. I've been sober for only a week now but I already feel the benefits.
I am more aware and more.. conscious. My cognitive functions are improving. I get cranky when the cravings kick in, but mostly I think I am more pleasant as a person now.

It's worth it.

Ok that's it.. take care.",104

While searching for some vague answer to what it could all mean, I came across this little nugget on the interwebs, and though it made me giggle a little, I felt it was deep:

""Religion is for people who are afraid to go to Hell and spirituality is for those of us who have already been there.""

I am currently in bed, cannot sleep despite a busy day, and am floating through a series of insanely up and down emotions and thoughts. I did not drink today, and for that I am grateful. I was able to walk my dogs, attend to my work online, eat a wonderful dinner with my wife, did yard work and worked out (in no particular order). Yet I find myself up, awake and wondering. Is this possible for me? Can I truly do this? Will I break? My immediate thoughts are...yes you can, you need to, you feel excellent and just laid down several reasons you can do this...so why the doubt? 

My mind is continuously fascinating me as each day goes by. I have found myself craving and desiring a drink so terribly much, only to conclude that if I do in fact drink, the series if unfortunate events that will follow will most certainly undo what joy or satisfaction I sought in the first place. So I don’t. But these creeping thoughts have continuously forced myself to battle myself mentally and nearly physically. 

But i have won those battles thus far. 
Reading these stories has given me peace. I see a lot of myself on here and very much empathize with those who are seeking and have sought out a better life. I just wanted to post out of sheer joy that there are others out there who share the same sentiments with me, and that they have come to find an enlightenment I hope to arrive at. I certainly feel like I am on my way.

I hope to share more and read more stories. And if you’re struggling and reading this, I sincerely hope you keep the good fight and win those mental battles.",6

It seems like yesterday that I made the choice to better myself.  I never would have thought I would be sitting here 4 years later still sober but I made it!   For all of you that are struggling my advice to you is to do the following:

&#x200B;

* Always play it forward.   It might seem like just one drink but be truthful with your self on where that one drink will lead.   It might not lead down a broken road the first night you drink but eventually, it will lead down that road of sorrow and embarrassment that we all are too familiar with.
* Come to Stopdrinking when you are struggling.  Read their stories and think about what I said above about playing it forward as some of the stories you are reading can be you if you take that drink.
* Surround your self with people who lift you up and support you.   They will be there when you are in your darkest days and lean on them as much as you need especially in the beginning.

Everyone has their own paths but these steps have helped me and if it helps just one of you that are struggling then I am happy to have shared it with you.",130

I came clean and told her how I was binging and getting blackout drunk every night. I told her so I could keep myself accountable to someone other than my therapist that I only see every 2 weeks. But 3 weeks later I ended up lying to her and relapsing 2 weekends in a row. I still constantly think about drinking but I feel like this is how it starts every time. I want to drink, then talk myself out of it. I want to drink, but then remember is not worth it. I want to drink, and end up rationalizing it until I find myself hitting the call button in the liquor aisle. I don’t have a lot of self confidence so it makes me feel empowered to drink sometimes. Like I’m actually making a decision for myself and doing what I want regardless of what anyone else wants for me or expects of me. It also helps me forget the loneliness I’m constantly feeling at this time in my life. The only thing that is different about being sober this time (14 days so far) is that 2 days later I got a message from a really good friend of mine asking to cut all contact between the two of us. We’re both struggling with 2 different addictions and the actions I take while binging directly affect his sobriety. It absolutely destroyed me that my drinking caused me to lose a friend (please see loneliness referenced above) and the worst part is that I was blackout drunk per usual and don’t even remember what I specifically did/said to cause it. I’m scared that I did irreparable damage to our relationship. I’m also scared that I will become hopeless and relapse again.",4

Example: say gaming. Hardcore gamers love to game 6+hours without any stress/efforts. SomEone who does not game will find this ridiculous would not ever DARE to even try. BUT WHY is this the case??????????????????????

Its actually very basic and simple. Anytime anyone is motivated/demotivated to do something its simply because they recall the experience they had created doing the same activity last time. Same goes with alcohol,weed,cigarettes,etc. Regular users have created their own +ve experience with these  bad habits and that is why they are always chasing that experience. By no means this is a +ve experience in reality, it is just that they have believed this is a +ve experience and have been thoroughly convinced. Simultaneously everything else becomes boring this is because they attach a negative experience to these activities(like talking a walk, running, working out, cleaning the house....) Hence they never feel motivated to do those activites. Finally for the same reason people who have never tried drugs/alcohol continue to always turned down the chances they get to indulge in them. WHY???????????????????????????? Simply because they never got the chance to attach a +ve experience to these activites to create a drive to do them. Hence they never feel tempted whatsoever.

&#x200B;

Solution: You need to recalibrate what your mind considers to be fun/worthy doing/+ve experience and also what your mind considers boring/-ve experience/not worth doing. This is done by attaching(in your mind) negative experience/thoughts/cons of a bad activity everytime you think about it. Similary attach( in your mind) +ve experience/thoughts/pros of a good activity (which you want to introduce into your life ) everytime you think about that activity. Once you keep doing this, you will slowly lose interest in things you should not be doing. and start gaining interest in things you should be doing. 

Want to know one last interesting thing? reverse the whole process explained above and thats exactly how you started developing the bad habit in the first place.(Ex: As you started to drink for the first time, you never thought too much of it and you were probably never interested because your mind had not attached any experience to it. But as you kept doing it over and over the mind got progressively convinced this is +ve experience. And everytime you want to have a good time the only thing that pops in your mind is the activites which you THINK are positive experiences)

I’ve unfortunately had to experience a 5 night medically controlled withdrawal. Sleeping (trying to sleep) in a hospital bed while being woken up every 3 hours to take meds and vitals sucks, but that’s nothing compared to the uneasiness, anxiety, nightmares, shakes, speech impediments, body imbalance, confusion and overall dread you experience for days on end. Every 5 minutes feels like at least an hour. 

If I would have listened to the people talking to me about how bad it can get, I could have saved myself a pretty traumatic experience. So if you are at all feeling like maybe it’s a good time to re-evaluate your drinking, believe me, it is. No time like the present.

By the time Friday rolls around, I feel like I need something special to kick off the weekend. We usually order out (we barely eat out so it's definitely something we look forward to) and we also usually make yummy drinks. Then, because it's the weekend, I feel like I need something Saturday afternoon/night. Especially since it's getting warmer and we're doing yard work on the weekends, I would usually want a beer of some sort.

I think something that drew me to alcohol was the perceived novelty, of having something ""special"". And I think that expectation was placed on me by society... that the weekend is a time to kick back, relax, let go, and just chill. I would put this undue pressure on myself to do just that, with a drink in my hand. I'd open a bottle of wine on Friday and you know, just ""have"" to finish the bottle over the rest of the weekend so it doesn't go bad.

It’s hard work not drinking. Sometimes I feel like I make it harder then it needs to be.I have been wanting to quit drinking for 3 years and other then pregnancies the longest I have made it is two months. So I am now making it my goal to make it 6 months. I’m hoping after 6 months my cravings will be manageable and I won’t even want to drink. Even though I haven’t had many days straight sober other then pregnancies the last 3 years, my drinking has been drastically reduced and for that I’m proud of my self. 

I don’t know if this is the right away to do it. But for right now forever seems like too much. I know to take it one day at time but in the back of my mind I know it’s not one day it’s all the days and I become overwhelmed feel like I’m doomed. So I’m saying 6 months sober. Thankfully I have felt the amazing benefits of short term sobriety and hopefully I will experience the long term. Thanks for reading sorry for the rambling. IWNDYT!",15

My situation is complicated because of the relationship that I""m in with a controlling emotional abuser.

He's told me many times that I'm a drunk.  I need help.  I need AA.  I need ...fill in the blank.  I went to AA and he hated the fact that I had a daily obligation to a meeting...and a sponsor etc.  It threatened him.

SO, he started mocking me when I got anxious at all...   not drinking.  It hasn't been easy.

I was drinking upwards of 1 to 1.5 bottles of wine a day.  I had to start hiding wine from him because even 2 glasses of wine was a sin to him.   The hiding of wine....spiraled my drinking out of control.  I would NEVER think I would be slugging wine from a bottle in the closet, but I found myself doing that to deal w the anxiety of his fights --- and not be caught.  THEN he caught me drinking in the closet and that was even MORE proof that  I was ""insane"" and a ""crazy alcoholic"".

As I said, I haven't dran in 8 days.  I have done some virtual AA meetings.  But I'm wondering if I need rehab?  What will cure me of this consistent desire to drink?  I almost think it's the ability to say ""F U"" when I swig back wine and if he wasn't in the picture...it may be normal.  But for right now....  what would you suggest?

i've tried online hypnosis...AA..   but I keep wanting wine to deal with his constant insults.   Suggestions?  And yes, it's easy to say ""just leave him"".  But he's told me many times I will be a raging alcoholic and under a bridge in no time...if he leaves me.  And part of me wonders if that is true...",5

To get them settled into the space, we put our three cats into an empty useless guest room with some litters. Well, I guess they weren’t into using the litters (vengeance, possibly?), and peed all over the floor.

Fast forward 3 months, and that empty useless guest room got booked up for future residence. The wife got knocked up. Yay, Woo, Wonderful, all of those things, but also - shit. That rug is GROSS. Small Future Resident will not approve. I pull the rug out, the pads, and find that the wooden subfloor has pee stains. Horribly smelly pee stains. I love cats, but they’re bastards.

I do some googling and find a primer that’s supposed to work a dream to seal the smell away. Pee smell locked in an inescapable paint dungeon. 

I get the can, open it up, and feel like I’m going to pass out. It smelled familiar, but I couldn’t quite place the smell just then. Just something toxic and dreadful and a little familiar. Most of all though, it was repellant. I had to use a face mask (you know, those things we all have in abundance right about now) and with tears in my eyes, nostrils burning, stomach churning, I painted the offending spots.

As I’m waiting for the spots to dry so I can apply another coat, I decide to look over the can’s label. Surely it has a fume warning. I’m curious what kind of wicked chemical I just invited into my lungs.

Well, shit.

An old friend.

It was ETHANOL. The smell that I was sure must have Geneva Convention regulations attached to it was the same shit I used to invite into my body by the gallons for YEARS.

Gross.

Also, perspective.

In the context of a bar, I sniff whiskey and purr.

Out of a paint can I smell the same thing and worry for my health, my future child, and the neighbors.

Alcohol is poison. I promise. Next time you’re tempted, go to a hardware store, buy a primer and smell it. You’ll see. 

(Don’t drink it, please.)

Poison, dirty poison.

I woke up at 4:30 this morning (as I usually wake up at odd times when I drink) feeling like crap...I went in the kitchen and poured out an entire 5th of vodka and threw my cigs away. I don't want to cut back...I just want to stop! At least for a lonnnggg while! I want my beautiful life back! I'm a at-home drinker. I don't go to clubs or drink and drive, etc. I cook dinner, put my child to bed and then I drink...and drink and drink (lol)! I hate it now! It's not fun anymore.

2020-06-08 17:06:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gz85f3/did_your_spouse_ever_forgive_you/,Did your spouse ever forgive you?,"I've been sober for about 7 months now. 

I have done some spectacularly dumb things: got DUI, lost a job. I would disappear into my bedroom for days and drink because all I wanted to do was not feel (don't recommend. not a good idea). 

**Background:** Had twins and had terrible post-partum depression that wasn't diagnosed until a year in. The birth was traumatic (emergency C-section, went blind in one eye, kids were preemies). Sleep deprivation was insane: didn't sleep longer than 2 hours for five months. Their first year was the worst year of my life.

Those are not excuses for my behaviour, I made the choice to drink (just proving some background).

I have made some monumental f\*ck-ups and I still can't forgive myself, though I am working on it with help from a therapist. I'm gutted that I had a negative influence on my kids. I have become a much better parent sober. 

Almost everything in my life has gotten better sober but my relationship with my husband is terrible. The birth of the twins was the turning point but it's continued to get worse and worse. He is hostile to me 98% of the time. My kids notice: my son asked me why ""daddy is so mean to you"" and it makes me so sad. I'm scared to do anything that might piss him off. We sleep in separate beds but have a small house (800 sq/ft) so there's not really any place to be alone.

We have done some marriage counselling. It has been helpful at the time. We stopped. He says he doesn't want to go anymore.

I have tried a number of times to have a talk with him. He usually blows up and says he is waiting for me to fail and if we divorce he will take the kids. I feel like he is depressed and his anger could also be tied to that. 

He has said that it will take 2-3 years to forgive me–if I'm lucky. I live in one of the most expensive cities in the world, and currently don't have a job, so leaving would be next-to-impossible and I'm desperate to stay with my kids. 

Here's the thing: I don't want a divorce. I do want to work on our marriage. We had a strong marriage (or so I thought) before we had the twins. 

**TLDR: Husband says it will take 2-3 years to forgive me if I'm lucky. Our relationship is terrible.** 

Did your spouse ever forgive you? Can they ever forgive?",3

2020-06-08 15:44:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gz6def/2_weeks_sober/,2 Weeks Sober,"2 weeks ago what was supposed to be a relaxing evening on the Boston Pizza patio with some friends and a little bit of wine, instead turned into me downing back an entire bottles worth of wine in a half hours time and being loud and embarrassing. When I got home, I got into my car completely blacked out and decided it’d be a good idea to go for a drive. Miraculously, I made it home without getting into an accident or hitting anybody. 

I’m 21 years old and still live with my mom, who is a recovered alcoholic of 8 years sobriety. She has warned me about my abnormal behaviours when I drink, but up until 2 weeks ago I didn’t want to hear it or believe that I could have a problem. My mom knew I had been drinking that night, so when she noticed my car was gone, she flipped. I barely remember the fight, but I know it was a bad one. I had already been set off earlier on the patio from a conversation I had over text with a guy I was seeing. My drunken rage grew even stronger as my mom began yelling at me for something that she was completely right to yell at me for. I was so inebriated that I could barely even walk, or speak, let alone drive. 

I became violent towards her, and this happens very seldom when I drink, but I have been in fights before after drinking way too much alcohol. I was cussing at her and calling her out on some of the things that happened in my childhood. All of the resentments I held towards her boiled up and anger was spewing out of my drunk face. My brother had to hold me back from hitting her. I called a cab to go to my friends place, and my mom knowing how drunk I was begged me not to and told me instead to just go to bed, but of course I didn’t listen. When the cab arrived, I got in, and all of the sudden a part of me came to. I realized how unsafe it would be for me to get in a cab and go downtown being in the state I was in. I threw the door open and ran out back to my house. 

When I got back inside, I began to cry hysterically. My memory of the night is very, very vague. All of the sudden I was FaceTiming my friend and decided it’d be a good idea to hang up and FaceTime the guy I was seeing at the time. He’d never seen me like that, and I don’t think he could have imagined that part of me existing. He had no idea how I got when I drank. I don’t remember what was even said over the FaceTime call I had with him, but my friend remembers me calling her after to talk about it. I had told him some very personal things about what happened to me during my childhood, things that I definitely wouldn’t have told him if I was sober. I cussed him out. I don’t know what I said, but that was 2 weeks ago, and I haven’t spoken to him since. 

To describe how I felt waking up the next morning as painful would be a massive understatement. There are no words to describe the amount of shame, guilt, embarrassment, and horror I felt about the actions that I took that night. I cried all day thinking about how I acted towards my mother. I was embarrassed by how I acted at the patio and apologized to my friends, but they just told me they were used to my drunken behaviour. I was mortified by the things I told the guy I was seeing. I felt so vulnerable that he knew those things about me. It felt like somebody else shared my secrets for me. I felt dirty. I felt worthless. That is the lowest I think I have felt in my life, ever. 

2 weeks ago, I looked in the mirror the morning after one of the most chaotic nights of my life, and all that I could do was cry. I couldn’t recognize my own reflection. Even today when I look in the mirror I wonder how I let myself get to where I am now. I worry that I won’t be strong enough to stay sober. I have a habit of self-sabotage, and I am worried that my life is doomed to get worse, because I don’t know how to maintain anything that is good for myself. When I drank, it was a way to forget how I was feeling. I would drink to the point that I couldn’t feel anything. 

It’s been two weeks since I’ve had a drink, and some days have been good, but for the most part, it’s been really, really hard. If you’ve read this far, I really appreciate it. I just had to write this all down as a venting tool. I’m taking it one day at a time. I want to be better, and I want to be proud of myself. I want to recognize myself again. I want to feel like I’m living a life that’s worthy of staying sober to experience.",11

I've lurked on this site for about a month now as I've been questioning if my drinking has gotten out of control. A lot of the stories posted here about reckless things someone has done under the influence of alcohol are similar to mine. It's true for me too that 1 drink is usually not enough. 

For me, I drink to escape. I drink to get away from my self-doubts, shame (mostly from stuff I have done over the years when drunk), over-thinking and anxiety. But the next day, waking up hungover, I feel even worse about myself which often starts another cycle of drinking.

About a week ago, I had a revelation that most of the things I regret in my life, I did when I had been drinking and alcohol is clearly holding me back from leveling up into a better version of myself. 

Someone commented on here that there are two pains in life: 1) Pain of Discipline and 2) Pain of Regret. I've suffered a lot with regret but now it's time to give up alcohol and focus my time/energy that I spent drinking and recovering from drinking into more productive things: my relationship with my spouse, exercising, work, learning another language, meditating, stretching, eating well.

I found a lot of value in the program but for reasons not worth discussing I left it behind once I stopped actively destroying my life by chasing drugs that left me penniless and at odds with the law. Drinking didn’t bring me to my knees as quickly so even though I knew it was bad for me in many ways, I never saw a real reason to make myself stop; even though part of me suspected that it could one day become an issue.

Time has gone on and I have had periods of distraction from mind altering substances. The last few years however, my relationship with alcohol has gotten worse and worse. I don’t have a physical dependency but my tolerance is very high as a binge drinker. A normal person will throw up long before reaching the dangerous levels of drunk and stupid that I reach.

Last time I stopped was for two weeks, after a night of bad decisions that were dangerous and scary. I put myself in an unsafe situation and also managed to fall while in my bathroom, break my towel rack, bruise my back, and then had to make sense of it the next day without a memory to help me. These were minor consequences compared to what could have happened that night.

Then after those two dry weeks I ended up at an event that included drinking. That time went ok, probably because I was hyper cautious. The next few times as well.

Things are opening back up everywhere, but due to having some high risk family members and COVID still on the rise in my state, I'm continuing to exercise high caution and only really leaving the house for groceries.

Which means it's still zoom meetings or no meetings for me. When my home group disbanded from meatspace in the second week of March I was totally on board with virtual meetings and in fact even going to meetings I wouldn't normally go to in person. But after doing that for a while, I have come to realize it doesn't hit the same at all. No fellowship, no chatting with people before or after the meeting one on one to catch up, people (myself included) find it too easy to look at something else on their phone or the internet, stuff we'd never do in an in-person meeting.

So I've mostly stopped. I hit up my home group maybe every other week, but that's about it. And naturally, without attending meetings, I've been slacking on the prayer and meditation because I'm not bearing witness to the miracles step 11 brings (lol). I've been sober over six years so I'm not too worried about falling off the wagon. I just wish I felt more motivated to plug into the community virtually.

Anyone else going through something similar? Tips for getting back to the meetings, engaging fully, and having fun? I am not over AA at all, I'm just definitely over Zoom meetings.",2

My dad suffered from it, and it almost killed him and almost destroyed his marriage and our family. I drank an entire bottle of wine last night, after consistently saying to myself, I don't have a problem, I'm not like my Dad—I don't drink a bottle a day, or finish a 24-pack of beer, or polish off a fifth of whiskey. First it was just a glass. Then two. Then half a bottle. Then I started buying liquor to make cocktails. And then I drank the whole bottle. And I realized I'm headed down the same road. I'm scared, ashamed, tired. My body hurts, I feel sick constantly, I've gained weight. I am dreading that feeling that comes around every day at the same time, ""one more hour and you can have a glass. You deserve it, it's been so stressful. You're so anxious."" I've started to adjust my life around drinking. I've hidden it from the people I love, cancelled plans so I could drink, shown up drunk on their doorstep and hoped they couldn't tell (but I'm sure they could). I think about it all the time.

We've had several break downs and big claims that we were done. The longest stretch was like five days... We've been miserable, tired and sick. I've sat up nights with my children trying to comfort them from nightmares or fevers but been to dizzy to actually help. I'd fall asleep on the couch in the mornings after offering pop tarts and cereal bars for breakfast. The only thing that would wake me was the shrill Elmo's World song at the end of sesame street episodes.

I broke my own rules and tattooed people while I was drinking, a moral line I thought I would never break. I've broken down sobbing and then when the kids were asleep the next day, drink again.

But last night, my husband and I actually admitted we were alcoholics. Last night at 1 am we took our last drink.

I hear the news of a local joint owned by a gay lady couple. Very neat! It's Southern and Asian fusion, two of my favorites. Plus I can order a lasagna made with fresh noodles for later. Nice!

I order up dinner and a lasagna for later. I get a call. ""Hey, this is Steve from Jenny's, our delivery driver had an emergency and can't deliver, can you pick it up?""

""Afraid not.""

""Me, too. I'm biking, it'd be about 25 minutes of biking.""

""Ha, I appreciate your enthusiasm. I'm biking too. No can do. I'll order again tomorrow. It happens.""

""Okay, thank you for understanding. I'll make sure you get some _goodies_ tomorrow.""

""Aww, thank you.""

Some goodies! Ooh, I can't wait. I'm already salivating at the menu, I can't wait to try something unexpected from them.

Next day, I order again. Same order. Same lasagna. No problems here. A text comes in.

""Hey! This is the driver with Jenny's! We're super sorry about yesterday and we're throwing in a free bottle of Prosecco!"" 

""Whoa, hey there, thank you! I don't drink, could you please take it out so it doesn't go to waste?""

No response. Minutes pass.

""Oh hey, sorry about the trouble, the order is at your door.""

Open my door, and chilling atop my frozen lasagna is a bottle I had long renounced. Over a year after I've stopped drinking, poured out all the alcohol and made it contraband in my house, there it sits. I bring it in. 

Into the fridge. I'm still attached. It was nice. It was valuable. It was a kind gesture. I don't know what I'm going to do. Lasagna in the freezer. Hot food ready to be eaten. I take my meal. It's delicious.

Hours later, it's time to rummage through the fridge and ultimately decide on nothing. Except this time, there the bottle stares at me. ""Well, I can save it for a friend."" I think. The fridge closes. No midnight snack tonight. 

Next day, the bottle is looking at me. I can't keep it. I can't give it to another with a good conscious. I refuse to enable somebody else's drinking anymore. I'm done with that. Far too long I have provided alcohol to others.

The bottle opens. The scent floods my nostrils. ""Just a sip?"" I think. It smells sweet, delicious, _refined_. They had named the label by name, it must be special in some way. Am I really to waste this? I don't know, maybe I can just try a little...

The bottle turns upside down into the sink. The scent is overpowering. I can still drink it! I watch it as it pours. Guilt and pain flood my body for wasting something that was given to me. There's still time to drink, there's still time to drink...

And then there isn't. It's all empty now. The sink smells of it. I rinse it and the bottle, placed neatly in recycling now. I take a breath, light a stick of incense, and have some tea to relax. Even this long after quitting drinking, the alcoholism is still there. One day at a time*

In Japan I was drinking copious amounts almost every day. Before japan I was in an abusive relationship and was drinking and getting emotionally abused almost every day. I would drink quickly, if I was out with friends I was always the first to finish my drink and of course stay out the latest or at the very least stop at a convenience store at 4am for one more high ball. 

Now I’m living in my parents house again in my late 20s. 

For some reason I can’t drink anymore. For the first week or so I was consciously making the effort not to, as I remembered the shame of when I got drunk around my parents before. Then it was my birthday and I was so excited to drink again. But I found myself drinking slowly, unable to ignore the taste, and barely getting a buzz at all. And the next day the hangover was a wakeup call that I’d spent almost 10 years of my life waking up feeling like that. 

I’ve drank a few more times but each time just isn’t very fun and leads to hangovers. So I’m done. 
I’m glad to have more time to focus on other things rather than drinking and to not be ruining my body and brain anymore. I’m happy to no longer enjoy or depend on alcohol.

But the positive effects really aren’t all that great...I still wake up every morning with a sense of dread and guilt. I still struggle to complete my daily tasks. I still don’t have many friends. I still feel like a failure. I stay in bed all day often. I’m binge eating again recently. I’m single and will be for the foreseeable future due to trauma. 

I have a therapist and I’m trying to get onto a good psychiatric medicine as well, I’ve struggled with mental illness my whole life so I guess I should’ve realized that quitting drinking wouldn’t fix everything. But I read posts from other sober people on here and I feel really down. 

I used to be able to blame my bad feelings or bad decisions on alcohol but now it’s just 100% me and I hate it. I want to wake up and really appreciate the lack of hangover but I just always wake up feeling like I want the day to be over already.",3

My family does an annual 4th of July trip to a beautiful lake. It is my happy place. I feel more relaxed and one with nature there than anywhere else. I love it there. I will be headed up there in a few weeks. 

My mom just called to talk about the trip and says, “I ordered you 18 bottles of Hess and then 6 of something else.” 

For me. 

18+ bottles. For me. 

I’m going to be there 10 days. 

And this might be the strongest “I am an alcoholic” moment I have had yet. Because my mother (who, I should mention, is also an alcoholic) thinks that her daughter needs 18 bottles - and THEN some - of wine to make it through 10 days. 

So I stammered a, “Well, um, thank you. And I appreciate you doing that, but I’m also sorry you did because I’m not drinking.”

“Oh, ok. Do you think you’ll really still not be drinking by then?”

Ouch. Fair, but still. Ouch. 

“Yes, I still won’t be drinking then.”

“Ok, good for you. Let me see if I can cancel it.”

And when I say sober I mean not a lick of alcohol. I was a heavy, heavy binge drinker for many many years. Ultimately, it was the stomach problems that made me stop. I had alcohol induced gastritis that was so painful I called the paramedics twice. My doctor prescribed medication for my stomach and that with no more alcohol, I have lost 25 lbs. I’m currently at 120lbs which is actually normal for me but I didn’t get there healthily. I feel weak. Sick. And like things keep getting worse. My stomach IS getting better for sure but I feel that my anxiety has gotten worse and everything that I didn’t feel before-oh boy I feel now. If it’s emotional, it’s amplified, if it’s a physical pain-it’s amplified. I think that everything I feel is something really seriously wrong yet I was reminded that it’s a temporary state and that the first month for a heavy drinker can be harder-not easier. I started getting migraines and I sincerely hope those are temporary too.  I have also felt kind of “out of my body” at times and feel “numb”. I’m sticking with this. I have to remind myself that I’m healing and that this is temporary and to take care of myself and speak to the doctor whenever I have concerns-which I do. It’s difficult though, when I see people feeling so much better after a week, two weeks, etc. So why do I feel so awful after 41 days??

Of course staying sober is #1 & without it everything else falls apart.

It was super random. One day I went to a dinner with some very influential friends and it was a wine dinner. I resisted for a while then drank. Even that night I was like wow, I can drink and not go on a binge spree.

Update : now that roommate is awake. He’s on day one today.  Last attempt he did 9 month.

Update 2: she peed her self and slept on the couch.

Edit : too everyone going insane about him bringing a drunk girl home. They came to the house to DRINK MORE like alcoholics do. Not with the intention to have sex. I’m sorry but everyone is an adult and I was not at the bar to tell grown adults how to act under the influence of alcohol.  No, they didn’t have sex. She slept on the couch. But In her drinking slander wanted to go to his place. The last thing she remembers is thinking she was going home. But when you are black out you don’t remember asking to come over. But he had zero intention of sleeping with her. Also, if the guy is equally as drunk when does it cross the line as mutual? He took her to the couch.  There was no rape.  Black out drunk doesn’t mean sloppy falling over drunk always. You can still be functional and talk.  Why is everyone thinking she was like crawling or passed out? Black out is not passed out. Thought you drinkers would know that.  And have I had a discussion with him. Yes. He wants to try sobriety out again.  Yes, I did laugh at the situation because it is ridiculous.

I found this subreddit and it's been so helpful in this short amount of time and I feel hopeful this time. I've been here before and after a week I tell myself I'm not an alcoholic because I went a week without it so I start drinking again. 

I can't keep looking this man in the face and telling him the same line. This is it. I am done. I have to be done or I lose my family.

Well shit. 

Rewind three weeks ago. I spotted the perfect job opening. Close to home, permanent role, great pay... And I was more than qualified. I could **nail** this job. 

My current (self employed) work has slowed right down thanks to covid, and I've got my first kid due in a matter of months. This new job would relieve a lot of all that pressure in an instant. 

My CV and cover letter were prepared and sent, and I nervously but optimistically waited for the call to come in for a face-to-face interview. I felt like they'd easily see I was the perfect fit.

But they didn't. At all. So this rejection email today felt like a horse hoof kicked into my stomach. 

**Old me** would have welcomed that fog of depression like an old friend. I would have cracked open wine, felt sorry for myself, and drank until the looming fear & the wounded pride could be temporarily forgotten.

**New me** tried a different approach. I dragged myself to the gym and forced myself to get the endorphins and sweat going. I decided to think about my situation in a constructive way rather than as a victim.

And now I paused and reframed it, my CV was actually looking... a bit tired. I could really tidy that right up with a slick new design. And there's now time to refresh my professional certifications to stand out. And if those first guys didn't want to hire me, then to hell with them. I'll find an employer who values what I can bring. 

**So that's how it works.** Sobriety doesn't magically fix things and make stuff wonderful on its own. But instead of running away from my problem, getting drunk, and feeling miserable about life, I had the sober opportunity to exercise, think clearly, and get a game plan underway to force better opportunities to cross my future path.

I can now see how these kinds of positive thoughts and actions add up over time to build a better quality life.

How have you reframed a negative situation now you're not drinking?

I thought myself lucky to get moved into a job with better pay and more responsibility. Over the rest of 2019 though, I realized I was being handed a job that was really the job of 2-3 people, and the already long hours I worked was not going to cover it. In addition to that, I inherited a group of workers to supervise who were extremely apathetic and really did not want to listen to anything I had to say. I've tried to be a boss that is open to suggestion and working together, but they really seem like they don't care and just want to find a way to move to other positions in the company. My answer to all this was, of course, to drink it away. Why not? I now had even more funds to buy more drink.

Then, of course, lockdown hit. It was the perfect excuse to be getting smashed every night after work. No commute, no need to hide alcohol on my breath from the night before. The stress of trying to manage my team remotely as well as do work that was still tied to our office has taken its toll. 7 day work weeks are now pretty typical. Drinking now feels like a necessity in order to quell anxiety and a fear that I am not at all good at my job. While I have tried the last few weeks to pull back and cut down, the truth is I see my job as a cocoon that allows me to fund my habit. My partner works and we both agree we can live on one salary for a while.  I started online therapy and it's helping me work through some of the anxiety as well as confront the problems I have with alcohol.

Last week I had a few days off that I told my boss I needed, despite all the craziness going on with protests. I retreated with my partner to a cabin by a large lake where we tried to just disconnect. No email, no gchat, nothing. The first two days were pretty heavy with drinking, but by day three I was feeling more relaxed and by the final day yesterday, I didn't even want to drink. I realize that my job and drinking are intertwined, and I need to get out. I am not sure when I can do that, but I know I will feel much more confident about leaving without alcohol as a crutch to keep me tied to the paycheck.",2
2020-06-08 07:32:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gyxnai/super_fatigued/,Super fatigued :(,"Hey everyone. It's been a month since I've started serious efforts to cut down on my drinking. I'm struggling with being completely sober, but having only drank only four times in the last five weeks is a step up from where I was before, at least.

Anyway, I'm really fatigued. Like all the time. It sucks. I don't have the energy I'd like to have. If I give it my all at work, I've got nothing left over when I get home. I've been enjoying playing bass since I've cut down and some days it's just too dang heavy for me. The other day, I was holding a tray of food and it hurt my shoulders to do so. My feet and legs ache after spending a few hours a day at work standing. When I'm done with work, all I want to do is lay down- I hardly even have the energy to sit up.

If I lay down for a bit and rest, after two or three hours, I'll feel a bit better. I do also feel better today than I did yesterday, but you can imagine this level of fatigue is just sort of getting in the way of my life.

Has anyone else experienced fatigue this bad? I always get 7 or 8 hours of sleep during the week. I suppose I should be putting in a little more effort to make sure I get enough vitamins...",3

Have commented to provide to support to others, but have not posted.  I am not an AA person for a lot of reasons, but I also feel it is important to own your story and put it out there for it to be real.  I wanted to get to 2 weeks before posting because that would tell me I am committed this time as I have had many attempts to only go back to do Day 1 after a few days.  And there is nothing wrong with that.  We all stumble, but for me, getting to two weeks is indicative that I am in this fight.

My relationship with alcohol socially has been nothing but healthy and normal.  I have not gotten drunk in public in maybe 15 years.  Alcohol is a fun, social lubricant sidekick and good friend when out socially.  In fact, there are many times when others are having a drink, I won't have one because I don't want one.

My issues are home alone.  It is there where alcohol is not my friend at all.  I drink in excess far more than I want.  Not into hard liquor or drinking most beers in excess because hard liquor brings nasty dehydration and hangovers and most beers just make me feel bloated and never get me drunk.  Introduce high test craft beers 10 or so years ago.  And those are my go-to when alone.  And for those who drink those, they are freaking expensive.  I have been drinking 4-5 of those high test beers for 5 nights a week for about 10 years.

I never get hangovers.  When I don't drink for a period of time, I never have gotten any withdrawals.  I don't have a wreckage of broken relationships scattered along the way.  I have not thrown up because of drinking since college (many, many years ago).  I do not have any outwardly physical impacts from my drinking other than being more overweight than I would like.  Not morbidly fat, but more fat packed on than should be healthy.  But, other than that, no abdominal pains or anything.

What alcohol in private has brought me is just despair.  Frantically checking all my texts the day after to see what stupid crap I said and what damage control I would need to do.  I don't drunk text every time, but enough to where I need to check.  I can afford it, but the amount of money wasted on this stuff is just sad particularly for someone who will debate whether to spend $15 on a steak is worth the money.  

I live alone so I don't have to hide the alcohol, but I have found that I need to go to about 3-4 different places to buy it.  And even then the store clerks recognize me.  The ones I buy come as singles and I happened to have a found a 4 pack carrier in the store.  When I brought it up to the counter the woman said ""Oh, they're finally giving it to you in a 4 pack case now?""  After buying it, I sat outside in the car for awhile and felt like a degenerate loser.  Despite my best efforts to hide my drinking habits from perfect strangers in a store, they know me enough to know what I buy. Uggh.  That was the last day I have drank this time.

So two weeks in I am scared.  Because not drinking has been too easy this time.  As mentioned, I never have had withdrawals and none this time either.  I have been out socially with people drinking and despite that always being a safe no problem place without alcohol, no temptation to drink even with peer pressure to do so.  I drive by the liquor stores where I know my 4 little high test craft brews are sitting on the shelf waiting for me to bring them home, and I don't even give it much thought as I pass by them.

I am not sure if I am in a ""I will never drink again"" place.  It is undeniable I have put my liver through hell the past 10 or so years.  I need and want to give some time to heal.  For now, I have set a 6 month goal.  Lose some weight.  Save a ton of money.  And not drink socially or privately.  Set up a doc appointment for full check up in 6 months and see where my insides are at and evaluate it then.

All that said, I have a problem with alcohol.  Definitions can vary, and I am fine with it, if I am an alcoholic.  For awhile, I thought well if I am, I am one of the functioning ones until some sage person told me .... well you are until you aren't.  It would shock everyone I know if they knew I had this struggle.  And that makes it so hard as well.  I have always found it sad that if this behavior kills me, I would never have even had an intervention to save me.  Kinda sucks knowing I have a problem that is destroying me and no one else knows it.   I would love to some day share a pint with friends again.  But, I can't do that if that means I go back to drinking in private the way I have.

Sorry for the long post.  If you're still reading thank you.  But, also thank you to all on here.  Your stumbles and successes are an inspiration to me and so many in this fight.  Your horror stories are so so sad to hear, and I feel so badly for you. But, they can be a lesson for so many.  Your courage, candor, and accountability for your experiences are refreshing.  Alcohol abuse and addiction is undefeated when fighting someone who won't fight back.  I need to spend the next few months reflecting on what my fight is and if I can have a healthy relationship with alcohol again one day.  That answer may be a resounding no ... and if it is I have to accept that and put it behind me.

If you are similar to me and want to chat, please let me know.  Support is always huge.  I like providing it when I can as much as receiving it when I need it.

Im 36, been drinking from the age of 14. Alcohol has put me in some bad situations over the years, from trouble with the law to my relationships, from my work life to depression. Making some bad and regrettable decisions, hurting not only myself but the loved ones around me. I carried the guilt of this for years which caused me to keep on drinking. 

I'm at a stage now that I'm functioning, running my own buisness the last two years and life seems good, but it's still effecting my relationships, and I feel like I've got a fog in my brain that if was lifted I'd be much happier and much more productive in my work and my relationships. 

I've been following one year no beer for a while now, never really had the money to sign up so just read the success storys, I love hearing how people feel much happier and clearer, no guilt no shame and no brain fog. I saw a guy mention this support group so I said I'd give it a go and try get free of alcohol for a while and see how I feel.

I have been sober from alcohol just over 50 days and marijuana for just over 40, I quit toking when I started outpatient treatment. Alcohol had been making me miserable, daily drinking of at least a pint or more of whiskey + some beers and what not. I could not make it past five days sober on my own and getting  professional help was one of the best decisions I have ever made. I am genuinely the happiest I’ve been in a while and am so grateful for the skills and knowledge I’ve gotten out of treatment. My desire to drink has become practically non-existent and with continued AA meetings, working with a sponsor, and use of my support network I am cautiously optimistic and looking forward to a future free of alcohol! 

I had also been a daily pot smoker, started in high school just after having my first drink and was your typical “stoner kid” throughout high school and college. When I started college I really took a liking to alcohol and it quickly became my drug of choice. As I got older my drinking progressed steadily whereas my pot use declined. I became relatively disinterested in pot as my drinking got severe, I would smoke daily still, maybe a pinchy at night to help with sleep, occasional social smoking, and eventually I would smoke maybe once a week as weed just wasn’t my thing and drinking 1-2 pints of whiskey nightly was. 

When I tried to quit drinking on my own I certainly tried substituting pot and my use went up considerably, probably 3-4 bowls a day. This was no whiskey though and when the weekend came around I would always relapse, I could only make it 3-5 days without booze max. As mentioned I finally got professional help and that’s currently where I’m at. 

Quitting smoking when I started treatment was a non-issue, pot has not manifested itself the way alcohol had in my life. Initially I planned to resume smoking immediately after treatment. After really embracing treatment and finding genuine happiness and empowerment living this sober lifestyle I think I will continue not smoking some time after treatment. I am committed to never drinking again as it was ruining my life and I am really enjoying myself free from alcohol, but I would like to smoke weed again someday. Weed has never come close to affecting my life the way alcohol did, I liken it to how coffee has affected my life. Yes, there are some negative health consequences associated with smoking but that I am willing to except, I am not trying to be perfect here! 

I personally know multiple people who have quit drinking and smoke pot. I have two family members who have been sober (from alcohol) for over 20 years and lead a healthy and happy life while smoking pot. I do not associate getting high with getting drunk, getting high is not a relapse trigger for me. My councilor has been very frank on the matter of pot use in group, “you can’t smoke pot and be sober. If you smoke pot you are not in recovery” and even quoted Notorious BIG “If you don’t know, now you know” and I am having a hard time with that concept. I don’t really want to bring this up to group as this is a pretty settled argument there. I will bring this up with my sponsor, but I just met him for the first time in person on Saturday and honestly am a little apprehensive to bring this up before really getting to know him. 

So, I am bringing it up here! I would love to get your feedback and opinions on this matter, especially those who can relate or have experience with pot in recovery / pot after quitting drinking. 

Thank you for taking the time to read through this!!",6

I relate more here so I just wanted to see if anyone can offer any insight from their own experience. I’m a hardcore alcoholic with a year off the bottle and doing well but recently I think I’ve fallen into old addictive/obsessive habits trying to lose weight (very restricted eating and obsessed with the results even though I know it’s not healthy). Sorry if this isn’t allowed here and I understand if it’s taken down. I just think it relates to my alcoholism and is some kind of substitute all of a sudden right after I hit a full year without booze.,7

I'm sure this information is out there on the subreddit but in the state I'm in I just want some direct answers to my questions. 

Long story short, I quit alcohol on Friday morning, seemingly on a whim. I was on my way at 7AM to the earliest opening gas station to pick up alcohol and just turned back. Had to pull into a mall and cry in my car for about 2 hours about how I've ruined and am ruining my life with this shit. Since then I've been a mess. A crying and anxious mess, but a mess. 

I understand where I am. Yes, I should have known better.  I know what I should be doing (not fucking drinking). I just need help with some practical things and to vent a little. 

1. I finally managed to get the weekend alone with my roomies on a trip to clean my room. Just to vent I counted 48 empty 750ml bottles. That's just since the first week of March when I was sent to work from home due to covid. Now, alongside the copious amounts of fast food wrappers, mixers for drinks and other garbage, I have SIXTEEN bags of trash. Of course when I checked the dumpster, it's full to the brim. Is there any way for me to get rid of this? I've done my best to reduce the clink by wrapping the bottles in newspaper and other trash, but they still do. How do I get rid of SIXTEEN bags of trash? The bottles were easier to hide (Stacked in my closet in two suitcases) than them in trash bags. If anyone comes into my room they will see them. This thought has had me shaking all day. I'm considering making trips in my car tomorrow but people will see me carrying several bags of trash in many trips (it's an apartment complex). I just don't know what to do. 

2. How can I sleep. I've tried antihistamines, teas, everything...I used to drink myself to sleep at night. Now I'm fucking up in another way by not falling asleep till 5 and waking up at 9. 

3. How do you feel pleasure? I feel so dead inside. I'm ""pleasantly happy"" in a way, but I just feel dead. Without alcohol I realize how shitty the TV I watch is, how slow time passes, how many bad people I have in my life, how much time I waste. I just feel like I'm not looking forward to anything. I used to look forward to tonight's drinking session. Now all I have is work the next day. Even my hobbies just aren't fun anymore without a buzz? Did I destroy my brain? Any advice is appreciated. 

4. To the people who obviously suspected things. Is it good or bad to tell them? I know my Mother has suspected I've had a problem for a long time, but we've never discussed it except for a judgy comment here or there (she hasn't drank alcohol since trying it in her teens and thinks it's DISGUSTING on principle). 

In looking at this, this post is embarassing and I'm sorry for wasting your time. Admittedly it felt good to get this off my chest. I just can't stop crying and wishing I could turn back time. I've fucked up so much already for no real reason. I don't have any big trauma in my life or a ""reason"" to drink. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. It just hurts so much to know nobody did this to me, that I did it to MYSELF. 

Anyway, if you read, thanks. I like to imagine somebody out there heard what I have to say.",15

Now while her dad has been for the most part a functioning alcoholic, I can easily tell from what my friend says and how she says it that things have been going from bad to worse and at some point i fear something might happen. Currently the relationship as I understand it is that her dad is not to a point where there is physical violence, however there is plenty of screaming and arguing that seems to be getting worse. she has tried many times to get him to quit, AA meeting pamphlet, family interventions (sort of, its important to mention that part of the problem is her fathers family are unfortunately full of enablers) and he has quit multiple times for weeks only to relapse. I pride myself in getting down and dirty to really know and understand any issue a friend presents to me so that I can view the problem from all possible angles and give the best possible advice and alcoholism is something I have no experience in and cannot relate to. I've even tried in the past to get addicted to alcohol to better understand what its like however I don't have the genetic disposition for it to really happen.

And most of all I'm loving the clarity about my own emotions. I didn't realize just how much of my feelings I was drowning with booze. It's not all pleasant—yesterday I was just bored out of my mind, grumpy and frustrated.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hi, SD Family!

As some of you know, I use part of my farm as an unofficial sanctuary for unwanted/injured farm animals. It all happened accidentally, but it's become a regular thing here. Several months ago, I took in a badly wounded duck. She was in rough shape, but after a few weeks in Duck Hospital (an old chicken coop I repurposed for her), she healed pretty well.

I call her The Pirate because she has one eye and one working leg, and because she is a duck and cannot be offended by this name. She's one that will be with me and not move on to a new home. She now lives happily with other ducks, but she has a hard time entering the pool by herself. I made a little ramp for her, but she refuses to use it.

So day after day I've watched The Pirate try to get in this pool by herself. Feeling sorry for her, I end up picking her up and putting her in. Well, guess what...today she got in the pool all by herself! She seemed both thrilled and surprised and kept going in and out. I was so happy to see it because this duck has just never given up.

I tell you this story because The Pirate reminded me of me- of us- because she could have given up at any point. But she kept trying even when she wasn't successful. And it finally paid off.

So for any of us that sometimes feel like giving up, I encourage you to keep going. We can do this. We *are* doing this. Have a wonderful Monday and I will not drink with you today!",109

2020-06-07 21:59:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gypq0o/acts_of_kindness_aok_monday_showing_up/,Acts of Kindness (AoK) Monday: Showing Up,"Hi everyone!
Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we share about AoK we’ve experienced over the past week. It can be AoK to ourselves, to others, to animals, or to the environment we live in. It can be AoK which we've performed, received, observed, or heard about. Any AoK which has touched us is fair game.

The AoK I’ve participated in this week aren’t huge, and they’re pretty much just things that are part of being in mutually supportive relationships with people. But in thinking about them I’m struck by how my sobriety allows me to show up for life and to be there for other people. I cared about other people before I got sober, but I didn’t necessarily show up for them, I was pretty wrapped up in myself.

On Wednesday I had plans to drive a friend to Walmart so he could pick up some big, bulky stuff that he needed. He’s an essential worker and had already taken the afternoon off so we could go during the day because our city has had a curfew, but when we were looking up stores to decide which one to go to we realized that all of the stores in the city and the surrounding suburbs were closed that day due to safety concerns. 

He suggested that we reschedule, but I didn’t have anything else pressing to do, and I know that it’s difficult for him to get time off right now, so I thought that it made sense to just drive to a suburb further out and get it taken care of. Which we did. It gave us a chance to hang out and talk, which did me the world of good, and I got to be there for a friend.

On Fridays my sponsor has been hosting an AA meeting on Zoom for all of the women in our extended sponsorship network. My sponsor had a death in the family earlier in the week, and her sponsor sent out a text on Friday morning asking if someone else would be able to host the meeting. I have a Zoom account and am currently hosting another AA meeting. I don’t particularly like chairing Zoom meetings because I don’t particularly like Zoom, but it's not always about what I *feel* like doing, so I stepped up and volunteered to set a meeting up for us. There’s about 18 women who attend the meeting regularly, and several of them expressed that they were grateful the meeting was still happening, but I did it for my sponsor more than I did it for them. She shows up for me. It was nice to be able to show up for her.

Yesterday I heard that a woman I know was recently diagnosed with cancer and is in the hospital getting chemotherapy. Today I got in touch with one of her friends to ask what I could do to offer support, and we’re going to talk tomorrow about what her needs will be when she gets out of the hospital this week and how we can support her. 

That is something that I never in a million years would have thought about doing before I got sober, but it makes sense now. I show up for other people, because I know that other people will show up for me. I am present in my life, and I am part of something that is bigger than myself. And that feels good. Showing up feels better than checking out.

That’s it for me for this week, sobernauts. How about everyone else, any AoK that you’d like to share?",24

I stopped quite suddenly and with no real planning as my wife tripped, fell downstairs and hit her head after a few glasses of wine and it gave us a real shock, she was rushed to hospital and still has concussion. We both decided it was a wake-up call.

I knew I was drinking too much or rather too often, 4-5 beers or a bottle of wine 4ish nights a week.

So I don't really know how long I'm stopping for, I have a vague notion I'll give it 3 months and see how I feel after that, if nothing else the break will do me good. A couple of years ago I did 25 days and it was OK but I didn't really notice any benefits, apart from the lack of hangovers.

This time in general I'm finding it OK but I am not sure what to do with the ""extra"" time I have. Guess I'm a little lost without my drug. I'm certainly eating more and this will probably hamper the weight-loss I'm hoping for (I'd like to loose about 30lbs).

Besides a relationship or maybe a dozen (not all romantic) I never lost anything major.

He eventually quit drinking, but the phrase wasn't related to that (and predated it by a decade). 

I think that's what stuck with me most. I have been living my life like it is ""before the accident"" and you can't imagine the difference. Yeah, there is still some darkness, there is still heat, but darkness is necessary for that light, and that light only comes from heat. 

Not out of fear though. Calculated risk taking, but the calculator isn't drunk. Anyway, hopefully it makes as much sense to somebody else as it does to me.",10

The past week or so has been a little different. The nice warm weather has been causing me to remember ice cold beer lol. 

I have the desire to crack open a cold drink. I’ve also been having thoughts like “what’s the point of continuing to not drink?” Alcohol has negatively impacted my life. I need to not drink because it’s not worth the cons or problems.

I don’t feel like I’m going to break today and run to the store and get some. I just feel like I’m at a cross road of telling myself to give in. I wrote this because I feel like it will motivate me to keep going on sobriety. It kind of has but I’m hoping for the cravings to stop. I don’t want to end up down a path of self destruction. 

Sometimes I get depressed or tired and get negative. I start to tell myself these are the same feelings I felt when I was drinking. That’s why I drank. For an escape or for fun. Like woo I’m wasted and wreck less lol. I felt like I was in control for once but in reality I’m really not when drunk. I haven’t been sleeping well either.

I ended up stumbling, nearly blackout drunk before passing out in my bed.

Over the last 11 months, I’ve put together some good weeks and fallen back into some bad weeks. I’ve tried beer only. I’ve tried “I get 12 beers to last the week - better spread them out” (ha that lasted all of four days before cheating on that one). I’ve tried tapering off, only to never actually do the tapering part.

Hell I’ve even tried “only” buying a pint of whiskey and congratulating myself that that’s “all” I drank that night.

I’ve justified my drinking, I’ve promised myself countless times that I would “quit tomorrow”, only to find myself in the same chair pouring the same glass of whiskey over and over again.

I’ve spent months on end, dragging myself out of bed for work, spending the better part of each day in various stages of withdrawal, only to go quiet the anxiety and pain by doing it all over again.

My conscious mind knows that alcohol won’t truly quiet the pain, only delay it. It won’t stem the anxiety, only increase it.

My last drink was Wednesday. I took Thursday and Friday off work. Thursday was rough. I saw my doctor Friday morning for a physical and blood work and told him I am quitting. Still waiting on blood work, but outside of a slightly elevated pulse, everything looks fine. I will see him again in 4 weeks.

I’ve tried this before, but this time I will do this. I have a plan. I have my family’s support. I will create a larger support network and find more external means of accountability.

I will do this for my loving fiancé, who I have disappointed too many times. I will do this for her three children, who are at the ages where they will forever remember my inconsistent actions, my slurred speech, and my smelling of whiskey when I kiss them before bed. I will do this for my 2 year old daughter because she deserves to never remember me like that and because she deserves to have her dad alive and there for her when she is 16, and 21, and forever 29.

Most importantly, I will do this for me. I deserve a long life. I deserve clarity. I deserve self-love.

We walked and then played along and in the water. I found a stick and threw it. I assumed that she would glance at it with disinterest and without pause, as is her usual choice. Instead, she ran to fetch it. We ended up playing in the water together for a couple of hours. Her stick being thrown again and again. It filled my heart to have that experience with her, and to see her so full of joy.

We walked back into our home dirty, wet and content. I gave her a bath and then turned on the fireplace for her. It isn't cold, but I know she'd love to slumber near it. She's snoring as I type this.

As I was briskly drying her, my phone insistently dinged with texts.

Looking at the screen, my eyes tried to make sense of the words that were across it. I stared blankly, as if they didn't really belong. They couldn't.

Someone that I knew, who had such a beautiful soul, passed away yesterday. I had met her in treatment. It was her 11th time there. She had stayed sober for a bit, then had went back out.

I received a text from my sister, that said, ""Thank you for fighting. I can't lose you."" It caught me by surprise. We don't talk like that...

Although my heart feels heavy, I feel thankful... Thankful  for my sobriety. Thankful to have felt the chill in the air, as the sand gave way under my toes in the water, playing with my girl. Thankful for the chance to enjoy the littlest of things an early morning brings.

I am a HUGE overthinker, and I think I'm probably a bit of a novelty addict, so I'm always planning the next thing, the next career direction (I've had more jobs than I can count, and my resume is a pile of flaky shit), the next getaway (I've lived in more houses than I have years in my life and I'm mid-30s, and traveling fills that need to change scenery), the next learning journey, etc.

Being newly sober has been difficult, but I will say that this past week was the best I've felt since I stopped drinking, and finally have some joy, some true emotion, and some clarity of the mind back. But I'm constantly thinking, 'Right, I'm sober now, what am I going to do with my life?'. I have to keep reminding myself that I should probably just hold on... let everything settle, neurologically, physically, otherwise, before I start making huge sweeping life changes.

I’ve been feeling inspired recently to post my story, because I think that alcohol has a hold of many people who don’t realize it. I never hit rock bottom. That’s not to say that I didn’t have my fair share of poor decisions, and deep pain that stem from them, but I never got arrested, fired, or wound up in the hospital. 

I quit because I went on an anti-inflammatory diet and wasn’t supposed to have alcohol. I figured I could do it temporarily. Once the alcohol was out of my life I realized how much I wanted it to be a part of my life. I didn’t want to give up drinking. I loved how it tasted, how it made me feel, etc. I couldn’t imagine it not being a part of my life. I wanted it sooooo bad - and that’s what scared me. I realized I was more addicted than I cared to admit, so I set the goal of not drinking for one year. It was really hard, with everyone but my boyfriend questioning my decision. Even my grandpa kept pushing alcohol on me. “It’s not like you’re an alcoholic” he told me. But if I had kept going on with my nightly glass of wine and heavy weekend drinking, who knows where I could have ended up.

Now that I look back, almost 2 years later, I realize that I was living for alcohol. I gave it full reign over my life no matter the decisions I made while on it or consequences of those decisions. I’m so thankful I quit while I still could. About a year ago I had a few drinks while out with friends, and I couldn’t stand the way it made me feel anymore. It was like a sudden switch was flipped - not drinking isn’t hard anymore, but it took a long, hard road to get here. And only now being sober am I able to realize I was indeed an alcoholic.",195

So I've been working through the pandemic. I'm an essential healthcare worker, though not a frontliner. The last few months have been stressful and I've been burned out. A week or two ago, I added a breakup into the mix, and moving to a new state. With so much going on, I thought I could ""treat myself"" to a couple glasses of wine. And the first couple nights, that's all it was. But after 2 days of that, it turned into a bottle a night, then more and more. 


Last night I had a very honest and raw conversation with a close friend about depression/anxiety, coping mechanisms, etc. and I made the decision to start over and refocus on my mental health in a positive fashion. I actually had already been taking the right steps of therapy and medication, but for some reason chose drinking anyway. Now I'm hungover and feeling very angry with myself for throwing away 400+ days (badge reset incoming!!). I can't undo the relapse so I'm trying to take it easy on myself. Just wanted someone to commiserate with. 


Hope everyone is doing well and hanging in there through coronavirus and civil unrest!! My heart goes out to those affected by either. It's very hot where I am, I'm going to make today an ice cream Sunday, if anyone wants to join me. IWNDWYT ❤ Stay safe and healthy, all.",11

I would probably consider myself a gray area drinker, although I was comfortable calling myself an alcoholic for the sake of meetings. In other words, I had few negative repercussions and never ""hit bottom."" I honestly was rarely drunk or hungover, but drinking was more a part of my life than I wanted it to be. And I couldn't successfully drink only on special occasions, so it was simpler to just quit. Sort of a relief actually.

I enjoyed participating in the program for a while... I think I related to the ""alcoholic thinking"" more than the alcoholism itself. I learned to let go of wallowing and self pity. I examined my fears and character defects. I related to other people who also grew up with a sense of ""anxious apartness"" or feeling like an ""egomaniac with low self esteem"". But I really think I related more because I'm an adult child of an alcoholic, and because I have struggled with compulsive eating the way people in AA struggle with alcohol.

Having said all that, it just doesn't feel like a place I belong anymore. There's a lot of shit that I'm tired of, but I won't turn this into a rant about specific personalities in AA. But am I asking for a relapse? I have had that drilled into my head. I have no desire to drink. I just don't see any point to drinking anymore. I still plan to practice the principles, because I feel like the concepts behind the 12 steps are helpful to me. And I have friends in recovery both in and out of my regular AA meetings.

I was here in this subreddit for months after I stopped drinking but before I tried AA. I think you all are much more open-minded about there being many paths to staying sober.",13

I've felt lost and miserable and generally out of place, in a very distinct way from anything I've experienced. I've been doing a lot of self work and analysis, some yoga, meditation, therapy, journaling, been on sick leave, confronted my ugly feelings etc etc. but I only just realized - again - that I am in recovery. Not just from alcohol abuse. I am essentially _recovering_ a lot of things that I've lost along the years. Some of them over 30 years ago. Of course it is hard at times, like today when I suddenly started feeling super drained and cut short my biking trip. Got some ice cream on the way home, just like I used to do on early sobriety. Didn't even think about drinking.  
I've been so so hard on myself for so long. But I ain't doing that anymore. It is in its own way really empowering to really listen to yourself, what you need, and then give that to yourself. I've also come to finally realize that there is no other person or thing in this world who can do that for me. I still have a lot of emotional catching up to do, but at least I feel like I am finally sticking up for myself and learning to take care of myself.

&#x200B;

Going out to buy groceries: Usually, this would end up with me buying a lot beers and wine and painfully resisting to buy gin or rum. It felt great to save that money. And, to be honest, I felt a little bit stupid. I used to hit the drinks aisle first thing.

&#x200B;

Cooking burgers: I love cooking burgers and everything about them. But I was used to have a beer or two with them or while cooking. Seems that my home brewed kombucha it's a good substitute.

&#x200B;

Going to a party: Well, everybody were surprised I wasn't drinking anything but water. I can't blame them, you know? I thought this was going to be more difficult, but I spent an amazing time there with some friends and I've woken up full of energy and motivated to keep doing my things.

&#x200B;

At night: I was too used to pour some Jagger in my night infusion.

&#x200B;

A question that keeps popping on my head is: Is there going to be a moment when I'm going to idealize the alcohol and not think too much in the hurt provoked? And, if so, how to bear with it.",9

Don’t break yours,"Maybe this is me finally venting, I don’t know.. but I know I have a problem. I admitted that to “myself” (mainly others) a long time ago and I had quit drinking for a year or so. Sure I believed myself to a degree but I didn’t *really* believe I was an alcoholic until a few months ago, literally a few weeks before I opened my first bottle.


Thing is, I grew up drinking. Where I come from, we’re known for our drinking and able to party nearly 24/7.  I’ve relocated halfway across the country but still can’t hide where I come from (I try to hide my accent but it can be difficult). So when people say “Oh you’re from [insert home here], let’s go for a beer sometime!”. I have to repeat myself “No, I can’t”. I don’t care if I seem like an asshole, truth is I can’t afford to drink at a bar and I don’t care to drink in company of people. The worst part, in my opinion, was when I said “I can’t” it was more “I can’t because I want to stay sober, I want that mark on the calendar, I want to make someone proud”. I made my ex proud.


That was before.


Now it seems like I’m living off 2-day leftover cold pizza and trying to hard to blend every day into the same.  Yes, I have returned to the same pizza place drunk twice this week, ordering the same thing. Staying awake until I notice my cue to go to bed - the sun is rising and the construction crowd next door will be here soon. The next day is my usual “Today is a write off - I’m hungover” with me giving myself false motivation for the next day. Only for me to silently snap under any stress or trigger and say “fuck it, this drink will help take the edge off”. My roommate likes to make sure I have a bottle in the freezer for the ‘bad days’ I need a drink and he feels it’s okay as he likes to have a drink once in a blue moon. (Which means he’ll have maybe one drink out of a 40 or two) I’ve tried telling him I feel like I’m slipping again but those who seen me drink think I’m some weird professional drinker as “she knows how to drink, she can handle her booze”. 


No guys, spending the entire day on an empty stomach, having a couple drinks and then eating plain bread whenever you know you should isn’t handling shit (... but thanks for the compliment anyway right ?? /s)


I’m thinking about telling my ex, she’s the only one who ever really supported me. Damn, shes the one who cleaned off the windows to my hell house that’s my heart.

Today’s the day where I would normally start drinking again. There’s a full bottle in the freezer. My stomach is empty, I know today isn’t going to be any better than anything recently. I’m tired of feeling defeated.


Thanks for taking your time to read this.. I’m tired of sounding like a little bitch. Here’s to hoping a cold shower might help. I’m not sure when my Day One will start again but for anyone reading this please, please continue to stay sober.



Enjoy your Sunday everyone, take care and stay safe",6

I will never regret that decision. If I stumble or if I fail one day, you bet your ass I'm going to get back up and continue not drinking. It's simply not worth it anymore.

Last night, after a day-long bike ride, my wife and I, and another couple went to a restaurant for the first time since March 14th. Being outside all day normally would have been enough to have me drinking the rest of the evening and night. Restaurants aren't open indoors here yet, but, they can have up to 50 person occupancy on their patios. This is one of our favorite bars / restaurants with one of the best patios in the city. One I have never, ever, been at sober. NEVER without a beer or drink in my hand. Over the years numerous groups of friends would meet before and / or after different events... always booze, usually shots and definitely big tall beers.

Thanks to covid and quarantine, I haven't had to face a lot of social triggers yet. This was a big one. I didn't know if I could sit on that patio and have fun without a beer or 6. I could... AND I DID. We had so much fun last night,  Laughing all day and night long. I needed this for two reasons... to prove I could succeed not drinking on summer days like this, and it was good for my soul. I needed things to feel normal, if even for a day, after months of... not normal.  Craziness. Another big help yesterday was being with friends who know I'm not drinking, SUPPORT me not drinking,  and want to help me succeed not drinking. It doesn't hurt that between them and my wife, none of them are very big drinkers.

TL;DR -  it was a great fucking day, and I didn't fucking drink.",34

I am drinking way more than I want and once I start I can’t stop. There is no moderation for me. I’ve tried and failed.

This can’t work in the long run and I know it. Sobriety is a little uncomfortable so far but it’s time. I haven’t failed anyone. I’m punishing myself for being human and I won’t do it anymore.

I wanted to stay together and she wanted out. I understand why she left. I was a terrible and miserable drunk and she gave me a 100 chances to quit and change, but I didn’t. Even a stint in rehab didn’t work for me. Though I understand why she left and can respect her decision, I still miss and love her deeply. Sometimes I miss her so much it feels like all my bones in my body might collapse all at once like the burnt out logs in a fire and I’ll just crumble to the floor. 

She moved out in August of 2019. I went sober for about 2 months and tried to show her I could change, but I could tell by the way she would talk to me on the phone or when she came over to get some items occasionally that she had mentally blocked me. She talked to me now the way you might talk to a barista at a coffee shop you are never going to frequent, very polite, but completely ineffectual. Again, I don’t blame her, but it was maddening. I knew I was looking at the person I loved most on earth and the person looking back at me was looking at me like a stranger. 

One day, about 2 months into the separation, I fell off the wagon. I drank hard for two straight days. I mean all hours of the day, endlessly. I would black out and fall asleep and then wake up in this nervous twitchy nightmare and begin again. Near the 2 day mark I was done being alive. 

I won’t get into exact details, but I wrote a note, which I still have and think about, and then did what I did. I was pretty confident it would work, but I woke up almost 12 hours later alive, but very, very sick. My parents were worried terribly about me because I hadn’t been responding for multiple days. They came over to check on me and found me very sick and I told them the truth. 

I stayed with them then for about 3-4 months in a small little college town. It was nice living with them. My parents are very kind and understanding people. I was sober the entire time I stayed with them and was going to meetings. I was reconnecting with old friends, losing weight and treating myself better.

When I moved back into an apartment in Chicago by myself I kept it together for a couple months, but then the realities of the divorce hit me and I fell hard back into drinking from late February until now. I just couldn’t deal with the idea of her never being my partner again. And I just kept putting out that pain with heavy drinking.

Some of you already probably know this, but for most alcoholics who return to drinking after long stretches of sobriety, the effects of the alcohol are more intense. I drink way more now than I ever have. The hangovers are worse. My actual organs hurt some days. I don’t talk to friends anymore and I stopped exercising. I wake up every morning crawling out of a grave of self-pity and self-harm. 

I really want to stop again. I want to be the kind of person who is strong enough to deal with their emotions and hardships soberly. I want to be wise enough to remember it’s never worth it. That you will always wake up with less than what you had yesterday. You’ll keep half-lifing down the joys in your life and the opportunities as well. Friends will eventually be done with your bullshit. Family will too at some point. 

It’s like for me I can drink and have nothing else good in life (friends, family, health, relationships, extra cash, etc) or I could just not drink and have all those things. I know this to be true, but still my brain goes “well, are you really happy and free if you CAN’T have this one thing?” And I always give into that logic and go “you are right, brain, I can have it all this time with drinks and everything else good as well.” And it never works out. The truth is if I stop drinking, I won’t get everything I want and love, but I’ll get a lot more than I do by drinking. It’s not as bright and shiny an ending as I would have dreamt, but that’s the truth of a lot of life. I see that now. So I want to choose to have the better life even if it’s not perfect. I want to say goodbye to drinking and start living.",106

Either way I can use it as a reminder; if it survives and thrives I'll associate it with my quitting drinking; if it inevitably dies I'll associate it with what would have happened had I continued on and waited too long.

And if nothing else, I can remind myself how I replanted a tree over my first cup of coffee at 7am because I wasn't hungover!

2020-06-07 04:23:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gy8ig3/first_time_new_comer/,"First time, new comer","Hi all,

Brand new here, signed up to the group after searching google this morning on stop drinking support groups. 

I am a mummy of 2 young children and in the last 18 months have turned to alcahol more and more in the evening to help get me through the stressful time that is the kids bedtime routine and admittedly use it to dull down that voice in my sub concious that tells me I’m not a good mum or the mum that I thought I would be and because I have those thoughts I think I have actively convinced myself that I’m not and have lost all confidence. Don’t get me wrong both of our children are very happy healthy kids who get interaction and lots of love from my husband and I but for some reason and I think it is largely due to my own parents and their role they have in my children’s lives undermining my confidence in being a mum - they are always highlighting “problems” and better ways to do things. So I think I started to use alcahol to help me ‘get through’ the most stressful part of any parents day because it gave me the confidence to do so and so I didn’t have that internal conflict that was exhausting and a bit sad really. I should say that on the odd night where I don’t drink once I’m through the 5-7pm period I generally feel a sense of achievement and happily go to bed with hubby at 9 o’clock having not fallen asleep on the sofa as I usually would and with a much clearer head.

Realising that this isn’t healthy to drink a bottle of wine a night and becoming more emotional and lacking enjoyment from life I want to stop drinking and start enjoying my children and my husband because we really do have a lovely life and I want to really live that. As I say both kids are beautiful, we love them dearly and have a lovely home  so I don’t really have a reason to not enjoy it.
I don’t want alcahol to become a bigger problem where I can’t stop although I am really scared of that now I’ve decided to stop that may be a reality.

I’m hoping I can get some support and advice on how I move forward now... but for today I have decided I will not drink.

I will remain strong not drinking because it will only temporary numb my pain and the next day anxiety will be peaking. 

The weird part of all this is that I want to text my ex how good I’m doing not drinking. I know it’s not a good idea and so far I’m not going too, I guess I just wanna feel validated.. ugh I keep telling myself my sobriety is for ME and I truly believe that but I can’t help that it’s for her too.

I blew out on Fat Tuesday and woke up so hungover I genuinely thought I had COVID because it stretched on for four days with a pounding headache, depressed breathing, runny nose, and a sore throat and I felt like I wasn't improving. As the clarity came back and I started to feel better physically, I realized I wasn't feeling any better emotionally.

Before Lent, I didn't often find myself drinking on weekdays, but I would have a terrible cycle of drinking heavily on Fridays, and spending entire weeks recovering. As part of all these half baked weekly recovery efforts, I often found myself floating in hot springs and saunas, just trying to sweat the evil out, trying to stop my mind and body from feeling all the pain and embarrassment my own behavior had caused. On ceasing drinking, I continued this part of my weekly ritual and as my bloated and abused body drifted about for hours on end, my mind had equal time to wander about these strange tides.

Whether it's helped or harmed, my memories started flooding back...

At first, I found myself examining my relationship with alcohol and other crutches. I found myself blaming my relationships with others, lovers, friends, and my own family for my toxic love of self abuse, falsely bargaining in my head ""Well, I only did [embarrassing thing] because [reason]"". I realized half of these people won't talk to me, and a good proportion of the remainder are likely embarrassed to even associate with me. Secondly, I found myself reliving these failed relationships, remembering monumental moments I wish I'd treated more ceremoniously, and of all the places where I'd been asked to leave because I'm a tremendous asshat. To seek out the patterns and causes of this behavior, I found myself diving headlong into memories, trying to examine them honestly, finding a moment in time and ""pushing play"" until I caught myself up to the present moment.

I discovered a couple things about myself.

I've found that I have a terrible fear of being alone. Not in a romantic sense, nor through a lack of friendships, but cosmically and spiritually alone. A true fear that I couldn't form a deep, existentially meaningful connection to the other souls swimming in the sea of life, and that this life is merely just perception without substance. I tried to use alcohol as a shared experience with others, finding that despite a perceived connection in the moment, it is hollow through being forgotten the next day.

I also found that I grip onto these negative things that happened in the past, letting them weigh me down, despite their ever-increasing irrelevance as we are subjected to the inexorable passage of time. The miserable, drunken aftermath at the end of a long relationship with a wonderful woman, which I blamed for my  continued awful coping skills using alcohol, mitigated by her happy marriage to another. The roommate that asked me to leave because of a booze-driven emotional meltdown, mitigated by thousands of miles and brief, curt, but friendly exchanges of the occasional message. The biggest pain remaining is the weight of the realization that I did these things to myself, mitigated only by the fact that it's also on me to fix them.

Perhaps the only reason I continued to drink was through the avoidance of the painful clarity that sober and clean reflection would bring. Nothing pains me more than the lack of memories of nights passed, not knowing what I said or how I may have acted insensitively to others. I know that once I start, it's difficult to stop until the next sunrise, and then it'll just bring more things to regret, try to fix, or attempt to erase on an ever accumulating burden of self-assessed sin. 

Stopping drinking didn't fix me, but it's helped me see what is broken. I can only deal with what's in front of me. I will not drink with you today.",13

Long story short, my youngest daughter graduated high school tonight and because of pandemic safety measures, we had to travel a bit to a proper venue. I’m on the road back home now (don’t worry- husband is driving!) and I have to tell you how wonderful it was to be sober for this event. 

It was wonderful to know that I was 100% there for my child for what, to date, is her biggest milestone. I had the energy and focus I needed to truly share in this moment with her. Even the small parts like spending the better part of an hour helping her do her hair and makeup. I didn’t miss a single moment and it’s because I wasn’t preoccupied with booze. It was honestly a beautiful experience.

I have been feeling good, I have been having fun. I decided to buy a bottle of wine, I didn't need it, I didn't have a strong urge to buy it, I subconsciously talked myself out of it. I bought it anyway. 

No positive impact, no enjoyment whatsoever. I feeling dusty this morning and I ate all my son's school snacks.

Anyway, I'm not going to feel guilty about it as that won't help. But I'm I'm not going to drink today, or tomorrow, or after that and go from there.

Being sober made me realise that only time I have been properly sober was when I was a child. I created fun, I remember laughing and goofing off. I enjoyed parties, enjoying hanging out with friends, enjoyed going to the beach and enjoyed the weekends. I had less anxiety back then despite going through traumatic events as a child,  I was way more resilient than now. 

Sober adult me was alot the same, I danced with my dog, I played cricket on the beach, I laugh more, I was more silly, I had more fun everyday. And I lost a couple of kilos even though I've been generous with my diet.",38

I needed to replace a light fixture in my laundry room. I got everything unassembled and when I when to install the replacement fixture I found it did not fit. I was a little frustrated so I ran to the hardware store. 

On the way there I was overwhelmed with the urge to go to the liquor store and get red wine. My justifications were I had accomplished a lot in the past week, it is Saturday, once I finished the light repair I deserved a drink, drinking once a week is not a bad thing. I am not capable of living sober. Why try so hard?

When I stopped drinking this time I promised myself that if I wanted to drink I had to play it forward and list all of the negative results of a drink. I sat in my car out side the hardware store, gripping the steering wheel and started to list them. I would feel like a loser as soon as I put the glass to my lips. It was around 4. If I started drinking around 4 I would drink a bottle of wine as fast as I could. I would then want more and would probably get more, wasting money. I would probably say f it to finishing my repair. I would not make the nice dinner I had planned. I might make something but it would not be the best. I would not be present for movies with my kids. We would not have fun eating the pie I made together. I would pass out instead of sleeping. Wake up feeling like crap and have to start all over again. Or worse yet get sucked into the black hole of alchohol that I have spent the past week crawling my way out of. 

Ok, that was a long list. Long enough to get me home without  the wine. 

I feel like a stranger in a strange land. Living sober is like trying to learn a new language. I know the longer I stay here the more normal it will get.

I honestly don't mind because nothing y'all can say will make me feel worse than I already do. I don't remember much but piecing things together it seems I was coming back from Mcdonalds eating and driving along and, probably distracted by unwrapping my food and not paying attention, hit a parked car a couple blocks from my house at about 20 mph.

&#x200B;

I’ve known about this sub for a few years and always knew that I should stop drinking. This was a place that would help me though a tough time. I wanted to introduce myself and tell my story so that I could help out fellow quitters and receive help myself.

Pardon the long post, I feel that details are the things that I connect with the most and I wanted to get as much of my story out there as I can. 

&#x200B;

**My Story**

I’m a 36 year old guy. I quit drinking on March 1st, 2020. Overall I feel SO much better. It is a little hard to judge because my normal routines are so far away from what they normally are during the pandemic. There are still checks that I can do though and for the most part I feel more mentally and physically healthy that I have in a long time.

I used to drink pretty heavily. I started not long after I turned 21 and haven't taken a long term break from drinking until now. Most of the time I was the drunkest guy in social drinking situations. Many times in social drinking situations I would have more fun consuming or bragging about how much I could consume than the social activity itself. Sometimes this was hanging out at the bar after work, brunches, birthday parties, comedy, or music events, i.e. social events that had a goal of some sort rather than drinking being the main goal. I usually made drinking the main goal. I would think about it beforehand “That is going to be so fun. I can get so fucked up there.” I knew that this behavior was a sign of a serious problem. I just rationalized it with procrastination. It was the typical “I can quit whenever I want.”

&#x200B;

**Divorce**

About a year and a half ago I separated from my wife as we started to take steps towards a divorce. I don’t need to go into all the details here (not that I’m opposed, it just really isn’t relevant.) She cheated on me after 5 years. The quality of the relationship had been hurting for years. My drinking definitely contributed to the decline of that relationship. She didn't like how drunk I would get nor how often. I would hide and lie about how much I was drinking. I’d buy 6 tall cans of beer hide 4 of them and try to appear to her that I’d only drink 2 when I was actually drinking 6. I don’t know if it always worked, I was usually pretty intoxicated. After we separated I went extra hard for around a week in an attempt to combat the loneliness and sadness with my new found freedom. Most of my support system were friends that drank and used drinking to cope. Warnings started coming up and I knew that I needed to ease up on the gas. Without the heavy drinking I fell into a pretty heavy depressed state. I would only eat easy to cook food that was shitty for me. I ordered a lot of shitty pizza. Spent most of my time sleeping in front of the Netflix “Are you still watching?” screen. Ignored all texts and phone calls. Sparingly checked in with my family to let them know I was still alive. Worked the same amount but I was basically just a shell. Didn’t tell my co-workers for a few months about what was going on but they could tell something was up. Around this time is when I started to drink constantly.

&#x200B;

**Work**

I work at a local brewpub. I’m a manager and content creator for the social media. My work environment was pretty relaxed on the rules. We aren't allowed to drink on the job as it is illegal and the owners don’t approve. Just about everyone did it anyway. I drank on the job more than most and was probably viewed as the “chill” boss. I would drink before I went to work, drink through the whole shift, and I’d drink after work. I wrongly justified the behavior with a “Happy staff makes happy customers.” line of thinking. Getting out of a situation where I could drink for free while clocked in played a major role in helping me quit drinking. I wanted to come out of this quarantine a better person. I’m worried about falling into past routines when I return to work soon but I feel like I’ve developed good strategies to avoid that pitfall. I’m not happy with my job. I think I would be happier in a position that utilized my creative and technical skills rather than my ability to carry food to tables and smooth over service issues. It would be great to clock in at a position where the constant temptation isn't there.

&#x200B;

**Relationships**

Around a month after my separation with my ex-wife I started dating a girl that I worked with. We both were heavy drinkers. It started with her coming over helping me cope with the separation while we drank and watched movies as friends. It was nice to have someone to talk to about things. After a while things progressed and we started sleeping together. Progress happened quickly and before I knew it we were in a dedicated monogamous relationship. It was really refreshing being able to be myself and judgement free coping through alcohol. I was reconnecting with friends at this time as well and realized that I was drinking a fair amount more than I had before when I spend time with them. My default mode was to plow through beers and shots until I couldn't anymore. I didn’t get many verbal warnings from them about the excess behavior as I think they chalked it up to coping though the tough time. Most of those reconnections fizzled out pretty quickly and I spent the majority of my time with my new girlfriend. We were either drunk or recovering from being drunk practically all the time. Around 6 or 7 months ago I really started to modify my behavior and slow down immensely. I wanted a way out of the cycle. I wanted a light in my future that I could look forward to. She continued to go hard which I wasn't opposed to. I didn’t feel like it was my decision to modify her behavior just because of how I felt about myself. It didn’t bother me that she was drunk all time but it didn’t help my quest for sobriety. I eased up quite a bit and got back to what I would consider a more stable relationship with alcohol. It was still bad but wasn’t as bad as it used to be. I still would binge all night into the morning once a week when I didn’t have to work the next day. Quarantine started and I stopped drinking completely. I wanted to be clear and focused as I tackled this bizarre set of events going on around me. I broke up with her a month ago for a few reasons, one being the drinking situation. I really needed to be selfish and work on my lingering issues with all of my effort.

&#x200B;

**Mental, Physical, and Home Health**

I’ve been doing really well lately. I have a somewhat regular and healthy sleep cycle. My cat loves the extra attention and care I’ve been able to provide. I’ve been watering my plant. I mostly keep the dishes done. I cook a lot more mainly sticking to balanced meals that are good for me in the long run and mentally stimulating to create. I haven’t ridden my bike as much as I’d like to. I’ve gained weight but it isn’t extreme. I’ve been FAR more creative messing around in photoshop creating art that I’m proud of. I’ve been playing video games on my own and with my little brother who lives far away. We’ve been grinding for top tier equipment in Diablo 3 together. Overall I’ve been enjoying my interests more than I have in a long time. I fix things when they need fixing. I’ve been keeping up on the maintenance of my bike. I’m alone almost all the time with the majority of my social interactions happening on social media (twitter, insta, and reddit.) Sometimes I get lonely so I’ve loosely been trying to setup bike rides with friends. I haven’t posted about my sobriety or told anyone other than my little brother. I struggle sometimes with wanted to crack a six-pack and sit back. I get worried that it would lead back to me having wine with my breakfast bagel in the morning though so I just direct my attention and energy elsewhere, usually art creation or video games. I’d say if 10 being a break down and drinking again on the struggle scale I’m usually at a 1 or 2 with short spikes hitting 6 or 7.

&#x200B;

**The Future**

I plan on continuing this sober lifestyle for a while longer. I still smoke cigarettes and drink coffee with the goal of tackling those demons later down the road. I think that a good goal is to adhere to “Not a drop” for a year with a revaluation of my goals then. I hope to have a different job by then. I want something that doesn’t contribute to temptation and has positive feedback loop with my creativity. I want to discover ways of being social without needing to drink to do it. I’m thinking of getting back into Magic: The Gathering. I used to play competitively and it would be fun to pick back up casually. I haven’t looked into how I can explore digital art creation in a social way but I’m open to suggestions. I think that sharing my culinary creations would be beneficial as I can do it in my controlled environment. These are options that are hard to explore as my work and other venues haven't opened up yet. Quitting drinking hasn’t been easy but it wasn’t as hard as I though it was going to be. Taking advantage of this quarantine situation has been really good for me. I look forward to waking up again and I’m proud of all my progress.

The longest i had lasted before was 29 days (so currently on my new pb)... does anyone have any advice for dealing with possible bipolar ups and downs as i tend to turn to alcohol to 'deal' with them. I also have insomnia which often leads to little sleep and time on my hands- so i turn to the bottle to pass the time. 

I have finally admitted to my boyfriend about how much i actually drink- can be about 2 bottles of whiskey a night sometimes, although often was around half a case of beer and some whiskey or vodka every night or two and always had a few shots in the morning and atleast a beer or two in the evening. 

I am currently doing cold Turkey and I'm on adhd medication and sleeping tablets. Its hard as me and my bf are quarantined a few hours away from each other and neither of us can get to each other although we ft most nights, but some nights i just need one of his hugs to help me get out of my head for a bit. 

Also i should probably mention i have anxiety and depression (thanks adhd/ bipolar) and came very close to ending it last month although i set a date net year and if my life is still the same or worse then i will do it and if its better than i wont. 

I really want to succeed this time so yeah just wondering what yall are doing to pass the time/ deal with mood changes",6

I started drinking in college the usual way any kid does: binging and partying. Partied my way out of school. Entered the restaurant industry at 18 and was a career server/manager for 15 years. The first 8 years, I was a product of the industry, a proverbial bar fly, as it were. Met my husband 7 years ago and retired from the bars and took to drinking at home, usually around a bottle to two bottles of wine a night. In essence, I had no idea who I was when I started drinking and now my entire identity is built on it. I'm not a fall down, raging drunk, nor am I an hysterical, crying, black out mess. I'm just a happy drunk. Problem is, I cant feel anything when I'm sober. I'm just numb. Not happy, not sad-absolutely nothing. The only way I can cry, seriously self-ruminate, enjoy sexual intimacy with my partner, enjoy personal intimacy with others, etc, is when I am drinking. I have a great job and a wonderful marriage. There is also no added guilt to the equation because I dont hide my drinking from my husband or anyone else. In fact, he drinks more than I do. I have long passed the times of blacking out and waking up with the next morning ""scaries."" My job and relationships are not effected by my drinking. I have great credit and a nice home and great relationships with friends and family. I'm general not unhappy. But, I've always suffered from depression and anxiety and I know I NEED to quit drinking.

It's in the 80s, a nice breeze is blowing, the sun is starting to sink in the sky, the birds are chirping, a dog is barking somewhere in the distance. My wife is out with family, and my kids are occupied on their own.

A couple of years ago, I would be about five beers deep en route to polishing off at least a six pack then hitting the whiskey, or perhaps wine—whatever I had in the house.

But tonight, I'm going to eat a healthy dinner, drink some water, put my kids to bed, go to bed at a decent hour, and wake up tomorrow morning and go for a run.

It's times like these I'm utterly grateful that I don't feel a need to turn to poison to have a good time anymore. IWNDWYT.",63

Its been a long time since I posted. I still read most of the posts that pop up on my front page, but I feel disconnected from the sober mindset that I once had. I did about 5 or 6 months sober last year, but have been drinking again since last August I think.

Since the pandemic started i have been really hitting the bottle hard. Ive been stashing bottles so my wife doesn't know how many I go through. Ive been drinking at work, which then means I'm driving under the influence too. Its terrible and I can't seem to stop. Every day I tell myself I need to stop, but I dont.

I tried listening to this naked mind again, and alcohol explained, but i can't get into it this time around. I'm watching my country tear itself apart, watching  the world get crazier and crazier, watching the impending climate disasters be ignored and honestly, im watching the end of humanity in real time. I feel like I'm drinking myself to death just to get the fuck out of here. 

I don't feel suicidal at all, never have. But when I consider my actions, the way I'm intentionally poisoning myself every day, it sure seems like intentional slow suicide. I dont know what to do. Before the pandemic I was about a month or 6 weeks sober, and was going to a support group once a week. That has obviously been cancelled. The thought of doing that sort thing on a zoom call is not appealing at all. But I suppose it's time to figure something out. Help! SOS!",1

Then in my dream, I was surrounded by all of them, and I relapsed. I know it’s only a dream, but it’s a great reminder of how this thing I hold so precious to me can be lost in a moment. I think I need some support and I’ve not felt this way before. I’ll be in here more often this week. Love you guys.",4

2020-06-06 16:57:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gxywsu/my_story/,My Story,"I got a DUI, my third in 9 years, in November. I had the two previous from 2010/2011 but it took awhile to get charged and convicted. I was drunk but ironically it was my ""best"" DUI in that my earlier ones involved erratic driving and an accident. This time my taillights were out.

After the second DUI I went to rehab and came back. I wanted to do something with my life now. But it was a mixed bag. I eventually got promoted to CIO of a factory but at the same time for the next 5-6 years it was off and on binge drinking followed by periods of sobriety. I eventually occasionally started driving again.

Three years ago I left my job, as I planned, to come to study to be of all things a pastor. I have always felt that this was my calling. While studying I was the same - periods of sobriety followed by intoxication. There is a different kind of stress dealing with all kinds of people rather than being the person people come to for tech help.

I had 125 days sober two summers ago. I relapsed because of relationship issues, and destroyed that relationship. It got worse and worse and last summer I got a public intoxication being passed out in a lawn on the way home to the bar. My BAC was .34.

In November I got the DUI and I was sober for 30 days. I blame my drinking on the stress of my life. I said yes to everything. I literally had 5 jobs in addition to being enrolled in classes at the seminary and at the hospital training to be a chaplain. One job in particular is very taxing to me and I hate it, but I can't bring myself to quit. It is a (to me) stressful non-religious office job at the place I am studying, processing all the incoming donations and mailing out thank you letters. I also do technology work for the school, occasional maintenance, preach at two different churches, and work as an on-call chaplain at the local hospital.

I relapsed in December after staying awake until 3 in the morning for 3 nights in a row trying to finish my final papers while still doing all this stuff. I actually preached twice on Christmas Eve and then proceeded to come home and drink 12 beers and take four tabs of LSD. It was the worst Christmas of my life.

I came clean about this relapse and was sober for 100 days between January 6 and April 15th. Because of COVID-19 I began to work much more at the hospital because no volunteers were allowed. I visit patients in-person but am also on call for approximately 120 hours a week. Luckily getting called in is not that frequent. In the meantime my schedule was better, but the disorganization of the time before from my office job was constantly nagging me. During this time I also started a healthy dating relationship, which I would say is my first. In April I went to the office and brought home hundreds of pieces of loose paperwork that needed filed appropriately. I spread them around my apartment to work on them. Every day I would see them and get a lot of stress. My girlfriend eventually stopped coming over and we would only meet outside to exercise and catch up.

On April 15th after discussing it with my then-girlfriend I had three beers. By the end of the evening I was drunk having drank the remaining beers alone and ""borrowed"" some alcohol that I had to replace later. This pattern has continued and gotten worse and worse. Around 7-10 days of sobriety followed by 2-4 day extreme binges. Between Sunday evening and Thursday, I drank 1.5 fifths of liquor and 40-50 beers. Because I am supposed to be on-call I have always been lucky not being called when drunk, but this time my boss called me and I eventually told him I was drunk. He had written a wonderful letter of support for me advocating for house arrest instead of jail. He actually did not fire me but did say he may not be able to support me.

My romantic relationship went downhill each time I drank. I'd get drunk and not answer texts or make up excuses. Then I'd get sober and get desperately clingy. Monday I was passed out for 8 hours and the only thing she could say was ""I'm glad you're not dead"". It didn't sink in until I sobered up Friday that this was not a joke. I told her that I drank, as I eventually did each time, and I wouldn't say I have a girlfriend anymore. She has made distance from me and is not answering my messages. I sent her a message saying that I would respect her taking space and would just let her know how I was doing, and thanking her for being a good friend.

In January I started seeing two counsellors. I told one of them I drank on Wednesday but drastically minimized the time the relapse occurred.

I've spent the day alternating between googling how to hang yourself and trying to organize office papers. Yesterday I felt nearly suicidal and drank 3 beers to make it go away. I don't see any light. I have been trying to quit drinking for over a decade, way before all this trouble. And I have realized through what happened with my girlfriend how people cannot support or even associate with me. I am good at what I do and am a trustworthy and loyal friend, but not when I am drinking. Now I am alone. I feel like the worst imagining what I have put people through my whole life. I don't know how to stop and what I do is whine like this which accomplishes nothing.

I don't know about getting immediate help. I have felt almost exactly this way hundreds of times. I also feel like I need to go do more work because that is the only thing I have to do right now besides laying in bed and feeling enormous regret for ruining my relationship and hurting my girlfriend. I obviously believe in God but I will actually, at points, believe that it is my responsibility to moderate and overcome. That never works for too long.

My girlfriend had been telling me to quit my office job since we started dating, but I don't feel like I can. I made a mess and I feel like it's my responsibility to clean it up. It is also hard to be on call almost 24/7. I also have a friend who takes up enormous amounts of my time and energy complaining and looking for sympathy. I don't feel capable of anything and what I tell people is that I feel pulled in too many directions. But really it is getting drunk that has destroyed me. And right now, I don't trust myself at all. I could be drunk in 2 hours, easily.",6

And I enjoyed my night. 

And as I went to bed i remember reading on here someone say you will never regret not drinking. 

So true and has spurred me to actually try again iso or not.

Not many cravings.  My escape buttons are sleep or video games.

Right now, though, I'm feeling resentful, bored, and lonely.  I've been up since 7 doing what I always do: keeping the kids alive and happy, keeping the household going, and finishing my own work for the week.  My husband doesn't usually work on a Saturday, but today he has a 3-11, which he left early for after sleeping late and playing games until lunchtime, which he prepared for himself, leaving the dishes in the sink.  I don't begrudge him sleeping in, but I wish he had offered to cook the kids lunch or take them to the park for an hour or something while temperatures were under 100.  Feels like I'm on my own today and it's not like I can take them anywhere indoors.

I don't have much to complain about, really.  The kids - 5 and 7 - are being incredibly good.  I'm going to read to them in a minute and tonight we might watch a movie together.  I'm not dreading the next six hours at all.

That said, I am - for the first time in almost a year - seriously tempted to drink.  In the middle of the day, too.  I have options: my husband keeps beer and liquor around, and we have half a bottle of very cheap wine I bought for a recipe.  It's not usually a problem.

I think I'll be okay, eventually.  Just wanted to put this out here to keep me accountable.  Thanks.  IWNDWYT.",9

I guess I'm a 48-year-old alcoholic.  I mean I know I am.  Like many of you, I'm sure, I'm probably considered a high-functioning alcoholic.  Great job, good salary.  Wife and 2 lovely kids.  Compared to many of you, my drinking is not of the Andre the Giant realm.  I go through about a 350ml a day of vodka and (lately, as I've been trying to cut back, lol) about 375ml a day of wine.  Wife does not know about the extent; knows I drink and would be mortified to know how much, because I hide it.  She does not really drink at all.

I want to quit in a way.  I love my kids and my wife and don't want to die.  But like many alcoholics, I can't seem to.  I recently had COVID-19, and in the testing for it - they did so many tests - they said I had great liver and kidney function.  So it allows my lizard brain to say my drinking can't be that bad, but of course it is.

My question, such as it is, I guess, is: have any of you experienced this?  I am afraid I'll have a stroke at 50 and leave my children without a father...but I love the way drinking makes me feel, I almost never get hangovers, and right now at least it seems that my organ functions are ok (although I've had high blood pressure for years now and am on meds, and I am sure it is alcohol-related).

I cannot and will not admit to my family that I'm an alcoholic.  So what now?",12

I not only had a drink but I had several and got really drunk. I talked on the phone with family and friends and was overly affectionate, I sent drunk text and what’s most embarrassing is that when I attempted sex with my partner I couldn’t perform. I was so drunk that my mind couldn’t stay in the moment of sex so I got a bit of anxiety and it turned into a noodle. Lol. I’m kinda worried about our next sexual encounter now. Anyway the next day I came here to find out what I should do about my slip up and you guys gave me great advice. Thing is I wasn’t finished being punished for my trip down alcohol lane. I suffer from depression and anxiety and drinking makes it a lot worse. In the last 6 months I hadn’t really had any significant anxiety attacks but after drinking I experienced severe anxiety. The feeling that I’m going to die and then depression because of my bad choices. I’ve learned that it’s just not worth it. 6 months of sobriety destroyed and not only because I drank but because I drank and every reason for me quitting in the first place revealed itself. At some point in our sobriety we can forget how bad alcohol really was to us and allow ourselves to believe that we can actually maintain it. I’m not sure that I’ll ever be able to maintain a “healthy” relationship with alcohol but at this point, with all the problems, humiliation and anxiety that it causes me why would I want to. Don’t do it for the number of days, do it because it’s just better for you not to drink. If drinking was great for you then you wouldn’t even be here in the first place.

Fuck show of a government. Blatant Racism. Fascism. Sexism. Greed. Corruption. Profits over people. Lack of empathy. Obviously I could go on.

Shit, I literally forgot about the global
pandemic and all of the shit show around that. Politics and society not a beautiful place. But like I said, I want to care. I want to do my part. So I let all of this in. And I worry. And act. And pray, etc. But I think I’ve been worrying too much about the rest of the world and not myself. I’ve been taking too much of the pain on and what I’m feeling is what many of us might, this shit is just way beyond my control. 

So that hit me for a second as a recovering alcoholic. This is out of my control. But is it? I mean, isn’t that what protesting is? An attempt to take control or power is some way? But this isn’t really about the protests. It’s about telling myself that it’s okay to let go and not be as outraged as I am. And I’m wondering if there are others who understand? It’s like I feel pressure to be outraged but then I’m not in control over anything so my outrage is turning into poison. Poison that sits in my body. 

Recovery has taught me to not worry about what you can’t control. But society needs me to Act. To control what I can, my own decisions and actions, and help push us forward. But as I do that, I keep hitting the Shit of it all and seeing that it’s beyond my control. So I’m left trying to control something and I can’t and well, it ain’t doin’ much for my quality of life. 

The hard part is what’s the other option? Not care about all of this? Simply because it doesn’t feel like can make a difference? Well that’s the whole point of societal change. Each individual does make a difference. 

I guess maybe I just need to take a personal break, rebuild my strength to endure, cut myself some slack, hey, it’s not my sobriety at threat. But that is a long term concern. Get too worked up about things out of my control and that little devil sees a crack. Alright. That felt like kind of a useless waste of time. Sometimes when I write things out, answers pop in my head. Other times they don’t and I just talk in circles. Any comments are always welcome. I’m curious as to what people think.

I'd just love the chance to grow up without getting that shit drilled into my head every day of my upbringing. I think I'd be much happier. I know I'd be much happier. 

One of her big things was control over money, as in not spending it. There are kids who grow up starving because their parents can't afford food. But, this sounds crazy, kids grow up starving because their upper middle class white mom refuses to buy groceries because groceries cost money and she hates spending money. The joy of not spending money is more important than feeding her children. If you say, get a summer job, get money in the bank and spend that on food or other things, you disobeyed her. I vividly remember buying a $3 shirt without her permission and having her go ballistic on me, or the time my dad bought me a shirt for Christmas without her permission and her forcing me to tell him that I hated his shirt and didn't want it. My dad spent that Christmas Day sitting in his car, crying, because he bought me a Christmas present. 

Nevertheless, I'm still cheap from growing up in that environment. Frugal, whatever. I tried switching from vodka to beer, switched back to vodka because it's cheaper to get fucked up. I'm done swimming against the current, because in my experience there's no such thing as free alcohol. I have to go and purchase this needless expense. Nobody's buying me a free drink, and sure eventually I'll attend a party where the host is providing drinks, but I'll cross that bridge once I get there. For now, alcohol does not appear unless I make the conscious, sober decision to leave my place, go to a store where I can buy liquor, and purchase it. There's no more autopilot anymore. Every step to the store, with the intention of buying alcohol, is a chance to turn around and walk home. My bank account all the fatter from my decision to not drink today.",2

I think probably the outside world and its chaos has definitely impacted my personal decision to drink again.
But it is mostly me, as always. I had kind of a weird day yesterday but I don't want emotional challenges to be this thing that I use to justify my drinking.

I think at this point my biggest hurdle in staying sober is popping those nostalgia balloons when they start crowding my brain. At the same time, I’m also trying not to give alcohol too much power by personifying it into this mustache-twirling villain. True, that beer fest 5 years ago was fun. Also true, I snuck swigs of vodka afterward and passed out on the couch while our new friends were over. Also true, I’ve gone to a handful of beer fests since, trying unsuccessfully to capture the fun of that first one. 

And that’s kind of the theme of my daily drinking the last 13 years. Instead of opening myself up to change and just letting life happen, I drank and drank and drank so I could maintain an illusion of control. And for what? All that living in the past just made me feel lonely and left behind. 

The only constant in the last 90 days has been the ups and downs, but the biggest take-away I can give is that wading through the shit has been 100% worth it. Every day I wake up present, available, and with something I never had while drinking: an honest sliver of hope that I’m capable of becoming someone I’m proud to be.

Thought I could, I didn’t, and now I KNOW I can’t","I made it to 10 days, ‘woohoo double digits’ I posted, proud of my progress. And then I went and screwed it up.

The academic year finally over, I decided to start some clean out projects I’d been putting off. I found a couple of small containers of red wine- little cartons I’d buy to take to the beach- no glass. Only 500 mL, not enough to do damage, right? I wrestled with the ‘do I or don’t I’ dilemma for quite a while... and then I opened one. It’s so small, it can’t hurt. Besides, summer vacation, celebrate!

At first, it was great- the taste, the warmth, the buzz... the disbelief when I realized I’d finished the whole thing! But they’re so little I reasoned with myself, c’mon, just open the 2nd one and then they’ll be gone for good and I can continue with my abstinence. Alcohol makes for some really strange justifications... 🤦🏻‍♀️

During this time I was supposed to be eating my OMAD (one meal a day- fasting diet) I’d had nothing but water and coffee during the day. Needless to say, once wine took over, food was unnecessary. So you know where this is going, right? Yeah, I should’ve too...

Yet I remember feeling surprise when I laid down and suddenly felt my stomach rise in protest. I made it to the bathroom thankfully, but as I saw this morning, not all of it made it in the bowl. Though I didn’t wake with a hangover because it came back up and out again last night, I did wake up feeling like absolute crap with the realization of what I’d done. I remember nothing else thanks to blackout, and have to deal with facing kids when they wake up- did they know? Did I interact with them? Did they think to themselves ‘oh no, not this again...’

Once again I am starting over. This time, however, I believe I have a much better idea of how strong the pull is and how truly weak I am. I thought I could handle it, I didn’t and I can’t. Damn, I hate admitting that... but I need to. IWNDWYT (for real!)",1

One thing that really helped me.,"I started drinking most weekends from around the age of 18. From then on, every single weekend was dedicated to hanging out with my friends and getting wasted, then spending Saturday and Sunday hungover as hell.

Before this, as a teenager I would spend my weekends skateboarding or doing other hobbies with friends. Sometimes just playing video games or hanging out in the city.

Remembering this time before alcohol became my owner, I get really upset thinking about how simple life was back then and how much I missed just going out for a skate on a Saturday morning. Alcohol made me put my board in the garage and never look at it again.

Turns out, when you stop drinking, you get a second chance to pick up where you left off. You get to go back to who you were back then and remember just what kind of person you were before all this. All that youthful energy is still there inside you, just being heavily guarded by the alcohol goblins and masked by endless hangovers.

It's Saturday morning. I'm 30 and I'm going out for a skateboard session. Later, I'm going to play video games with my friends over Skype. I'm picking up my life from daycare after I abandoned it there all those years ago. I'm a 30 year old teenager again.

Try to remember who you were as a kid before alcohol existed in your life. You might first feel sorrow for all the wasted years since then, and that's a good thing. It just makes it all the sweeter when you realise how that person, and that life was just on pause, and you now get to welcome it back with open arms.

I snapped and snuck out to a bottle shop. I naively thought I would just have a glass, put it away and ration it. Over the course of 3 hours I drank the entire bottle and blacked out. I have no recollection of any of the conversations I had (and I had at least a dozen) from 10pm until 4am. 

I feel like I have thrown away months of work only to fall back into bad habits and I spent today hiding the shakes from people and dealing with a hangover I thought was going to make me pass out. 

The level of guilt and shame I feel right now is overwhelming. I have no idea why I did it either. My drinking directly destroyed at least 4 of my friendships because of my behaviour and all I can think about right now is how I feel like I'm a terrible person for not being able to keep this monster at bay. 

I am sad. I am scared. But at least I'm sober. 

Day 1... again. 

Any words of wisdom or encouragement are welcome. I'm feeling pretty shit right now.",63

2020-06-06 02:46:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gxm1ba/bit_milestone_today_day_41/,"Bit milestone today, Day 41!","Today is a big milestone for me. I was a daily drinker, and frequent binge drinker for 16 years, since freshman year of college. The longest I went without alcohol during that time was 40 days when I gave it up for Lent a couple years in a row. But since about 7 years ago I was not longer able to last the full 40 days. Well today I finished 41 days sober. The longest I have been sober since high school. I can't believe it. 

I never even wanted to be a drinker in the first place, because 1) I didn't want to support the alcohol industry, 2) because I wanted to keep my mind sharp, and 3) I thought it would be a terrible waste of money. When I took my first drink I knew I was hooked. All my friends were drinkers, so I went along for the ride. I started drinking local micro brews, so I didn't have the guilt of supporting the large corporations. I've been relatively successful as an engineer/scientist, so my mind seemed okay.

I have wanted to quit for 16 years, but I didn't have the guts. I have done some crummy things while drunk, I've spent who knows how many thousands of dollars on the damn stuff, I've injured myself a couple dozen times (never serious), I've said things I didn't mean and things I did mean but shouldn't have said, I've put myself and people I care about in dangerous situations, I've wasted so much time hungover in the mornings, I've embarrassed myself over and over, I've been blacked out for probably a full year of my life if I added it all up, yet I continued to drink.

I am writing this because I want to continue a sober lifestyle, yet I am scared I'll get content with my milestone and go back for a beer. After all, what is the harm in drinking one good quality local craft beer? I know the answer is another, and another, and another... My wife and friends all ask me when I'll be drinking again. I haven't told anyone that I'd like to quit forever. Well I have, but they must think it is a joke, because I'd always be drinking with them the next day, and I get the sarcastic 'never drinking again, huh?', and I jokingly respond, 'okay, starting now!', as I go for a refill.

Well, I don't know that I'll never drink again. But I do know that I will not drink tomorrow, nor the next day. I am going to mark my Day 82 on my calendar, and I'll plan to write a follow up post then (July 16th). Thank you all for posting to this community. I don't post a lot, and I only read a couple of posts a day, but they are great reminders for me. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I wish you the best on your personal journey.",6

It was that alcohol gives you a false sense of control. When we’re feeling bad, it fools us into thinking we can just drink this drink and feel better, allowing us to be in control of our emotions. For me, this was a crucial piece of information. I do want to be in control. When I feel like shit, I wanted an easy fix to just drink or eat or smoke that will take it away. With sobriety, there are no more quick fixes. We just have to do the work of repairing what’s broken so that we can face life’s problems. 

This idea brings me a weird kind of relief. At least knowing there are no quick fixes allows me to accept the struggles of sobriety at face value, instead of trying to trick myself into thinking it’s all going to be easy and enjoyable. I always tried to lie to myself about wether or not I enjoyed being sober. Instead, I think I’ll just accept being sober and all the feelings that come with it. And in those tough moments where I want a drink, I will remind myself- “there are no more quick fixes. You cannot go around this challenge”. 

What do you all think about alcohol and controlling emotions? Does anyone else share this perspective? Thank you and IWNDWYT.",16

It started slowly in May with a couple of beer here, a bottle of wine there. Then last week it turned into a full on binge with beer wine tequila rum...never enough. Needed it in the morning.

I haven’t drank in 7 days (officially tomorrow morning). I realized Saturday morning that I wasn’t sure the last time it had been since I went more than a day without a drink. It has been my routine to have a few every single night. I really enjoy it most of the time.

Last Friday I drank quite a bit with some friends out on my back deck. It was the first time doing so since quarantine. I woke up the next morning hungover. Nothing crazy – I remember just about everything. I’ve woken up times in the past and thought “oh no”. Those were the worst. This wasn’t quite like that but I surely didn’t feel good about having to piece together parts of my night in order to prove to myself that I didn’t drink way too much and that I didn’t do anything stupid. Plus it sucked feeling sick the whole day. It’s never ever worth it to drink that much and I always know it.

I talked with my wife on Sunday and told her I need to get out of this habit. A few drinks per night is a dangerous spot to be in especially when it’s been this way for years. So I told her I want to go a week, and maybe the whole month of June. She’s all for it and is doing the same with me and I love her very much for that and just about everything else about her.

A definite positive is that I don’t feel as sluggish and I’m pretty sure I have more energy throughout the day.

But I’m also realizing that having those evening drinks really took the edge off and allowed me to relax. When I get bored, I grab a drink. Not being able to do that has been a challenge and has brought me back to the days before I drank. I’m not sure what it is, but I think it’s either anxiety or depression. I’m not sad. I’m not constantly worried about anything at all. But sometimes I just get the sense that things aren’t okay. I’ve felt that more this week like I did in high school and college. My best example is watching TV. I was watching Ozark with my wife last night and I couldn’t get through the whole episode. I wasn’t tortured with anxiety or anything. I just didn’t like the situation they’re in and I wasn’t enjoying the show like I have been.

I’m not sure what that is but it was amplified this week. It could totally be anecdotal and I hope it is. So I’m doing another week. But I’m not sold that I want to stop drinking for good. That’s never been the plan. The plan is to get it under control and to be able to drink once or twice per week instead of every day. That’s why I don’t have flair and why I just created this alt account. I’m simply not committed. I genuinely love the taste of beer and whiskey and rum. So I’m not sure I want to do it and I’m not sure I could do it if I tried.

I’m wondering if there’s anyone else in a similar position or that has been in a similar position in the past. I’m looking for perspective and perhaps advice. I know it’s only been a week but I wish I was more in love with not drinking than I currently am.",1
2020-06-05 23:05:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gxj4l0/206_days/,206 Days,"I am what I like to call an unconventional alcoholic.

I mean this in the sense that when normal everyday drinkers imagine an alcoholic, they generally have this depiction of an unemployed, overweight, inappropriate, slurred-speech, 40(+) year old asshole of a person in mind. Please don’t get me wrong guys, none of us alcoholics are above this image, this could very well be any one of us EVENTUALLY (if it’s not already true for some). 
But what I am trying to say is that I STARTED drinking when I was YOUNG and I STOPPED drinking when I was YOUNG.
I only have 3 years of drinking under my belt, and none of those years were legal years, hell they still wouldn’t be if I picked up now. 3 years was all I needed, I mean shit if we want to get technical 1 year was enough for me to realize I had a problem, I just had less things to give a shit about in my life during that time.
I have always been self-conscious about my age within the community of alcoholics, I always felt like fellow alcoholics looked at me and doubted whether or not my self diagnosis was true or not, I always felt like I hadn’t been through enough. 
BUT that is just pure and utter bullshit. That is the alcohol trying to take advantage of my poor young mind, but I pride myself with the fact that I have always been pretty self aware, I’ve always been able to be honest with myself (it’s a gift and a curse). And without coming off as too egotistical, I am pretty smart for my age. 

Being a “young” alcoholic is hard, just as it is hard being an “old” alcoholic, but at the end of the day an alcoholic is an alcoholic. The drink always finds a way to re-enter your mind, even at 206 days sober, even at a year sober, even at 20 years, we all have those days where we have abnormal thoughts about alcohol, and that is what separates us from normal drinkers, we can’t do it without that obsession. 

I will say AA meetings are one of the most inclusive groups I have ever been apart of, and the people there WILL include you, but there will be people who look at you twice because of your age (if you’re a younger alcoholic) and people who doubt you, but those people do not represent the whole. It is on you if you decide to drink because human beings are being human beings. Do not use other people as an excuse to drink. When you attend a meeting it shouldn’t be to convince others you’re an alcoholic, it should be to find a group of people who you can truly relate to.

I really went off on a tangent with this post and I’m 99% sure it doesn’t read well, but fuck it, hopefully this helped someone.

I am a 27 year old female who doesn't drink often, but when I do drink it's embarrassingly unpredictable. I just relapsed after having 2 months under my belt. My biggest problem is sometimes when I drink, I #1 don't realize how much I'm actually putting down and #2 I can get really angry/emotional. Going from happy to sobbing to downright cruel and angry. I blackout or greyout and wake up the next day confused and people being rightfully upset with me. And sometimes I'm totally fine and none of that happens.

My boyfriend for the first time today told me I was abusive when I'm drunk. We had friends over and I was okay til the very end when I got kind of weird and too open and obnoxious. After they left, he said I got furious because he made me eggs and didn't put them back in the fridge. Something not normal for me when I'm sober but when I'm drunk I latch on to tiny things and then blabber on about everything I'm upset about. He said I basically kept telling him to leave him alone and called him names. That I then segwayed into basically going over everything in my life that has hurt or angered me. Going back and forth from crying or being angry. I guess not only in my blacked out state did I do this, but I took my prescribed muscle relaxers which is super dangerous. I don't remember much. I apologized but I know it doesn't mean much. Especially because this has happened several times. He has avoided talking all day and I can't imagine how shitty he feels. I asked him what I can do and he told me to leave him alone for now. So I have. I am disgusted with myself. He is the perfect partner and we usually don't argue. I don't know why I react this way but it isn't worth more than my relationship. I want to stop. But that's where the trouble starts everytime.

I seem to always do great for a few months. Like I said I don't drink often, but I drink a lot when I do. And then basically I'm surrounded by it and I guess I convince myself its ""not a huge deal"". Especially when its social and everything is ""ok"" at first. It is hard at times because bf works in the entertainment industry, and despite it being quarantine its engrained pretty hard into our lifestyle and culture I guess. I've asked if there was a way that he could make sure when we're at home that he could have a drink discreetly so that I don't know, and usually he says he can but after a while stops doing it. We also had the conversation that it's unfair to ask him to change his behavior when I'm the one with the problem. I am unsure what's right. On one hand I shouldn't force everyone around me to make accomodations for me especially people who can manage their drinking and emotions accordingly but on the other, I do feel a trigger when I see it and while I have skills to work through triggers, I stumble often. He just left to see his friends at a party. I honestly hope he has a good time especially because since I won't be with him he can actually let loose and relax without having to worry about me.

I'm not sure if this is relevant but I do have mental illness severe enough that I went on temporary disability a year ago. I have a few of them like PTSD and bipolar 1 with  intermittent psychosis. I am in therapy and on meds and have been working towards getting back to school in the workforce. I am transparent with my therapist. I thought I was doing pretty good but I always I'm doing pretty good before I mess up again. I was also raised by abusive alcoholic parents.  I used to take solace in the fact that I wasn't repeating the cycle but now I know that isn't true. I also have been clean from heroin for 6 years. I sometimes think I minimize the effect alcohol has on me because in the back of my head I always remember how bad I used to be. It isn't right, it isn't true, or justified but my head goes there at times.

I don't really have many friends or anyone besides my boyfriend. It's something I need to work on because it puts pressure on him to be the only person I go to. I feel scared to make friendships due to my PTSD.

I really want to change. I don't want my boyfriend to feel depressed or worried everytime we go anywhere with alcohol. I want to make him happy. I also want to be my best self and that is 100% not me when I drink.

Now, I just got a job offer today, and in attempting to get replacements, I find out I can't get them online (Bonus points: I may have also had my identity stolen!) The office is closed due to corona, and the phone lines aren't open til Monday.

I cried and cursed and was just PISSED the FUCK off. Sent ranting texts to my bf. Chainsmoked some cigarettes. Then went to a zoom meeting.

I realized I'm just letting myself wallow in self pity. And if I do that, I'll drink, for sure. And if I drink, I won't get it taken care of, and then I won't be able to work.

There's no use wallowing in self pity. I did this to myself, and I'll fix it myself. So many amazing things have already come out of my sobriety, and it's only getting better every day. I have the strength and the tools to fix all the problems I've made for myself.

I've been having a few thoughts about picking up again even so, so I thought I'd remind myself why I've stopped drinking by revisiting what happens when I sober up after a binge. 

I experienced withdrawal quite a few times. It would normally be after a few days binging, where I'd have got through litres of vodka and anything else I could get my hands on. The first thing I'd notice when I started to sober up was how tired I was - I might not have slept in three days. The lack of sleep would get so bad I'd start to hallucinate; incomprehensible muttering at the edge of my hearing, voices calling me from the next room. After that the sweating would start. I'd sweat right through the sheets to my mattress. Then the shakes, the anxiety, and the fear. Eventually, despite all that I'd start to nod off; and that's when the real fun started. For some reason the visual hallucinations only started just as I was falling asleep. I'd be jerked back awake by a feeling of intense fear. I'd see shadow figures, insects and spiders. On the worst occasions I could feel them too. Crawling over my arms. And this would go on for hours and hours and hours.

Hope you all are safe out there! 

After trying everything for 4 years and constantly relapsing, I’ve come to realize (through various books and podcasts especially This Naked Mind and other scientific resources) that up until now I have been in a constant internal war with myself. 
Consciously I want to stop drinking more than anything else in the world (as in, I would rather achieve sobriety more than any other life goal from advanced career to having a child) - subconsciously, the alcohol demon is still roaring and shows his ugly face every single day. 

Somehow, “I” subconsciously still believe that I am missing out or that alcohol is amazing and needed in social situations or to have fun and bla bla. I am working hard every day to prove myself wrong. The last 2 times I relapsed, the experience of drinking was not really amazing, AT ALL. It didn’t taste good, I didn’t get that “high” and I was sadly dealing with severe depressive thoughts the day after. Not to mention vomiting 16 times..

I believe that the key for me to stick with sobriety is to end this tiresome war in my mind and cognitive dissonance. I spend so freaking insane amount of energy every day on the friction between the conscious and subconscious. It goes “I am not ever drinking!” one hour and a moment later I see someone drinking wine in the sun and BAM the subconscious voice comes “I want to drink”. Becoming sober feels like a war and I am the prisoner in my own mind. 

How did you find freedom in quitting? Was it by letting go of the thought of ever drinking again? Or did you tell yourself something along the line that it is a disease and just not an option?

I'm a trans woman, if that matters? Anyway, for about 7 years now I've had this habit of buying a quart of hard alcohol like 45% vodka or whiskey and drinking it over the course of two nights, usually half Friday and half Saturday.

Before I transitioned it was kind of a defense mechanism, a way to get out of my head, and would honestly sometimes transcend even that limit and go to ""most of a quart one night, the rest of the quart + beer the following night"", and my biggest memories of those times was waking up wondering who the hell I needed to apologize to, who I called at 3am bawling my eyes out... I'm not proud of that.

When my quality of life started improving through transition I told myself that drinking was mentally ""Healthier"" now since I was happier while doing it. So, the ""Quart every weekend"" habit continued.

My dad was an alcoholic. and because of that I was always scared to talk about the elephant in the room. I kept telling myself ""well I'm not drinking every day, I only drink 2 nights of the week"" but if you spend the rest of the week just... waiting for the next weekend so you can get wasted, is it any better? No, I don't think it is.

It was in recent years that I started to notice that I wasn't getting ""as drunk"" from what I was drinking, but I was still waking up feeling like a pile of sunbaked crap, and not really remembering what I was doing. Or at least not all the details. I would justify this to myself by saying ""well, a missed convo here and there isn't a TOTAL blackout!""

Fuck I'm good at rationalizing it. lol. Anyway... I have a very good support friend and while I havent really quit fully yet, I did go from a quart of hard liquor every weekend to, so far, a pint of hard liquor every few weeks. so... half the liquor in half the time.

I'll never forget the stunned silence of my friend when I told her i go through a quart in two days. I felt so shitty, so guilty, i hated feeling that way and I never want to feel it again.

So yeah, hi. I'm gonna stick around for a while. And work on bringing that ""pint every few weeks"" down to ""none"" because those few weeks of being sober, of waking up sunday morning feeling fresh and rested is... alien, but amazing.

Things have improved slowly. I haven’t lost a huge amount of weight, grabbed a swanky new job or risen from depression like a phoenix with a new lust for life. What has happened though, has been small, incremental and consistent improvement. I can concentrate again. The numbing haze of alcohol has left my mind. I am there for other people and I remember conversations (sometimes better than others - who knew that could happen?!). My memory is improving and I’m gaining more from the studies I’m undertaking in lockdown. Occasionally, I even get the answers right now, or at least remember why I got them wrong.

I don’t stink of booze anymore. My academic tutors have since mentioned they could smell it on me whenever I had meetings with them and it’s no wonder I was struggling.

My relationship with my partner is better than ever. I’m not lying to her anymore. I don’t hide neat vodka in water bottles in every crevice in the flat, in the plants outside, in the boot of my car. I don’t chug it neat as fast as I can to give myself another fix in the five seconds I have whilst she goes to the bathroom or gets the doorbell. 

The small number of friendships I have maintained have strengthened significantly because I’m no longer a liability bringing nothing but worry into their lives. I’m getting back to my old funny self and I’m helping organise online social activities like board gaming to get us together again now we live all over the UK.

Today, before my other friends joined out voice chat for a virtual board game, my best friend since school who is recently engaged asked me to be his best man at his upcoming wedding. People haven’t really mentioned enormously that I have changed except my close friends because I was very good at hiding my drinking, but he was aware of the vast majority and the state I’d ended up in. He knows I went to rehab in November of last year and that I’m still sober. It was the first real boost to my confidence that others have noticed these small changes like I have. 

He doesn’t think I’m a liability anymore. 
He has the confidence in me to pull off something important for him on such a memorable day. 
Of all the people he could put his trust in, he picked me.

I was working directly for an executive since June 2018. A Director of Operations started under this executive in October 2018. I was assigned to work for him as well. My executive was very accusatory, demanding, and not sensitive to my diagnosed depression & anxiety. In July 2019 I pitched a job to my Director of Operations to work for him. It took a lot of work but the job was created, I applied, and I got it late December. My executive wouldn’t allow me to start until March 1st. I was thrilled to finally have a supportive boss who wanted to help me grow. I was still supporting my executive as well because she had not found a replacement for me. Fast forward to May, my new boss who I love says he’s leaving. I can’t be mad, he got a great opportunity. His last day was May 29th. Now I’m back working for the executive doing my current job, old job, and some of the DOO work leftover. There will be a replacement DOO at some point, but not sure when. I just got out of a team meeting with her and the first thing I said was “I need a drink.” I’m not going to drink - I actually start and outpatient treatment program tonight - but having to work for this woman is definitely something that is going to be a trigger I can’t avoid. It’s not permanent, but I’m newer in my sobriety and could use some advice on coping strategies to help me get through the next few weeks. I’m single, live alone, and don’t have much interaction with people now that we are working from home indefinitely, so when the feedback I consistently get is harsh or “why did this happen” instead of “can you tell me what happened”, I know it’s not good for me. My outpatient small group will help, but I’d love any other suggestions for how to deal with triggers you can’t really avoid, even if they are short term. I don’t want to quit because I love my job and she won’t be my boss forever, but could use some interim help. Thanks sober family! IWNDWYT!",1

I stopped drinking on Mother's Day so hope to go at least the rest of the summer without booze and see where things go from there.

I graduated college a few years ago and lived in a party house.  People came over and I hosted probably 12 or so a semester. So I think people viewed me solely as someone who had a house to get wasted in and since I no longer live there, they stopped talking to me as I provided zero value otherwise.

Since you all have stopped drinking, have you all figured out that there are ""drinking buds"" and also ""real friends"" who stick around and actually keep talking to you when alcohol isn't involved?",8

Anxiety through the roof. Diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis, and from what I'm reading, the prognosis isn't great. 33m","Recently went on a 2 month bender, culminating in incredible binge drinking during my final week of drinking. Using an at-home breathalyzer, I blew a .360. That's when I told my husband it's time to go to the ER, because I honestly hardly even felt that impaired. 

My drinking career however started far before then. Since about 2010 I was a pretty heavy drinker. Legal issues got me 100% sober for a little over a year from 2014 to like May 2015. From there it gradually started back up again. 

After a few months, there weren't many days during that time period I did not drink. However, I have a breathalyzer on my car, so during weekdays my drinking was fairly limited, as I work an 8-5 job and need to blow 0.00 every morning. 

Then quarantine happened and I was working from home, and that requirement went out the window. That's when the bender started. 

The ER only kept me there for about 8 hours, determined I was stable, and released me (with a considerable amount of booze still in my system). 

I brought myself down from that .360 to a .000. It was awful. I met with my doctor and he prescribed Librium to get through the withdrawals (lifesaver). However my bloodwork was bad. 

AST: 319

ALT: 241

He's thinking Alcoholic Hepatitis. However I have to wait a full 19 days to get a liver ultrasound, and then 6 more days to meet with him to go over results. I'm terrified. 

I've been completely sober since the incident (1 week! and will 100% keep it that way). I have had little to no symptoms pointing at cirrhosis, but who really knows. I'm 5'10, 180lbs, and after the initial withdrawals I'm feeling pretty normal. No bloating, no swelling, no jaundice, etc.  

Not looking for medical advice, but I'd love to hear some stories of anyone else who has gone through this.

Her eyes looked dead like she she had no soul she was void of emotion. It was a look in her eyes I seen many time usually after that point she would start being abusive towards me.

We were friends for 10 years and when she drank she was a mean drunk. Called me fat, a slut, told me nobody liked me and spat at me. I always forgave her and thought we all do dumb things when we’re drunk. Over the years the abuse got worse and I cut ties with her. She would then call me when she was drinking and be rude. Her drinking really affected me the words she would say and the choices she made hurt. Seeing that last night just made me feel so much better for not drinking. I’m usually not a mean drunk but I can be insensitive, I never want to get that point. But I have been so drunk that my eyes go dead and I feel nothing.

I was so proud of my one year of sobriety man, so proud and I blew it all away because I was so anxious of working, putting myself out there again. I downed 2 beers in one go and went to my first day. As you can imagine I crashed HARD after about 4 hours into my shift. I got beer heavy and tired and felt my guilt and anxiety creep up. I finished work, the day was fine, I stopped at the gasstation to get smokes and a quick lunch oh and yeah, a bottle of vodka and a 12 pack. Downed it all that day and night. I always was a binge drinker, it was my issue. I didn't drink every day but boy that first sip was my rabbit hole. The more I drink the more thirsty I get. The intention always is ""oh just a few to set the mood"" but I just can't stop. I can't. Oddly enough it was easier to manage ""none"" than ""just one"". And here i am again. My first 24h. And I just hate life. Called in sick on my second day because the hangxiety and physical hangover were too much. Pretty sure I'll get fired lol. Typical. Well here we go again.

I've been on here before and managed to stop drinking for a month, when I did a month I rewarded myself with a few drinks with friends which I didn't really enjoy. 3 years later I'm back here again. 
Before lockdown I was doing ok(ISH). I wouldn't drink Sunday-Thursday but then would get drunk (10 beers or so) on both Friday and Saturday nights. 
Since lockdown my drinking has increased a lot. Most week nights I would drink at least 4 beers but usually 6. Then I would still go mad at the weekends. I can easily drink 12 beers and still not feel drunk. I also started drinking spirits as I realised I could make a GandT and have it 70% gin without my fiance noticing. I've gained loads of weight and my skin is bad. My anxiety is also massively increased. I'd wake up every morning thinking I'm not going to drink today but by 4 I'd be on the bevs again. 
I've also been smoking quite a bit of weed, 3-4 joints a day of high quality hash. 
I've managed to have 5 days off both now. My sleep has been shit I'm angry a lot and my brain feels really foggy. 
I'm not going to drink today but I have the cravings already. 
Hope anyone reading this is having a great day and enjoying being sober/on the way to sober.

2020-06-05 08:09:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gx3cme/a_long_post_for_my_2nd_anniversary/,A long post for my 2nd anniversary,"I honestly didn't see myself getting this far. Someone I used to be in love with once told me ""some of the worst words you can say are 'never' and 'always.'"" That saying always stuck with me & I try to avoid using those 2 words. Especially when talking about what lies ahead. Absolutes are terrifying. So I wasn't one of those people that said ""that's it, I'm done. I'm **never** drinking again."" Cause those words terrified me. It was ""for a while"" cause that was what I needed to hear. I didn't say it for anyone else's benefit. It's what I needed to hear at the time. I needed an out in case I failed. That safety net of ""for a while"" was what made me comfortable to take the initial steps of the tight rope walk.

I didn't find myself hitting rock bottom. I stayed in the grey area. Did I drink more than most people? Absolutely. But I was able to hold down jobs & relationships. I was fine, I just liked to party. I'm a bartender, it's market research, right? I'm young & in my twenties. It's punk AF to be this way. Excuses, etc.

Rock bottom as a concept breaks my fucking heart these days. Not only because it's a fellow human at what they feel is the absolute lowest point, that things can't get worse for them. But what really breaks my heart is the people in the grey area that aren't going to think about quitting until they get to that point. That grey is just getting slowly darker & darker. They might not even notice it happening cause it's subtle. It's not bottom. And it's always talk of rock bottom being the turn around point. When your at the bottom, your only way is up. Just constantly getting worse until or drifting in that void is gut wrenching to me. Bottom might be liver failure. Or a car wreck. Rock bottom might not be a place they can come up from. They might leVe a corpse there. And they won't ever think about turning around before.

I remember the first night I thought about sobriety. I was on a road trip to Texas from California. We were in Austin for a few days & drove out to Port Aransas. The drive out there was fucking miserable with traffic, I was hungover, the air like soup. And when we got in, there were no hotel vacancies because of a sand castle competition iirc. We unsuccesfully tried finding campsites. I remember driving on the beach right on the coast looking for sites when the tide comes in and starts to drag the car out. We barely made it out. When we finally found a place to stay my first action, and I mean first action, was to get drunk. We took acid later that night and went to the beach. I was miserable. I remember sitting on that beach while my friends were loving it. I didn't feel it. I'd taken acid plenty of times before & it just wasn't doing it. I just sat there mad and thinking how I felt ""sober"" and hating it. And that's when I realized I couldn't think of when the last time I was actually sober outside of a work shift in 7 years. I drank daily. I smoked weed to fall asleep nightly. I did cocaine more nights than not to get myself going(or some mornings to wake up).

I was 25 and I didn't know what it felt like to be myself. Just my true, unadultered self... for my entire adult life.

But that's not when I quit. I went another 2 years with two nagging voices. One saying ""you have a problem"" and the other saying ""but sobriety isn't going to stick if you don't hit bottom."" Because that's what I had always heard. I knew where I was heading. I could see the tracks leading off a cliff and I was passing stations where I could get off, but I stayed on the train. Because I had heard so much about hitting bottom and that being there... that was where you turned around.

It took 2 years of internal conflict. I was dating someone and our entire relationship was based around getting plastered together and fucking each other's brains out. One night she said our drinking wasn't helping her depression or anxiety and her bulimia started to resurface. I also had mild depression, am still fairly anxious, had a lot of health/weight issues & hearing someone say something just tipped the scale on my internal debate. So I quit... ""for a while""

I had work to do before I actually liked myself. I stayed fucked up all the time because I didn't like who I was & feeling the way I did. So I took the easy route by numbing myself and putting it off. Quitting drinking didn't change those feelings, but it gave me the insight to recognize them, the freedom and energy to work on solving them, the time to do it, but most important of all the feelings of wanting to take care of myself. Substances just numbed me to actual feelings after a few years. Was I sad? Drink to feel better. Angry? Drink to calm down. Happy? Drink to celebrate. Bored? Drink to entertain yourself. I forgot how to feel anything without it. I couldn't feel anything.

The analogy I always use for quitting drinking is the [Allegory Of The Cave.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave) You find that your old life was a lie. That wasn't reality. Adjusting to seeing the real world for the first time is fucking terrifying. But you're out. Free from lies, free from imprisonment. And you start to see the real version of things. I was starting to see the world and myself for what felt like the first time. I could feel again.

Two years in have proven it to be the best decision I ever made. Things aren't perfect, but the difficulty settings have been turned down. The first year was analyzing triggers, avoiding them or learning to cope and pivot. The second year has been learning who I really am as a person. I remember last year coming up on my one year anniversary and I felt fucking INVINCIBLE. The last few weeks leading up today have left me feeling weak. I still work at a bar as a manager & work nights behind the stick. My job closing to shelter in place restrictions left me with no responsibilities and not having the gym left me with no outlet. I often semi-joke that [""The Iron""](https://www.oldtimestrongman.com/articles/the-iron-by-henry-rollins/) is my higher power because of how much it has helped me. Losing that outlet and my connection to my high power was crushing. I had to ask my roommate to get rid of all alcohol in the house. I pride myself on being controlled around it, I'm a fucking straightedge bartender, that's fucking cool. But this was a huge blow to my pride. And then watching case after case of police brutality, riots and rise of police state it's... another conversation for different sub... But, it's been affecting me and has been the first time I felt tempted or weak. I have to constantly remind myself how much easier it is to deal with this with a clear head and one less issue to worry about. I'm generally happier, life is easier without it and I can deal with situations so. much. better.
 
To any lurkers who haven't taken the plunge: I'm going to paraphrase from This Naked Mind(cannot recommend this book enough. Read it. Read it twice.) I think the most important thing isn't rock bottom but to ask ""could I be happier or could my life be better without drinking?""

To people just starting out or are quitting ""for a while"": cliches like ""one day at a time"" exist for a reason. Forever is a long time and absolutes are scary, just focus on today, everyday. On that note...

It hasn’t been easy I tell ya ,but y’all already know that.
I think the most difficult part are these hidden triggers. Like music or grilling outside. 
I haven’t listened to much music lately because I usually will sit and listen to music and drink. 
I know it will pass because I’ve been sober before and was able to jump that hurdle. 
Anyway. 
I live with my 2 children. A 17 year old and a 4 year old. The 17 year old is going away for 3 days. He’s 1 of the major reasons I’ve decided to put the beer down. He doesn’t like me when I drink. Can’t say I blame him, I don’t like me either. 
I know I won’t pick up while he’s gone cause I’ve shifted my mindset but I ain’t gonna lie, it is tempting since he won’t be here.

I struggle to have normal conversations.
Just to clarify, it's also like that when I'm sober. Haven't been drinking in over a week.

I understand that it has something to do with gray matter, etc.

It's just...I can't drink in moderate amounts. It always has to be full shitfaced drunk or nothing. And to be honest, I developed pretty early on an unhealthy relationship with alcohol, since my dad is really on the heavy side with it. So alcohol was always around, it was no problem even as a teen to get as much as I wanted and becoming black-out drunk was in my mind not even that bad. This, combined with like-minded friends resulted in some pretty degenerate evenings. 

When I started going to university, I moved to another place, had to get new friends and I think this prevented me from the worst. Because most of them just didn't drank alcohol. Kind of blew my mind in some way, because I was imaging my time with roommates at university as this constant drinking party, but everybody was fine with one/two drinks for the whole evening. While me on the other side, after starting there is no stopping. This of course led to some pretty stupid shit I've done, like totally embarrassing me. Became more and more ashamed of my drinking habit and started more and more to drink on my own. I managed to stop drinking daily, but still have my binging every now and then. And the shame/guilt is always there the next day and my mind is kind of mushy.

My biggest fear still is losing contact to some people when I stop drinking, but I guess my own health and well-being should be placed first. So this is basically it. Thanks to everybody who read it, I just want to write it out to make this commitment, and not only say it to myself when I wake up hungover.

Background information: I am 25, and used to drink enough to get by the night since I was 19, all these years I had tons of fun while drunk. Lately, 2 years after my mother passed away, I find my self drinking and having uncontrollable emotions that vary from guilt to aggression come out on surface. I get shitfaced drinking just half a bottle of whiskey, and sometimes I go home to act psychotic about shit that bothers me to my father. I'm afraid I might hurt someone, and next day after drinking I sometimes feel depressed. I used to enjoy drinking, why can't I do it now? By the way I also broke up from a long term relationship.

I really want to enjoy alcohol like a normal person again, does anyone have knowledge on why I can't? Does it have anything to do with my brain or psychology? Even if I'm feeling happy one day if I drink I will enjoy it to a certain point until time flows and I overcompensate again.",2

That was on May 2nd. Haven't drunk any alcohol since then. Almost gave in last week, though. Bought a bottle of champagne and thank god I poured it out. Man, my thought patterns can be so fucking perverse sometimes! Like, I read the Big Book and just ended up enjoying the stories of people's crazy binges and started craving booze again....either that or alternately read those same stories and wanted to get really lost in drinking so that I could hit an even lower rock bottom than what happened three years ago, so that I could really get my shit together. That is some seriously twisted logic! Hard to stay sober with the pandemic and everything being shutdown and now the past week-plus of protests and police brutality....I got back into looking at porn, instead. Felt awful, as usual, afterwards, and joined PornFree. Tried NoFap years ago, and that worked for a little while but then I just got super depressed without any replacement for the dopamine hits. Trying to stay off both booze and porn is my ultimate goal, but I think I might have to get back on anti-depressants in order to live that way for any extended period of time, and that is super disappointing. Really don't want to be dependent on pharmaceutical drugs, but it's better than getting back into my porn addiction. And even though I've succeeded more re: booze than porn, I'm even more scared of getting back into drinking, for numerous reasons - whether or not that's objectively sound, it's my personal opinion that booze is worse for me than porn.

How easy it is to rationalize that we're doing all the ""right"" things--kids, home, work--but living with the shame of not being our best selves. We commiserated about hiding bottles, mystery bruises, and drunk text messages. We laughed about how to navigate single, sober dating--I've got kids and don't drink, wanna come over and ""fix my washer""?

At the end of the call, I still wanted to have a drink. But I thought about my new friend and, if she could get through her first day, I could get through one more day with her. And we both did it! I mean, we're both still under a week, but we both have more days now than either of us have had in years.

I need a place to talk to people who have replaced this habit with something better. I know it can be done, I just feel like I might be better able to reach my goal of sobriety if I can talk to someone who has already done it.

Thank you for taking the time to listen.",11

I have had so many disappointing birthdays not simply because I was hoping for something to happen but also I hate thinking about another year passed, another year wasted, another not-a-damn-thing accomplished. 

Alcohol let me turn off that switch for that day and I stopped getting that sick feeling in my gut until the next day where it poured over which was fine for me because at least it wasn’t on my actual birthday. 

I both feel like I need to be special and forgotten. I hate my birthday. I hate how envious and reflective I become which ultimately leads to dejection. Fuck this so hard.",13

It was awful. I cried out, freaked out, and flung my hand all around, getting blood all over the kitchen and aggravating my then-boyfriend. He had to drive me to the ER because we couldn't get the bleeding stopped. 

In the ER that night I was a teary, whiny, blubbering, nervous wreck. The ER staff was clearly annoyed. I thought back then that they were real jerks who had forgotten the concept of bedside manner. Today, I have a better understanding of their response. They may not have been the kindest, but drunk people are pretty obnoxious and I don't know that I could have acted better were I in their place.

Today, I had to seek out urgent care for the first time since I've been sober. Why? Because I went to the fridge to get a drink (of Coke Zero!), and when I grabbed a glass pitcher, it slipped, broke on the fridge shelf, and then shattered on the floor. My thumb got sliced open, deep. Yeah, I'm still trying to work out the mechanics of how that happened...Anyway, four stitches later, I'm back at home and relaxing.

This is the sort of clumsiness I thought I'd said goodbye to in sobriety. Maybe not. Oh well. Because I was sober, I was able to calmly navigate my feet out of the mess of glass, calmly grab my thumb to apply pressure, and calmly get to the clinic. Because I was calm, when a nurse noticed my Doctor Who shirt, I was able to pass the time by chatting with her and lamenting the fact that there aren't any Cons this season. Because I was calm, I was able to relay effective information to the medical staff, and I was able to exchange masked smiles with everyone there.

Sobriety may not stop shitty things from happening, but it can radically change how you handle them. Sober on, folks.",246

It’s been a journey. After 6 years of being drunk all the time and destroying everything, I’m finally starting to get my shit together.

I don’t know, man. When I was drinking I always had girlfriends, or casual hookups, or whatever. Now, 8 months sober, it’s just so hard. I’ve been on so many dates. Obviously in March and April I didn’t because of COVID, but over the last few weeks I’ve gone on two “social distancing” dates with girls I met on Hinge where we walked around the park and wore masks.

I’m sooo awkward on these dates. I just feel so uncomfortable in my own skin. I just got back from a date and going into it I felt so confident. Fuck it, right? I wore a nice shirt, shaved, picked my best mask. Then as soon as I saw her, she was so gorgeous, I just froze up. We talked for two hours, which seems good but I just kept running out of stuff to say and grasping at straws. Eventually she said she was hungry and had to go. 

It’s not looking like there’s going to be a second date, but I don’t know. I feel bad about the missed opportunity, but I guess I’ve kind of accepted that things are gonna be bumpy as I adjust to this new life.

For six years of prime adolescent time when my brain was forming, I was totally fucked up. In a lot of ways, I still have the brain of a 17 year old. And the same maturity level. I get that it’s gonna take some time to figure things out.

I don’t know what I’m really getting at here. I just feel kinda sad and wanted to rant! Hope you all are well and are staying safe. I read this forum every day and it helps.",38

Could I expect things to get much worse? Or if you don’t really get bad withdrawal in first few days is it generally is ok?

Decided to try drinking responsibly about a month ago - didn’t like it so I started drinking like I used to drink (makes so much sense). I did some pretty awful/scary things in my 20s while drinking, but by my 30s I fell into a pretty standard routine of 6-10 beers every other night. No black outs (for the most part), no driving, no embarrassing texts or phone calls. Just a beer or two and then chasing the buzz the rest of the night before ending up in bed bloated and tired and disappointed. 

Wake up in the morning - groggy, headache, anxious, gut rot - swear to quit drinking and reset my counter. Grind my way through the day - hollowed out, no joy, no energy, not nearly as sharp as I need to be for my job - eat a shitty dinner, yell at my kids, end up in bed exhausted by 7p. 

Wake up feeling fresh (for the most part) and promise myself that I won’t drink. Sometime between mid-morning and afternoon start thinking about a drink - butterflies in my stomach and a tingle a little lower. Somewhere in the back of my head I hear a voice (mine) “Don’t. It’s not worth it. You’ll feel like shit. You know this. You promised yourself.” Shut that voice up. Back on the porch with a beer to listen to the same old songs and have the same old conversations and get in the same old fights with my wife. Ignore the kids and the rest of life passing me by.

I just found this sub today, as I'm currently nearing the end of day 4 of not drinking after at least a year of never making it this far. I have never considered that I have a drinking problem - it's never affected my job or life too immensely outside of feeling groggy every once in a while, but through the pandemic I've noticed that I've been drinking every single day to try and cope with pretty severe generalized anxiety disorder. I also suffer from mild depression and over the last month, it's felt like my anxiety and depression have been winning more often than not in the battle for productivity and happiness. I've been sleeping like shit but still managing to exercise and show up to work, but would go to sleep so stressed and wake up feeling completely unrested and even more anxious than the day before. Every few days I've burnt myself out by doing the bare minimum because my brain is so tired, and I'm so sick of it!  I'm sure a lot of folks are going through similar routines right now. Drinking provides such a short-lived relief, but then exacerbates everything so quickly and puts me in a vicious cycle that I haven't been able to break. I quit cigarettes after smoking for 10 years 4 weeks ago and have picked up jogging and gotten back into strength training, and I decided that I'd start off June with not drinking just to see how I feel since I feel so proud and healthy ditching the cigs. 

After 4 days, my headache and very tender emotions seem to feeling better. I haven't really noticed much of a difference yet in my sleep, but I feel like I'm almost there.

I have been drinking pretty heavily since fall 2016 where I would drink about 30+ a weekend at college. But once I turned 21 and more access my use slowly built up to a lot more frequently and also a lot more drinks per sitting up to the point of 60-75 a week depending so I talked to my psychiatrist and got on naltrexone and for about a month and a half to 2 months I was pretty much sober I might have had a 6 pack once or twice in that span. Then once the virus hit I slowly started abusing it again now to the point where I’m back to drinking 50-75 a week with maybe 3-4 days in between if I am lucky. I almost checked my self in to a detox place this morning but once I woke up and was sober I was too scared to go and didn’t want to lose my job over this but I feel so fucked. Like I got a liver test a year ago and my numbers were normal but they have been high in the past. But I’m sure if I got a test right now I wouldn’t like what I saw. I just want to know how long it would take for my liver numbers to get back to normal or did I already fuck it up to much.,3

Medication is there. It does not alter you. Find something that works and stick to it, but the advances in medicine are there. We live in 2020, not 1930.

I’m talking, once in a blue moon, a couple weeks in. I did try Sinclair also but it wasn’t effective for me but I’ve done a ton of research on it and I wish it was. But stick with it. 

My dad is a doctor and we ran these medically supervised trials, so I am very fortunate to have that support but I’m telling you: this will work for you. I was hopeless. I also NEED to stay connected, this wasn’t a magic pill, but by God it helped.

(Long story!),"Long time lurker, first time poster.  42 year old bartender here, been a moderate and mostly daily drinker for about as long as I can remember, but especially in the last 8 or so years.  After revealing to my husband in October of last year that I was so drunk while driving home from work one afternoon that I didn't remember the telephone conversation we had, I knew I needed a change.  I would try cutting down and moderating, but it was so easy to just catch a buzz at work that I would give myself excuses to put it off.  I found myself doing all kinds of ""typical alcoholic"" stuff - sneaking drinks, hiding bottles, etc, and while my intake wasn't enormous (maybe 10 drinks a day at the height of it), it was clearly impacting me in a negative way.   By the end of the year I found myself becoming anxious and afraid of seizures or serious WD symptoms if I didn't get a drink in by noon.  I made a plan to taper off and stop drinking at least for a month in January (although I secretly hoped I would last longer), and stuck to it.  I went to SMART meetings, started really digging into this subreddit, and read This Naked Mind.  I opened up to several friends about my struggle, and I made it 97 days before having some drinks on my birthday.  I was really enjoying being sober!   I was nervous about having those drinks, but I was able to convince myself I wouldn't end up in the same place I was before (imagine that!).  

I managed to keep up my sober streak after my birthday for the most part, and was SO grateful to be sober during this quarantine period. By mid-May, my comfort level with having a glass of wine here and a margarita there caught up with me, and here I am again sneaking drinks, obsessing over the amount of booze in the house, drinking myself to sleep, and waking up feeling like shit.  I have only been at this point for a few weeks now, but I know it isn't where I want to be.  I'm trying to set a start date again, and hoping to find that feeling of clearheadedness and peace of mind I had in the first three months of the year.

This stupid addiction is even trying to tell me to go back down to 10mg, which I know is a bad idea, but it doesn’t mean the urge isn’t there.

I'm in the US and he's in the UK. He's been sober for many years and is very open about it. A talk we had once almost two years ago (that he didn't even remember having) stuck with me. He wasn't judgy at all, just wanted to make sure I was ok, and I got the message that he noticed I had a problem. It was the beginning of the end of my drinking. 

In January of this year I was going to my first Sales Conference sober. If you haven't been to one they are MEGA booze fests. I knew he would be there and so I found him at all of the social activities and we bonded. It was exactly what I needed and it got me through the week clean, rested, and happy. 

This weekend I hit 9 months and was having my little happy sober party with my BF. Yesterday I noticed I had a missed call from my coworker but when I found it, it was too late in the UK to call him back. I was ecstatic. Obviously he remembered it was my 9 months from like 3 months ago when we last talked. Even if it was a calendar reminder, holy shit, obviously that's why he's calling me! Right? He's checking in on me to make sure I'm ok and still sober and to congratulate me. 

I called him back this morning. He wanted to ask me a work favor. hah! 

He did ask how long it is and check in and make sure I'm staying clean, he's still a good sober pal. I just thought it was hilarious where my brain went vs reality. 

Remember all those little check-ins you make CAN make a difference. All of my sober friends just existing and being happy and sober is what made me realize I needed to try too. Thank you to everyone on r/SD. And before my username comes up, like it always does, I do not now nor have I ever had a problem with benzos. it's just an unfortunate joke from during my divorce.",16

I was sober for over 100 days buthave been off and on relapsing for about 50 days. I kept that a secret from everyone but my girlfriend, who might not be my girlfriend anymore although is still supporting me. I have done so many things I am ashamed of in that short amount of time, generally involving getting drunk and doing shady stuff like stealing and then replacing liquor to stop myself from driving, and also driving not hammered but coming down off alcohol and definitely not sober either. Things could be so much worse. I didn't get a(nother) DUI, and I didn't get fired despite my boss needing me to go to work and calling me when I was intoxicated and him finding out.

Honestly the worst thing is waking up completely hung over and just wanting to be dead. I wouldn't wish that feeling on anyone.

I realize that if I don't drink that these feelings will go away and things will get better, at least in regards to destroying my life with alcohol.

I need to make some major life changes but haven't been making progress towards them. I have several jobs and some stressful personal relationships and what has been happening is that I will try and be productive but eventually I get overwhelmed and drink. I know I need to cut out some things but I am too prideful? to quit anything, despite not being able to function as well as I want even when sober.",2

I don’t want to shout about it too much to my friends and seem preachy. But fk it, I made 100 days, this is huge for me, really happy to have done it!

Its been a bumpy journey, but I’ve enjoyed some awesome benefits along the way

\~ Overall mental health improvements. Memory way better, confidence up and generally feel much more in control and positive about my life.

\~ More $ to spend on useful things, instead of poison. Treated myself to Garmin Vivoactive 4 sports watch with my savings, and I’ve plenty of $ left over.

\~ Weight loss of about 10lbs, would have been more, except for the next point

\~ Discovered the amazing taste of Ben & Jerrys and Haagen Daz icecream, and I feel guilt free about the extra calories. For me it pales in comparison to damage I was doing to myself by drinking poison most days.

Shout-out to following that helped enormously:

\~ This forum, all the posts from people succeeding, people struggling, and lessons people learn along the way. Just having somewhere to vent or to share success, and knowing others are on a similar journey, is massive for me. 

\~ This naked mind and alcohol explained books, really changed my mindset. 

\~ Covid pandemic for removing social pressure to drink!

Thanks to the stories shared on here, I know that I need to remain vigilante, but I’m definitely taking a moment to enjoy this milestone!

2020-06-04 14:46:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gwngyw/my_experience_using_psilocybin_as_a_catalyst/,My experience using psilocybin as a catalyst.,"First off, hello! I’m new here, I’ve been drinking everyday for about 3 years, about 4-8 per day. I know it’s a problem and I need to stop. I’m a 35 year old male with no significant medical history. I once heard a podcast (maybe it was Radiolab?) about the use of psilocybin for addiction treatment. I have experience with psychedelics, and I guess I’d like to share this story in case other people are interested. 

First of all, I have talked to a therapist about my drinking, and I’ve tried to reduce it a couple of times with very mediocre “success”. The therapist was not particularly worried about my drinking, but personally, I am worried. I tried using marijuana as a substitute, (it’s not fun to be high and drunk at the same time, barf) and honestly it kinda worked, but it was temporary. I was definitely able to “figure out” how to drink and smoke, and then I discovered that I was both drinking and smoking. I was not learning how to be sober, and I think that was the problem.

So anyway, I had some mushrooms around the house and I thought I would give it a shot. It was spores mixed with chocolate, and I’m not sure how much was in it, but it was a very heavy dose. I believe the way the treatment experiments were properly done is with the help of a therapist, and supervision during the treatment. I didn’t have that, but like I said, I’ve surfed these waters before. (I also don’t have any history with depression or mental illness, and anyone who does should never try this.)

I won’t detail the experience, but I will say that I definitely experienced suicidal thoughts and that it was a difficult day overall. I did not do this for fun: I didn’t watch any movies or distract myself at all. I laid in bed and focused on my goal: being sober. After about 8 hours of my brain crying for psychedelic mercy, I emerged from the trip. I was exhausted, but I hoped that maybe it would help rewire my brain in a way that would help me learn to live sober.

The results have been underwhelming. I have not drank for 9 days. But it has not been effortless. My SO drinks wine every day, has a wine collection, and a bottle is in the fridge right now. The fact that I am not in a sober living environment is difficult. Eating pizza without beer is difficult. She is out of town tonight, and all the suffering in our world right now is bearing down on me. I found this subreddit the other day, and I think it’s going to help a lot.

If you’re considering using psilocybin as a catalyst, I want to say that there is a high chance that it will not work. It’s not a magic bullet. I have not experienced a significant reduction in desire. The key factors involved in recovering from addiction will continue to be Therapy, sober living environments, peer support, and whatever else the experts tell us to do. Additionally, I think it’s very risky. We still do not understand the brain, and therefore we don’t really understand how psilocybin interacts with it and there’s definitely the possibility of causing harm to yourself. I definitely think that there could be huge medical benefits in the use of this chemical, but until the federal government pulls their head out of their ass and approves scientific experimentation, all we have to work with is anecdotes.

On a positive note, what I HAVE gained is a very powerful experience that has cemented in my mind the importance of being sober. I’m not really sure how to describe it, but it’s kind of like melting away all the excuses and bullshit and all that remained was the inescapable fact that I was taking enormous risks. 

I think that the roots of a tree are here, and if I can get them to grow then I will succeed in conquering this addiction. I wish it was easier, but the truth is that I CAN do it. I can face the world each day, and be someone that other people can rely on for help. I am strong enough to be sober. 

Life is a battlefield, and if we spend too much time being fucked up then we’re going to die early. Whether it’s disease, a car accident, or if the house catches on fire while I’m drunk on the couch, getting drunk can literally kill me. I’m not ready to go yet. I am strong enough to be sober.",6

2020-06-04 14:37:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gwnajz/terrible_nightmare/,Terrible nightmare,"This morning I woke up feeling absolutely disgusted from an awful dream. 

I dreamt that I was back working for a toxic job I left a year ago, doing exactly what I did every day. I got off work and popped open a cold one and drank it all down in a few sips. After I was already done with it, I realized what I had just done. I looked down at the empty can and felt the buzz coming on. A familiar feeling that I used to love... except in that moment I hated it. My heart dropped and I felt nothing but disappointment and disgust in myself. I started thinking about the plans I had made for the next day to go diving, and to the beach, and how I would feel tired and hungover now, and my face would be puffy. I’d done it many times before though, so I just said fuck it. I figured I might as well keep going. So I opened another and drank the bad feelings away. 

That was when my phone rang and I woke up to a close friend’s phone call and told her about it. After our phone call, I checked my I Am Sober app and it read that I am on day 60 as of today. The longest I’ve ever gone. That’s when the relief overwhelmed me and I almost cried tears of joy. 

This just goes to show how we are never “cured” of this disease, no matter how good we feel or how far we go. It’s important to stay humble, and keep a good support system. 

With everything going on in the world, times have been heavy lately. I am so thankful that I have a clear head and heart to deal with everything in a healthy way. 

I am immensely grateful for this sub. I read posts here every day like it’s the daily newspaper. Thank you all for sharing, and being there. I could have never made it this far without y’all. 

I’m currently drinking my Yerba mate and eating some fruit and oatmeal while I sit with my dog listening to the rain outside. I will leave later for the beach, after some yoga, feeling 100%. A day that would never be as pleasant if I had been drinking.

My trick is not to think about NEVER drinking but, think of just not drinking TODAY. 

My journey started on May 4, 2010 when I got too drunk on my birthday. I slapped my best friend and sent him home, cussed out my aunt who bought all my food at the party, threw my loving cat to the wall, and cursed the hell out of my older sister to the point she cried.

I also did more things prior like flipping the bird to some cops and got detained in Jail. Fought delivery men for a restaurant beside my favorite bar. I generally became an obnoxious asshole who pretends to be tough with the power of alcohol.

Everytime I woke up with a hangover, I would realize what I did. My friends & family would try to tell me what I did but, I can't bear hearing it and the process of apologizing to everyone I hurt became a shameful experience because when I'm infront of alcohol, I can't control myself.

Until now.

I used the Lockdown to force myself to not partake in any alcohol. I gave away all my alcohol in the pantry. And everytime I wanted to drink, I just acted faster than my thoughts and stopped whatever I was doing and downed a tall glass of cold water until I'm full of water.

Today I lost 5kg just because of abstinence alone. Today I realize that tomorrow when I wake up, there will be no regrets, no apologies, no warrants, no hangover. 

These are the words a kind user in this subreddit told me in one my posts which became a guideline to my change. I hope you can make use of it:

He's not my real dad, adopted me when I was a toddler, and when he divorced my mom when I was a teenager, he pretty much divorced me too. We have never had much of a relationship in my adult life, with the exception of running into each other at bars and getting sloshed together. He was a drunk my whole life, and I was very proud of him when he got sober, about 6 or 7 years ago. I've seen him maybe  4 or 5 times since then. It is what it is.  


But I ran into him today,  while I was working. I do distribution for a local publishing house, have 40+ stores on my route, many of which are liquor stores. And there was my Dad, at noon, sitting in a car outside a liquor store, open beer in one hand and another between his legs, while his buddy was in buying more. I didn't mention it, just a few minutes of small talk before I took off. Texted my brother (who I also have almost no relationship with, who is also a heavy drinker, but is close to my dad) And my brother said ""Yeah, I know. But it's better than heroin.""    


Apparently, dear ole Dad had knee surgery a year or so ago and got hooked on pain pills, and he turned to heroin when the prescriptions ran out. Now he's on suboxone, and has taken up drinking again as a way of fighting withdrawl symptoms.    


Face-fucking-palm!!    


 I told my brother I will pray for Dad, but I also thanked God that I am not involved with these people anymore. Sometimes I miss having a ""family"" but it's times like these that I realize I'm not missing out on much.  You people here, you are all my heroes! Keep fighting!

I read some threads about movies in this sub but didn't find anything useful. Movies like Flight or Leaving Las Vegas are great but I used to watch them while drinking (sort of not drinking alone I guess) and it might be tough seeing them drinking even though I know what the point of these movies is.

I am now 25 and 4 days sober. During my last drinking episode I was so drunk, barely able to walk and surrounded by guys I know.
I know they have instantly ruled me out of being “girlfriend material” because I was acting drunk.

I sometimes wish I was a man still. I wonder if there would be something less shameful about my drinking.

If you are a woman, suffering with this addiction and feeling the societal weight of shame around what you are compared to what you “should” be, i’m here to tell you that you are ok. This isn’t your fault and you are valuable, loveable and incredible.

One day all the qualities which might have driven you to drink so much (for me, a huge capacity for empathy, a sensitivity toward the self and others and a intelligence about everything that is going on in the world), will be the exact qualities that someone will love you extremely hard for and will be the exact qualities that will drive you on to succeed and surpass the weight of your addiction.

I have been a problem drinker for a long time. It is around 10 years since I first admitted there was an issue and agreed to seek help. I'm 44. I didn't consider it a problem for a long time but have done some stuff that wasn't what normal people do and put my kids at risk at times.

I often took the path of least resistance rather then really being honest with my wife. I was gas-lighting her, agreeing to drink responsibly or not at all, telling her this was what i was doing while doing my own thing in secrecy with a lot of success at times.

I am trying to moderate for the nth time although it seems to be working fairly well so far this time.

I will be seeing friends later today that will be drinking, I just have to stay strong and remind myself of this good feeling. I have this good feeling because I haven’t picked up a drink.

They were surprised for sure (as they’re my normal drinking buddies), but commended me for trying to get in shape and healthy. Not one judgement; only positive praise.

In one week I’ve noticed/experienced
-irritability 
-better sleep
-decreased anxiety
-more energy
-better productivity 
-a drive to accomplish things around the house
-motivation
-and my first solid poop in the longest time!! (Apologies for being gross, but this is a win!)

I lurk here on occasion to remind myself that I don't need to drink and that I'm not alone. I'm also trying to lose weight and have been doing intermittent fasting. Down 10 pounds, which is pretty cool.

Don't have too many cravings. I just remember why I'm doing it and why I don't need alcohol anymore. Lots of ""what ifs"", but then I just remind myself that the only day that matters is today. I also mentally remind myself of the tally of the good and bad of drinking, and obviously the bad dwarfs the good by a long shot.

Pot helps. I'm not a huge fan, but at least it's something I can use when I feel like I want to do something ""bad for me"". Something that has minimal repercussions. I can use as much as I want in a given sitting to appease the addict part of my brain, and the worst that happens is that I eat too much and fall asleep. I'll take that over getting too drunk all too often any day. Edit: also I drink an unholy amount of LaCroix. I love the stuff. It's so refreshing and so many flavors to try. Certainly helps.

Anyway, so far so good. Didn't drink yesterday, not drinking today. Keep up the good fight!

I have been joined to this sub for almost a year now, but I rarely lurk and this is my first post.  This may be a novel and for that I am sorry.  I am currently 3 weeks sober.  For a 5 year period from 2009-2014 I was a hard drinker and drug user and ended up in a 8 month rehab.  Since the Summer of 2015 I have been sober for at least 3 periods of longer than a year and have probably been drug/drink free for 4 years of the 5 in total.  I have had multiple ""relapses,"" at least 5, 6, or 7.  My worst was in 2016 - using hard drugs.  Since 2016, my relapses have been with alcohol or kratom alone every time.  For alcohol, the drinking has never lasted more than 2 weeks.  For kratom - they have lasted anywhere from 1 day to a 3 months.  While I have not lost a job or any material things, I did damage my current relationship through hiding and lying about my using.

Since my first rehab I have been in and out of the AA program.  I got sober using AA (and rehab) and my longest stint of 19 months was using AA.  My other 2 ""long"" stints have been about 14 and 12 months and I was using AA.  With all 3 however, I am active in AA for the first 50%-60% of the sober time, and then I start to drop off and skip meetings, slow down on phone calls, etc.

**In the end, the only thing that has worked is AA - although I have not really tried ""other avenues,"" I honestly don't know of any.**  **The issue is....I don't like AA.**  I am not anti-social, but I am an introvert.  I have tried desperately to enjoy meetings for 6 years, and I just don't.  I don't dread them, but I do not enjoy them.  I find them boring and the handful that are OK, I still never want to go to.  I have an amazing sponsor (helped save my life), somewhat of a hard-ass, but a good guy.  His rules are meetings, usually 90 in 90 and then it can slow down, but also to call him and 4 other alcoholics every day.  This does keep me sober, but I am not happy doing it.  I have made the phone calls and meetings for as long as 10 or 12 months in an attempt to adjust and learn to like it, and I never have grown into that.  The entire time, the meetings and calls are just ""check-boxes"" to be checked to make it to the next day.  My sponsor outright tells me that it should not be like this, and I have put in honest effort a few times to try to chance my perception, but it has not worked.  The repeated ""relapses"" and new attempts to just jump back into this intensely busy AA life is just ***exhausting.  I do not want to sound entitled or ungrateful, again, the AA program and community saved my life, but  I feel like I have given it honest efforts to the best of my ability through the years.***  I am often told it is a medicine that I must take/do to treat my disease and it is a small price to pay (meetings, AA, etc). but for me, it feels like a larger price.  I do not want to do something my entire life that I do not enjoy.  I also have a few long-time friends from AA (6 or 7 I feel comftorable talking to or hanging out with), but I do not connect with them as I do some other child-hood/college friends (they do not use).  Either way, I do enjoy time spent with them and they remain in my life.  I know AA and NA do not claim to be the only way to maintain sobriety, but again, it is all that has ever worked for me.

***Has anyone here had success staying sober through other avenues?***  I want to be sober, I know I am an alcoholic.  There is no moderation for me, and if there is, it is a drastic or gentle slope - it always gets worse eventually.  I am not confused about that.  (**On the same token, AA helped save my life, but I do not share many of the black and white beliefs that many people I know in the program do).**  I am just starting therapy and new medicine, but I don' think that alone is enough (although I usually quit therapy when stuff gets better).  My current 3 weeks of sobriety I have been calling my sponsor and people every day and making some meetings...but I just do not want to do it.  Currently I am happy and have no urge or thoughts to use, but this is often the case in my relapses.  I have no issue maintaining sobriety from day 1 usually for at least half a year (AA or no AA).  It usually begins as a gentle slope over 3-6 months before I end up using.  It seems to start with some of my addictive tendencies towards video games or fitness, or some outlet and when that is not enough may move to caffeine and energy drinks, and eventually..alcohol.  ***I should also note that before I relapse I begin to isolate more and turn more of my attention to my current obsession(s).***  Either way, I often fail to notice when my OCD or addictive tendencies flare up.  I usually end up using out of ""boredom"", or some messed up concept of deserving it?  But I think those are just excuses I tell myself, I think I honestly end up using to manage my un-checked anxiety.  This last one I had about 10 months sober and the stress/procrastination involved with my Bachelor's Thesis I think got the best of me.  I never addressed the anxiety or stress with anyone and I ended up turning to kratom.  My GAD and how I handle it are going to be my main focus with my new therapist.  I have a lot of amazing stuff going for me right now.  I just graduated college, I have $$$ in my savings account for the first time, I have a beautiful and amazing girlfriend and we get a new awesome apartment in a month.  I am happy at the moment and I don't want my life to go down a down-hill path.

In my life, I really don't have anyone with addiction issues to turn to, besides my AA community.  While they claim, ""AA is not the only way,"" they are all sober through AA, and while not all, some, including my sponsor believe I am bound to relapse once I tell him I no longer wish to participate in the program.  For good reason, I always have, it is my pattern, it is almost comical how identical my relapses have been since 2016.  Anyways, sorry, this has become a novel.  I am just looking for some input from people who share my issue, but aren't biased as members of my life.

&#x200B;

I truly appreciate any input or advice.  Thank you.",14

Has anyone tried this before? Did it help? Did it make you want to drink more? In my mind i see it similar to trying to quit smoking and taking up vaping instead.

I dont want to cut out seeing my friends, but I know if I am sat there all night explaining why I am not drinking, I wont enjoy myself and will end up caving to pressure.

Family members and even our NICU nurses said “you deserve it after what you’ve been through”, but my husband and baby girl don’t deserve me drunk. 

Especially recently with quarantine and working from home it’s just so easy to drink all day. I got up to a box of wine every 2 days, which is making me look like shit, act like shit and feel like shit. 

My doctor prescribed me lexapro after some serious postpartum anxiety. That plus the wine and I’m basically blacking out after we put the baby to bed. 

Anyways, I spent the last few days weening off so to not shock my system. I feel okay today and am probably ready to give it up. With my gal napping next to me I can’t help but think I robbed myself of some of the time of her first 7 months. But that’s in the past now.

That said, it’s difficult to interact with people on any social media platform without witnessing people using current affairs as a reason to get shit faced. 

Maybe the persons posting these memes and hashtags don’t have a drinking problem. They have mental space to find #2020makesmedrink humorous. They don’t have a DUI. They haven’t lost a job. They haven’t destroyed friendships with alcohol. They aren’t lonely in a soul-crushing marriage. They find levity in the laughs and I should keep scrolling. 

I’m trying to process the state of the world. My city is in chaos. There are nightly curfews. People are dying. There’s so much I want to say, but all I want to do is scream..”I’ve been sober for 18 months!! Please stop making alcohol seem funny and great!!!!”  

How is it that I can speak up about racism and virus safety, but I can’t find the courage to condemn a meme about drinking? 

I want to look the other way, but then, minding my own business is how I got here. It’s how WE got here, as humanity. Looking the other way, not speaking up is the root of so much that’s gone wrong. 

Thanks for letting me rant. I have some feelings to process today. The world doesn’t revolve around me or my sobriety. I need to get over myself and go for a walk.

I'm not sure if this is the right place to pose this question, but I thought I'd give it a go anyway as I do spend time reading here and honestly feel so privileged to read everyone's very personal stories and the subsequent positive responses and I am silently cheering everyone on in their journeys!!!!.

My question is, as a wife of an alcoholic, what are some of the best ways to support my husband during his sober journey?

(Read on if you want more info):

We have been together for 10 years and alcohol has always been a part of our life. I stopped drinking 3 months ago (admittedly I am not addicted, just knew that drunk me was not a good mix with drunk him and I wanted to start a change for myself and our family). He continued drinking, which I expected, but not long after that he admitted that he had a problem. I honestly never thought I would hear those words come out of his mouth so I carried that with me as he continued drinking day in, day out, knowing that change will come for him in time.

Cut to: tonight. I JUST found out that he has been trying to quit booze (2 days now) and now all of his recent outbursts make so much more sense! He's been so agitated and cranky but I feel like if I had known he was trying to make this change I would have held back a little when we argued tonight. He ended up leaving and got a couple cans (which he said was WAY better than his usual order and I totally see that that's a HUGE win for him!) because he didn't know how to face the stressful evening without it and now I feel fucken awful thinking I should have just let the silly argument stuff go and maybe he would have made it to day 3.

Also, I'm silently pissed that he didn't tell me his plan (as selfish as it sounds, but a heads up would have been nice because withdrawal is a thing!) because now I feel like I haven't had his best interests in mind when he was feeling irritable. And I know he didn't tell me because he doesn't want the added pressure, but honestly, I believe this is HIS journey and I would never hold it over his head if he caved. I want to help hold him UP so he doesnt feel the need to cave!!!!!

Anyways, any advice/input is much appreciated and I wish you all strength and good health.",1

I recently went through a pretty bad breakup of a three year relationship, and at one point had a moment of weakness and drank. Luckily I pulled myself back up right quick. Because of that decision I was able to distance myself from her, and start making the moves I needed to get my life back together. I moved in with my folks, resumed classes at the local community college and started looking for places to live. Last week, I volunteered at the food bank for a day. I’m a service industry worker, and I’m making more on unemployment than I ever have working, but I’m not a total POS, so I try to help out a bit yah know? Anyway, I go and pull a shift, and the girl I’m volunteering under is a few years older than me and seeming pretty badass. We’re talking about seeing concerts, mtn biking, backcountry skiing (all this shit I can actually do now because I’m in the best shape of my life because I stopped drinking and started doing calisthenics for like half an hour a day) and apparently she thinks I’m kinda cool and gets my number and says she wants to hang out later.

I think, oh well, who doesn’t wanna meet new people let’s go. I get to the beach and talk to the food bank girl for a bit and then her boyfriend shows up and then her cousin shows up and I kid you not she’s a Disney fricking princess. She’s into my type of hippy holistic shit, has perfect teeth, hikes, cooks, bikes and holy cow I’m over the moon! The three of them enjoyed a glass of wine and I politely excused myself from drinking and I think I saw a little admiration in her eye when I said I didn’t drink.

After reading Allen Carr’s book Quit Drinking Without Willpower, i thought that no way would quitting be that easy. Yet, here I am at 6 weeks. Just waiting for the axe to drop at some point...

I’ve kept my sobriety fairly quiet so far with only a handful of people in the loop. I guess I don’t want to have to explain my decisions to others that are so committed to a drinking lifestyle, as if it’s part of their identity. I mostly struggle with the idea of telling my family of my decision since they’ve come to know me as a drinker. They see me moving in another direction becoming different, but it’s only because I’ve been working hard on myself in every way, getting inspired after meeting my bf (30M) last year. He’s a bit quiet and my parents don’t quite understand him yet, so they’ll likely blame him for “manipulating me” which they’ve expressed before... 

He had been really concerned about me when we started dating because I’d forget conversations we had, sometimes really deep meaningful discussions that I feel guilty for not remembering. It was always embarrassing, waking up the next morning with a sinking feeling like a dog with its tail between its legs, wondering what I did wrong the night before. I noticed friends losing touch and I felt paranoid that it must be something I did wrong and despite bringing it up to try and smooth it over, the friendships would fade. Was it the booze? I still have no idea. I tend to get vulgar, brash and outspoken about my opinions. I become a bully. After my trauma, I learned to be vocal and that the more assertive you are, the less people fuck with you. You quickly filter out opportunists and only those with true intentions remain. I regret this perspective and approach for Im sure it prevented some really great relationships from happening :( 

My boyfriend has helped me so much this past year and now I see that booze is not liquid courage but it taints the wonderful person I am inside. Not a bully, just someone who is scared of getting taken advantage of again. I’m trying to learn to love myself and understand that alcohol doesn’t make anything better and it doesn’t make me better. 

This weekend I’ll be seeing my parents while socially distancing at their house in wine country... I’m nervous about my strength, if it will hold when I’m around them. I’m worried they’ll judge me and/or ridicule him...yes I could say some excuse to explain it away, but I don’t really want to hide anymore. I just want to be me again",10

This is the longest I have gone without drinking this year alone. I can't think back to a time where I didn't drink until blackout. It's been almost 10 years of drinking almost daily. 

I got my labs back(on mobile app) and it shows that I have at least one organ damaged. Whether it's my liver, Kidneys, or heart, something is upset. I see my doctor in two weeks to see how I'm doing without alcohol and to follow up on lab work.

Started with just a few, then after I got a job it would be 6 a night, and then 8 a night, and then eventually I got a full time work from home job and that is when it got bad. 12 a day, starting in the morning. And then hungover, so would have a beer the next morning. Hair of the dog. Then 12 wasn't enough. I'd buy an 18 pack and nearly finish it in a day. And then a 24 pack and have a few leftover for the morning. 

That was my trajectory starting in 2013 and culminating until just a few days ago.

I recently moved in with my boyfriend and it has been very very difficult. He knows I struggle with alcohol, but he thinks the problem is only half as bad as it actually was.

But it has been a week now since I moved in, and I won't say the craving is gone, but I have been doing so well.

The first few days I would still drink a fair bit. Over the weekend and dealing with the move and bills and stress, still drank a fair bit.

Today, I woke up and didn't drink. I went to get a haircut. I went to the store. I deep cleaned some furniture. I had one beer around lunch and one with dinner.

I have had two drinks today. That is about 14 less than I did on a daily basis little more than a week ago.

I know I need to be careful tapering down. But I feel pretty good right now. My stomach is visibly less bloaty. My skin is less red and dry. And I can actually hop in the car and go somewhere if I need to.

I don't know what the path forward looks like. But last week, that path looked really scary. This week, not so much.

I knew that this situation was coming and I knew that if I was drinking I would not possibly be able to handle the 13 miles a day. Not huge by bicycle standards at all, but for a beginner it’s a little daunting. 

Well I fucking nailed it. I made it there, worked a great shift that I thought I would be absolutely exhausted for, and rode home even faster. I’m proud of myself for that. 

And now here I am once again, trying to rationalize the thought of going to the store and “grabbing just a 40”. I know that if I do this,

1. I’ll do it again tomorrow night
2. I’ll feel like shit and not want to ride my bike to work tomorrow
3. I’ll waste ~$30 on Uber’s tomorrow, plus whatever I spend on alcohol tonight
4. I’ll feel like a complete loser all over again

So why on earth would I consider throwing such a great (however small) day away for something that will literally suck the life out of me?

2020-06-03 19:40:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gw5mds/one_year_sober/,One year sober.,"Since I don't have a meeting to go to tonight I guess I will tell my story here.

One year ago today I was trying to force alcohol into my body while violently vomiting it back up. I knew at this point that if I continued to drink it would kill me. Prior to this I had about 9 months of sobriety and was feeling the effects of the disease of alcohol addiction in full force. My tolerance toward alcohol had lowered over the past months and I couldn't handle how much I thought I needed. It was a horrible situation where I couldn't get the buzz I wanted unless drank enough poison to kill me. I realized right then and there that I was fucked. I poured out the remainder of the alcohol I had bought, hunkered down in my bed and waited for the withdraw symptoms to start. Spend 3 days getting through that hang over and began the tough process of recovery. 

The only thing I found that works is if I only not drink for one day at a time. If I try to ""plan to not drink"" ahead of time I get thoughts of ""what if this happens"" or ""What if I can't do it"" the key for me was not drinking for that moment. Another hard lesson that I learned was that if I stopped drinking the only thing that happens is that I stop drinking. I still had to deal with emotions, life and tough situations. I have learned a lot this past year on how to deal with anger and sadness. In the past I would just let all those emotions sit and drink them all away. 

I can say this though. My life is better, there are no peaks and valleys emotionally anymore, more like slow rolling hills that I can easily navigate. I have quit smoking and eating out all the time, I attend a gym regularly and have held onto my job. The biggest contributing factor to my sobriety is figuring out what I can control and what I can't. I found that most of my problems in life that contributed to my anger/sadness and to my drinking problem was from trying to control things that I couldn't.  I had to let go of that control to get to where I am today. That's about all I have to share for today. Thank you and IWNDWYT!",185

I still really hadn't made it past a a dinner outing with anyone other than my family since COVID had limited any type of restaurant visiting in my state until recently.  

Anytime we had a dinner out with anyone visiting or just anyone outside of our family circle, whatever part of my reptile brain always decided this was free reign to start getting a buzz at dinner and just drink all night.  

Long story short, we went out to a group dinner with friends to a restaurant my daughter serves at.  So most of the staff knows us pretty well there since my daughter has been working there nearly 4 years.  I ordered my water, and one other party member ordered a beer.  When the manager brought our drinks out, she immediately without hesitation just dropped off the beer in front of me.  That was not unexpected, but quite startling to me... like I really was known as the guy who always had a beer.  I politely corrected her, and just laughed it off... I mean I can't blame her.  She was like I just assumed, I don't think I've ever not served you beer.  Up until that evening, she was absolutely correct lol.  The night resumed, I didn't drink, and I had a really good time.

Today I noticed I’m a few days past a month and I’ve also noticed during the last few days some internal dialog about how I might start up again and what constraints I might put in place if I do. 

Having been to therapy with my wife, we came up with some pretty good ground rules about what would constitute “healthy” drinking which I pretended to follow while secretly getting in as much as I could get away with. Now I’m wondering if I draw a line for myself about honesty and openness around my drinking, should I have another go at the “healthy” drinking  (freely drinking one night a week plus one or two drinks as appropriate at social occasions). I’m really not sure if this will be cool or if will seem like a pain in the ass whenever I’m forced to be sober or if it will end in me lying again and getting divorced. My relationship isn’t perfect and there’s a part of me which thinks that sober me will never pull the trigger because of the short term breakup pain but that I’d be better off blowing up my marriage. Probably the right choice is to be sober longer and be honest with my wife about my reasons for being unhappy with our relationship.

I am getting anxiety attacks from withdrawal. Needing to call out of work more often. I had three years sober then about a year ago I relapsed and have been moving back and forth from some sort of substance abuse since. It’s either pills and no drinking, then drinking and no pills. Then I get some pot for the anxiety, stop drinking for 7 days which helped, but then I had the bright idea to drink AND smoke pot, now I’m getting cross faded and it’s even worse now. I downloaded all of the fancy sober apps and it’s not helping. I attempt to buy a limited amount (only a few tall cans) but end up driving buzzed and getting more every single time when it’s gone.As soon as that buzz hits I lose all control if I had any to begin with. The funny thing is, I don’t even enjoy drinking that much. I can’t stand that bloated feeling and it makes me tired, dumb, and screws up my sex life. I get angry at myself for drinking WHILE I am drinking. I can’t even enjoy it anymore. YET, I still find a way to stop by the gas station everyday and get booze. It’s like something takes control over the steering wheel and I’m just along for the ride. I made a cute little sober calendar on my white board in my room to check off the days, but haven’t had any yet. I have promised my fiancé countless times I would stop, but haven’t. Anyway, I’m getting really upset. Not feeling like myself at all. My sober years were the best in my life and I long to have sobriety again, I know that I can be sober because I’ve done it, but can’t seem to get out of this rut I’m in. Am I making this too complicated? Thanks everyone.",6

It's a HUGE deal to me and it's been a serious operation with a daily plan of attack and an arsenal of tools.  What has helped the most is to write a page or two in the morning, journalling and planning the day, and - CRUCIALLY - anticipating cravings.   I wrote down what Mr Addiction might say to me to try and get a drink.  I wrote down how stupid and illogical his reasons for getting me to drink were.  I told him that I LIKE going to bed sober so he can fuck off with his afternoon grumblings.  He's not getting me to feed him poison anymore because I don't want to.  The part of me that I thought wanted alcohol wasn't ME, not my true self, it was my addicted brain.

I'd been a recreational user since 2010 and still drank and smoke heavily, but it became a daily vice to shut my brain up for a few hours of peace every night a couple of years ago.  

At the suggestion of this sub, I started reading The Naked Mind on 4/14 to help me quit and was reading Candide at the same time before I went to bed.  I didn't even finish The Naked Mind before I had read enough to kick it. And on the same day I sat it down, I finished Candide and in a synchronicity that felt like a sign from the universe, one of the few underlined/annotated lines in the used copy of the book was:

""...we find that the work banishes those three great evils: boredom, vice, and poverty. ...'I also know,' said Candide, 'that we must go and work in the garden.' 'You are quite right,' said Pangloss.  'When man was placed in the Garden of Eden, he was put there ""to dress it and to keep it"", to work, in fact; which proves that man was not born to an easy life.'

I think a lot of my abuse of substances was born from an inherent disillusionment with the world and wanting to ""turn off"" my inner monologue for a few hours everyday, or at least stifle it a bit.  Since I've quit, I'm still a depressive sad sack.  But not as much as I was when I was drinking and smoking all the time.  I'm working on it.  

I tend to have an all-or-nothing mentality, as pointed out to me by several of my past therapists.  But I used to at least channel that into some positive avenues.  Then it started trending towards just negative aspects of my life.  Since I've stopped, I've started reading voraciously again.  I'm studying for the LSAT, and I quit one of my dead end jobs as a bartender.  After stopping lifting in 2018 following 5x a week from 2011-2018, I've been hitting the weights again.  Gained back 16 lbs after only eating 5-6x a week right before I quit.  Skin looks better, I sleep better, I'm a better boyfriend to my girlfriend, and I finally cut people out of my life who were only bringing negative vibes and encouraging my shitty behaviors.

I’ve lost 15 or so lbs. I run 5k, 2 or 3 times a week. I take my anti-depressants. I’m reading again. Novels. Self help. Spend (what feels like) all day everyday entertaining, teaching, serving my sweet 5yo little girl. 

But I feel like I’m lost and dark and falling. I just had a huge fight with my wife, in front of our kid. I don’t even know what about. Built up resentment maybe. We’ve been so distant lately.

I always start back slow then wind up where I started. Sometimes it weeks, other times it's months later. Eventually I always get back to the persistent state of fogginess and only concerned about the next drink, never the current or last. I'm tired of this cycle. 15 years is enough. 

I'm hiding how much I drink from everyone. Others see me drink a few beers and a few glasses of wine, what they don't see are the wine boxes I have hidden in my office, the garage, the car. They are suspicious but I think too afraid to admit themselves that I have a serious problem. I'm too afraid to admit it. 

Over the past year I've developed an undiagnosed condition that I know is related to drinking. The doctors think it's a rib/skeletal condition because I even lie to them about how much I drink. It's a pain below my ribs, on either side, that gets worse after a weekend of drinking. I have another appointment tomorrow to come clean about how much, how often, and hope that I can get the treatment I need. 

I'm depressed when I don't drink, I feel bored and irritable. Today especially. I've done this enough to know it's just a part of the detox process and hopefully goes away after a few more days. 

If you have read this far, thank you. I just needed to put it in writing to hopefully be able to reflect back and hold myself accountable and to have a reminder of why I want to stop.

2020-06-03 13:57:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gvyu6l/today_is_one_year_sober/,Today is one year sober,"I made it.  On June 3rd, 2019, I reported to a hospital after vomiting blood and stomach lining/tissue all night long and almost losing consciousness; My bathroom looked like Dexter had come to exact revenge.  That was the culmination of 30 years of drinking, the last 10 of it blacking out almost every night on a third of a gallon of vodka.

I started out drinking as a way to cope with massive anxiety, fear of getting older and being alone, being gay, work, money, (you name it - I found a reason to drink to it) .  The funny thing is, the alcohol was fueling the anxiety but I never found the courage to stop long enough to discover that.  I haven't had an anxiety attack in almost a full year I guess.

My food was limited to microwave mac-n-cheese after almost setting the house on fire - 3 times cooking while drunk.  The firemen had to come over twice because I was sleeping through the fire alarm.

After 5 days in the ICU and encouragement from this sub, I went to a rehab for 45 days and joined AA when I got home. Did I enjoy sitting in a basement with strangers talking about how I was unable to function as an adult without booze - nope, but I did it anyway.  To the new folks, the amount of courage it takes to walk into your first meeting and admit that you need to be there is not a joke - but put your pride away and do it.  It can save your life.

These days, I'm in better shape (and in better health) than at any point since I left my parent's house after school.  I bought a home, I deal with my problems with a clear head and I can see a future again.  One of worst drinking memories was of me sitting on the couch, vodka in hand, making an internal decision to just say ""Fuck it. The world sucks, I'm going to just sit here and drink until I die.  If that's tomorrow, oh well.""

Before and after - Age 36 (maybe) a bar trip with drinking friends (not really friends) and sober on my 47th birthday less than 30 days ago.  It's been a weird journey but I'm in it for the long haul.  Thank you all!

The boss even let me order food on his account, and he trusted me 100%...

He didn't know I was an alcoholic who was drinking at least half a bottle of Vodka every day that I would buy and drink in the city centre while waiting on my commute... Sometimes I would ""top up"" but I thought I had a handle on it... Then I get given so much responsibility, and he came into the office the next day to... Not a good sight I imagine. (I don't even remember it because I was blackout, and just fell asleep at some point and that was why I was still there the next morning). He had no choice but to fire me, but he was one of the most kind hearted and trusting people I have ever worked for...

I called him today and said how sorry I was and he was honestly concerned about me, even going so far as to say that if there is ever any scraps he can throw my way he will...

Just wanted to let you guys know that even your biggest F ups don't define you... I was hard on myself and thought this guy hated me. He was let down sure, but also sad and understood what I went through.

edit: I know this doesn't go for everyone, so if you want to make peace with yourself, and can apologise, choose your battles.

I’m 18 years of marriage one of our biggest “issues” is he likes to sleep with the TV on - I’ve finally given in in recent years, because it just wasn’t worth the fight (and enough alcohol I’d just pass out anyway).

Drinking wasnt that fun.  Ive had just as much or more fun sober doing the same things.  It definitely took a while, but somewhere along the way my brain rewired the rewards center to work properly while sober.  Drinking really ruins that for you, needing alcohol to have dopamine.  

I got wicked hiccups! I spent most of the drinking time and a couple days after fighting hiccups.  I wanted to punch myself in the face to make them stop.  

Over the next few days, the cravings were back like they never left.  I needed a drink. I felt irritable and the physical withdrawal was not fun, all day at work I couldnt shake the gross feeling.  I started eating a lot of sugar and icecream to kick the cravings (i have found sugar really helps stave off the cravings, at least enough to stop me from buying more vodka).  

Then my skin flared up, broke out with acne and looked aweful. I forgot that beer (and sugar) (and the pizza that I always order while drinking) caused my skin to get nasssty.  

To round it off, my thoughts and social skills have not been as snappy all week, though it's almost back to normal now.  Its like pinging myself for something fun to say, and my subconcious is like ""nope you got nothin').  That sucks.  


So take it from my guys and gals, you will have a Much more fun and fullfilling life once you quit alcohol 100% and allow your brain and body to heal.  We dont need beer or wine to enjoy an evening, and drinking will just ruin the rest of the week and make it that much harder to have fun without it.  

Now someone teach me how to reset my fuckin' day count :(",1436

I started drinking regularly back in September (I had only done so occasionally before that), and as time went on, my habits got worse and worse. I went from a few drinks a few times a week to drinking a lot whenever I had access to liquor. When i came home for Zoom University, I was drinking almost every night. My grades didn't slip, but my hobbies did because I replaced them with getting trashed and watching youtube. Then I turned 21, and I spent three weeks getting sloshed every night. Recently I switched to beer, thinking i could have just one or two and be done, but I would just go to my room after dinner and hit the bottle of Evan Williams. 

At work, I'm exhausted. My recovery from some athletic injuries is slowing to a crawl. My ability to progress in my goal as a writer is quickly vanishing. I feel like a prisoner. Every day I wake up and think about booze first thing. 

Just because I'm 21 doesn't mean I can drink. I can't, apparently. I don't want to see the next thirty years of my life lead to nothing.

I recently reached 1 year sober from alcohol. Around this time, I went off the antidepressant medication I was on. I was also spending time isolated with family (I usually live alone) and wasn't really attending meetings. This combination started to get to me and I could feel myself becoming really REALLY close to drinking.

Came home to my own space, called my sponsor, hit some online meetings, started to feel better, didn't drink. But i decided I wanted to try smoking a joint because I wanted to do SOMETHING. 

So I went to the local, legal, weed shop and bought a joint which I smoked last night. Didn't care for it, as I figured would be the case, so I don't think I'll be doing that again. It maybe helped me not drink as I was still thinking about it... but now I have no desire to do either?

I'm stuck between feeling like this is something I should tell my sponsor about, but also feel like it wasn't a big deal and not something I plan to do again and it would just open up a big can of worms.

I am of the personal belief that people can be in AA, and be sober, and smoke marijuana. Some people don't share this view, which I respect. 

Should I tell my sponsor or just let it go? Are there things you just decide aren't worth bringing up? If I binge on sugar and caffeine for a release, is that not also seeking some kind of a drug for release? (ok im stretching but you get the point)",5

My little brother almost committed suicide last year. 

Understandably our whole family was shaken. We all became closer and he is much better now.

I feel so much anger since. So much sadness. So much guilt. The feeling that I’ve failed as a big sister never goes away. I should have protected him but we almost lost him. I don’t know what I did wrong. How come someone so young can feel so much pain. No one knows why. Everyone he spoke to gets a feeling he didn’t tell them everything, even the professionals. I could tell my big brother anything. I went to him when I had troubles. Why can’t he come to me. What did I do wrong. 
The alcohol makes the guilt temporarily fade away. I feel like I’m drowning, suffocating, but the alcohol is my oxygen, finally allowing me to breathe. I don’t know if it’s a problem. I drink quite a lot when I’m alone in my flat this past year+. Started with a bottle of wine a night. Switched to vodka because it’s cheaper and I’m a student with no money. Didn’t tell anyone just how much. There are phases when I drink less and phases when I drink day and night for 2 weeks straight.
I’d think- I can stop anytime but why would I complicate my life if I know alcohol makes it easier? It relieves the tension. It’s the only way I could think of (that wouldn’t leave scars, though with alcohol I have punched the wall and few times. Left a scar that my brother noticed and added to the feeling of guilt).

Last three months I’ve been home with my parents and little brother due to corona. It was great for the most part. I’m grateful I get to be with them and see my brother so much happier.

Last week I noticed new cuts on his hand, dried blood on his wrists. For a split-second I thought it was red marker and then I noticed/realized and I spiraled. I believe he is so much better than before, he talks about buying things online and plans for the summer, I don’t think he is suicidal, but I still spiraled. I caved in and bought vodka Sunday and drank that night. I haven’t since. I feel guilty with it here. What if he saw it (even though it’s hidden). I don’t want him to see it and to think that if I’m drinking alone then he can too (once he is older). Don’t want him to justify bad habits because I have them too.

I spoke to my mother finally, about the anger the sadness the guilt and the alcohol. It helped telling her.

I’m not drinking anymore.
Not with people (I don’t feel safe) and definitely not alone. We deserve peace sober. 
I’ll find another way. Ill start therapy again. I’ll be a better sister. I’ll find peace another way.

Thank you to this community. It’s inspiring.",33

My BAC was at .3 and I knew I would have dangerously high blood pressure and massive panic attacks. Not to help I was actively suicidal in my gut I knew I had to take it seriously.

I had 5 weeks of sobriety since the last time I was in detox, and I know I can do it again. This year I’ve had a collective 3 months which is more than the last 8 years. Plus I’m only 27.

My liver enzymes are back to normal though from the stretch of sobriety so that’s a relief. Though knowing that probably led to the bender. That and I was running out of gabapentin and trying to stretch the dosing. It really controls my cravings. Plus I got my period and that’s always been a trigger with my mood.... 

Then I started compulsively shopping and my account is overdrawn I’ve been trying hard to save money- but buying $100 worth of booze for the weekend wasn’t the smartest.

I’ve got tools in my toolbox and I really am not sure about going to residential treatment. I went a few years ago but I may have to go back.

Just got to make it through these morning sweats and I can leave the hospital later.

Edit: I'm not saying I don't know how to successfully turn down an offer to drink, I'm merely curious how many people here identify as alcoholics freely enough to admit it to others as well. I guess I've phrased it poorly.

I don't know if I'm an alcoholic, but I don't identify as one. It may be easier to just tell people I'm alcoholic and forget about the drinks being offered, but I don't feel comfortable doing that because I don't see myself as one.

This last weekend I foolish bought a bottle of rum and dry gin thinking I'd enjoy them over the course of the week. Instead I went through them in two days. Because of that event I'm choosing sobriety from here on out, but right now I'm miserable, physically, emotionally, mentally.

I'm having issues with heartburn, anxiety/panic attacks, breathing/coughing, sweating, lightheadedness, and worst of it all right now I can't seem to sleep. I've gotten maybe 1 hour across 2 days, none of it uninterrupted, and I manage to doze for 10 minutes just a bit ago. On the plus side the other issues are slowly clearing up which is giving me hope, but I feel that if I could even get 4 hours of uninterrupted sleep I would be set.

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

**Amor Fati: Love of Fate**

One of my favorite Stoic teachings is Amor Fati, which is a Latin phrase that means “love of fate.” Friedrich Nietzsche defined it like this, “That one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it… but love it.” The Stoics believed there was always a learning opportunity in anything that happened to them. This is anti-regret. It is not only facing down whatever challenge you have, but also loving it and seeing it for what it is, a chance to grow. A lot of this is about accepting that there are just plain and simple a lot of things out of our control. What is within our control is the ability to *choose* how we react to our circumstances.

Leo Tolstoy said it this way, ""Life could be limitless joy, if we would only take it for what it is, in the way it is given to us.”

Marcus Aurelius was the most powerful man in the world at the time he was the Emperor of Rome. What really brings this into perspective is this was a man who had everything any human could ever wish for at his disposal. And still he kept a journal for himself with little notes on how he should act with reminders like this: ""Try to live your life and be happy with your destiny, acquiring inner peace by love and good deeds.”

Alcohol has taken all of us on a different journey of sorts. Whether your journey took you on a long meandering path or a quick B line to get here, that’s not where our focus should be. We are living today and can only control what choices we make today. We are accepting and loving who we are today, in this moment. We can either wallow in self-pity for the cards we are dealt, or we can take them and decide we are going to push ourselves to be a little bit better for tomorrow. If I have to put up with something, I may as well be happy about it and make the best of my situation.

From my story on ego yesterday, Amor Fati is what brought me from staying outside of myself to acceptance and love of who I was in that moment and ultimately learning and growing from it. It brought me from a place of running from what *was* inside of me to understanding and working on what *is* inside me. These events have already occurred. My response: it was meant to happen and I will love my circumstances as they are today, not grow weary because I have put myself through pain. I will work on and grow myself now. Not sometime in the future. And I will repeat this every day as these circumstances change.

William Seabrook was a journalist in the early 20th century who struggled with alcoholism. He wrote an excellent autobiography called *Asylum* that I would recommend to anyone here. Back in those days, one of the only ways to get treatment was in an insane asylum. Keep in mind, this was before Alcoholics Anonymous existed. Towards the end of his treatment, he came to this realization:

>""If I wanted to come out and survive, I had to take stock of whatever I was and get the courage to face it without trying to drown the image in drink again. I had to stop running away from myself, I had to stop hiding from myself, I had to stop drowning myself in gin. Whatever I had was all I had, and if I weren’t a hopeless coward, I had to do my best with what I had.”

This was my realization too. The idea that it didn’t matter how I got to where I was in this instance. It only mattered if I took stock. It only mattered if I understood that I couldn’t control any of my past choices. It only mattered if I decided to accept and love my circumstances and build on myself from there. I don’t want anything different in my life. Because it is my only option.

How does Amor Fati relate to your journey with alcohol? Is there anything you are holding onto that isn’t allowing you to move on to a place of growth?

Not drinking with you today in San Antonio!

My therapist said even a change of what room you’re in can help change your thoughts and emotions. As I’m walking I realize my stress and anxiety is due to me being in the past and in the future. I sit and try to focus on what I’m feeling and why I think I’m feeling this way, instead of just thinking it’s the drink and only the drink that is making me anxious. Just writing out the what and the why to what I’m feeling helped.

...I think back to The Power of Now (fantastic book so far). How it asks what problem do you have right now at this moment? Guilt, shame, etc. is due to focusing on the past. Anxiety, worry is due to focusing on the future. While I write this I could sense myself automatically thinking: “Well, I have the answer. I can do it. Let’s just drink one more night though, take the easy way out THIS TIME.” In the book, he also says to ask yourself if you get any pleasure when you live in the pain-body. I suspect there is a bit of pleasure in self-destruction, in sticking with habit and delaying change and actual work and discomfort. What problem do I have now? None, really. But I do need to choose what I am going to do today...

I call my family which is one thing that was making me anxious and we discuss our plans. I put on This Naked Mind and cook dinner. I didn’t focus on two hours from now or worry how I would feel before bedtime. That was the future and the future is not real. I focused on the now. After a while, I start feeling ok :)

&#x200B;

6 months ago I posted that I needed to stop drinking. I didn't stop and I pretty much ended up having a breakdown in February. I moved back home to my mom's  house and quit my job. It has been pretty miserable. 

&#x200B;

Now I'm on my 5th day of being sober. It was a super day for me. I have bipolar disorder and have mood swings and today was a depressive one. I am also a black American and have been reeling from the social unrest with all of the police brutality issues in the country. In addition, I need to lose weight desperately (like a good 100 pounds or more) and I know not drinking will help with that. I am doing a juice cleanse now and plan on starting keto next week and hope to do it for a good year so I can reach my goals. 

The thing is is I feel like I have no true ambition to reach the goals I need to. I was super tempted to drink today but haven't even though I still have some vodka left. I also smoke pot but haven't touched it in weeks due to needing to take a drug test for a new job I got.

Either way, I am just generally down in the dumps and just needed to talk to a community that might understand.

And today I saw a bottle of gin near the fridge.

Hadn’t seen a bottle in ages.
Had earlier bought a carton of orange juice because obviously orange juice is the best drink ever.

I asked who owned the gin and was told that anyone can work on it. It was up for grabs.

Was coming up on 2 years sober in a few months.

Still am.

I am not doing well at all at the moment. Mental health is shattered. I’m shattered. And I still haven’t drank. I’m going to be so broken if I ever touch it again. I think this helps me fight through it. I have everything to lose because of it.

Those have mostly went away, but this scalp issue... it's driving me batshit.  If you looked at it, it'd appear to be nothing.  But it feels tingly, sensitive, and sometimes burns ever-so-slightly.

I filmed a bit of our discussion and I'm terrified to watch it back again, as I know I was being obnoxious and she was very upset. I'm saving it in case I need any motivation later to remain on the wagon, which I know I will. 

My wife essentially told me she would leave and take our 2 year old son with her. She told me she's had enough. I looked at his face and it broke my heart. I'm well and truly done with drinking. 

Previously when quitting, I'd focus on all the amazing things sobriety would offer. This is a great strategy obviously. But in a way, I denied that some aspects of drinking are fun. 

Now, I feel like I've accepted both facts. Sobriety is fucking amazing and will allow me to achieve so many of of goals, without a giant fucking anchor weighing me down. 

But I also accept that I had some fun times with alcohol and it can be fun. But... I am now at the point that I am not able to drink anymore. I've literally drunk my life's quota and I must abstain. 

I have a responsibility as a father, husband, and to myself to never touch a drop of alcohol again. 

I had some really good self-driven success, but I feel like I need to loop into a support group. I'm thinking about AA and will connect myself to this subreddit like glue.

I had an idea for a piece of legislation and I wanted to know if people thought this would be helpful or not. I lost a family member to addiction so this issue is really important to me. I want to get more feedback on my idea before I present it to my state representative.

My idea is to add an optional ""relapse prevention"" marker to drivers licenses. If you voluntarily got this marker on your ID, stores would not be allowed to sell you alcohol. My idea was that this could be one tool that people in recovery could use to help reduce the risk of relapsing.

Do you see any potential problems with this existing? Is it a tool you would use if it were available?",5

I was a chronic relapser of about 8 years and a heavy drinker for decades.

With each relapse, people ask me, what are you going to do different this time?  As a result of my last relapse I learned two things and applied them to my recovery:

1. **One day at a time**.  A simple cliche but extraordinarily helpful.  The longest I made it sober before this year was 8 months.  At that time, a few years back, my goal was to stay sober a year.  I was craving most days and in hindsight, I'm surprised I made it 8 months.  I will never think about my recovery again as extending into the future beyond today.  All I have to worry about is today and tomorrow plan to do the same.  
2. **Accept life as it comes to me**.  I've written before about the girlfriend I lost to drinking.  I saw her the day before my last relapse and I was ***incensed*** that she would not talk to me given that I had not drunk for about 3 months.  I consciously recall saying to myself ""I cannot accept this"".  I started drinking the next day for about half of April and all of May into 2 June 2019.  Now, each day I accept things that I cannot change and try to change the things I can.  Would I be pleased if that girl would talk to me?  Yes, of course.  Do I expect it?  No.  Will I be OK if I never see her again?  Yes.  Did I learn anything?  Yes, if you drink and drive people away they may never come back.

I've learned a few other things, like reaching out to friends when I feel off, keeping a journal, readily admitting I am wrong and expressing gratitude every chance I get - to myself and to others.

It's powerful stuff. This is my first share, and I apologise for the long read in advance, I just want to get this off of my chest. 

I have been battling with alcohol for a long time. Once I flipped the switch at the ripe age of 16, it didn't turn off for me. Here I am, almost 32 years old, and I am seeing life through a different lens, and i've realized how much alcohol has taken from me, and how little it has actually given me. 

I grew up in a broken home, mom and dad divorced when I was very young, both alcoholics in their own right. When I was 7, my brother and I were in the car with my mother when she was pulled over for a DWI. Luckily my father had been through rehab at that point. But the pressure of raising three boys finally got to him and he was back on the sauce. Moving back and forth between parents for years, 2 middle schools, 4 high schools. Finally when I turned 16 I discovered alcohol, and it changed everything for me. I suddenly found an escape from my internal anguish, and I felt more alive than ever when drinking. I was still very active in Lacrosse at that point. So I didn't start drinking heavily yet. When it came to senior year of school I found myself skipping class to play beer pong with my friends. What did I care? I was alive and having fun. Somehow, someway, without getting a high school diploma I was able to enlist in the US Marines. If any of you have ever been in the military then you know how big of a role alcohol plays. I was in the best shape of my life, and mentally disciplined, so alcohol still wasn't having a major effect on my life. 

Suddenly the ride of the military ended, and I was back in the real world. At 23 I was unsuccessfully making an attempt to go to community college, which was derailed by.......you guessed it, alcohol, I still didn't get it though. After dropping out of college I found an amazing job opportunity, and I was doing well, but this is when I realized that alcohol was affecting my ability to perform at work. So I think this was my first attempt to cut alcohol out.. 

A couple years later I discovered the love of my life, I was 26 and she was 24, and she really liked to party. But suddenly I felt alive, and I felt amazing again, due to moving around alot I had never found the opportunity to form a bond with a large group of friends, but now I had that with my new girlfriend. Things were going so well, we moved in together, and thought we could build a beautiful life. At this point I had neglected so many parts of my mental health due to the fact that I was engulfed in a unsustainable party lifestyle. She is an enigma, the most responsible partier I have ever seen. She could maintain the lifestyle, and was very physically fit. I was neglecting my personal well being, and over time it got worse and worse. I developed a case of severe depression, and went on medication. This is when shit started getting crazy. 

I went on medication after medication, completely ignoring the advice of healthcare professionals and the label ON THE BOTTLE OF PILLS, which said ""do not drink alcohol"". Yet I still did, thinking I had a magic pill in my pocket, and that my problems would go away. Suddenly when I drank, I found myself blacking out constantly, my girlfriend and I were fighting all of the time at this point, and my solution to deal with it was to drink. One night after a fight I walked to the local bar, I don't remember how long I was there. But I woke up the next morning in a house I had never been in, on someone's couch, and covered in mud and Burdock's. I never saw who helped me that night, I left as soon as I could, but I'm assuming someone found me passed out in a bush or someone's yard, and carried me into their house. Did that stop me from drinking? Nope. Sure didn't. 

Needless to say my girlfriend and I didn't last much longer after that, we broke up, it was traumatizing, definitely not a good breakup. Yet she still loved me, and even went with me to an AA meeting. I declared myself as an alcoholic for the first time. Fast forward a couple months, I'm living with my alcoholic mother, and my depression took a turn for the worse, and I found myself drinking every single day. I was at the lowest point in my life. I didn't care anymore. I specifically remember someone at work asking me why I was in a bad mood that day, my response was ""because I woke up today"". This didn't stop, I was hanging with friends who thought alcohol was my solution, and that I just needed to have a few beers to solve life's problems. I was spiriling out of control, yet still maintaining the appearance of a normal life in certain ways. There was no soul, or passion for life left on the inside. I was essentially a walking meat bag. 

This past December I saw my ex girlfriend, and I knew she could see the effects of alcohol in my face, I knew I didn't look the same, I was puffy, tired, and looked like a completely different person. Yet somehow she still saw the other person. She still believed in me, somehow even after the hell I put her through with my drinking. We kept talking, even though she moved to Florida this past January, I knew I had an opportunity, I knew that I had to figure out how to be different. I had to eliminate alcohol from my life somehow, or at least reduce it. I had to get her back somehow, I needed to fix my life. Luckily she is in a point in her life where the party has stopped, and she wants other things, just like me. We decided to try to make it work again, because there was too much love to ignore. 

I started working out again, and started trying to control my drinking, at this point after drinking every day I had begun to ignore the symptoms of something wrong. My liver started hurting when I drank, yet I still kept doing it. I had one toxic friend who kept influencing me and convincing me I was fine. So I kept doing the same routine. Then corona happened, I was stuck inside by myself, no gym, no outlet...yeah I was drinking alot. I then discovered this reddit page, and I started reading your stories, and I discovered that there are so many people with experiences similar to mine. I found the book ""the naked mind"" and started understanding things about myself. I felt a mental shift occuring.

 I've decided that the only way I'm going to have a normal life, or get to where I want to be is to not drink. I cant do it anymore. I just can't. I feel angry about what I've done to my body, and what I've done to the people around me. I need to be better, and I am determined to stick this out. I'm now 8 days sober. And I'm seeing life through a brand new lens. I hope through persistence and discipline I can achieve my goals. One day at a time. Thank you all.",9

I'm following sober accounts on Instagram and looking up inspiration to motivate me to stay sober. And then I'll have a moment. Nothing really has to happen to spark it. I just want to drink. And in that moment, I am CONVINCED that all this stuff about sobriety is just an overreaction on my part and that I don't really have a problem with binge drinking or alcoholism. I've never gone to rehab or had a bender. Sure, I've embarrassed the hell out of myself. I've said things I didn't mean to friends. I've acted in ways that I never would sober. But that's normal, right? No big deal. I'll be fine if I just have two or three or four. Except I can't stop at four or five or whatever. I just keep going. 

Yesterday, I went to the lake with my two roommates. It was one of my roommate's birthdays, and we were celebrating. I had five seltzers in the time that they had maybe two or three, and then I discreetly opened another in the backseat on the way home. We stopped at a grocery store. I was drunk. I felt good. This morning, my roommate messaged me and basically said she doesn't know what to do. ""Three drunk people in a grocery store is fun. One drunk person and two sober people in a grocery store is not."" I guess I had said that I was going to buy another case of seltzers, ""for next weekend."" This morning she said she'd gotten frustrated at that because she knew they wouldn't make it more than a day or two, let alone to next weekend.

I just don't know what to do. I don't know how to stop. I don't want to make my roommates and friends uncomfortable or frustrated or embarrassed for me. I don't want to be out of control.

I'm sitting in my office at work typing this, and if you put any kind of drink in front of me right now, I'd figure out a way to drink it without anyone knowing. I am so sad because I just don't know how to control myself anymore. I can't go to AA because I'm an atheist, and the god thing really puts me off. I don't know that anyone at any kind of meeting would even take my drinking seriously because I guess that deep down, I question if it's even a problem or just another ""disease"" I'm making up, the same way I feel about my depression/anxiety, which I'm on Effexor XR for.

But who would I be without it, what would be my name?
The drinking was fun, until it was not
Rolling over in the morning, start drinking (a lot)
A few day ones, half hearted attempts
Stopping forever? I hold myself in contempt
This morning was different, it had to stick
For me, for my family, I truly made myself sick
It wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows it’s true
And with all my heart I believe in you too.

I think I've slowly been getting here, to actually stop drinking. I just can't moderate. It's the same with certain foods, which is why I don't keep stuff like chips and Oreos and ice cream in the house. I've been lurking in this sub for months now and I really admire everyone here being so encouraging and honest. It's a balm for society.

Backstory: Addiction, especially alcohol addiction, is in my family history. My uncle was addicted to drugs and alcohol. My parents are both functioning alcoholics (as in, they go to work every day but as soon as 5pm hits, they're drinking all night). My siblings have also had substance addiction issues. 

I would say my issues have been the most mild out of my immediate family. I have never smoked cigarettes because I saw what it's done to my parents throughout my childhood. I would sit at the top of the stairs and pray that my dad would quit smoking because I was so afraid he would die. He tried to quit so many times, but just couldn't and now he's in the high risk category for COVID. I never tried drugs because that just seemed stupid and expensive .

I was thinking the other day that I might have also stayed away from alcohol if I hadn't been given some beer when I got my period as a teenager.. as a ""celebration of becoming a woman"". My parents regularly let me drink at home... mostly after I was about 18... and I remember getting pretty drunk the night before my 21st birthday with a friend. Since then I've been mostly a binge drinker. I can go weeks or even months without alcohol, but as soon as an opportunity presents itself like a wedding, funeral, or vacation (unlimited alcohol cruise package anyone?) I would drink several drinks in a short amount of time. I would say generally I don't get blackout or so drunk I puke.

I have not been able to find the line between drunk and blackout/puking drunk. Hangovers last all the next day and I usually puke a couple times before I feel better. I really enjoy the taste of all different kinds of alcohol and that's one reason it's been hard to stop. I've puked all over my bed... in a hotel room... in an Uber. THAT was the most embarrassing and expensive.

This weekend we went over to a friend's house and I knew I was probably going to get drunk.  I hadn't been puking drunk in about a year (it happens usually once, MAYBE twice per year) but I had no self control. I had burned a TON of calories with exercise and yardwork and thus I justified it by saying I earned all the calories and the relaxation. I would have been better off eating a pint of ice cream.

I threw up outside the car as we were leaving (spouse drove home), and went straight to bed upon my return home. I woke up in the middle of the night, thinking I had been getting really good sleep, but then immediately the shame and sorrow of having drunk so much came to me and I was muttering ""I'm so sorry"" in my sleep. I kept asking my husband if I'd said or done anything stupid while I was drunk and he assured me that I did not. And then I physically felt like absolute shit the next day and had no energy for anything.

So this will be the third day in a row that I don't have a drink. I want to tell myself that I don't have a problem compared to other people. And maybe I don't have a physical addiction. But the mental time and bandwidth I spent thinking not really about ""Ooo I can't wait for a drink"" but ""what am I in the mood for?"" ""How much should I drink?"" ""Will I be able to drive home or ask my husband to drive?"" ""How will this impact my exercise tomorrow?"" ""How many calories am I consuming?"" ""When during my menstrual cycle is the best time to drink?"".... all that mental energy WASTED.

Not to mention the havoc it wreaks on my mental state - I've been working really hard on my own and with a therapist to overcome lifelong depression, anxiety, and grief and it just seems like a waste to voluntarily bring in a physical hindrance to that. It is really hard to be present with your feelings, especially now in the crazy-ass world of ours. But when this pandemic hit initially, I was thinking that the world deserves more sober people right now who are woke and aware of themselves and the humans around them. It seems crazy that I wrote all of this to say that I'm still on the fence about actually quitting or just cutting back, but I can't look at it like that. It has to be a daily decision. So....

I was with my husband, sister, BIL, kids, and some family friends.  I showed up with a 12 pack of Busch NA.  Immediately the questions started once they realized I wasn't drinking.

I kept my NA beer on hand and would have a couple here and there when real cravings hit.  But I probably drank 2-3 drinks every other day.  
It took me a few days to come back to you all.  I was ashamed of screwing up.  I am mad at myself. I am also disappointed with my family.

My drinking started as a social thing in college, but after I graduated it actually became something that I exclusively did alone in my room. I used drinking as a way to shut my brain off. I went from bouts of depression to a universal 'blah'. It replaced every other hobby. Every night, I could just skip ahead until the morning by drinking until I passed out. In fact, one drink made feel awful and jumpy. It was passed out drunk or nothing. 

Now 16 days without a drink, I've discovered that I'm actually starting to like things again. I've remembered that I like playing video games in the evening, that I like reading before bed, that I like taking walks and listening to music. I've started to acknowledge that I'm lonely and that drinking had replaced the active social life that I had enjoyed all the way through college. Even in in lock down, the days have started to feel separate in a way that they didn't while I was drinking. Just the act of going to bed at night and waking up the next morning remembering the night before feels great and starts the day on such an encouraging note.

I'm counting my days privately, but I'm also much more focused on the quality of life versus the quantity of sobriety. 

AA is wonderful for lots of folks, just not myself. Frankly, meetings always made me drink more. The notion of self identifying as defective is inherently awful to me.

Thanks to you guys, I’m on day 5. Still grinding my teeth and white knuckling during my trigger time between 5-7, but if I can make it to 7:00 I’m okay. If not, I’d have started drinking wine continuously at 6:00 and MAYBE stopped at 10:00, but easily could have gone into the night as I have before waking up and feeling like hell. 

I had a tough day working at the hospital on Sunday (day 3) and I almost caved. Somehow (no idea how) I didn’t. I had no scheduled work for the next 2 weeks because our census has been so low due to cancelled elective surgeries, and I’ve been stressed about money. Well, yesterday morning I was unexpectedly  called in, as the hospital had an uptick. I had woken up naturally at 7:00am feeling good that morning and was raring to go when I was called. 

If I had given in on day 3 and chugged wine until I passed out, I would have made up some bull crap excuse for being unavailable then flogged myself all day for drinking away a day of work.  So when I got home yesterday tired again I had that bit of nervous drink-energy, but it was much less than the day before. 

I can tell myself all the natural positives; being present for my children, not feeling inexplicably angry at my husband out of nowhere, waking up feeling great. I even started having mild visual hallucinations (a screw on the wall in our office which kept moving in my peripheral vision as I was documenting) reminding me how much poison is purging out my body. But none of that is as tangible as the simple ability to go into work on a day I thought was otherwise going to be free for sleep and a hangover.

The very first day I decided I needed to stop drinking for good I started a Google Docs as a journal. I continue to make entries almost daily in it and it was such an integral part for me of documenting at the beginning what I was feeling, the things I was reading, and the experiences I was having as I navigated first time support meetings, talking to friends about my issue, etc.

On June 5,2019, mere days into my sobriety, I had listened to an episode of the HOME podcast and the hosts were talking about what surprised them most about their sobriety journey. I was inspired to write out my own answer as if I was writing it on the 365th day of my sobriety and not the 6th. I returned to this entry numerous times throughout the year for inspiration and motivation.  So here it is. And after one year of sobriety I can say that I was right. This is how the year went and this is how I feel now.  If you are just starting out, hang in there and hold on, it is a bit of a wild ride but so miraculous and so worth it!

*June 5, 2019*

*One year from now...*

 *In the past year what I have found to be the most surprising is how easy this journey has been.  Not “easy” in the sense that there was no effort, or no hardships, or no stumbles along the way, but that once I got clear on the fact that I wanted to be thriving in sobriety, things really started to fall together in a miraculous way.  The path, as it were, was laid in front of me and I was never confused or unsure about my next step. I might have felt a little lost at times and there were definitely some difficult moments and periods, but that is just part of life.  I knew that as long as I kept walking in the same direction as I was headed previously I was on the right path.  Things just unfolded in a really unexpected and wonderful way.  Moments of doubt? Sure.  Moments of feeling like I was alone or overwhelmed? Definitely.  But there was this voice, or presence, or just my inner self that was always steering the boat in the right direction.  That part of me never faltered in my decision, never second-guessed, never looked back. I may have been bracing myself against the side of the ship but the ship was on course the whole time no matter how choppy the waters, or how dark the night, or how terrifying the storm.  Deep down I always knew that the boat would carry me to a better life.  A life I want to lead.  A life I want to be a part of.  A life that unknowingly I was yearning for for decades.  And now, after a year, the seas are calmer, I am not as afraid, I am continually inspired and in amazement of what is.  I can, in the distance, see the shoreline of my new reality and it is incredible.  Magical.  And way better than anything I could have ever imagined.*

I've been drinking for around 20 years and already knew in the very early years of my drinking career, that I had a problem. I continued drinking to the point I was shitfaced, made a fool out of myself and pissed in my bed. I've wrecked my car, got a DUI, several arrests, broken relationships and bones, lost friends, jobs and lost the ability to love and respect myself.

Deep in my heart, I knew that what I was doing wasn't right, but I wasn't able to stop. I've been too deep in that vicious circle of re-building my life and destroying it again by ""rewarding"" myself with booze. 

The longest period in which I did not drink was 500 days in total. I have to admit that this time was one of the worst and most depressing times in my life. I had to **force** myself to do the everyday things because I did not find any fun in them. I constantly thought about alcohol and I had the feeling that I was missing something or that I or ""someone"" was forbidding me to drink. ""The others have so much fun, why can't I have fun?"" were thoughts that were constantly buzzing around in my head.  
I relapsed and suddenly I had ""fun"" again with my life. I went among people, was active and had the feeling to live again until the moment when everything became too much and I drank at least a fifth of liquor a day.  

This went on for so many years until I reached a new low in November 2018. It was a new kind of low, I thought about suicide. My parents completely disowned me, which gave me a deep stab in my heart. I stopped drinking again but this time I decided to start a therapy. In therapy I learned that I used alcohol to hide my anxiety and to find motivation to go among people. During the therapy we hardly ever discussed the topic of alcohol but focused exclusively on the reasons WHY I was drinking. I did various exercises to overcome my fears of people, worked on strategies to find new hobbies and reevaluated my job situation. I've started with new sober hobbies like dancing salsa which gave me the opportunity to work on my social anxiety and to meet people who don't see booze as a necessity to have fun.   
I've quit my high paying job and solo traveled in Asia & South America, something which would have been a nightmare before. It's like I've just started now to start living and I want to catch up on so many things, but i'm also giving myself the time to rest or to reflect on myself during the recent time and to learn more about things like mindfulness and what's really important in life. 

I confidently can say that without a therapy, working on my fears by approaching them and finding new hobbies & friends, I would have been at the same dark place as before and possibly even tried to suicide. 

**TL;DR**

What helped **me** to become a happy sobernaut:  I have asked myself: **WHY** do I drink and worked together with a therapist on strategies to tackle those WHYS. My big WHY has been social anxiety which led to isolation and depression. For me, the pressure to drink always had a reason and I've been able to withstand the pressure for some time (longest streak 500 days), but I've felt miserable because I was not enjoying myself and life. After breaking the cage of anxiety, isolation and external expectations, a new world opened to me and I've started to solo travel, dance and simply enjoying the moment and my life. 

I wish everyone to find their own journey to success. It can be done, I promise.",48

2020-06-02 07:42:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gv5ska/shame_gone_proud_nondrinker/,Shame gone. Proud non-drinker.,"I was 5 months sober today. New year's resolution cliche...

It's been a pretty massive thing for me and my family so I thought I'd share some thoughts.

1 - The hardest part was changing my idea of who I am. We hold on tooth and nail for consistency in our identity. Even if we know it's doing us harm. 

Before quitting drinking I tried changing a few other things that I thought ""I"" would never do. Stopped drinking coffee and switched to tea after 15 years of at least 3 cups a day.  Started going to the gym. I found that proving to myself that I could change these parts of my identity helped me to see the possibility of becoming a non-drinker.

I started forging my new identity in a way that made me proud to own it. I'd tell people that I don't drink, or that I stopped drinking. If they asked why I would proudly tell them that I wanted to achieve my life goals, have a better relationship with my wife and be a better role model for my family. 

To make people feel better about themselves (if they're drinkers) I'd explain that I come from a long family line of abusive alcoholics and I can't ""just have a few"". 

2 - Withdrawals were way more real than I thought. I found myself bargaining in my mind. I'd be feeling like I couldn't breath, heart beating out of my chest while snapping at my wife and daughter and I'd think ""I should go and have a drink. It's not fair on them that I act this way. Really it's best for everyone."" Oh the games we play. I explained to my wife and daughter what I was going through and that if I was going to get through to the other side I'd need their understanding and support. Luckily they put up with my grouchy ass for a few weeks. 

I also used the Easy Quit Drinking app which gives you little rewards and updates on what to expect regarding symptoms of withdrawal, tells you the positive impacts on your health, calculates the money you've saved (just bought a sweet new TV with my savings BTW) and gives you little milestone badges. 

3 -The first social gathering was hard. I would always drink to ease my social anxiety. When I got to the party I felt a very strong urge to drink. I went for a walk and talked to myself and just decided that I would just have to find another way to adapt to these situations. I drank 6 cups of tea that night... I found that not being drunk actually helped me communicate with people. Also, when other people drink it doesn't matter at all if you're not drunk. It's still totally fun. No issues at all.

4 - I thought that I was really going to struggle relaxing at the end of the day without booze. However, after the first month I felt totally fine at the end of the day. The ""need"" to drink to relax wasn't there. Maybe my body's cortisol levels had reset and I was just running on a lower stress setting generally. 

5 - I've been trying to quit drinking for about 6 years. I finally feel like I've done it. Life is so good now I don't want to risk having ""just one drink"". I've lost 10 kg, I've hardly had a fight with my wife and I spend more quality time with my children. Most of all. The shame is gone. I wake up proud of myself. I broke the cycle. 

I hope this helps someone. 

TL;DR 
5 months sober. It was hard, but worth it. Identity change and support is important. Be proud of your new self.",948

It's now 10 days without alcohol and I'm doing ok. I still feel a little hangover-like in the morning and I'm experiencing brain fog during the day. In the evenings it gets better. I craved alcohol but it was not that bad. Little side note: I drank every weekend 3-5 beers, during quarantine it got worse and i drank 1-3 times a week at least 5 beers or 1 bottle of wine, once 2 bottles of wine. Was always a ""party girl"" and a binge drinker at the age from 17-29. But had my sober days in between. But, of course, I had a problem.

Now the thing is I feel like I get pissed very easily by my boyfriend. We're together now for nearly 2 years but are dating since 2016. We know each other for nearly 10 years. I'd say he's my best friend, he's a kind, intelligent and good person. 
Now after he moved in 3 months ago I feel like the honymoon phase has come to an end and flaws I previously felt were cute und funny are now unbearable. What I liked about him and what describes him best is that he doesn't take life too seriously, he's joking about everything, he acts very childish and can be very self-centered. At family feasts I sometimes feel soo embarassed for his behaviour (bad table manners, lying around on the couch not participating in anything because he's too tired because he again stayed up at night till 5 am...) I thought that we were completing each other because I often take everything too seriously but now he makes me mad. I feel like I'm the only grown up in our house and I'm responsible for everything. But actually what I want is to have an equally involved partner. I feel like I've develeoped and he hasn't.

I'm not here for relationship advice. I have to figure things out by myself. BUT i would like to know if anyone experienced anything similar when getting sober: Did feelings for loved ones change? Am I just more irritable because of the alcohol withdrawal? Or did I already have these feelings deep down and  numbed them while drinking. I feel like now that I quit drinking and getting my life together I've outgrown the relationship. But I also know that we're know in a critical phase because the hormones calmed down and we live together now and it's kind of normal to struggle in this phase. I really do love him with all my heart and I know he loves me but I just can't stand him right now anymore.

Like most, I'm sure I can't even believe I'm here on this subreddit. I took my last sip of beer (mind you, only one beer in total) last month and plan to ideally go the rest of the year without booze.  If not totally cut, then at the very least never drunk AGAIN.

I'm the biggest idiot drunk.  Sometimes, as recent as Feb, I'll just wake up in my bed with the lights on and fully clothed and not wonder what happened as my last memory would be me at a party.

Though TBH I feel like my last time getting drunk should have been NYE 2010 (so ringing in 2011) when I drove and hit a pole.  THANK THE LORD nothing bad happened to everyone else and I am truly grateful.

Normally, I'm a super levelheaded guy who's easy to chat with. I usually drink and think I become super smooth with the ladies though in reality, that is the opposite. I'm a total goon and might accidentally get too close to them as spatial awareness and sense of hearing are the first to go so I have to lean in super closely.  I am embarrassed of this behavior.

I've lost friendships after a night of drinking probably due to some behavior I can't even remember or behavior that I normally wouldn't do sober.  Later, I'd run into them and they'd give me the cold shoulder and/or weird looks and I'd have no clue why. I suppose this is the pushing point and here I am ready.

I've come to realize that at parties and whatnot, I just like sipping something so I stocked up on various flavored waters and juices from Costco to sip while at home. I've never been the drinking alone type, but I can't stop while at social outings.

Thanks for this subreddit and happy to help you all in any way.",1

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

**The Ego Monster**

>""It is an absolute perfection and virtually divine to know how to enjoy our being rightfully. We seek other conditions because we do not understand the use of our own, and go outside of ourselves because we do not know what it is like inside. Yet there is no use our mounting on stilts, for on stilts we must still walk on our own legs. And on the loftiest throne in the world we are still sitting only on our own rump.” -Michel de Montaigne 

When I decided to write about ego, I had no more of a thought than this quote and how our drinking doesn’t allow us to reflect on our lives in a proper way because we think we have it all figured out. Instead something much more personal appeared on the paper that I didn’t fully understand existed until now. 

I went through the majority of my 20’s coasting through life never really focused on anything in the form of improving myself. And definitely never fully trying to understand who I was and what was inside of me. This quote from Montaigne is the essence of my journey with alcohol. My ego carried me through this phase. The best version of myself was my drunken self. In my head, I had all the knowledge I could ever want and all the tools I would ever need. Over the course of several months when I was 28 years old, I had to face a reality that was not pretty. Needless to say, it was an emotional binge drinking roller coaster to the bottom. 

I finally was able to get sober after a lot of time trapped in the claws of alcohol. I realized that what I had done in the past wouldn’t work. I devoted myself to self-improvement. I read as much as I could. But then a different monster grew in my head and my ego once again took control. I started reading just to tell you what I was reading about. I was beaming with all of my newfound knowledge. And I probably was not the most fun person to be around if you didn’t care what was permeating in my mind (I say this sarcastically). I somehow made it two years sober. On my honeymoon, I decided it was safe for me to drink again. I had taken enough time off of alcohol. As we all know, this doesn’t end pretty either. I was on and off alcohol for the next five and a half years, continuously struggling with it until I was able to get my head straight. 

For me, it was more than just the realization how I had let my arrogance get the better of me. I was scared as hell of what I would discover - even in the first sober phase. Nothing I did throughout this time helped me understand who I really am. From the outside, it had to have seemed like I was passively going through life. But to me there was nothing new that could have possibly helped. Alcohol taught me to stay outside of myself, to run from what was inside me, and to build myself up with false stories. 

Ryan Holiday, who is one of the great Stoic teachers of our age, wrote this: ""We build ourselves up with fantastical stories, we pretend we have it all figured out, we let our star burn bright and hot only to fizzle out, and we have no idea why. These are symptoms of ego, for which humility and reality are the cure."" 

I know better now than to assume that I know everything about myself. Unfortunately, I didn’t understand this until my mid 30’s, but I live with no regrets and I have learned to love how my life turned out. This is a lifelong journey for me and Montaigne is a constant reminder of that. The only thing I can do is try, every single day, to work towards a better understanding of who I am and what I want my life to mean. My ego caused me a lot of pain that I could have avoided. Of course, it wouldn’t be an ego if it didn’t. 

The more we understand that there is never an end to our journey, that we are always practicing, the more likely we are to keep our egos at bay.

Is there something your ego has kept you from either in the present or the past? 

Not drinking with you today in San Antonio!

My sleep has improved some (one of the main reasons I started drinking as much as I did was because I suffer from pretty bad insomnia due to PTSD from my time in the military) I’m still irritable, but I think maybe I’ve always been an angry person (again, the PTSD doesn’t help). 

The urges are still there. It’s been a rough month at work... I’m busier than I’ve ever been at work due to this whole COVID mess.  My two main ways of blowing off steam are to lift weights at the gym and to drink, and I can’t do either of those right now.

After the end of the relationship, and waking up concerned about myself I decided enough was enough.  It’s been about a week with no alcohol.  I couldn’t sleep more than maybe an hour a day and would toss and turn all night just thinking of all my wrongs and of course my ex.  I’ve been trying to work out everyday, eat right, drink a ton of water which my body desperately needed.  

I finally got maybe 5 hours of sleep the other day, but just asking you all what to expect these coming days, weeks physically, emotionally, mentally.  I know it’s different for everyone.

I'm glad for the most part that I no longer abuse alcohol but I must say - I miss parts of my old life.

Before I got sober I lived in a different city and had a lot of friends,  went to the bar a lot, played softball, went to the gym...had a fun social life and yes a lot of it involved alcohol. 

My husband and I moved, I continued to drink - we didn't really make friends,  although I met some people through work and crossfit. I quit drinking,  and most of my social circle has never seen me under the influence of alcohol. 

I'm bored. We don't go out...really ever....anywhere. Why would we? Dinner? Its expensive and we can make better food at home. Movies? Netflix and redbox in my own livingroom is way more comfortable. Concerts? Shit no - being around a bunch of drunk people in a big crowd sounds terrible. Camping? Without whiskey and a campfire,  nope. 

I'm in a rut. I feel old and boring. I don't have anything to look forward to, the weekends all blend together and I'm feeling.....over it.

I’m 6 months sober today. Though my reasons for quitting drinking were because I was diagnosed with an auto immune disease, I’m still really proud of this moment. Maybe it was the wake up call I needed. 

I used to ride about 30-40 miles a week on my bicycle from 23yo and on but in the last 3 years rode little to none. This year I’ve started riding more and am now back up to 15 miles a week. I have more energy to go for walks and exercise. I’ve found ways to socialize with friends without having to drink (which also included a 3 days weekend camping trip). I was at 245 on Jan 1st and have finally hit 200 lbs today. Weight isn’t everything btw. I just have more energy to do more physical things now. 

Anyways, happy to be here and have read all your inspirational post which have helped along the way. I hope to get to that 1 year milestone and more.

I've struggled with chronic dry eyes and ocular rosacea for a couple years now.  My eye doctor can practically recognize my voice over the phone I call the office so often.  Anyway, I had an appointment in early Feb and was basically told that I have some signs that long term damage is beginning in my eyes.  As someone in their mid-30's this was really scary news.  Fast forward to today, I had a quick follow up appointment and my doctor was in disbelief!  She said that practically all of the signs of long term damage had repaired itself and my eyes don't show any signs of the rosacea.  

The ONLY thing that I have changed in my life is cutting out alcohol - a major trigger for rosacea.  I knew my complexion would lose the redness, but I had NO idea that my eyes would benefit so much.   
 If this isn't a major motivator to stick with it, I don't know what is!  The whites of my eyes are actually white again.  No more wandering around looking like I'm hammered even when I'm not!  And no more fear that I am slowly going blind (probably an over exaggeration but nevertheless a fear I had).

Happiness is a by-product of living the right kind of life, of doing the right thing. Do not search for happiness. Search for right-living and happiness will be your reward."" In that moment, it clicked for him. He'd been living his entire life selfishly. Only considering how any situation or circumstance could benefit him. He decided to make a change.

I'd be born 11 months later, and a little over 30 years down the line that man would walk into a room at a treatment center, and I would ask him to help me.

You know how long it took me to get 5 years sobriety? 5 freaking years. I know it's common to say you must do this for yourself, but if you don't find a reason to stay, you'll find a reason to leave.

I could wax poeticly about what all this journey has given me, but the day that stands out the most is December of 2019. My grandfather passed away at 81 years old. At his funeral, I was asked to stand and give a Eulogy on behalf of the family by the family...And I was present. That can never be taken away from me. That's what not drinking did for me.

Know that whatever you're going through, you're not alone; nor are you the first person to go through it. Please feel free to reach out to me anytime, and I'll do all that is possible to help; because that's what someone else did for me.

Okay this is a bit longer than I wanted, but it's not too bad if you have a few minutes.

I'm going to start posting much more regularly to SD. I'll use my posts for the community but also chiefly  as a kind of self diary. When I'm struggling again, which I need to face that I will struggle again, I want to be able to read these posts that I made. Gonna provide a bit of backstory, and then my 'break through'

I've drank heavily since age 17, I'm 32 now. Mid June, 2013 is when something really changed for me. From that time; 2013 I started drinking every single day. Only had a month here, a month there. Maybe 2 or 3 days of precious clarity before pay-days when I was absolutely broke. It was December 2019 that I think/hope things started to turn around. I'm sort of proud to say that since December, I've drank MAX 15 days. 5 day bender in Jan, another in March and another in April. And drank 1 day, fucking up one wonderful, painful month of sobriety, on May 27th. Need to change my counter. Anyway, fast forward to today:

Today I randomly came across some money. Enough to get drunk for one day. I can't get to a 'good state' without at least 750ml of good quality rum. Anyway, as soon as it was in my hand, of course that 'part' of me (some of you call it the drunky voice, demon, whatever). Whatever the fuck THAT part of me is, I have been battling it for nearly a decade. That part that, even though I KNOW I need food, and I KNOW I feel regret, I still go to the liquor store.

 In this better part of a decade, I've successfully told that voice to shut up about 5 times. 3 of those times were in 2020. So that's something. The first 2 times, once the shakes stopped and I realized the victory I achieved, it was euphoric, but extremely difficult. That ...evil, fucked up part of me uses my over-thinking against me. I'm sure a lot of us know how that is. The rationalizations. But today, and those other 4 days I WISH I wrote about, I did something different. While arguing with myself, I said ""No, use this money on gas instead. Simple"". 

Usually, after putting my foot down, the 'bad' part of me wins the argument. ""Fuck that, you really wanna spend the whole evening depressed?"" Nonsense like that. This time...you can call it Instinct, you can call it Clarity, grace or God, I spent 20 minutes driving around the block, trying to focus on my breath (made me realize practicing meditation in the morning again is my next step). In those 20 minutes, including the time it took me to fill up my gas and pick out one sweet beverage, there was very little thought going through my head. Just did what I had to do - while my body was craving alcohol like crazy... which judging from how little I've drank in April and May i'm surprised I felt that way.

Driving home, I did feel empowered, but also a little 'bummed out'. But tomorrow morning, like one user here put, we NEVER are like ""shit I really wish I drank last night"". If I have any luck, I'll get a little 'pink cloud' feeling tonight. Thanks everyone, in future posts I'm going to express how grateful I am this subreddit exists and how daily use has been integral in my Path since December.",9

This is my first post here. My history with alcohol and drugs has been long and winding. I used to have a HUGE problem with alcohol throughout high school and college - I had multiple blackouts and was thrown out of a private high school and college. My second go at college went well and my drinking seemed in line with everyone else’s - I have always been wracked with self guilt about many things so I am confused when other people are drinking way more and having much more life consequences from it but don’t seem to care. I haven’t had any severe drinking incidents in quite some time but I still don’t really like drinking or how I can behave when I do it. About half the time I have a hard time stopping at the ideal 2 or 3 drink number but I do stop eventually - probably after 5 or 6. This leaves me feeling hungover and shitty but “tells” me that I’m not an alcoholic. 

My financee however, is a severe alcoholic. He is  in recovery most of the time since we met - he had a few relapses and they were bad. He seems to have an easier time not drinking in social situations than I do despite the fact that he is such a serious alcoholic. I think that is because his consequences have been much more severe - he seems to lose a brain screw when he gets drunk and is often suicidal and has deliberately crashed cars into trees while drunk. He spent 4 years without his license and now has a breathalyzer. 

I really want to to stop drinking because I know he would greatly appreciate it if I did and it would help him feel more comfortable in sober situations. I want to stop because I don’t really like how it makes me feel! I get more aggressive and sometimes we fight. 

My drinking ties into my more general issues of lack of self esteem and social anxiety and always feeling like a left out reject even if evidence points otherwise. I have felt so much of my life feeling different from the crowd and I hate feeling more different in the situation by not drinking with them. I also find social situations generally boring if all we are doing is talking and drinking so I just keep drinking to have Something to do with my hands. I live in a very drinking heavy town where people take pride in their lack of moderation so that often kills my resolve in the situation as well. 

I know the obvious solution is to avoid drinking situations but unfortunately everyone I know around here drinks and I have always felt perpetually lonely so I hate staying in and not being out with my family and friends. It’s so easy to not drink when I don’t see other people doing it. But as soon as I do, I cave and want to do it. 

TLDR I really want to stop drinking. I tend to mirror others in social situations and feel I cannot handle witnessing another person drink and not drink too. I have spent much of my life feeling lonely and rejected and massively fear how i will feel when I decline the little social life I have left . I will not do AA for the record. Sites like meetup are very inactive in my very rural town. People proudly binge drink here and do so during daytime activities - even dirt biking at the track there will be people drinking as dumb as it is for them to do. Most people here are social distancing/wearing masks  while socializing it’s easier here in the woods and lakes to do so than in cities. Would taking a month or so to totally avoid drinking activities make it easier to reintegrate after the break even if I don’t have any problems with drinking on my own as it is? Will the loneliness crush me? I need more people in my life to see than my boyfriend.",1

Last time I almost made it to 30 days, but didn't, and now I remember why","I feel more depressed than ever. And I remember the last time I felt more depressed than ever as well.

Maybe it takes my body around 3 weeks to clear enough to fully experience the emotional craphole I've put myself in during the last drunken years. 

But now that I can feel it, sadly, I'm not surprised this is where I broke last time. I go back from work and sleep the whole afternoon and night, until I wake up and go to work again. I don't want to meet anyone because I'm afraid I might break down and cry, and given my history of depression, nobody wants that. I can be really heavy on people and I'm in love with someone I shouldn't. Some of the people around me don't even know about my feelings, because I'm too ashamed to admit to them. This makes everything even worse.

On top of that, generally speaking, neither my friends nor family seem to be fully supporting my sobriety. And those few who do, are unaware of how deep of a craphole I've put myself into with the aforementioned unrecruited love. I don't want to tell them, because I feel it's a burden and it's so easy to just say that I shouldn't have done this or that, or what was I thinking. I wasn't thinking. I was drunk most of the time, either because I was drinking at the moment or because I was drinking the night before. 

Drinking got me into this mess and it's highly improbable that it will take me out, so - for now I just try to withstand whatever comes my way. But it feels completely and utterly hopeless. And I'm not the one who usually goes with the ""I'll always be a loser"" narrative, but it just feels so true right now. Like there's no exit, no possible positive solution.

I simply feel lonely.",12
2020-06-01 15:22:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gur18c/7_days_already_wow/,7 days already!? Wow!,"I honestly thought I was at day 5 or maybe 6, but its been 7 days and 1 hour according to the bot here and AlcoDroid, 7 days and 1 hour since my BAC reached 0% last time. 

I should celebrate with some hot cocoa drink I suppose ^^ 

For me it was a combination of a really embarassing situation I put myself last time I blacked out, having a video record of it (I put up a camera myself to record whatever I do when Im blacked out), confessing to my wife about my problems and asking for her support and yesterday even two of my friends, reading This Naked Mind and reading and engaging in conversations on this sub. First few days were kind of hard, but I feel like I am in a state of mind where I am starting to despise alcohol, and I even get some familiar feeling about it back from my childhood when my own dad drank. I hated alcohol back then, I hated what it did do my father and other people, but somehow I ended up going down the same road. 

I hope I managed to stop in time, and I hope I will be able to keep it up. 

The unwanted side effect I got, however, is that I think I am starting to feel some anger or maybe disappointment towards drunk people, now that I am determined to stop drinking myself. For example yesterday me and 2 of my friends played video games and frankly it went quite bad, as in we were uncoordinated and losing badly. One of them, as usual, get frustrated and starts to discuss tactics, trying to find out what gone wrong, we can always fell the heat coming from his back side. He can be a bit rude or maybe rough during these moments, but its always okay, without anything that would offend others. We would usually discuss it and get back to playing, usually managing to get next round better.

But yesterday he was drunk, some beer in warm weather clearly hit him hard. And he was acting in a much more loud and offensive manner, to a point where I just left the conversation and game and went on doing my own things. I did not rage quit, I did not have any strong emotions burning in me, I just felt like I dont want to be listening him in this state. Maybe was a bit angry or offended. Another guy did not make a big deal of it, he's also sober and for over a year. 

I also know that I would not feel the same way if I were still drinking, even if I was sober during such conversation. 

I dont know, is it just part of recovery that will pass or is it new way of thinking? I dont want to judge people for moderate drinking or being tipsy or even drunk on occasion, but I feel like I do for some reason. For example he's not even a heavy drinker. Yes he can get totally wasted on occasion, but he usually drinks a few cans of beer once in a few weeks, which is not anywhere near the abusive drinking that me and many people on this sub got themselves into.

Anyway, cocoa's ready, cheers to another week and see you at 14 day mark! :)",12

I love wine, gobs and gobs of it.  Can't remember a time since I was about 15 years old that I didn't drink. I'm a professional, mom, artist, gardener, wife.  Old enough now that the regular amount of drinking I have always done makes me feel like crap way too often. I mean physically, and then psychologically.

I'd like to be sober for a little while. In my mind, for instance in my challenge to not drink today, I've made up this mission statement: ""Prevail to Escape Lasting Unwellness.""  

I don't have, and have never had, outside interventions. And my very well-meaning husband just doesn't understand. I mean culturally and intelligibly. He grew up impoverished in a culture where nobody will admit to having any kind of a psychological illness propensity or struggle  Therefore there is stigma and virtually no access to help in treatment. On top of that, he is the kind of person that can totally babysit a small glass of wine or a beer for an entire night and thus really struggles to fundamentally grasp how anyone else cannot do that.  Meanwhile I'm four glasses in two hours or less. I would rather not drink at all, than not drink as my whims dictate. I HATE being pressured to sit in front of one glass of wine and sip it.

I don't know if I should start with a week of No drinking, 2 weeks, a month. The last time I tried for a month I think I only got to 19 days.

6 months of no drinking but my mental health is still a dumpster fire. I had to move back in with my parents 28(f) because of addiction and Rona. My 24 year old brother seems to have everything going for him, we could not be more different in terms of attitude. I try to emulate his care free style but then I get dragged down by anxiety and depression, start to compare and that's never helpful.

  It hurts that he is clearly the first choice child to my parents. He has a really good job, gets to move around alot and is a helpful,good man. where as I have only held down kitchen jobs and when I did try a geographic solution to emulate my brothers adventures I ended up running home with my tail between my legs. 

I went to a treatment center in November my parents seemed relived that they didn't have to talk about my problems, yet my mother took it uppon herself to tell the whole extended family about my addiction which I'm still a little hurt about.

However it always stopped me from quitting. I would tell myself I am tapering and when I got to one or two beers a day, I’d drink more and start all over, in fear of going the next three days (typically when DT hits apparently) without.

Now, this Friday was the last day of alcohol sale for the weekend. And due to COVID the bars are closed. There’s no way for me to get alcohol for a couple of days. I was freaking out, and on my way to the store on Friday I fell and injured both my legs. Had to go to the ER and missed the sale. I had no way of getting alcohol. The sale opens tomorrow.

I feel weird. I can’t sleep. I’m grumpy and tired. But tomorrow I will be four days free of alcohol, and I am not touching that stuff again. I have read some of the stories from older people in here, and I do not want to end up like you (I mean no offense by that. English is not my first language so it might be an odd formulation).",4

If you are thinking about quitting, I promise there is beauty on the other side of addiction. Even when you are far down the rabbit hole. I drank two bottles of wine a night for close to 17 years. My liver was starting to go. I was so miserable. Constantly waking up at 3am, heart pounding, pain in my joints, muscles, and liver. Wondering how much more I could take. Looking at my amazing, supportive husband and loyal dog and hating myself for not being the wife I wanted, the partner he deserved. 

I wrote down every reason, physically and emotionally, why I wanted to quit. I saved it on Google drive and I still look at it sometimes. 

Good luck. Please reach out if you need support.

2020-06-01 11:46:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gumx9s/its_time_to_stop/,It’s time to stop.,"My story is probably familiar to some folks here, but it is my own to share.

I drank socially, starting in college and under what I believed to be normal circumstances. Parties, hangouts, nights at bars. 

This continued through my twenties and only in my late twenties did I begin to worry. I was binge drinking more often. Drinking at home. Blacking out. The worst feeling was waking up and trying to piece together the shame, wondering if I did anything bad. Trying to remember where my awareness ended. Tracing my footsteps, reading embarrassing messages I’ve sent to friends.

Then there were social events. On several occasions I got too drunk at work parties. Stumbling home. Not remembering conversations. Calling out sick the next day. 

In 2018 I had a bad event like that. The next day I get so hungover and disgusting I decided it was time to quit. It was years coming. By this time I was in my early thirties. I actually successfully stayed sober for a full 8 months. Then, on a vacation to a foreign country, I decided to relax and ease myself back into “cautious drinking”. Well, of course we all know where that leads.

It’s two years later and I’m no better off anymore than I was before I quit. Sure, maybe I have a better understanding of myself and my problems and limits. I’ve even read all the books in past quitting attempts - This Naked Mind, etc. I’ve been to therapy. I’ve practiced accountability. 

At the end of the day it’s my own determination that will set this right. I have to commit. As I type this I am hungover from drinking 2.5(?) bottles of wine by myself last night. I am tired. I feel gross and bloated and fat. I feel depressed. I want to hide from the world until tomorrow. I know I am damaging my mind and body. It is utterly pointless. I felt so good that 8 months when I was sober - why is it so hard to now return to that?

I can’t moderate. I can for a bit - maybe a good week. But then one night, I’ll drink a ton, drink until I can’t think or remember. Then the cycle continues. A few days later I silently, internally, mentally convince myself that “hey, it’s not so bad. So you got drunk again. It happens. You can have another beer now, what’s the big deal? Hell, maybe it’ll even make you feel better!” Rinse and repeat. 

I want this endless stupidity to stop. I am in control of my destiny, of my body and my mind. I want to lose weight. I want to wake up fresh and clear each day. I don’t want to want alcohol. I want to talk with others who are struggling the same as me. I will not drink today.",8

My left knee was bloody and sore. I'd stormed off at 2 am after getting into an incoherent argument with my husband during which I said horrible things. Fortunately, I had enough sense to take a walk instead of get behind the wheel. Because if I fell and busted up my knee doing something as simple as walking, I shudder to think what might have happened if I had been driving.

My husband stayed up waiting for me until I got home like a parent whose teenager has missed curfew (i'm 44). He heard me rummage through our kids' bathroom looking for something to clean up my knee with. He kept lurking around, checking up on me, so the last thing I said to him before I went to bed was ""Stop being so creepy.""

I went back to sleep after the kids left to do their own thing. The guilt and shame I felt when I woke up was crippling. I didn't want to leave the room because I knew I needed to apologize to my husband for what I had said, not remembering much of it at all.

When I finally worked up the nerve to talk to him, he was very cold and understandably hurt. I was scared I had broken us and ruined our family. Lucky for me, he's a patient man who has seen me at my finest (sober and kicking ass) so he just asked for a bit of time to forgive me.

The first few days were awkward AF (we avoided each other as much as possible), but on day 4 he called me ""baby"" so I know we're getting there.

Every morning since that awful day, the first thing I do when I wake up is reach down to feel the scab on my knee. It's a built-in reminder of how close I came to messing up my life forever. And it's in an awkward place, so it cracks a lot and will definitely take a long time to heal.

I want to be sober throughout the entire healing process, and every day after that.

I've been off the liquour for a little while now and so far it's made me feel like an absolute beast and given me heaps of personal success. It still does! But the positive feeling from staying sober is waning off and it is slowly becoming the norm, which in itself is great. 

However, especially last weekend I started feeling anxiety related to finances. My senior cat has been ill (recovering thankfully!) so it put a noticeable dent in my wallet. I still havent fully recovered from my past behaviour of spending way too much on drinking so I didnt have the veterinary bill money on a savings account like many responsible pet owners should have (or for any other sudden money requiring thing). I also believe being sober ""forces"" me to fully face these stressful life situations so perhaps they hit me harder now. 

On top of that today was a very hectic day at work, like I needed to use my brain at maximum capacity the entire day, and I finally had time to sit down and eat lunch at 2:30 pm. I'm home now and I just feel like I can't unwind. I'm desperately trying to think of ways to help me relax and not think too much about stuff I cant change, but boy is it hard. It's like my brain is one giant traffic jam at the moment.

I come to you asking for tips! What do you do to relax? How do you soothe your mind? 

Among all the ""noise"" in my head I can hear one specific question to myself: how do I re-capture the feeling I'm valid and a good person, which I still very strongly felt last week. 

All tips are more than welcome! And I hope you all have a wonderful week :)",3

I’m a 27 y/o F. I’ve had issues with alcohol for give or take 6 years. I’ve developed worse and worse habits as the years have progressed, with instances of hole and clarity in between. I am a guaranteed blackout drunk. When I start, whether it only leads to two or eight drinks, I can guarantee I will blackout. My actions have caused a lot of mental anguish for not only myself, but everyone around me. This notion kills me because I am naturally an avid protector of those that I love. And knowing that, as of late, all I’ve done is cause worry and strain for those I care about. 
I started dating the love of my life right around the time I started to battle issues with alcohol. He’s a very responsible, reasonable, and pragmatic person. He loves me so much and it kills him to see me do this to myself. It doesn’t make sense to him. He broke up with me because of my drinking back in early 2018. I was devastated and went down the rabbit hole of alcoholism even stronger for about a year and a half. I’m not even going to get into all of the terrible shit that happened to me because of my drinking, but let’s just say it has caused me a lot of grief and now that I think about it, a ton of PTSD to boot. 
He reached out to me last year in August and we have been going strong ever since. Since then and now, I’ve had plenty of slip ups, but he’s stuck around regardless. Back in February, I got trashed and called him. Needless to say, he was infuriated. He has a lot on his plate outside of me, so the additional stress isn’t fair. I stopped drinking after that phone call and had been sober since February 27th. 
His family and I are really close, I love them like my own family and I’m pretty sure they feel the same. I was invited to his fathers birthday party on Saturday. So, I baked a cake for my FIL and drove up to join the party. It was a surprise, so I helped make sure to keep it that way. Everything was going perfectly and according to plan. 
The night before the party, my boyfriend and I were discussing the breakup and how much we love each other. Specifically how well we are doing overall and how we were made for each other and how we are stronger than we have ever been as a couple. 
The day of the party, I got handed a piña colada. The fucked up thing is that when I was driving to their house, I told myself not to fall into the temptation bc I knew what it could lead to. 
I guess a part of me really wants to be “normal” and be able to enjoy a piña colada by the pool with the rest of the “normies”. I convinced myself I’d be fine with just one drink, but as it turns out, this was not the case. I honestly don’t even remember drinking more than a few sips. Next thing I know, I’m waking up in his bed without him around. I laid on his bed for hours waiting for the inevitable conversation.
When we came into the room, he promptly told me is done and wanted me to leave. Apparently, I was wasted and kept drinking and made a fool not only of myself, but him as well. He broke down and stated to sob, explaining that he doesn’t know how to help me anymore and all he wants is for me to get better. I’m his main support system and I keep letting him down. I begged to stay, but he made me understand that he needed to take a break. He lives 3.5 hours away from my home, and I really don’t want to go home. I drove around his city for hours after, just crying my eyes out. 
His mother contacted me thanking me for coming and for making the cake and saying she loves me. It killed me to see that, so I, of course, apologized to her profusely. I am so fucking embarrassed and ashamed. She replied saying she feels guilty for handing me the drink and that she just wants me to happy because she loves me. That made me feel like shit, because it’s not her fault. There’s no one else to blame but myself. My boyfriend also contacted me asking if I had made it home okay and I told him I was still in his city. He then asked if I had a place to stay and just asked to please get a hotel or go home and to not sleep in my car. 
An old friend luckily lives in the same city, so I was able to stay with her. Anywho, said friend had to go do her own thing, but I still don’t want to go home. I don’t want to face my family bc I know I won’t be able to hide what it is going on. I also want to be alone for a while, I think I really need to sit down and muster in all of this.
I am so deeply ashamed and angry at myself. I’m sick of myself. His sobs are burnt into my psyche. To know that I caused this pain of his all over again, especially after we had just discussed how far we’ve come, will haunt me for the rest of my life. 
I’m not sure where it is he stands and honestly would be shocked if he wanted to make it work. I really don’t think I’d be able to handle losing him again, but I don’t deserve him. He’s been too good to me for me to just go fuck it up time and time again. We are such a fairytale couple outside of the drinking. We love each other so so much and it’s just so fucking stupid that a liquid I chose to ingest is what’s going to fuck it all up. I am numb right now and I don’t what the purpose was behind posting this.. just needed a place to vent.

I’ve been putting this off for a while and I’m happy to post here for the support and cameraderie. I’ve been off the proverbial wagon for months and been pulled through all sorts of muck and grime. I met a new woman who I like a lot. On, Saturday, a relatively light day of drinking for me, she said “I’ve never seen anyone drink that much.” I know some people didn’t grow up around it, have managed to avoid it in their adult life, but it was hard to hear and frankly embarrassing. I told her I was having trouble with it so it wasn’t as if she was whistle blowing, we had been in discussion about it. In any case. Day 1 is today - and I have a lot of people I won’t be telling. However - I’m wondering everyone’s thoughts on telling a boss. I’ve been flaky and unresponsive at times during the pandemic and I have already alluded to my boss the issues I have after missing work because I was arrested for drunk related behavior. So is it a good move or a bad move to have an open convo with my boss and let him know “hey, I know things haven’t been great, but I just want to let you know I’ve cut out a lot of things from my life recently and I’m committed to excelling in my position moving forward”.

The person in the first picture, a little over year ago, didn’t believe it was remotely possible I could ever be where I am today, yet here I am – happy, healthy, loved, and thriving.  

By the time I finally reached my lowest point, I saw zero hope I would ever recover. I truly believed I was just going to lose the few good things I had left in my life, and I had reluctantly accepted my fate of dying a lonely, pitiful alcoholic death in my early 30s. Alcoholism had completely consumed me. I lost my job, alienated friends, family, and loved ones, neglected my physical and mental health for years, and felt completely buried by the massive weight of lies and deceit I had spun over the past decade to hide the extent of my drinking. It was soul-crushing, and while alcohol had been my escape for years, over time I wasn’t able to just drown my problems anymore. My life had become a never-ending struggle of trying desperately to keep whatever small pieces I could grasp together, while wading through the mental fog every day to maintain constant access to alcohol and keep withdrawals at bay. For the last couple years I couldn’t function without alcohol, but I eventually reached a point where I couldn’t even function with it. I was truly lost.  

When my incredible girlfriend finally gave me the ultimatum that she was about to leave me if I couldn’t get my shit together, I knew I had to pull from the miniscule amount of willpower I had left and at least try. I believed deep down that I was too far gone to be saved, but I still held onto a small sliver of hope. I wanted sobriety so badly. I wanted my life back. I wanted my friendships back. I didn’t really even know who I was anymore, but I wanted myself back. It was worth a shot, despite how low I thought my chances of success were.  

Being terrified of hospitals, I thought I could taper off and detox on my own, against the advice of literally everything I had heard and read about my situation. Not my brightest idea. After several days of pure agony while attempting to taper, including violent delirium tremens, painful pins and needles, difficulty breathing, and writhing in bed for hours on end in a lake of my own disgusting sweat, I finally suffered a grand mal seizure. I vaguely remember getting in the ambulance immediately afterwards, a fat, weak, shaky, sweaty mess, thinking “This is it. No going back now. I’m either going to beat this right here, right now, or I’m going to die.”  

With new determination to finally achieve sobriety, and finally opening myself to the outside help I so desperately needed but had been afraid of and avoiding at all costs, I found myself lying in the hospital bed realizing I should have sought help so much sooner. No one judged me. No one pitied me. All of the amazing doctors, nurses, and specialists were only there to help and support me. Accepting that help and support was so liberating, because I was finally able to admit to myself that while I was incapable of getting over that hump alone, with this army of professionals on my side I started gaining confidence that I could actually do it.  
  
Each day in the hospital I felt better and better. The worst of the anxiety, delirium, and physical anguish began to pass, and I found myself beginning to experience life with the clarity of sobriety for the first time in years. I can’t even describe how good it felt to actually be feeling and experiencing something, anything, instead of just drowning it in an ocean of booze. I was feeling hope, shame, relief, fear, and newfound resolve all at once. These were REAL EMOTIONS, and I was FEELING them! To those of you lucky enough to never have gotten as deep as I was, I had honestly forgotten what true, actual feelings felt like.  

When I was finally able to regain a decent amount of motor control and re-learn how to walk without alcohol in my system, I was released from the hospital. I spent the first few days on my own just reflecting on everything that had led me to that point, and planning my path forward from there. All my problems that had mounted didn’t just disappear, but with that dense cloud of addiction dissipating and no longer obscuring every facet of my life, the solutions to those problems suddenly became attainable. It wouldn’t be easy getting out of the hole I had dug myself into, but being sober, I finally at least had a shovel and a ladder, so slowly but surely, starting with the little things, I began picking up the pieces and clawing my way to the surface. Eating better and getting some light exercise every day helped a lot.  I also found myself immediately fully present and open in my friendships, my relationship with my girlfriend, and my relationship with my family. The ability to be truly honest in those relationships felt incredible, and the new trust and love I received in return lifted me higher.  

Over the past year I’ve made amazing progress in re-discovering myself and picking up where I left off in life when my alcoholism took over. I landed a fantastic job I love, I’ve rebuilt the foundations of many relationships, I’ve been able to get my finances in order and start saving money for the first time in years, and I’ve made huge steps in taking care of my physical and mental health. I cook fantastic meals and work out regularly. I’ve picked a lot of my old hobbies back up, and now I'm getting better at them than I ever could have been while drinking. Perhaps most importantly, however, have been sobriety’s effects on my clinical depression and anxiety. Since getting sober, I haven’t had a single anxiety attack and my depression has easily been kept at bay. It turns out “self-medicating” myself with ever-increasing amounts of poison was actually wreaking havoc on my mental health, and that had become a slippery downward spiral.  Who knew?  
 
All in all, within one short year, I’ve worked my way from the hopeless depths of despair to having a truly fulfilling life again. I never thought I could be this happy, and I just want all of you to know that if I can do it, so can you. It wasn’t easy, but HOLY SHIT was it worth it. Without a doubt, getting sober was the best thing I have ever done.

I relapsed this Friday and I haven’t even been able to post here (although I really wanted to) out of shame and extreme self-loathing. But I don’t know where else to go. 
It was going really really well. I had survived social triggering situations with friends. In fact, I felt peace for the first time in the 4y I’ve tried to fight the alcohol demon and become free of it. 
I had written a letter to my closest friends about how I no longer drank alcohol, couldn’t handle it, and for them to please never ask if we should drink wine/cocktails etc. again. 

Then this Friday my new boss who is the CEO invited me for a strategy day at her house with wine and sushi afterwards. On the same morning I had seen my therapist (alcohol counselor) discussing what to do, my fears, etc. I told her that if I went later and did not cancel I would with 99% probability end up drinking. My mind of course had subconsciously already decided to give in. 

I ended up drinking too much wine of course and shared a little too much, I allowed myself to loose control after having been in such control for 3 months. 
The day after was supposed to be my bachelorette’s party. But I was too hungover. I puked like 16 times not to mention all the crap I ate. Yesterday I tried to meditate, journal and listen to anything I could find on relapse and so on. It’s Monday not and it’s like the self hatred grows for each day. I am so close in losing hope. I am so tired of fighting. I don’t want to give in, but boy am I exhausted that 80% of the time my energy goes into thoughts related to my addiction. “Why me?” “Why did I fail?” 
 
I want to believe I am not alone but it honestly doesn’t feel like it anymore. For f***** 4 years I have been trying and still I don’t get it. I keep on relapsing. I have a good month, 2 months or this time almost 3 months and I fucking fail again. 
While it seems like everyone hits a rock bottom or have a magical awakening and from one day to the other they are sober and stay sober. Or like Annie Grace (author of this naked mind) they fall in once maybe twice but not 20-40 times like I have. 

I hate myself. Really. I am so lost.",23

Nothing sounded better than jumping in the ocean (something I haven't done in 4+ years despite living 15 minutes away from the beach). I went on the beach, I swam in the ocean, then I went for a walk.

""A drink sounds nice right about now"" and similar thoughts began swimming around my head. Then I stopped in my tracks. No, a drink does not sound nice. If I was drinking, I wouldn't be here right now. I would have gotten off work, immediately picked up a 12 pack, then drank my night away. And I would do it again, and again, and again. I would not live outside the shitty liquid cycle. If I drank the past 39 days, I know I would not have done anything outside of this cycle. 

Realizations don't come often. When they do, I hold onto them. For days when all I can do is lay on the floor and think about grabbing a drink. 

Life is meant to be lived in, and that's why I will not drink with you today.",8

My street is boarded up, smashed, and burned. I've been keeping it together for the most part but this last weekend was just too much. I drank about a half a handle of vodka while the gunshots rang out in the neighborhood. The thing is, it didn't make me feel any better. I just wound up feeling like shit even more. I started feeling a bit better yesterday and by last night I felt hopeful and optimistic again once the alcohol had left my system completely. I am going to head out to see what I can do to clean up my neighborhood today, and use that as a physical metaphor for cleaning up the destruction I caused myself.

2020-06-01 10:22:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/guli1j/my_mother_sent_me_an_sos_emergency_text_last/,My mother sent me an SOS emergency text last night accidentally or maybe on purpose?,"I haven't spoken to her since last year before she left for florida for the winter.  We have a very strained relationship.  My parents divorced 10 years ago after 39 years of marriage.  Following that they ""competed"" for validation in regard to their status of the best grandparent.  A lot of their interactions with my 10 year old daughter wife and I have been informed by their bitterness regarding the divorce.  They tell the story that makes them feel good and puts the other one down in some way.    

When I first stopped drinking I knew that I had to set better boundaries without over reacting.  Some worked at first, but neither of my parents could really handle it and it resulted in even more pressure on me to deal with them and limit the effect on my daughter.  Eventually, I had to move in with my father for a while because his health got so bad we had to oversee him or send him to a nursing home (yeah right).  My mother got worse with her stuff as I expected knowing we were living with my dad.  

I eventually blew up last year and told her I'd had enough.  That it wasnt about her life and her divorce it was about us and I didnt give a shit anymore about her feelings and all the guilt trips she would lay on us.  She is a fucking pro.  Thinks she has all the answers, is the righteous one.  She cheated on my dad when I was 7 and again when I was 8.  It was a secret until my dad finally told me a few years ago, showed me a letter of prove from her from 1985.  It explained a lot and the fire raged in me.  My dad was always a pushover and let her blame him for it.  I have given it to him to for not leaving her so he could have actually parented me.

Anyway, last night at 10pm I received an SOS message with ""HELP!"" with a google map locator to her house 10 minutes away.  I told my wife, jumped out of bed and sped over there thinking she was on the floor or something or was having a medical event she is older in age and has some health conditions.  

She answers the door, not really surprised and says she must have done it by accident.  I dont know if I believe that shit.  She asks how I am, I say ok and we share an awkward hug.  I told her that right now was not a good time for us to work through anything.  She proceeds to guilt trip and blame my drinking for my limits I set on her and basically telling me my drinking made me irrational with all of it.  I told her off semi politely and reminded her she had a role as well.  She told me she didnt know what role I could possibly be taking about.  I said nothing more and just left.  

I feel guilty, because I have to decide whether continuing to keep my daughter from her now that she is back here for the summer.  I dont want her in my daughter's ear with all of her bullshit.  But then I feel guilty and hate that I have something people can use against me rather than be loving and supportive.  I feel angry, frustrated and crushed as well.

I want to drink right now pretty bad.  This stuff is deep shit for me.  I posted this to get it out.  I hate my family sometimes.  It was all a fucking joke.  No wonder I wanted to escape so much.  Today is going to be hard I think my brain has already sent me to the store later.",7

A friend of mine and I made a two-week pledge: no weed for him, no booze for me. If we can't make it two weeks, it's time to admit we have a problem and seek help. If we can, then it's still time to reassess our relationship with our substances of choice. (I know two weeks is a silly-small chunk of time, but we figured we have to start somewhere.)

I know from previous experience that the next few days are going to suck, especially in terms of insomnia and night sweats. Does anyone have any advice for dealing with those?

I've experienced that these 2 weeks as well but I know I can be strong enough to power through to learn a new normal.

I progressed from 1 bottle Friday, to 1 1/2 Saturday, and Sunday went shopping for 3, such goals! Each morning I woke with the usual pounding head, troubled insides... 
I’m trying to lose some weight so nothing but coffee or water during the day to soak up any of the unrest. 
Yet each evening, the pain, the regret, the knowledge that this was not a good idea magically disappeared as I once again opened another bottle.

I had already made plans for today - June 1st, to be the day. I work in education so it’s almost my summer- what a good time to ‘remake myself’, learn new habits, make better choices, get healthier, happier... oh yes, quite aware I must be trying to drown some sorrows in all that red wine- or silence some inner voices.

But last Monday I woke with such an intense desire to CHANGE! I regretted the wine, the lack of discipline, the flirtatious texts sent to the wrong types of men, the habit I had faithfully developed and fed into each night which excused me from doing all the things I knew were better for me (exercise, eating better, social connections). 

I decided that I would start early and actually threw out an unopened bottle of red because I knew, come 5:00, it’s siren song would bade me to come. 

I made it through the week, but more importantly, the WEEKEND, without a drink. I was productive and accomplished a lot of house tasks I’d been putting off. I was a responsible parent and was able to pick my daughter up LATE at night without worries, I walked the beach, I tended my garden, I read a great book and listened to another... I cleaned my house and listened to my grateful body’s appreciation at not being poisoned this week. I loved the sleep and sober morning wake ups.

I know it’s only a few days, not even a full week yet. But I joined this subreddit a full year ago with this exact intention, and it’s taken me 51 weeks to finally be ready to do this and I am sooo thankful to be here, right now, able to say I’m ready.

For 3 weeks everything went smooth, until I got a new job offer. I decided to celebrate it with a beer. Had only one. This happened on Friday. 

On Saturday, seeing that I can stop after only one beer, I went to some friends for a board game night. I had 3 beers. Still not much and I was proud about myself for being able to stop. Usually on such ocasions I was binging the bottles until blackout.

Yesterday however was the 6 months memorial service for my grandmother. After the service I had some moonshine with my father. It didn't take long for me to blackout. I came back to my senses while  driving like a maniac 50 KM away from my home.

I don't know what happened. I didn't touch the car while drunk for over 6 years. It was always a no go zone.
