Quick recap: drinking has caused me to have been homeless twice, lose many amazing women, ruined friendships, attempted suicide, and most recently in a 12 day coma back in May.....those are just a few of the many horrible things that drinking has brought into my life. I have had struggles, like all of us, which leads me to binge drink and become horribly depressed. I have PTSD, depression, and MDD...so drinking only helps for an hour or two, then it exacerbates those conditions. 

I started an amazing position with a new company a couple of months back, I‚Äôm really fitting in and enjoying everyone I work with. Im performing well and getting great feedback. I‚Äôm forming new friendships and have been invited out with all of them on numerous occasions. I have politely declined but today was rough. I really wanted to go and bond more with them, be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, have the ability to handle my booze without making an ass of myself. Everyone went out after work today to celebrate the holiday and release some energy after a long week, these types of situations have led to multiple relapses in the past...well, that and starting new relationships. Each relapse is harder on my body than the last, harder to pick up the pieces, longer stays in the hospital, and longer to regain my mental clarity. I came home tonight and tried to distract myself with podcasts....all I can think about is quieting the little voice. It‚Äôs telling me that I‚Äôve matured this time around, I have done the work to grow personally, I go to therapy once a week, I‚Äôm happy again and the depression won‚Äôt come back, all of these things will amount to me being able to pick it back up again, in a responsible manner. 

I know it‚Äôs a lie. I will lose my job, these new friends, my happiness, stability, sense of self, growing confidence, independence, and self worth. I wish there was a way to quiet that manipulative little voice on this Friday night. I guess I just needed to get this out in writing....

I hope you‚Äôre all doing well in your recovery. I‚Äôve always enjoyed this sub and the advice I read here. Enjoy your Friday night and remember that the shitty little voice is always lying. IWNDWYT.",37,0

I think about drinking a lot still and miss the careless and crazy person I was when I was drunk but I am so thankful to be alive & so much healthier. I‚Äôve lost about 60 lbs in the last 6 months and I‚Äôve been making other positive changes in my life. I just never thought I‚Äôd give up drinking for good. It was always just a ‚ÄúI‚Äôll drink again when I‚Äôm ready‚Äù 

...And idk if I‚Äôll ever be ready. The person I was becoming, idk. I‚Äôve just been struggling a lot lately and literally 0 of my friends are sober so I don‚Äôt have people to talk to about this & ive been thinking of joining AA but it‚Äôs covid so idk, here I am... posting to a bunch of strangers in hopes someone relates to the nonsense I am trying to explain üòÇ 

It‚Äôs incredible, waking up every day without a hangover. But I hangout with my friends and they get to have drinks & let loose while I seem like the boring one & then I‚Äôm bored because I‚Äôm sober & my friends keep telling me to drink casually but like, I can‚Äôt do that.. if I start drinking again I‚Äôm going to start blacking out again every night & living a life I don‚Äôt want to live anymore. 

It‚Äôs just hard but on the bright side, this is the longest I‚Äôve been sober in 14 years so if anyone read all of this, thank you, and I‚Äôm proud of you all. I will not drink with you today üòä",39,1

I sometimes want to drink. But mostly just to fit in and ‚Äúhave fun‚Äù. I‚Äôve basically lost my best friend since I quit drinking, our friendship is currently in the process of a slow death. She basically ignores my texts for the most part. It all started because I didn‚Äôt drink at her birthday and she thought I had a bad time and didn‚Äôt want to be there (I actually had a good time and just left at a decent time for once).I don‚Äôt have an issue with people drinking around me, I just no longer wish to myself. 

The knowledge that she no longer really wants to hangout with me is a massive blow to my already low self worth (the question of if I‚Äôm worth being around while sober). Through therapy I‚Äôve recently came to the realisation that I have been drinking to be better in social situations since I as 14 (11 years).

My drinking personality is the life of the party. She is a flirt and outspoken. My real personality is still all of the above, I just take a while to warm up to people.

This is so hard. I am proud of my sobriety but, no one tells you how hard it is once people start walking out of your life or you have to face the real you.",13,0

At one point I went outside to have a cig and be alone for a minute.  The hostess came outside and found me and apologized for serving alcohol in front of me.  I replied that she didn't have to apologize; and that I'm not opposed to alcohol, it just doesn't work for me.  She said ok and went back inside, fairly soon I also went back inside and rejoined the party.

The words I said just came as a natural reply, but since it happened I have been reflecting and find that statement is very profound to me.  We can't expect others to change for us and we can't hide from alcohol.  We just have to remember that alcohol doesn't work for us and we have to remain firm in our conviction to stay sober.

I am looking for a new job, and not being hungover will definitely let me get some serious work done updating my resume, etc. If I get the position I want, I would really need to continue down the sobriety path as I would need to have my wits about me, and prove myself to the folks at the new company.

I was just crying ALL the time, super emotional, I would break down over little things that normally wouldn't bother me, and would stay up all night just THINKING. At times I would feel GREAT and other times I would wake up in a fog, feeling exhausted and almost feeling hung over. Thankfully my counsellor explained that my brain chemicals (or whatever, I'm not a scientist) were still adjusting to my body being without alcohol and that this process would likely take months and she sent me some info on PAWS. If I had known about it earlier I would have probably sought medical help before attempting to stop drinking, however, I have since done this and I was prescribed an antidepressant to see if it helps (have never been on them before, so we will see how this plays out). I was already doing everything else such as counselling, exercise, mediation, yoga, but nothing seemed to help, so I was willing to try anything to help me stay sober at that point.

For a bit of backstory, I'm a bartender in my mid-twenties and have been a high functioning alcoholic for over five years. I've narrowly avoided hospital trips, duis, and arrests for years. I've never hit ""rock bottom"" though and I always keep myself in check, which I know are just excuses I make to keep doing to same shit. 

Recently my SO purchased an RV and has invited me along to travel the country for a year. This was a decision made on extremely short notice and in the midst of me working through some major financial holes I've dug in the past few years due to injuries and COVID. I'll be quiting my job in two months and leaving, so I need every dime I can get my hands on. 

Obviously drinking is the first thing that's got to go, as I easily spend $100 a week on the stuff, and that's not considering the occasional gambling that takes place when I get properly sauced. I also just got over a nasty cold and quit smoking cigarettes a few weeks ago. 

I know it is especially hard to quit drinking when you run a bar, but I've done it in the past for a few months and only decided to start drinking again on while on vacation, not while working. This time may be permanent though. I love drinking, making cocktails, pairing booze with foods, all of it. But sometimes you have to realize that certain things just bring more sorrow than joy. 

I woke up today actually looking forward to going to work, not getting off work so I can have my shift drink +5 more. I am so excited to travel the country with my lover and get back into decent shape, as I gained the quarantine 15... +15... +15.

I'm late 40s, a professional with a good career, married over 20 years, one kid in a great college and a second on his way to another great college. I've never had a dramatically bad event caused by alcohol or other substances. Not for lack of trying or opportunity. 

I've done all the dumb stuff. Drove drunk. Like close one eye to line up the lane marker kind of drunk. Many times. Ride share apps have helped with that issue a lot. Lots of black outs. Lots of saying and doing inappropriate stuff.

I've done a few 30 days sober in the past but I've always planned to go back to drinking. I know my drinking is escalating and it needs to just stop. That's a tall order. I've built my life around it. My closest friends are all heavy drinkers. I love to cook and eat well and, of course one needs the right wine to go with such a nice meal.

Two nights ago I returned home from several days out of town. I was substantially drunk but I've come home much worse before. My oldest kid and my wife had a come to Jesus talk with me. She's unhappy. Not going anywhere soon but not going to put up with this situation forever. My kid pointed out a number of changes to me over the last few years and a number of inappropriate things I've done in the not too distant past.

On my trip, I was on a full bender. Yesterday, I had to maintain a low level of alcohol to control the shakes and basically allow myself to function. I wasn't drunk or even buzzed. But that's unacceptable. I've drunk no alcohol today and won't. 

I may go to first ever aa meeting later today. We'll see. It's a busy day but at least I got this post up to do a little venting and help to hold myself accountable.

I just created this account to make this post. I really need help. I am a functioning alcoholic with demanding job, 2 year old baby and a husband. No one other than myself knows what have I gotten myself into. I just drank a glass of wine first thing in the morning as soon as everyone left home. I have also collected all my hidden empty wine bottles so I can go sell and get some money to buy another one. This is how my morning is going so far!! I have never been late on a deadline, my work respects me very much and I just got a bonus for high/over performance on a project. That made me even more confident.

I have been drinking 1-1.5 bottles of wine EVERY SINGLE DAY. I did not drink for the last 2 days because I want to quit. I know how damaging this could be to me, to my relationship and other aspects of life but that tomorrow never comes. I am so scared to say it out loud that I quit. That would mean failure of not handling my alcohol moderately.

Everyday, I make a wow that it will be tomorrow... just this one last bottle, this last day of being the heaviest I have ever been, this last day when I eat junk because of drinking, this is the last day. But tomorrow never comes.

No one in my friend circle knows or even my husband. I WFH so I finish a bottle by the time he gets home and then act ""normal"". I am very strong personality so even when he suspects, I bark back at him at how dare he always thinks I am always drinking. I am sure he knows something is up!! 

I have ran out of all my cash (good thing!) and we have a joint account so he will know overtime I buy. This is one last time I can buy today. 

How do I gain the strength to decide that this is it? Alcohol is always on my mind! ALWAYS. Sometimes, I wake up in the middle of night thinking about the drinking plan for tomorrow around my meetings etc. I do not have to drive either so that works for me perfectly. I am waiting for probably a slap on my face but I would have lost everything by then. I am very scared but the scare is not enough to make me stop.

I found this sub yesterday through a random other sub during a raging hangover. I have known I have issues with alcohol for quite a while now, and have tried to quit drinking a number of times over the years. I think the longest I've ever gone was about 30 days. That would have been sometime early this year. It was a legitimate try, but one I ultimately failed at.

But as I've seen everyone say here, pick yourself up, dust yourself off and move on. It is time to make things right.

I have been a very successful with career. It has made hiding my inability to have just one drink very easy to do. It was the age old excuse: I cannot have a drinking problem if I am doing so well in life. I have a loving wife, a beautiful 2 year old son and am in a very stable environment and a great job. But I continue to self-destruct with my drinking. Somehow it has not yet affected my professional life, but I feel if I keep doing what I'm doing it will at some point.

It certainly has affected my home life. My wife has been incredibly supportive of me, but I know she is getting to her wits end. She knows it is a struggle, but I know it is only a few more screw ups on my part for her to leave. I keep trying to put myself in her shoes. Seeing your husband black-out drunk, slurring words and unable to help with the little boy is completely unacceptable. Furthermore, hiding alcohol is clearly a sign I am unable to control myself.

So it is time for me to actually do something about this. And I cannot do it alone. I've tried that, it does not work for me. I will have this post be my first step to sobriety. The posts I read yesterday were so incredible and supportive. The people here are amazing. It has opened me to the idea that I'm not alone, and I need not be shamed into admitting I need support. 

The hangover is gone. I start a new job today after leaving an incredibly toxic firm that likely led to my significant increase in drinking. Time to be the father, husband and professional I know I can be and should be. This is the start of my second day not drinking, I'm a little groggy still but don't have that fog we're all so familiar with. All I have to do is not drink today and thank all of you for sharing your stories.",4,0

I loosely knew about this and I think most people know you can change your habits by repeating new ones, right? It's just gaining the motivation to do so.

Thanks to covid I haven't had to go out and socialise with people at bars for awhile, it's been easy to avoid. I was never too bad with home drinking compared to other people, my demons would really show when I went out. I've done really well at not drinking so far, quite proud of myself really, but I haven't had to go out yet! And with Christmas looming round the corner I'm getting anxious. I had a zoom call with my boyfriend's whole family (parents, two brothers and their partners) and they all love a drink, and one of his brothers said we had better all have a drink with us before we join the call! Man that made me feel so anxious, and I've had so many thoughts that it'd just be easier to drink alcohol than explain that I don't drink anymore. (Which is bogus of course)

When I do eventually go out again, I'm trying to think of something I can replace the alcohol with. Food would be good, but I can't gorge myself on it all night haha. I'll drink plenty of non alcoholic drinks and that should help a lot since you're still sort of doing the old habit, just without the poison. But what if that isn't enough? I could just walk to the bar and pop a shot in my lemonade if I'm feeling anxious in that social situation. Maybe I could keep a notebook handy and scuttle off to write out some feels, remind myself why I don't drink.

I drank a bottle of wine last night and it hit much harder than usual. Instead of eating a real dinner I made and ate a ridiculous amount of cheesy wraps (like, I gotta buy my roommate replacement tortillas now). After I drained the wine I also stole one of my other roommate‚Äôs beers, even though when I‚Äôd asked if I could have one a few days ago, she‚Äôd said no. 

This is where the real shame comes in, especially because I don‚Äôt remember much. I know one of my roommates was home the whole time, but I don‚Äôt think I ever saw or talked to her. I know at one point my other roommate and her bf came home, and I saw and briefly talked to the bf in the hallway (no clue what I said). I also know that at some point, after I drank the stolen beer, my stomach flipped and I had to puke into a plastic bag in my room, which I wrapped with multiple plastic bags and hid in the corner of my room (it‚Äôs still there). I then went into the bathroom and ran the shower to hide the noise of me puking again. 

But that‚Äôs all I know. It‚Äôs 8 am now and I‚Äôve been up for four hours just lying awake, feeling terrible. Do my roommates know?? Did they hear me throwing up? I must‚Äôve been making a bunch of noise in the kitchen while making all my stupid cheesy wraps, and again when I came to grab more plastic bags to hide my vomit. Honestly, I don‚Äôt even remember turning the shower off‚Äîdid one of my roommates have to come shut it off?

The worst part is that I did this barely a day after my roommates and I had a long talk about alcohol, sharing some of our most regrettable drunk stories and cringing about how dangerous/stupid we‚Äôd been (we also congratulated ourselves bc ‚Äúat least we don‚Äôt really puke anymore‚Äù....lol). I was very upfront about how I knew I had a problem, especially when it came to drinking alone, and they were sympathetic.

But I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve that sympathy when I go out and do this to myself. They know that I know I have a problem and need to stop, but I still went to the store knowing I‚Äôd drink the whole bottle, and even then it wasn‚Äôt enough, and I still stole my roommate‚Äôs beer. I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about how pathetic it is, drinking so much alone in my room that I literally make made myself sick. 

It‚Äôs going to be time to get up soon, and I have a good amount to do today (write a paper, answer some emails, attend a zoom Halloween party for a part-time job üò£. Also face my roommates and somehow conspicuously throw away my vomit, I guess). I‚Äôm also going to call my doctor back‚Äîa few weeks ago I asked her to refer me to a substance abuse counselor, but I missed the first call and hadn‚Äôt gotten around to following up yet.

Here is what I have experienced these last 20 days.

After the first few days, I began to wake in the morning with a feeling of peace, contentment, and, wait, what is this, is this a little bit of joy?  Compare that to the last 20 years or so of waking with regret, fear of what I may have said the night before, fear of what I was doing to my body, disappointment and a general apathy for my life...One point for the sober life, 0 points for the alcohol sodden life.

I have achieved so many things in the last 20 days:  painted some rooms in the house, baked, created beautiful dinners, taken up weaving again, walked the dog, remembered movies that I have watched, read more, up about 2 hours earlier every morning for some ""me time"", the house is clean and I have began studying the beautiful Spanish language again.  Compare that to the last 20 years of getting drunk almost every night, watching movies that I never remember the next day, living in a fog with no motivation...One point for the sober life, 0 points for the alcohol sodden life.

Saved about $400 or $500 in the last 20 days (even with the increased ice cream budget).  One point for the sober life, 0 points for the alcohol sodden life.

Feeling proud vs. feeling ashamed.  One point for the sober life, 0 points for the alcohol sodden life.

I think you all get the gist of my post, I could go on and on.  Perhaps still riding a bit of the pink cloud, but even when this dissipates, it will be better than the dark, lonely hole that drinking put me into.  I thought I drank because I was depressed....turns out I was depressed because I drank.

I realize not everyone who quits has this type of experience in the early days.  I remember talking to a wise soul in his seventies who had quit drinking in his early 50s.  ""Best thing I EVER did"", he said, and he had had a lot of adventures in life (sailed twice across the Atlantic with his, then, wife, drove a car from Europe to Singapore in the 1970s, does hut to hut ski tours, travels extensively...still, quitting drinking is THE best thing he has done in his life).  I have thought about that many times since I met this fellow in 2012.  Here's to best things in life.  IWNDWYT",246,0

October has been difficult; On the 8th, I experienced a setback two days before I hit my 6-month mark (had two beers but felt nothing). After that, I went another 20 days before I slipped and had a few sips of Lambrusco last night. Idk if I should feel ashamed of myself or not, there‚Äôs this unusual stew of pride (for having three sips and stopping) and dissatisfaction circulating through my veins. These events have led me to conclude that successive day-counting is counterproductive and creates a cloud of pity for me. Contrarily, I‚Äôm probably feeling this way because I‚Äôm trying to rationalize and soften the blow of the setbacks. I genuinely don‚Äôt know what to do. Before that 182-day stint, I‚Äôd been a daily drinker who used alcohol as a crutch. Is this progress supposed to disappear just because I had two beers? I quit cold fucking turkey with no rehabs or programs - is this improvement obsolete as of today?
Man. This is difficult. On top of my existential dread, depression, anxiety, ADHD, nihilism, taking care of a dying parent, being a lesbian, being Black, living in the hood, being a woman, and living under capitalism, I have to battle alcoholism, too? How the fuck am I supposed to cope with the constant anhedonia, brain static, and grief? Positive affirmations don't work. Exercise doesn't work. Indulgent self-care doesn‚Äôt work. Prayer and rituals don‚Äôt work (I‚Äôm a secular anti-theist).  None of these workarounds provide me with the same relief from my internal chaos. Where else will I get relief from all that I see and experience (I know that alcohol‚Äôs ‚Äôrelief‚Äô was toxic escapism, just venting here)?

Ugh. I feel like a failure. Weak. I was overpowered by the ambiance surrounding both of the relapse nights. I‚Äôm going to shoot for a year of sobriety this time. Funnily enough, the buzzes did absolutely nothing for me. I need to accept that alcohol is no longer needed as a crutch. This is the worst breakup experience I have ever had. The wine was my confidant and trusted friend in this cold, unforgiving place. Well, at least it felt that way whenever I wore the Ros√©-tinted glasses. It was my catharsis, my relief elixir, my anxiety-reducer, and the driving force behind my impulsive creativity. It helped me feel better about my perpetual state of physical and philosophical loneliness. However, it also made me overspend, throw up, and make some of the worst decisions that have impacted me for the rest of my life. I hate myself. I haven‚Äôt slept. I want it all to stop. I guess I have to buckle down and find a sober community offline. Not AA, but something else in the NYC/NJ area.

Thank you for reading this if you‚Äôve made it this far. Idk right from wrong right now. 
I am starting over yet again. 
I guess this is the final farewell to alcohol and momentary decisions.

I was in the ICU for almost a week. Found out from my sister which I did not know that I almost died twice while there. I was in a cute liver failure and my other systems were shutting down. I managed to make it through I had to go to physical rehab after all of my blood levels started to return to normal period I am being released a week early from physical rehab to go home.

I have done so much damage to my liver that one single drink may actually kill me. I also have a bunch of medications that I will be on for the rest of my life to keep my body functioning. Most people do not recover from this kind of liver failure. they were telling my family that a liver transplant was the only thing that would keep me alive, but I would never be approved for one because I had done it to myself
 
So I have no choice but to stay sober now. but after everything I put my family through, everything I've put my daughter through, and everything I went through, I actually have zero desire for a drink at all. I took it so far about as far as you could take it. 

maybe I'm being overly optimistic but I do not think that I can have a relapse. But I know I need to deal with the guilt and the shame of what I've done and how I affected my family. I will start attending meetings and I will be going through counseling as well.

I will say that if you want to stop drinking, you should do whatever it takes to stop drinking because of this s*** is no joke.

I've posted a comment there, but I'd like to elaborate - in front of people, not just in front of myself, where after a week I'd rationalize and warp my own sense of responsibility and fear. 

I think that most and foremost I fear rejection. 

Like mamy of my then peers, I started drinking (and smoking) in my teens to ""fit in"". I'm a small woman, so in order to ""keep up"" I had to literally train myself by drinking on a regular basis so that I don't get completely smashed after the first beer. 

For years I've been this kind of party girl who's fun to be around and with whom you can have a solid couple of drinks, because ""I can handle my liquor"". Funny how this phrase is used, suggesting the complete opposite to the truth. Honest truth be told - I often used it to help people. I'd be around to mediate (drunkily) between the two more drunk then me individual. I'd be around to give someone an arm, to cry on whenever someone would get emotional. I'd listen and surprisingly - I'd remember what I've talked about with people. 

So - when I had a few months sober earlier this year, it's the rejection of people who seemed hurt to see me gone from the drinking train, that hit me the most. I've come to feel *useless.* I got out of my way to make people sure that I'll not be judging anybody now that I'm sober, but some felt judged nonetheless (especially my bff, who has a drinking problem and I tried to talk to him about it) and others felt abandoned by me (my god mother with whom I used to enjoy some wine in the Saturday evenings - I feel like my presence gave her the permission to ""have fun""). 

Meanwhile I met my now SO who's the occasional drinking type. On a party he'd open one beer and not even finish it. He's completely not interested in getting drunk. 

I feel like I'm halfway somewhere which is a confusing place to be. I know I shouldn't be drinking, but I want to enjoy my friends and family and apparently me not drinking hurts them in some way. I was able to stay sober for some time but now I've sort of gave up, I'm second guessing the validity of my will to get sober. 

I feel a resentment building up under my skin. And it's a resentment towards literally everyone in my life right now. I'm not trying to shift blame (""oo I drink because of them""), I recognize that it's my decision to make and stand to take, to put myself before others expectations of me - and let the rest sort itself out. I'm just not sure where to find strength for it. I've been pretty isolated from not drinking before (notably - bc of my supposed bff, who was so hurt with me he went out of his way to make sure I get excluded from our circle of friends) , I don't want to get isolated even more. 

I know I'd probably make new, sober friends etc Im just not sure if I'm ready to pay the price for that. 

It's scary. 

Im sorry for the ramble. Thank you for anyone who reads it - and if it's not too much to ask for, I'd kindly ask you to let me know what you think in the comments. I'm genuinely tired with this mess and I have no one to turn to with this cr#p.

This is my first time posting here so I‚Äôm not really sure if this type of post is appropriate for this sub, but I wanted to get some feedback. I‚Äôve officially been sober for a week today and I feel great. But for the last 2 days or so I‚Äôve been randomly flashing back to memories from my childhood or teen years. Not like full on flashbacks, but I‚Äôll remember a scene or a sound or a feeling I had just out of nowhere, and they‚Äôre completely random. For example, just a few minutes ago I flashed back to when I must have been around 7 or 8 standing on a chair in my living room playing with one of those mechanical singing fish that hung on our wall.

My mother-in-law is certainly nice and certainly has her own demons but she is literally the bossiest person and the most demanding person I have ever met. Ever. While I was over there I was taking my mother her purse up to the top floor because she'd left it open in the car. As I am walking up the stairs my mother-in-law walks out of the kitchen and says verbatim ""You are never to go upstairs without more in your hands, there are things I need you to do upstairs."" She doesn't live there and she is not going to live there. I tried to brush it off and kept going up the stairs. When I get up to my mother she is in one of my stepkid's rooms and she is washing down the surfaces and she has tears in her eyes.

100 days. It‚Äôs taken me a bit to muster up the courage to post this, but I know seeing other people‚Äôs photos has given me motivation to continue on the path. I‚Äôve also recently been dealt quite a blow with a nasty breakup, and that‚Äôs taken time to handle. Still not drinking, even though the temptation was oh so real. 

The photo on the left, that‚Äôs the guy who was drinking a handle every two days. That‚Äôs the guy who can‚Äôt really explain to you why his shirt sleeve is rolled up or why his phone is hooked to whatever it may have been. I‚Äôm not sure why the mirror is foggy either, perhaps the fog of drinking? 

The photo on the right, that‚Äôs the guy who looks way happier on his 100th day. The guy who thinks clearer, makes sounder decisions, and realizes that a lot of problems came from alcohol but not the first one was solved with it. 

If you‚Äôre struggling, reach out. I came to a plateau, either continue drinking or lose a close knit group of friends. They stepped up and offered to help, even as far to take me to rehab if needed. Joining this page and seeing the success and encouragement was a big help as well. I realized something had to change, and it‚Äôs by far the best decision I‚Äôve ever made. 

It can be overcame, I literally had a point in life I hated myself for drinking and had this ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never be able to quit‚Äù mentality floating around in my head. Was this my first attempt? Of course not. Is it going to be my last? Most definitely.

I‚Äôve been a heavy drinker for the past 10 years. At first it wasn‚Äôt a problem but developed into one.

I got my first DWI almost five years ago, got off with a fine, community service, 90 days of an interlock and community service. I was incredibly lucky. After that I straighten up, still drank semi heavily but never drove if I had anything to drink.

Fast forward to this year, I‚Äôm married now, have an amazing job and house. But, this year as everyone knows has absolute sucked. I was switched to work from home because of covid, but that started to take it tole on me. Started drinking more again. Not 24/7 but ever evening. I have been on lexapro for a few years for anxiety, but after talking with my doctor he also put me on Welbutrin for depression. Yes I still drank on it, yes that was incrdibly stupid. 

Well Tuesday afternoon I decided to have a couple tall boys because it was a rough day at work. After i had already had them I got notified to I had to run up to my office to fix something. I thought, no big deal, it‚Äôs been an hour and half since I opened the first one, I‚Äòll be ok. Well I had a reaction with the Welbutrin, I remember getting ready to leave the office, text my wife I was on my way home. Then I was getting pulled over a couple hours later. Some of it came back to me, I got lost in a neighborhood try to get a friend‚Äôs house my wife was at to pick her up, and I at one point helped someone look for their kid that had ran off. I vaguely remember buying a couple fireball shots (one of my favs) and drinking them but that‚Äôs it all I can recollect for those two hours.

I haven‚Äôt drank since and don‚Äôt plan to ever again. I am signed up for counseling for my depression, and looking for an alcohol support group. I would like to avoid AA mostly because of the Christian influence. 

I know I have a long road ahead of me. I have broken down and cried and cried so many times over the last couple days. Luckily I have the most amazing wife in the world who is being completely supportive and hasn‚Äôt shown an ounce of anger, I would not be able to this without her. I also have an amazing and supportive family (except my dad, that‚Äôs a different story) and friends.,

Again sorry for the ramble, I‚Äôm not even going to proof read this because I am starting to tear up again. I have been a long time reddit user and have participated in some amazing communities. I have visited this one many times in the past and I know how supportive you all can be. I look forward to updating you every day on my journey and hearing all of your stories as well.",10,1

Withdrawal sleep - nightmarish. Anxiety praying I can get 4 hours and not pull an all nighter before work. Itching in bed, sudden awakenings as I start to doze off, hot flashes, convincing myself to drink more water every half hour.

Sober sleep = amazing, I look forward to laying down for bed early with a natural feeling of tired winding down with a movie or show.

Over lockdown, I started drinking in the afternoons. I figured I was at home and I wasn't going anywhere, what was the harm? Did work really notice that I kept forgetting what I said I would do?

Then, I went back to work at location, and the old habits set in. Get off work, get home, start drinking and eventually pass out. It was stressful. I realized I was losing memory, I was slower and not as reactive at work, I was snappier with my kids.

I went to my GP today and told them everything. Accurate volume, how long it has been happening, how it's worsening my depression. I have been prescribed a mild antidepressant and I was given resources. I learned about SMART recovery. I can do this. I need to do this.

I will not subject myself to that kind of drama   I‚Äôm also sad because that particular meeting was one of the first I attended when I went into rehab. Now I would like to tell the person causing this that it‚Äôs dumb and against the principles of AA to exclude people due to not being able to physically be in the room safely or in such a way that they can be kept safe from COVID.  However I know better than to call someone out in the open like that as that would be dangerously close to taking someone else‚Äôs inventory and that‚Äôs a no-no.

I need to write this down. I need to make some sense of what happened and how I ended up poisoned, laying in bed all day, cancelling all my engagements, and generally feeling so sick I wanted my own mother to care for me. Hah. 

So. I was on day 47, which is a significant accomplishment for me.... 
I've been doing school courses and not working, just been living at my rental, losing weight, getting exercise, good stuff. Good stuff I apparently thought was getting boring. 

I had this growing anxiety building in me for days. Each day it got more unbearable. I didnt know how to fix it. I tried exercise,  meditation, baths, cooking, sleeping. 

In my mind the only thing that would fix this would be alcohol. Not only did I spend 300 at a casino, I got that first fated drink. Then I got a bottle of wine at the store. Went home, and I drank most of it. Then me and my roommate went out. 

I was that annoying drunk girl. Spent more money on slots. Bought rounds for people wh0 were not my friends. God. I have become so repulsed by this person I become. But I did it anyways. I fuckin did it anyways. 


We came home. I didnt go to sleep till 430am. The worst part is I left my poor cat on her leash outside for 3 hours until I remembered her at 7am. Fuck. I'm a horrible person. 

So, what did I learn you ask? 

I learned that being sober is unearthing some very uncomfortable feelings I dont feel equipped enough to handle. I am going to get some ativan from my doctor next week. I am also going to get back with a therapist. Even tho I have no money right now, I guess it's better to spend my money on good things that will help me than bad things. 

I want to be sober so bad. I know now after years and years of trying to drink normal that it wont work for me. And most of all that I do not like who I am when I use. 

I dont really believe in god but do I ever wish he could just fix me.

I apologize if this is long, but it‚Äôs good to get it out there and hopefully I can look back at this and see how far I‚Äôve come. My last drink was the night of 10/27/2020 edit: actually day two because I can‚Äôt math lol

I love drinking. I love smoking weed too...but not like I love drinking. I like so many others like to drink when I‚Äôm happy, sad, stressed, celebrating, bored, horny...pretty much whatever mood. I‚Äôve never really saw it as a problem until the last couple of years. I‚Äôm 35 years old and I still didn‚Äôt think I had a problem when I‚Äôve urinated on a friends couch, then another friends couch, then my bed multiple times, or my ex gfs car, when she left me there after my bday celebration. Shit, I had an amazing FWB and once night of heavy drinking and sex, she and I woke up in my own pee stained bed. I just thought I had a small and terrible bladder. I would embarrassingly joke about it when my closest friends (who knew alllllll about it) would make fun of me. I would find the solution! I could still drink all I wanted, I would just make sure I would pee before bed NO MATTER WHAT. Even if I didn‚Äôt need to pee, I would wait there squeezing until I had to go...like a damn child. It‚Äôs absolutely embarrassing and I‚Äôve never truly told anyone until now the extent and how many times I‚Äôve done it until now. I started seeing a psychologist in June when my 3 year relationship fell apart. She informed me that each one of those times were a big sign of alcohol poisoning. 

I love drinking. Whiskey neat is my drink of choice, but I‚Äôll definitely drink about anything. I‚Äôm a whiskey snob, but I can still drink a whole bottle of Kentucky deluxe and not bat an eye. I‚Äôm a fun drunk! I‚Äôm the type you want at parties and weddings to keep everyone entertained, laughing while I tell funny stories and keep the people smiling. Until I hit a point and I‚Äôm no longer there. Still silly, still the joker, but no longer Lloyd. I don‚Äôt know when to quit or stop like most do. I‚Äôm the guy who will recommend shots after a full night of drinking at 2 or 3am. I never want the party to stop. Let‚Äôs keep this feeling going and fuck whatever tomorrow brings! ‚ÄúNo day but today!‚Äù Kind of mentality. Even though tomorrow will ALWAYS bring the worst hangover and I‚Äôll promise to myself that I won‚Äôt drink for awhile. I eat alll the worst foods for you, watch movies all day and reset. Then 2 days past and bam! I‚Äôm right back at it again. 

The global pandemic is terrible time for everyone. It‚Äôs insane that we‚Äôre all living through this and trying to make it through the best way possible. Quitting drinking during a pandemic? Sure, why not. No day but today. 

My ex...she is a drinker as well, but she handles it way better than I do. She loves to say drink, drinks water, and paces herself. I cannot day drink because I‚Äôll be passed out by 6pm and I don‚Äôt know what pacing is, nor do I ever drink water while drinking. We connected drinking. We didn‚Äôt have much in common, but we both loved to drink. I don‚Äôt want to speak too ill of her, but it was a very toxic relationship. Very toxic. I know I wasn‚Äôt the best partner, nor easiest person to be in a relationship (always a bachelor and this was my first true LTR) but I can say what was my fault. She was controlling, manipulative, verbally and emotionally abusive. You never really notice when you‚Äôre up close. But I ignored all my friends and family telling me other wise. I knew she was mean, but I loved her and was going to make it work. We got a puppy last October, she paid $100 more and said ‚Äúif we break up, I get to keep her‚Äù silly me agreed. We drank, because that‚Äôs what we liked to do together. Drink and then go do things. Drink at brunch, drink before and after dinner. Hike and then drink. We drank about 3 or 4 nights a week. Then Pandemic and THANKFULLY we both kept our jobs and were able to work from home. I can do my job hungover! That shit sucks, but I can suffer through. Then we were drinking 6 nights out of the week starting in March. Again, she was good at having a bottle of champagne, whileI would have a 6 pack of the strongest IPA or beer the liquor store offered. Or grab a bottle of whiskey. 

Late June everything came to a head. We had been day drinking at the pool with her friends, we came back to our house, cooked dinner, drank, played games and drank some more. Around midnight I passed out around the living room floor. They continued playing games, but her friends left. She started yelling at me for being embarrassing and how was I drunker than everyone etc. told me to go to bed. I did so. I guess I was in the middle of the bed and she got mad at me again and started yelling at me again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an embarrassment, grown ass man drunk and can‚Äôt handle liquor etc‚Äù. She always used to tell me my flaws and shit I did that bothered her. I never said anything and bottled it up because I didn‚Äôt want to hurt her feelings. That drunken night I exploded. I don‚Äôt remember much, but I threw a pillow and screamed in her face and called her a ‚Äúbitch and cunt and said I was kicker her out and keeping stormy‚Äù. All things that I didn‚Äôt mean. Ive never called a woman a cunt before. And I call a woman a bitch it‚Äôs usually outta love like ‚Äúbiiiiiiitch, I love you‚Äù. I‚Äôm a dude raised by women and I don‚Äôt treat people like that. Shit I don‚Äôt treat anyone like that. I knew I needed help. 

I found a psychologist, told her my past and she recommended CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) and to quit drinking. I told my ex She will never see me that drunk ever again. A week later I hung out with one of my best friends, got blacked out drunk (after not drinking a week) at a bar across from his house and crashed there. The next day she was upset because I got so drunk and we broke up. I got a place by myself, started feeling free and realizing that I was happier without her. That I‚Äôm obviously not the person for her. I could finally breathe and not feel like I‚Äôm tip toeing in my own house. She kept our puppy, which has been the hardest part. My new place was going to be a nice reset. Focus on my and my past traumas, work on bettering myself. Shit. I moved here and started drink more because I was by myself and didn‚Äôt have to worry about upsetting anyone. 6 days out of the week, I‚Äôm finishing a 6 pack a night. If I buy whiskey I‚Äôll finish it in two days. I started smoking cigarettes after quitting for almost 3 years. 

With CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) there is homework. I don‚Äôt do the homework. I tell my psychologist I will next week. I tell her how much I‚Äôm drinking, I haven‚Äôt lied to her, but nothing is changing. I have a lot of trauma in my past and PTSD to work through but I avoid it with drinking. There will never not be a reason for me not to drink. I‚Äôm stressed about my homework, I start drinking.

I told her that I wanted to give this another shot. Try and quit drinking on my own. As I type this I can‚Äôt stop thinking about taking a sip. But I‚Äôm going to fight it. I have to. For myself, for my family. I love drinking, but I love myself more.

For me, the first 6 weeks or so were the most difficult. I made the choice a couple days after new years to give it up for good. I tried quitting a few times before and made it 6 weeks at most. The difference this time was that I reached out to an acquaintance that I knew had many years. Over coffee, he recommend I just try one AA meeting, so I did. It was a small meeting with the average age of about 60, I'm 27. They were SO kind and honestly proud of me, even though we were strangers. They told me I was the most important person there, having been sober for just a couple days but making the effort to try my first meeting. I've never been since but will try to reach out to them on my one year.

I've gone from 230lbs to 187lbs! I'm more active than ever, more than high school. I got back into surfing and, even being in Maine, I'm still going out in the cold and its the most amazing thing. I'm playing golf again, bought a membership for next year. I cook a ton of healthy (and not so healthy) meals for me and my wife. I'm excelling at work. I keep in touch with family and friends. I've made new friends! I'm more outgoing and as an introvert who drank to be social, this one is such a blessing. 

My advice to you all in your early days is to find or rediscover your passions and dive in! These real life, healthy distractions are what has saved my life. And remember, it's not just sobriety that's one day at a time, LIFE is one day at a time, one moment at a time- take advantage of it. Peace and Love. Thanks for reading.",126,0

The last few beers I'd had made me feel gross, and I'd read just one more article on the damaging effects of alcohol, so I did a very ""me"" thing and just went all-in and quit. It was a remarkable experience as I discovered new energy, a reduction in background anxiety and depression, and, delightfully, I lost weight. I spent all those months feeling more fit, more even-keeled, but also learning a lot about how deeply embedded drinking is in our culture, especially in a city like mine.

I found that last part particularly difficult. By January of this year, I was reconsidering my all-or-nothing approach. I didn't like feeling so alienated from a big part of social life, from the way people enjoy a meal or a gathering. I read more about moderation management, about the way other cultures have much less problematic patterns around alcohol use, and I decided I could reintroduce it into my life in a measured, moderate way. Just a few days a week.

I remember that first beer back was pretty ... gross. It took me more than an hour to drink it. Tasted like fire water.

My first few times drinking again I did feel pretty foggy. I didn't love the feeling; I remember thinking at the time I wasn't really missing anything. I'd never been a binge drinker, but more at two or three drinks every evening drinker. Maybe because of that I didn't get any obvious ill effects right away; sleep seemed okay, mood seemed okay, I still fit in my clothes. So maybe this was all fine.

And yet, ten months later I had slipped right back into the old pattern: two or three drinks every evening. And without really seeing it happen I'd put on nearly 15 pounds. This past Saturday while I was walking to a friend's place I noticed how gross I felt; not trim the way I'd been used to, not feeling particularly healthy. Three big beers that evening led to a very bleary Sunday -- this past Sunday -- and that's when I decided it's time to cut way back again.

Haven't had a drink since Saturday evening. I have to be honest: I'm not sure right now whether this is a full sobriety decision again, or if I really will make it a once-or-twice a week thing. I just don't know. I missed the aspect of being able to join in in the social custom of it. But I also \*really\* miss the way my body looked and felt when I wasn't drinking. And re-reading all the ways alcohol messes up your system, I have to say, I'm leaning toward avoiding it much more than not.

Anyway, back when I first quit this sub was a great resource for me, so I wanted to come back and say: hello everyone! I reset my badge count, just in case I keep going for a while here. I think I might. All I really know right now is I want to feel better, look better, take good care of myself. I don't want to be dogmatic, but I do want to be open-eyed. Glad this sub is here.

(Oh, and I'd almost forgotten about the brain fog and insomnia during these first days or week! Whew. I need to go easy on myself right now and remember this is my body getting used to a new healthier normal!)",11,0

Yesterday was my 30 day sober and I was feeling pretty proud of myself but still discouraged because I still look just as gross and bloated as I did when I was drinking. I quit drinking to be healthy and because I wanted to have better relationships and actually achieve my dreams of being fit and healthy and responsible. But it just seemed like it was doing nothing but make me bitchy and easily agitated. 

Then around 8pm I hear screaming outside. Horrible primal screams like someone was in terrible pain. I threw on clothes and shoes and fast as I could and ran towards the screaming thinking there must have been a horrible accident and someone was hurt. 

When I got to the person screaming it was a woman screaming and crying so desperately. I asked if she was okay and she just kept crying so I hugged her. After we ended up sitting down and I could smell the alcohol on her breathe and felt so triggered but I knew she needed someone to talk to. I let her tell me about everything that she was going through, how she had three DUIs and she was being kicked out from her moms house. How her cocaine and alcohol use made her lose her home and custody of her child. How she couldn‚Äôt stop herself And it made my heart ache so bad. 

I told her about my drug and alcohol struggles and it made me realize that my life has improved so much in these thirty days. My relationships are better, I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to run that fast and far to her before. I had more energy and self esteem. I wasn‚Äôt making a fool of myself anymore. I wasn‚Äôt perfect but I wasn‚Äôt suffering nearly as much. 

I welcomed her to come work out with me the next day or just get a cup of coffee. I told her when she‚Äôs ready I‚Äôd love to go to a meeting with her. I realized that I wanted to share sobriety with her so she could feel better too. I got her Instagram and watched her go inside before heading home. 

It really felt like god had brought me to her to understand how far I‚Äôve came and what could happen if I go back. And that sharing sobriety can help me heal myself and heal others.

I realized even if I were to try to moderate, alcohol will feed into my current depression and my lifelong anxiety (well, since I was around 12). I know I‚Äôm an alcoholic, but it‚Äôs starting to become easier to accept that alcohol is not meant for my body and my mental health.

For some reason, this acceptance has made me more comfortable with wanting to be open to all about how I can‚Äôt have alcohol. I was always worried about telling too many people because I didn‚Äôt want to be judged if I ever wanted to try to drink again. But, being able to say ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt have alcohol because it causes my panic attacks‚Äù or ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt have alcohol because it makes me feel absolutely dreadful‚Äù feels like some fucking valid enough reasons to me.

A bit of google research indicates it is likely nerve damage from years of heavy drinking. It's possibly reversible if I quit drinking now and load up on thiamine. It will certainly get worse if I keep drinking. 

This is self-diagnosed, as I have no health care.

So I've been fooling myself for years because there were no obvious signs of the alcohol hurting me physically. I can't pretend anymore. 

If I keep drinking, the tingling will increase into pain, and eventually into mobility issues. I will become disabled and unable to work and pay my bills ( I live alone and am totally self-supporting. Although I can ask my parents for a loan if things become dire, that is a short term fix only).

Funny thing is, I see a lot people on here that have it even worse. People dying from liver failure, heart failure. The booze will kill us all one way or another if we don't quit. 

So, I expect to be here a lot in the coming weeks and maybe years. You guys and gals are basically all I have. I have a few friends I can talk to, but they are not addicts and don't really understand. Can't even go to live AA meetings because of Covid. I've tried doing this alone many times, to no avail.

However, until fairly recently I wondered if I was really gaining much by quitting booze. Then I had a bit of a revelation. I've always thought that my drinking wasn't all that bad - yeah sure I had a few but I deserve it don't I?

However, what has become apparent over the last week or so is that I have always judged my drinking through the eyes of others. Others who who don't have the full picture and judge my relationship with alcohol from snippets of my behaviour. My workmates who only see me smashed at Christmas parties or the odd work trip ('Ah he's alright - he likes a beer but not too often'), my football mates ('He's a bit of a lightweight but doesn't go out too often'), The wife ('Yep he can't stop but it's only every few months'), and my mum ('He works hard so should be able to have a bottle or two').

Now within all these groups I'm the one that is talked about when reminiscing about the Christmas party or a past, messy, night - stories inevitably revolve around a personal misdemeanour that I did. But often it's laughed off with a smile, but each mention destroys me a little. When I was in a management position one of the new starters said they were looking forward to meeting the 'other you at the party'.¬†

In isolation these people no doubt think I'm a bit of a piss head but fairly harmless. It's when you start putting all the stories and actions together that an altogether darker picture is drawn. One that faithfully and honestly represents my real, toxic relationship with booze. And that's doesn't even include the behind closed-door drinking!

It's only in the last week that I've done this - sat up and accepted that I can no longer only recognise a tiny percentage of my behaviour. Just because other people aren't aware that something happened doesn't mean it didn't. Time to really take responsibility for everything I've done, not just little bits.

That's why, when I tell friends and colleagues that I have given up alcohol they generally say 'Don't be silly, you enjoy a drink but it's only every so often'. Because they only see a tiny percentage of the reality.

Also, unconnected but amusing - I started reading a 'Sobriety is great' type book yesterday. The author started by retelling terrible stories of drunken antics and it was like a bingo game - yep tick that, and that ..... called House pretty quick.

Had a few drinks Monday night and I'm not resetting my badge.,"I actually had a glass of wine and a beer, then two more glasses of wine back at the hotel when I was visiting home with my high school girlfriends on Monday night. I felt kind of tired the next day.  No compulsion to drink like there was last year in November when I was visiting with the same girls in my home town when I had 4 months. That turned into an immediate drinking a bottle of wine plus a day ordeal for 4 months until I quit again last March. 
 I now have 7 months.  Since I'm confessing I also had two tiny glasses of wine a month ago that I didn't count.  Both of these times I picked up there was zero compulsion to drink again.  They were both special occasions and left at that.  I enjoyed the moment and moved on.  This is how I consume sugar and cookies/candy/cake/pie etc..... I don't eat it except rare special occasions.  I used to be addicted to sugar.  Maybe this will be like that.  No plans to drink again. 

I was a FWB that liked the guy and wanted a relationship, so unfortunately, as he was coming around and getting more serious, I was hung up on the label.  My insecurity ruined it and I was dumped yesterday. I think that may have been part of my emotional growth getting stunted from all those years of drinking wine and not getting the proper emotional growth from life's disappointments. 
 I've been here for 4.5 years.  I'm not going to reset my badge.  If I have a rare glass of wine that is o.k. with me.  I feel great. The last time I picked up after the exact same scenario with the same girls, it was a compulsion. It really felt/feels different this time.  So, I'm keeping my day count.  I am sad I got dumped though purely for not living in the moment and appreciating the good I was getting and being hung up on a label.  Shame on me.  Insecurities are ugly.  I am glad to be rising above this, learning from it, and moving on.  IWNdWYT",1,0

I do something else so I'm not drinking until around 8p or 9pm, that way I won't have as much (or so I think then I want to play catch up.....smh). 

At this point, I've gotten past the mental state of 'wanting' it. That was a BIG step, I can go the whole day into the night and not want it. The \*only\* thing that pops in my mind is ""Psst, hey if you drink, you'll fall asleep!"" That's exactly it - I'm just trying to sleep.

A little while ago, my full sober day turned into a fatigued fest as I hardly slept - I'd lay there eyes closed, and yet not sleep and the time just keeps on going. 

It's frustrating! I've been for the last month trying to figure things out.....

1) Drink just enough - you might sleep all night (like I did last night) but you still feel out of sorts the next day. 

2) Drink half the amount or whatever - you sleep a little and then I'm awake. 

3) Drink too much - you pass out, and feel like crap, and get possibly sick. 

4) Don't drink anything - don't really sleep at all. 

I drink lots of water as well, let me throw that out there for whatever reason.

At this point, I'm leaning towards #4. I just want to sleep, and shut down the 'noise' in my head. I don't really have anxiety or anything like that. It's a strange balance of I need to work, and be awake enough to work. I can't really not sleep, because of that. 

I am wondering tips to sleep? I've read all sorts of things. No screen time before bed, drink herbal teas, read, etc.

But it was the best thing for me and my family. My wife was really supportive though it was rough without me home. (Kids, work, etc).

Where outpatient didn‚Äôt really take for me, inpatient shined. Being around others trying to get sober 24/7, learning from each other. Seeing the obvious signs of those who probably wouldn‚Äôt make it because their heart wasn‚Äôt in it and playing the tape forward.

But moderation is a Unicorn. A pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 

I believe moderation is a fantasy constructed in the minds of problem drinkers. It‚Äôs a term that we use to describe something we don‚Äôt understand but desperately want. 

When a problem drinker sees a ‚Äúnormal drinker‚Äù they describe what they see as ‚Äúmoderation‚Äù but it‚Äôs not. As problem drinkers we desire alcohol. To moderate would be to exercise willpower to limit how much we drink. This limit is less drinks than we truly desire (which is all of the drinks!).

That‚Äôs not what normal drinkers are doing. They don‚Äôt have that desire to drink. That preoccupation that requires planning and a pre-set limit.

No, they CHOOSE to consume alcohol (never to excess) should the occasion call for it and don‚Äôt think too much else about it.

The word ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù doesn‚Äôt exist in the vocabulary of these people because they don‚Äôt have to think about alcohol in that way.

It's not unlikely that I wouldn't survive a third run-in with this phenomenon, so I really hope that this time is the last.

Again, I've seen a lot of people obtain success through self-help here, and I succeeded multiple times (with 77 days being my personal record), but please don't forget that there are resources where you can ask for help if you need it - I ended up having to recognize that this wasn't a fight I personally was going to win without external assistance.

I was a heavy drinker. I never actually did the math daily but a 1.75L daily was no problem. I was drinking heavy for quite a few years. Well last year it caught up with me. I had tried quitting many times. I usually ended up with severe withdrawals because I would try to detox at home not knowing how bad it could be. The hallucinations were no joke mostly audio hallucinations but the last time they were audio and visual. 
So last year I I had to be carried Into the hospital as I couldn‚Äôt walk. I was admitted and the whirlwind started. When I got there I was informed that what was happening to me was fatal. I vaguely remember the first few days in the hospital; tubes, ports, pick lines, you name it I had it. Restraints and all. My wife called all my friends and family to come say goodbye. Some I remember some I don‚Äôt. My liver and kidneys were shot, My stomach was bleeding I was dying very quickly. We made the plans for hospice and where to scatter my ashes. I couldn‚Äôt comprehend all of this as it was happening. I spent 49 days between ICU and a regular room. I couldn‚Äôt walk I was moved by hydraulic lifts. They didn‚Äôt bother to bathe me I wasn‚Äôt going to be there long. I had feeding tubes and diapers. The nights were the worst, I was always alone. Sometimes nurses would stop by to talk bc I was the only one awake and usually crying. I couldn‚Äôt believe what I had done to myself. My kids were going to not have a dad. Not only my liver and kidneys failed but I was a failure as well. I had the best job, family, friends, you name it. Life was good, until it wasn‚Äôt.

Why is a question that I ask myself often. Why in an exasperated tone; why did he drive like? Frustrated: why do my kids ignore me? Amazed: why does the flower grow like that? It‚Äôs that last quality that often leads to spontaneous gratitude. Asking why about the choices I make, though, leads to learning.

1. Obviously psychotic episodes aren't fun and are potentially very dangerous so don't wait for one to show you the error of your ways, get yourself medical attention.

2. I'm a year and a few days sober, one year on the 18th of October, but i've been busy and not had time to process and reflect on that achievement until today.

3. I wanted to share my story firstly because i'm hugely grateful to this community, it's so helpful to read all the posts, especially in early sobriety...I suppose a year is still early in the grand scheme isn't it. Secondly, because I was wondering if anyone else had a 'moment' like this, i'd love to hear yours if you're comfortable sharing them. 

Okay so, sorry in advance for the impending wall of words, but if you have a spare 5 minutes then gold star for you if you make it to the end! 

I started drinking when I was 14, and I started drinking in a way that would be considered 'alcoholically' when I was 17. Over the years leading up to this I was drinking progressively more and more and earlier throughout the day, the age old tale. So during the summer of 2019, I was 22 and drinking around 4 bottles of cheap red wine and however much vodka I could manage after the wine, every day. The anxiety had gotten impossible to deal with at that point, I hadn't left the house while sober in 6 months. My physical health had declined to what I assumed was beyond repair, it certainly felt like it. I couldn't keep food in my stomach, even water was a challenge. My liver area was constantly aching, my skin had become red and blotchy, urine that looked like brake fluid etc. Again, the age old tale.

The mental side was the worst though, and in the weeks leading up to this night, I was becoming more and more confused and detached from reality. I was seeing things that weren't there, hearing whispers and sounds, and had formed an odd habit of rocking back and forth while crying and laughing simultaneously. Clich√© breakdown stuff.

On this particular night, I'd gone through my usual 4 bottles of red and had managed to make it to my dad's house. He and my stepmother were (and are) daily heavy drinkers too. That night the wine had done nothing to calm my nerves (alcohol seems to just stop working to that effect eventually), so I dived into the vodka and went into a full blown psychotic episode, of which I remember only fragments, (certainly due to the drink as well).

My dad and stepmother took me to the emergency unit at the hospital, and that was the scene of what has stayed with me to this day and what ultimately helped me to get and stay sober. While my memory of that time is incredibly fragmented, I remember this perfectly well.

We were sitting in the waiting room, it was around 4AM and we were sitting in a dark part of the room, under a low ceiling where the lights were dim. The room was huge. Across at the other side were floor to ceiling windows facing to the east, the sun was just beginning to rise. The only other people in the waiting room were sitting next to those windows, a man and a young boy of no more than 4 or 5. I remember looking down at my body, at my stepmother holding my hands (very drunk herself) and just noticing the darkness around me. I looked again to the man and the little boy and then to my dad and wondered how that man would feel if he thought his little boy would end up like me in 18 years, if he was sitting here with him in the dark part of the waiting room. Unable to stand, helplessly addicted to alcohol, mentally and physically broken. How would my dad have felt if he thought i'd end up like this when I was a child. 

The sun continued to rise and I was seeing dark shapes and hearing scratching all around me as it did so. I focused again on the man and that boy, just as his mother - a nurse presumably finishing her shift, picked the child up, gave the man a kiss hello and they proceeded to walk out of the main door into the sunrise, and there was me, still stuck in the dark. Now I don't want kids, it's not me, but I at least want the option, and in that moment i'd have given anything to be that man, to have the option to become that man. The darkness was getting darker and the sun brighter and the sounds and visions wouldn't stop. It felt completely unreal, terrifying and imposing. I realised that I was actually going to die if i didn't stop, I knew that for a while, but this made me realise what I could miss. It was either die and, die very very soon - either from the alcohol or by my own hand because I just couldn't live with the slow burn suicide anymore, or somehow find the strength to live a life without alcohol.

I didn't stop immediately, the doctor decided that I wasn't a danger to myself or others and basically told me to sleep it off and to come back when I was sober, I thought 'ha, fat chance', and went home for a bottle of wine to knock me out to sleep. Something did change that night though, every time I drank from then on I couldn't get that man and that boy out of my head, the darkness of that room and the beauty of that sunrise. It wouldn't go away and I thought about it constantly. It plagued me. It felt like some gorgeous fucking metephor created by chance for my brain to latch onto and somehow it did. I forced myself to drink smoothies and drink less wine, then to eat small snacks and drink even less wine, and so on. It took me a month and a half in total to taper myself off, partly due to many slip ups and partly because I was beyond terrified of withdrawal. It took all the willpower in the world but it was the only option, I was too anxious to go outside sober, so rehab or a hospital detox wasn't happening. The final night, i'd allowed myself 1 glass of wine to complete my taper, I drank that and tipped the rest of the bottle into the sink, and i thought of that man and that boy while I did so.

It's a frigging circus in my head right now, and on top of the internal conflict I've got ""Time Warp"" stuck in my head. 

I guess I just need some words of encouragement. I haven't been vocal to my roommates and family about the difficulty I'm experiencing trying to get sober because I'm ashamed of how much and for how long I drank. That's why I'm turning to you, SD.

300 nights ago it was New Year‚Äôs Eve. The end of 2019. I sat in a dimly lit, cramped bar, with my girlfriend and some friends. I was ordering expensive scotch, after expensive scotch. As I usually do when I‚Äôm celebrating. But tonight was different. This wasn‚Äôt a celebration. **This was a farewell.**

I had my first binge drinking experience at age 16. I then proceeded to indulge in binges weekly, on average, for the next 14 years (I turned 30 this year). Not only that, but the days between were always drinking nights. Not always more than one drink, but not always less than eight. I‚Äôm Australian, young, and male, and I bring this up, because in my demographic, the habit I have just described is common place and often goes unquestioned.

Please don‚Äôt think I say the following to brag, but what I want to do is make sure any ‚Äúsober curious‚Äù readers understand that you don‚Äôt have to be broke, homeless and unemployed to have a drinking problem. Despite my drinking habit, I did amazing in university and landed great jobs (I am a PhD-qualified scientist). I went from the scrawniest to fittest guy in my friend group, after developing an obsession with weight lifting and working out. I am well liked with multiple friend groups. I‚Äôve always had an enriched life outside of work with many hobbies and interests.

By some crazy good fortune, I was able to sustain all those things above AND my drinking habit. I was mostly having my cake and eating it too, when it came to being successful and being a balls-to-the-wall booze hound. This made stopping to question my drinking an unthinkable thing to do.

But I have an incredibly vivid and lifechanging memory from around the year 2015.

I was reading blogs on my phone as I caught the train home from work and I stumbled on to a life changing article by a former professional boxer named Ed Latimore. I cannot post the link here but I URGE you to google ""Ed Latimore How To Know If You Have A Drinking Problem"". I quote the following:

*""When it comes to warning signs, all that matters is whether your drinking pattern is keeping you from getting what you want out of life.*

*If you‚Äôre trying to improve any aspect of your life but your alcohol use inhibits you, then you have a drinking problem.""*

Something about this article planted a seed so deeply in my brain that I remember vividly where I was and what I was doing when I read that article. This was an absolutely LIFE CHANGING moment for me. Surely, I, this successful person, couldn‚Äôt have a drinking problem right?? Surely, I couldn‚Äôt be getting more from life if I cut back my drinking right?? That‚Äôs crazy talk! Everyone I know drinks like I do! All my friends do this! This is just how it is in Australia!

But between the years 2015 and 2020, that little seed of doubt that Ed Latimore planted in my head started to grow. And grow big. I was starting to ask myself some uncomfortable and new questions. Questions like: would my life would be better if I never had to wake up on the ground in a pile of my own fucking vomit ever again? If I never had to lock myself out my house because I was too drunk to find my keys in my own fucking pocket? If I never sustained a back injury due to a drunken misadventure? If I never accidentally took illicit drugs because of being too drunk to know that‚Äôs what I was doing? If I never humiliated myself in front of friends, colleagues and family? If I never showed up to my job functioning at 50% capacity due to the state of my hangover? If I never suffered insomnia and panic attacks due to the sheer toll a hangover took on my body? If I didn‚Äôt sabotage my gym/diet progress with missed workouts and shitty nutrition? If I didn‚Äôt squander this beautiful blessing of a life by wasting large portions of it trying to quench a thirst that just cannot be quenched by all the beer and scotch and tequila in the world???

When I spelt it out like that I started to think, gee, maybe this shouldn‚Äôt be my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù‚Ä¶.

This started several efforts I made to cut back, between 2015 and 2020. I started reading THIS very sub (thank you all for your stories over the years). I experimented with Dry Julys, Sober Octobers. I would often do these to fundraise for charities to help with motivation. I would have 1-3 months sober every year, but find myself right back in old habits after the experiment was over.

I tried experimenting with moderation too, with no success. It‚Äôs terrifying how quickly drinking a couple of beers one day a week turns into spirits every night and throwing up bile at 4 am on Saturday morning.

What I took from my experiences above was kind of frightening and eye opening. I noticed this dissonance between what I thought I wanted ‚Äì to be able to drink ONE beer and stop ‚Äì and what my subconscious seemed to want ‚Äì putting alcohol into my face until I have to close one eye in order to see the TV clearly enough to watch a movie I won‚Äôt remember the next day.

At 29, I could clearly see that my life ambitions had grown too large to fit in the same room as my drinking habit. I was now more serious than ever about getting rid of this affliction, and started consuming Quit Lit (sobriety literature). My saving ‚ÄúGrace‚Äù in this process, was the work of Annie Grace, and her life changing book ‚ÄúThis Naked Mind‚Äù (another one to Google!)

This was the final nail in the coffin of alcohol for me, because it gave me the tools I needed to give alcohol the boot. If you are curious about quitting but just don‚Äôt know HOW ‚Äì this is the book for you. I have read it twice because the book puts me into such a clear and powerful headspace. It promises to teach you to ‚Äúdrink as much as you want‚Äù, and by the end, how much you ""want‚Äù to drink will likely be zero.

So armed with everything I have learned from Annie Grace (and other Quit Lit authors) I decided that 2020 was going to be THE year. And it has been :)

I can‚Äôt say I won‚Äôt ever drink again, because I don‚Äôt know that. Yet where I am at now, I genuinely fear that a single sip would start a cascade of events that would ruin all chances I have of obtaining the things I want to achieve in my 30s and beyond.

Now, to break away from all the doom and gloom, let me list all the kick-ass things I have done this year that I believe were only possible through my sobriety!

**Sober Victories in 2020**

\-Undergone surgery for a past gym injury, and am currently making a great recovery and am back in the gym! (I would not be doing my rehab properly if I was pounding beers every night, lets be honest).

\-Made some of the best art of my life and getting even better at my craft (I‚Äôm a lifelong musician)

\-Taken small but serious strides to achieve my dream of turning my music into a side business. I'm operating at a loss (for now), but people are paying me to do what I love and that feels DAMN good.

\-Moved into a beautiful apartment (complete with rooftop pool!) with my girlfriend! No real stress about affording rent as I‚Äôm not blowing my income on booze,

\-Bought myself a massive TV and racing simulator set-up for my xbox (also thanks to the extra money!)

\-Ongoing, but making strides in my mental health

\-Worked my way down from daily nicotine to none!

\-stopped wasting time doing activities that weren‚Äôt fun ‚Äì they were just opportunities to drink

\-Feeling like I‚Äôm worthy of being the health and fitness role model that people assume I am

\-Looking in the mirror every morning and being prouder than ever of who I am, and not seeing someone actively self-sabotaging their own success.

**Lessons to pass on to others:**

\-It took me 5 YEARS to get to 10 months. Practice makes perfect!!! Tell me one thing you did PERFECT the first time you ever did it? That's what I thought...

\-Similarly, Dry July, Sober October were SO valuable to me. They helped me learn what it feels like being sober. Where the dangers and triggers are. How to navigate the urges and cravings. Do these, and do these often, until you are ready to do 2 months in succession. Then 3, and so on. Do them for charity for extra encouragement

\-Stay proactive and don‚Äôt neglect your sobriety. I am 10 months in and still consuming Quit Lit (sobriety books) at least 1 day a week.

\-If you have to drink to make an activity enjoyable, it‚Äôs clearly not fun, and you shouldn‚Äôt waste your life doing it!

\-An observation: Quitting drinking alone MAY not be sufficient to give you your ‚Äúdream life‚Äù but it‚Äôs a damn good step in the right direction. It will almost certainly get you out of the woods, but building one of those ‚Äúsuccess story‚Äù lives that we all dream about (myself included) will EVENTUALLY require you to take the time and energy you put into your drinking habit and apply it elsewhere.

**Concluding thought:**

I heard a saying once that goes something like ‚ÄúHell would be meeting the person you could have become‚Äù. I don‚Äôt believe in an afterlife, but the thought of seeing myself as an inferior and failed version of my own potential, is enough to strike a deep existential fear within me that I will fight against at all costs. I know for sure, that idealised version of me doesn‚Äôt drink. I am pleased to say that with this act of quitting drinking, I have taken the biggest of strides towards bridging the gap between the person I could become and the person I will become. From the bottom of my heart, I wish you all the best of luck in doing the same.

I thank you immensely for reading these \~1800 words and for letting me share my story. Reading this sub was immensely important when I first started to question my drinking, so I hope this can serve to give something back, whilst reinforcing my own commitment to this lifestyle change. I also say a massive congrats on the 300 days to any of my fellow sober peeps who had their last drink on NYE 2019. Stay strong, and I'll see you all at the 365 mark and beyond!",303,0

TLDR: I wound up writing more than I expected, basically I‚Äôve enjoyed sober October and am considering extending it to 45 days and maybe beyond?

Hello, all! 

Just want to start off saying that I‚Äôve followed this sub for a while now and I‚Äôm always inspired and impressed by the vulnerability and dedication I see expressed here. I thought I might share what my experience has been so far throughout this month.

Myself, some friends and some coworkers decided to participate in sober October together. I think at this point it‚Äôs down to just three of us that have completely stuck with it. I wanted to quit smoking cigarettes and I used not-drinking to quit that as well. I‚Äôm 28 days in!

Some benefits I‚Äôve noticed with the combined quit: my breathing is immensely better, I have lots of energy, cardio is up, increased mental clarity, I fall asleep much easier, I tend to wake up earlier, NO HANGOVERS, I don‚Äôt take my short-comings to heart as much, negativity still exists but it is not nearly as all-consuming, I exercise much more, and it‚Äôs easier to make healthier choices. That last one was really interesting to me, I didn‚Äôt realize that, while abstaining is not a cure all, it does make it easier to initiate a healthy spiral. Like if there‚Äôs Cheetos on my left and a salad to my right, not drinking/smoking shifts me closer to the salad at the start. I also notice a nuance to emotions, some of which aren‚Äôt fun to face without the numbness that alcohol can provide, but I do feel like I understand how I feel more holistically. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôm grateful for. 

So... October ends soon, and I‚Äôm not sure how to handle the reins after that. I don‚Äôt know if I would be ready to give up drinking completely at this stage in my life? I‚Äôm a 27 year old man, a lot of my friends drink, I still find those experiences enjoyable, just not all of them. Having a couple beers with coworker/friends after work has become less appealing, but occasionally drinking with good buddies still has appeal. Having wine on a date sounds nice, too. I think I‚Äôd like to extend it to 45 days of no drinking, just to see how more time off of the booze can effect my physical and mental health/reaching my goals. Has anyone taken hiatuses from drinking, not because they felt they had a full-fledged problem, but because they wanted to reach their goals/challenge themselves? If so, did you ever go back to drinking/did you quit for good? If you did go back, were you happy with that decision?

If you made it to the end, thanks for reading!

This is not my first journey on the wagon. After being taken to the hospital for a .41 BAC when I was 15 (when I was supposed to be at my little bros bday party) and driving my car into a tree and received a DUI with a BAC of .37 at 16 years old, I spent the rest of high school in an after-school outpatient program. When I was 20, I went to a party where I knew no one, and long story short was sexually assaulted by 3 men who then bashed my head in and threw me in a snow bank thinking I was dead. The next morning when someone found me, I was life flighted to a hospital more capable of treating me than our city hospital could. I woke from a coma 3 days later. Recovering from a traumatic brain injury was nothing compared to the trauma and terror I felt afterwards. After months of serious pain meds and muscle relaxers, I weaned off of them and couldn‚Äôt sleep for the life of me. Enter closet drinking before bed, which snowballed into more and more and more. Weeks before I turned 21, I seriously contemplated using permanent marker on my ID something like ‚ÄúDO NOT sell me alcohol‚Äù because I was so terrified that once I had 24/7 access to booze, I would find myself in a downward spiral that would have me by the neck in no time. I wasn‚Äôt wrong. 5 weeks after I turned 21, I left for rehab. My daughter was only 9 months old. I was successfully sober for about a year, and was off and on for many years after that.  

About a year into my marriage, my husband and I had just moved and busted my ass to get a job right away. But that meant I was traveling to 3 states, being gone for 4 days at a time and working 80 hour weeks, leaving him to raise my 5 year old. Before I share what I‚Äôm about to share, I don‚Äôt need your judgement with the shit that comes next‚Ä¶please keep that to yourself. It‚Äôs relevant that this is a smallish town with few jobs when the economy had not fully recovered, and there was literally no other place I could make the hourly wage that I was offered while offering the hours of 2 jobs, with which I was still barely able to pay the bills for our entire family. Anyways, I was being terribly sexually harassed by my boss (like legit sexually harassment: he‚Äôd try to kiss my neck, demand back massages and tell me he was hard, tell me how sexy I was, bought me unsolicited lingerie, and even refused to pay for two hotel rooms and make me sleep in the same room knowing I couldn‚Äôt afford to pay for my own and knowing I couldn‚Äôt afford to quit). Eventually I was straight up given the ultimatum to sleep with him‚Äîregularly‚Äîor lose my job. I couldn‚Äôt simply go to management because his manager and CEO of the company was sleeping with his subordinate, 20 years younger than him while he was married with 3 kids; he knew what my boss was doing and encouraged it so they could swap stories. I begged and begged and \*begged\* my husband to get a job, but he didn‚Äôt for 9 months playing xbox instead. So I would drink a half a bottle of whiskey nightly to cope with my unending guilt. I wanted to tell him what I was going through, wanting support and knowing he‚Äôd go get a job knowing that, but I was TERRIFIED he‚Äôd hunt my boss down and kill him, or at least severely injure him. So I crashed my company car into the median on the interstate so I‚Äôd get fired for either totaling a company car (company policy) or be too injured to go back to work. It worked and, to my exhausted relief, I got fired.  

I had already lined up another job for after my recovery, telling my new boss I wouldn‚Äôt be available until the new year (this was in November). Then my best friend died weeks later. My drinking got so bad that I started to split personalities mid-sentence and go from fine to fight of flight mode as traumas creeped up and I would think I was in danger for no reason at all. Once I pulled a knife on my husband when he was trying to help but I thought he was attacking me. I was becoming totally delusional. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that I am bi-polar with PTSD‚Ä¶not a good combo for excessive drinking.

I was sober again for a while. We decided to get try for a baby of our own. Things were stable and we were healthy and on a great path. When baby was a couple months old, I ended up having a tubal ectopic pregnancy, where I was sent immediately into emergency surgery. We lost the baby and some of my reproductive organs. I was devastated. Cue the alcohol crutch.  

When my drunkenness ruined my husband‚Äôs grandpas funeral, a friend took me home and after the reception, my husband found me passed out in prayer position on the side of the bed. There in my hand was a loaded handgun, racked with safety off (I have been raised with guns, we hunt, I carry for protection, so I would never have it locked and loaded no safety without intention to shoot). That was the breaking point for husband and he said he was going to leave if I didn‚Äôt get sober. I was glad he gave me an ultimatum because I didn‚Äôt want to live like this but I didn‚Äôt feel I had the power to quit on my own volition. After that I attended AA for a while and was sober for 2 and a half years. Those were great years. I eventually started drinking casually and have had periods of up and down where I was a responsible drinker and thought I had shit under control, but life or mental health get tough and I‚Äôd start losing control and quit for a while before I started the path to another rock bottom.  

Jump forward to a very happy marriage of 10 years and (somehow) an incredibly awesome, mature, straight A kid who‚Äôs a youth leader at church, and a stable career. Life is good.  We go camping with our best friends and one goes missing. I go looking for him. Find him with a gun. He doesn‚Äôt say anything. He just quickly puts it up to his head and shoots before I can do anything to stop it. In his panic to do it before I can lunge at him, he pulls the trigger too soon, the bullet entering at his jaw and exiting out his temporal lobe. I see the flash, the blood splatter, then he falls and all I can see is the huge whole in his head (it was a Glock-style .45, so no joke of an exit wound). Then we watch him die for 45 minutes (because it was a poor shot) while we wait for friends to get down to service and call for help. I‚Äôll never forget the gurgley moans as he cried out in pain but was (drowning?) in blood. It takes two hours for a helicopter and services to make it to us, as we lay there with his dead body. In my haste for help, I thought I broke my foot, but it turns out to be a ruptured tendon. We get home, devastated, traumatized, in crutches to find our dog dying. We go to the funeral and return to put him down. I do nothing but lay in bed, immobile, crying and drinking for 2 months. This is where shit goes down hill, fast.

Foot heals and I started working PT at a high end restaurant with a martini bar to supplement my income while I build my business. After shift, it was customary to have a cocktail or two with the other waitresses. What the didn‚Äôt know is I also had booze in my water bottle during shift, because I‚Äôd become dependent. My tolerance became so high that I became a ‚Äúfunctioning alcoholic‚Äù, drinking any time I could, but not letting my consumption get me to intoxication (which took effort) until night. But at that time, I had no problem staying sober all day around my family, any time I would be driving my daughter anywhere, anything family related.  

Open scene for COVID. Restaurant shuts down, but guess who‚Äôs never driving anywhere, home alone all day, and living the life where drinking wine is socially acceptable at 11am?! You guessed it, meee! (And honestly, all of us) Shit doesn‚Äôt get any better here, that‚Äôs all I have to say. Along with hubby, we‚Äôre going through a gallon of vodka every two days, or a liter every night. He‚Äôs now hopped on the functional alcoholic train and, except for when we fight, our kiddo is still in the dark (which is how we prefer to keep it). Now that he drinks all the time, I feel better about my problem. It‚Äôs totally okay because he does it too.  

Fast forward to the state opening a little bit‚ÄîYAYYY! I meet with a business colleague who‚Äôs days away from gastric bypass surgery and wants to go out with a bang. I‚Äôm not going to say much about this except I cause a terrible accident where both cars are totaled, I sustain over $30k in personal injuries and vehicle damage (vehicle‚Äôs totaled), not counting the victims side.  

I promise my family I‚Äôll get sober. But I‚Äôve been closet drinking ever since. I just came home from a retreat where I drank all weekend and we get in a fight which ends in my husband calling me out about my drinking and outing me to my mom and daughter. My mom has lent me her car until I can afford a new one after the crash and she takes it away because I‚Äôve admitted to drinking and driving. Absolutely justified, but devastating to my ability to continue my business I‚Äôve been building for over a year and get to the restaurant which is in another state.

This is where it ends. I am glad I got outed and my husband confronted me, while he‚Äôs been kind of passive about it trying to avoid conflict and taking my word at face value repeatedly that I‚Äôll stop. He bought me a book called ‚ÄúThe Easy Way to Stop Drinking‚Äù by Allen Carr. Super sweet of him and I‚Äôm so grateful for his support. This time, I‚Äôm \*committed\* to staying sober. He‚Äôs doing it with me, although he‚Äôs already 4 months in, the sentiment is the same. I found this sub looking for support. I‚Äôm gonna need it. Thanks for reading the beginning. If you read the rest, you‚Äôre a fucking rockstar. Thanks for caring.",13,1

After a life-changing eight months of sobriety, I allowed myself to dip a toe back in to try moderation last March. I'm sure you know where this is going. I woke up on December 26th of 2019 with a massive hangover and the realization that the moderation path doesn't work for me. 

But I've fought since then to get heart and mind in the same place. I looked back longingly at how amazing I felt those eight months but was unable to somehow get back into that headspace. The first time that led to that eight months was so easy because every aspect of my being was in alignment with the desire to not drink. THIS time, I've had to fight more and it's taken me several starts/stops to find that equilibrium. 

I had my last drink last Tuesday - one drink which I intended to be the last - and woke up Wednesday feeling like I've recaptured that equilibrium, that balance. Seven days on and I'm being constantly reminded of why this is the right path for me. 

Anyway, long and rambling but I'm back, I'm engaged in the discussion, and I will not drink with you today.",39,0

My purpose with this post is not to sell anyone anything; it is to encourage you to think about taking up a hobby by seeing some of the benefits it can provide you.

For me, it's a wonderful feeling and I know there is no drink or drug or food on earth

that makes me feel the way my crafting does. It really boosts my self-esteem. 

Plus, it is a WONDERFUL distraction!

Ok, so I did some very simple sewing as a little girl.

I made strapless dresses and matching hand bags for my Barbie and I remember making a blue and white polka dot summery poncho to go with my outdated hand me down red and white striped swimsuit that had a solid white pleated skirt and a zipper up the back.

I think I was a teenager then.

I began making jewelry early in 2000 something when a co-worker showed me some lovely jewelry she made for her niece's confirmation.

I was like WHAT??? Where did you get the beads and how did you learn??

On my time off I went to a local bead store and went to town!!

When I first started making jewelry, it made my spirit soar!

People I worked with wanted me to make them personalized jewelry!

They even paid me to do it!

That was such an honor for me because they paid money for my work, and they wore MY PIECES!!!

And when I give someone something I have made by hand? Oh, My Gosh, that really feels GREAT!

I think I started to pay attention to my writing about 10 years ago and have worked hard to better it because I see it as a craft also. Art is when you take separate pieces and shape them into something new. I do that every time I write something original. 

Like I said in my opening, it's a wonderful feeling and I know there is no drink or drug or food on earth that makes me feel the way my crafting does.

Making beaded jewelry using simple gemstones which astound me on their own, lifts my spirits.

PLUS, I control the colors and have made outfits based on different stones.

For example, I have a pair of  denim skinnies I love and wear a lot. They are off white, blue and black floral. I have some beads at home that go with those colors nicely and am making a necklace, bracelet, and earrings set to go with them.

That is one example of the fun crafting can add to your life! And when I wear my jewelry out, I always get complimented on them. 

Other pieces I have made over the years are Christmas ornaments and pendents using cookie cutters,  polymer clay, texture sheets, and acrylic paints.

I made a star using another cookie cutter, gold paint, a texture sheet to make the stars on the surface of my polymer clay star,and a beaded star loop for it to hang from. 

You can get the polymer clay and cookie cutters from Walmart, either in person in the store or you can order them online. I bought the texture sheets from on online jewelry website. And there are oodles of art stores and craft supplies online!

How I benefit from crafting is the pleasure it gives me when I see what I have made and am actually using it. I crochet kitchen hot pads in any colors I want! And I can make items for my bathroom, coasters, curtain pulls, armchair holder dealies for my remotes, and anything else I can think of. 

Clothing!! From baby items to shawls, sweaters, hats, afghans, costumes, and wedding dresses!!

There's knitting also, and lets not forget sewing and painting or digital artwork! Drawing! Calligraphy!

My point is there are kabillions of different hobbies and tons of how-to videos on YouTube!

So what would you like to make?

Or, if you already craft, how does it make you feel when you hold in your hand what you have made by hand and what about when people compliment you on your work?

Again, for me, it makes my spirits soar, puts a big smile on my face and makes my day!! And when I give someone something I have made by hand and they appreciate it? 

WOW!

I know I am repeating myself, but I cannot say this enough:

***It is a wonderful feeling and I know there is no drink or drug or***

***food or anything self-medicating on this earth that makes me feel the way my crafting does.***

So, what do you think? Will you give crafting a try?",19,0

This subreddit was one of the first things that helped me when I began my commitment to stop drinking. That journey began around this time back in 2015, and since then I have had two relapses, and am currently at over 2.5 years since my last drink.

I haven't been here in a while, and I wanted to contribute something that might help, so I'm sharing a post that I wrote to my friends on facebook earlier this year. Hopefully it resonates with someone!

----------------

Since accepting myself as a sober alcoholic back in 2015, I've met a lot of other recovering folk both in person and online, and I've heard lots and lots of stories about their journeys. Everyone has a different path that led to them choosing sobriety, but there's usually some common theme of ""started drinking like a regular person> started drinking more> starting drinking too much> couldn't STOP drinking too much> hit some sort of rock bottom> made a commitment to stop drinking."" 

At my very first AA meeting (I'm not in the program, it wasn't for me, but it was a good place to start), I listened to a lot of other peoples' stories, then I shared my own, and when I did, most of the people in the room were shocked. They were shocked that I wasn't there because a judge ordered me to. They were shocked that drinking had never landed me in jail or that I had never been arrested. They couldn't believe that I was at this meeting and hadn't lost my family over drinking, or ended up in the hospital from drinking or withdrawals, or had never woken up in a strange place in some sort of mortal danger. 

It made me feel... like I was wrong to be there. That I was overreacting. That I didn't really have a problem. Like my rock bottom wasn't rock bottom-y enough. 

(I swear, there's a point I'm trying to make here, stick with me!)

So what I've been thinking lately is that there are probably people like me who have a problem, who KNOW they have a problem, but feel silly jumping to the conclusion of *gasp* ALCOHOLISM! because they're using someone else's situation as a yardstick. 

My point (here it is!) is that when it comes to your own struggles with drinking, it's not only fruitless to compare your situation to someone else's, it's dangerous. The goal here, in my opinion, is to pull out of the nosedive BEFORE something horrible or tragic happens, specifically something that might be irreversible. Alcoholism is tricky because there's really no solid criteria for who is and isn't an alcoholic. All that really matters is that you know, somewhere within yourself, that what you're doing to yourself is problematic and harmful, and that you want to fix it. THAT'S IT. That's the criteria. 

Don't let anyone tell you you're overreacting if you reach out for help because you feel yourself falling into a hole that you're scared you'll never be able to climb out of. Don't look at someone else and think ""Now THAT guy is a fuckin' mess, I'm not that bad yet, I'm still okay."" It's a perilous and pointless game, and nobody wins when they play it.

So yeah, man... just take care of yourselves! When you know, you know. Don't let the specifics of someone else's journey act as a roadblock for your own.

Love and kisses,
Sober Daniel",81,0

I‚Äôve been thinking about doing this for the past 6 months that I‚Äôve been working from home and tried a couple times but it never stuck. I come from a long line of high-functioning alcoholics with strong livers but I‚Äôve gone from a glass or two of wine a night to 4. It interferes with my psychiatric meds and I wake up feeling so groggy. I‚Äôm not a morning person anyways, so I‚Äôm just handicapping myself if it takes me an hour to wake up my brain enough to do anything. 

Right now, I just don‚Äôt think I can do moderation. I thought all the pros and cons of continuing to partake at all, and the main pro is it really does help in my career to be able to hang with the boys on occasion. But it‚Äôs always a risk for me. If I take it too far, I just look sloppy, so I guess there are probably as many times that it‚Äôs hurt vs helped. And no one is going out now anyways... Maybe the old boys club will have changed when we all get back! 

Date nights with my husband is another ‚Äúpro.‚Äù He thinks I drink too much, but he never really straight-out says it, and he also likes it when I‚Äôm tipsy on date night. Again, this doesn‚Äôt seem like that big of a pro to me. But he is actually the main reason I am posting here. I‚Äôve told him multiple times in the past months I was going to quit and not to buy more wine (he‚Äôs primarily a scotch-drinker, so that‚Äôs for me), but then I end up doing it myself and and then he thinks I‚Äôve given up so he starts doing it again, too. So he can‚Äôt be the one who is going to support me and remind me that this is something I really want to do and that it takes time to form a new habit.

A little bit of background:

I'm 23, I've had a drinking problem since I was seventeen but the addiction monster has lived in me my whole life. I quit in early August. Shortly after quitting drinking, I moved back to my small hometown to live with my parents and try to figure out how to take care of myself. So far, it's been alright. My days are pretty soft and heavy with routine but I feel more rested than I have in a very long time. I'm starting to enjoy the smaller things about my day and that makes me feel hopeful.

So two of my best buds are getting married to each other this weekend and I am going. I've never been a lover of big social events and when I drank I would hold that glass for dear life. The last wedding I went to I drank more throughout the whole day (I was in the bridal party so it was a long day) than I think I ever have before. I really want to be better at simply feeling uncomfortable in social situations and letting go of the expectation that I need to be the life of the party or some fabulous person who talks to everyone. Instead of allowing me to feel quiet and awkward. Why is humility so difficult?

 Anyways, I'm worried that I might encounter that addiction ravished part of my brain this weekend and I'm scared that under the social stress I might listen or react to it. So, please if you have any suggestions or words of advice I am all ears. I could really use some support this weekend.

&#x200B;

I do have my friends who are not invited to the wedding but are the first people I told about my drinking problem picking me up from the wedding. I'm staying with them too so maybe I'll express these sentiments with them. 

Love y'all!!!",3,0

Man it‚Äôs been about four years now of drinking pretty much nightly. I might‚Äôve missed a day every few weeks but it‚Äôs been consistent. 

I know my limits, I usually stop before the point of a hangover, usually. I have a job, wife, a kid, one on the way. And the biggest blow was my five year old asking ‚ÄúWhy do you always have to drink that?‚Äù 

I‚Äôm currently sick (strep, woohoo) and was laying in bed last night trying to figure out if the medication and alcohol would be harmful, or if I could have my nightly drinks tomorrow (tonight). I think at that moment I decided it‚Äôs been excessive and I want to stop. I don‚Äôt want there to be a night where I‚Äôm too hungover or drunk in the middle of the night to help my wife with the newborn when he comes. I want to be there and present and I want to be around for my family for a long time. 

I‚Äôm not even sure why I drink daily anymore. I started when I had a job I hated, traveling all the time and it was a way to tolerate the nights. Started getting heavy when I was in an abusive relationship a couple years back and just never put it down I suppose. But that ends today. I just poured the rest of my stock down the drain and with this post, I start that sober journey. Godspeed to all of you who are ahead of me and those that will follow.",35,0

So, in an attempt to get a grip on my relationship to alcohol, I joined a program, did 4 months sober and transitioned over to moderation management around August 8. The program expectations there are no more than two standard drinks an occasion, no more than four occasions a week and no more than eight drinks a week total.  


And while supported with hopes of success by my team, I was warned that lots of folks moderate until they can't.   


So, I did that until mid September where I decided to go back to abstinence. I was ticking up on my drinking, seeing a return of some of my particularly problematic behaviors (obfuscating how much I was drinking, rationalizing it, all of it), and had one bad night where I got all in my alcohol-induced feels and acted like a turd. So, that scared me and I pulled back.  


I did another 30 days completely sober.  


I decided I wanted to try moderation management one last time for a couple reasons. This is a year long program, and I've got another five months in it and if I was going to see if this were possible for me, now would be the time to do it with all the supports I've got right now.   


And  I didn't feel like I gave the first attempt a fair shake. I just kind of dove right back in to ""normal for me"" behaviors, and didn't stay on the literature, the groups, the meetings, etc and just kind of gave cursory check-ins with my team about it. I had it in my head that this wasn't an experiment to see what was possible or positive for me so much as a major exam I could fail. (over-achievement and debilitating fears of failure are themes for this Formerly Gifted Child(TM))  


And so, this last bite at the apple, so to speak, includes me doing the meetings, and reading the literature and being completely transparent for better or worse on how things are going because it isn't about getting an A+ this time, so much as knowing definitively whether I am a human capable of moderate drinking...   


and I'm struggling. I can keep my occasions to the right number (fewer than four), but how many drinks in an occasion and whether or not they're ""standard"" (think not regular beer but those higher octane 9%ers) not so much.  


All that long windedness to ask; is anyone else here working on moderation management? how's it going? any tips or resources you'd recommend? Anyone here try it and decide it sucks harder than abstinence (a conclusion I think I'm close to coming to)?   


Thanks folks. <3",8,0

There is a podcast I love called ""Inappropriate Questions"" by CBC Radio. They go over questions you really should not ask.. the latest episode I listened to (I am behind on them) was the question ""why don't you drink""

I know for me, when I have gotten sober, it's a dreaded question. The podcast talks to people who don't like alcohol, to people that have had health issues and to someone who is a recovered alcoholic. They ask this man about resources, for getting help.. he mentions AA, SMART and THIS SUB, he said he visits it every day - he has been sober 5 years at the time of the podcast recording.

If you are the person on that podcast big HI to you, you made my morning.

To everyone else, if you have time, you should give this episode - and the show in general a listen. 

I am so so thankful for this sub and it was super cool to hear it mentioned on one of my favourite podcasts!

Last night was different, though. I remember refusing dream drinks and telling the dream characters that I was sober. I'm not sure what it means when your dream-self finally decides to catch up with your waking self, but it feels like a good thing.

During this period of time I consumed about 3-6 liters of white wine each 24 hours in combination with a handful of 5-8% 50cl IPA's. I still managed to function fairly well for most of this time, but this was obviously only because my tolerance levels had been building up before and were now building up even faster.

At a certain point into this process, I started seeing what can best be described as vivid cartoon movies and color flashes every time I closed my eyes, and I was beginning to hear noises that were obviously not produced by anything nearby. I've been through a similar experience once before, but with benzodiazepines, so I knew what was heading my way.

My tolerance levels being what they were, as mentioned, my thought processes were surprisingly still fairly clear at this point, so I asked my spouse to assist me with getting an ambulance over, and their evaluation was that I would have been a fairly complicated case to treat if I had arrived at the ER much more than forty-five minutes to an hour later, but that they now were able to treat me in a more 'business as usual'-fashion with less active monitoring of my vitals.

For those who haven't had the pleasure to go through this process, this means an IV-drip with liquids (and likely minerals) and vitamins (B-vitamins, I believe) in your arm, lots of blood samples taken, a HR monitor on your finger and benzodiazepines to break the trajectory of the still ongoing DT process.

It all worked out, and the next morning/afternoon/evening (my sense of time was a bit fuzzy for a few days) after I had managed to get some real liquid and easily digested food down I was visited by a very nice man from a local community help center for addicts, and he gave me their business card.

I reached out, and now I've been on Antabuse for 16 days (my badge is probably still updating) and have had the benzodiazepines that broke the DT process slowly tapered out as well. I'm still being closely monitored in my process and I'm free to reach out to them at any point if I feel discomfort. My liver values really aren't great, but it's not beyond repair (yet - but continuing on the same trajectory I would of course have destroyed it).

At the same time I'm also reaching out for assistance with dealing with my general feelings of stress and anxiety during this obviously crazy time (which perhaps at some point will let me quit Antabuse as well, at this point what's going to happen further ahead isn't even on the planning board yet) since those were what drew me towards this in the first place.

One last thing. If it wasn't for this video, I'm not so sure that I would have had the courage to eventually actively take the plunge and ask for real help this time, so I hope that it can help someone else take that step (or to recommend a loved one to take it): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRGRduyCy\_M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRGRduyCy_M)

Self-help can be great, and I've seen it work for so many in here, but sometimes we need to face the fact that asking for help is not a sign of weakness. It can be the strongest, most difficult and perhaps most important decision we've ever made.

I've gotten really good at hiding it from those I love because we have had this conversation earlier this year and I'm scared and ashamed that we will need to have it again, but it's no one's fault but my own.

I've been working and failing at getting sober for the last 2 months but for whatever reason here I am again wide awake at 4am scrolling through this community because I couldn't use some self restraint yesterday. Kicking this habit is the hardest thing I have ever tried to do and although I continue to fall, I'm going to keep trying.

Some background on me quickly is that I‚Äôm a 26 year old female who has had anorexia/purging anorexia/bulimia for about ten years now. I‚Äôve never been able to get a handle on it.

And this year I have been drinking much more than usual. Fireball is my drink of choice and I‚Äôll buy a couple sleeves of nips at a time. Ill have anywhere from 5-8 nips in the evening before bed. Every night.

That may not seem like a lot to some but I am in general fragile health wise so I‚Äôve had many health issues, and certain things affect me different I guess.

This is such a huge scary wake up call for me. As of today I‚Äôm going to need to stop drinking.

I have an ungodly amount of anxiety and panic attacks. My heart just won‚Äôt stop racing. It feels like I‚Äôm going to have a stroke at times. This is scaring the absolute shit out of me. I haven‚Äôt told my girlfriend(my drinking partner) that I‚Äôm going to try to quit again. A few months ago in an effort to stop fighting so much due to alcohol. We made it a week and it was fantastic. I felt so good at the end of the week. Recently my girlfriends mom passed away suddenly, today she just had to put her childhood cat down.. I can‚Äôt even begin to describe or let alone understand her pain. She has been moderating with alcohol very well lately. Keeping it to just a couple drinks. I don‚Äôt really know what to do at this point. All I want is to be there for her in anyway I can. But how the fuck can I do that if I‚Äôm an anxious ball of asshole? What‚Äôs really helping me make this decision is my health. I recently notice my left eye has a floater in it and that my vision is starting to go bad in my left eye. My panic attacks are much more frequent lately and have been controlling my life. The alcohol was the only thing that made it just melt away. 

I‚Äôve had PLENTY of attempts at quitting. I‚Äôve been in AA, NA, CA and spent a year in a cognitive therapy community (court ordered rehab) it actually was kind of incredible and the amount of information about addiction I have is quite huge. Hell, when I got out of rehab, I literally wanted to go to school to start becoming LCDC. I wanted to help people just like I was helped. I miss being sober ME so fucking bad. 

Today my arm got super tight, my chest was pounding, I was feeling like I was going to pass out. I freaked.. I was POSITIVE that I was about to die naked in my shower. The idea of my mom having to come down and find me in the shower... It was the single most terrifying thing I‚Äôve been through, and I‚Äôm not flexing but I have been through a quite of bit. I NEVER want to feel this way again. 

If anyone has suggestions on what action I should take with my girlfriend still drinking and me quitting. I know she will 1000% back me up, and she has had a lot of experience in the sobriety field very much similar to mine. If we got sober together we‚Äôd be a fucking force of nature. And I want that so badly. However I completely understand that she‚Äôs purposely drinking less since her moms passing because she knows where it would lead. I support her for the amount that she drinks but I also know enough that it‚Äôs very risky or hard for one person to get clean while their partner doesn‚Äôt. 

TL;DR: Thought I was going to die in shower. Fuck this shit I‚Äôm done.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

**This pledge is a statement of intent**. Today we don't set out **trying** not to drink, we make a conscious decision **not to drink**. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't**: A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hello! If you're checking in for the first time or missed yesterdays check-in, my name is Nikki and I'll be hosting the DCI until October 31st. Thanks to those who were open and honest about practicing grace. If you've found yourself slacking, I hope the topic brought up some ideas for you to start practicing. If you're practicing grace regularly, I hope the PCI helps you maintain! Today, I want to talk about gifts of sobriety.

My mental health has been on the rocks since I was 6 y/o and it has been an extremely tumultuous ride. I was in and out of therapy throughout my whole life, in and out institutions when I was a teen, and went through so many medications to find what was right for me. The longer I was on this journey, the more rebellious I became, until I was 19 y/o and realized that at minimum, I had to be on medications. It felt like one of my lows realizing I was going to be dependent on it for the rest of my life.

I used to think it was hard to examine yourself and layout what needs to be changed within you to have a better quality of life, but I was insightful. I knew what needed to happen. The issue was applying the tools **without expectations of others** is what is difficult. I used to always think ""Why do I have to do all the work? Why do I have to take take the high road? It's unfair."" 

Another aspect that challenged my mental health were interferences and while I did have a lot of outside interferences (mainly ADHD that I didn't realize was as serious as it is), I was the #1 blocker for having better mental health. You're telling me I can either 1) take medication that has no upfront cost and let it build up to allow me to function better or 2) spend about $50 a week on alcohol or weed, another $50 on food, end up sleeping most of the next day, and still feel like shit? Well hot dog, sign me up for option #2 ***(wait...what?).*** At first, my reasoning was I didn't want to mix my medications and alcohol. But then, I was drinking (and eventually getting high) weekly...then daily. I was dependent. It was easier and faster to drown out my sorrows and worries with rum, chardonnay, or weed than to let my medications do what they were supposed to. Even as my panic attacks increased due to being inebriated, I didn't stop. I couldn't live with the pit of despair and sorrow that was in my chest.

The most precious gift I got from sobriety was a balanced mental health. I truly never, ever, **EVER** thought I could feel this way. After realizing and believing that I can only control my actions and feelings, forgiving key people who have caused me harm, and not giving a fuck what people thought of me, AND regularly taking my medications, I have achieved a clarity that I never had before. It's the first time in ever that I'm in therapy and feel like I'll be ok once my goals are reached (but ok and understand if I need to go back for maintenance). My mental health is my Mona Lisa. My Picasso piece. I treasure it and have it on a pedestal because it'll be the first thing I lose if I put sobriety 2nd to anything in life.

I'm curious: **As you've started your journey, what are some gifts you've gained thanks to sobriety that you never thought you'd have?**

I need a vacation bad, and tomorrow I'm going to open up to my boss and see what she can do for me. I have no more pto and they don't gives sick days or unpaid leave, but maybe I can convince them. 

I honestly should look into therapy or getting help. I can feel I'm on the final stretch of burying this problem. I can see I'm going longer and longer before I screw up, it's just the screw ups are affecting me more and more as well. 

I wish I had listened to this sub a year and a half ago. Things were so much better, so much more stable then. 

I don't know the point of me posting this. I don't think there's anything anyone can say to help me. It feels so lonely honestly these days though and even words ona screen help.

I'm checking in after being absent for the last couple of weeks. I just wrote half a post explaining what's been going on and then erased it, because I realized that it was just completely coming out of my head, and while it may have *sounded* good, I don't think that it was actually really true. I mean, I wasn't lying, I've just been living in my head a lot recently, and I don't think that the narrative my head is coming up with is really capturing anything important. Suffice to say, I got depressed and a bit stuck. It is a thing that happens. 

It's been a bit of a rough year, things have been catching up with me. Last week I seriously thought about drinking for the first time in a couple of years, which freaked me out. And forced me to admit that I wasn't doing so well. Which, I guess, is sort of the equivalent to hitting bottom with an addiction. I hit bottom, I talked to my psychiatrist and a couple of people in my life about how I'm struggling, I'm focusing on taking care of myself and changing some things. It's fine. It is what it is. It's not great, but it's fine. I'm not on fire. In this exact moment, everything is okay.

The one thing that I *have* been doing reasonably well recently is staying on top of my real life recovery program, which I am so grateful for, because it saved me from doing something dumb. 

I'm an alcoholic. One bad decision to pick up a drink is not going to end with one night of drinking. It just isn't. That's a very dark path for me, and it doesn't end well. I know that just because I was able to get sober before, doesn't mean that I would necessarily be able to get sober again. (I recognize that not everyone here on SD is quitting drinking for the same reasons, and that not everyone has a hard time stopping drinking and staying stopped. But I do.)

I knew for years that I had a problem with alcohol. I wanted to quit, or at least control my drinking, or at least drink less, but I wasn't able to. In the long run it just kept getting worse. I thought it was a problem that I had to fix on my own because I had created it. I genuinely didn't understand that I kept drinking because I have an addiction. I thought that I had *way more* control over it than I actually have. I thought that I was making the decision to drink, when in reality I was coming up with reasons to justify why I was drinking. I didn't really know why I was drinking myself, beyond how terrible it felt to be sober and how good I knew that drinking would make me feel.

Which is why I no longer entirely trust my brain. I can sell myself some bullshit stories. What helps me to break out of that today is I have other sober alcoholics in my life who do their own versions of the exact same thing, and we can talk about it when our heads get into a weird place. It's refreshing. I don't have to hide behind a wall of pretense and ego because they get it, and they love me. It's safe to talk with them.

Anyway, as far as thinking about drinking goes, my sponsor reminded me that we are alcoholics, and we are going to think about drinking from time to time. To a certain extent it's normal, and not something to blow out of proportion. It's alcohol-*ism*, not alcohol-*wasm*. I really haven't struggled with any serious thoughts about drinking so far in this go-round of sobriety, and it freaked me out to have some moments of seriously considering it. It fucking sucks to experience that, it is *not* a good feeling. It's been a long time since I had that urge to drink to escape, and it's deeply unnerving to experience it again. But it is a stark reminder that I still am an alcoholic, and I still need recovery.

I've gotten sober before and relapsed. When I'm in a place where relapse seems like a good idea, burning my life down seems like a fine idea. It's not like I don't play the tape forward. When I pick up that first drink I know *exactly* where I'm headed, but I just don't give a fuck. My thinking gets pretty nihilistic, and it also seems inevitable. Of *course* I'm going to drink. It's not like I can have a life *sober*.

When I had my ""oh *fuck this*, I'm going to *drink*"" moment  last week, I played the tape forward. And I was fine with it. My tape goes very quickly into a pretty bleak and dark future where I relapse, lose everything, and then die. And that seemed fine. Because fuck it. Life sucks anyway. I can't deal with this shit anyway, I suck at life, *etc.* 

So I need a little something else to help keep me sober as a saftey net, because I can't entirely trust my brain 100% of the time. (It is what it is, being honest about that with myself and accepting it is a part of what I need to do to stay sober.) 

What kept me from acting on any of those thoughts or nursing them further was my connections to other people in recovery. I've been active here on SD before and then relapsed and disappeared. I don't want to do that anymore. I'm active in AA. I have a sponsor. I talk to her regularly. I know that she cares about me. I have friends who are sober. It would hurt them if I dissappeared, and it'd also be distressing for them if they witnessed my relapse. They care about me. 

I also have service commitments at a couple of AA meetings. I'm the one with the keys, so if I don't show up, they don't happen. I couldn't handle having that on my conscience. Imploding my life and drinking myself to death seemed sorta fine (in the moment), but I couldn't not show up for those meetings, because what if someone who wanted to get sober and needed a meeting showed up, and there was no meeting? I couldn't live with that on my conscience. (And actually, the next day after my funk I did show up for a regular meeting and the two other people who showed up were a guy who's trying to get sober and a sober friend of mine, who is now his sponsor. If I'd relapsed and bailed on my commitment that wouldn't have happened. Service is a safety net, it keeps me sober.)

I'm actually sponsoring someone myself now. Which is weird, I definitely don't feel like my sobriety or my life is in a super-awesome place, and I feel awkward about that, but, I mean, it's not about me. I'm hesitant to say too much about it just for the sake of respecting my sponsee's privacy, but I will say that it's been a real joy, and I'm getting a lot out of working with her. She's helping me as more or more than I'm helping her. It's been such a joy getting to know her, and watching her grow in her sobriety and come alive again as a person. 

We're reading through the AA big book together, which I sorta hated doing when I had sponsors read it with me, but I'm having an incredible experience reading through it and talking about it with her. I'm seeing it with totally new eyes, it's amazing. 

Anyway, that's me. I know this is hella long, but, uh, that's me. 

**tl;dr:  Hugs not drugs. If you wanna be cool, stay in school. When in doubt, read the directions.**

Much love to all you sobernauts. Keep being awesome. And yes, Acts of Kindness Monday will return next week, I just... spaced on it for a bit. Sigh. I'm feeling perfectionist guit about that, but it is what it is. Life is lived moving forward.

**The Good:** I have been taking an online paper cutting class and, as a project, cut [a sparrow on a twig](https://i.imgur.com/Tt4s09L.jpg)‚Äîwhich I then made into a card for my cousin. I swear that doing art projects gives me almost the same rush of dopamine that drinking wine did back in the day.

**The Bad:** It‚Äôs late October‚Äîbut it‚Äôs STILL too hot in Florida!

**The Ugly:** Years ago, I was on my motorcycle (stone sober) and got mowed down and badly injured by a man behind the wheel of his Cadillac who was in the middle of an alcoholic blackout. (Ironic, right?) Recently, my knee joint has been causing me pain, and I‚Äôm back to wearing a knee brace again.

Two days into my ‚Äúvacation‚Äù we got hit with a massive ice storm. YUUUGE storm. Knocked all the internet out first and then the power. So naturally, like many of you-I wouldn‚Äôt have been upset because well, I could get smashed. 

Not these days. No sauce for me. 

So now, since the house was too cold for the family, we are staying at my fianc√©‚Äôs parents house - (her dad and I used to drink a lot together and he expected that‚Äôs what we‚Äôd do) guy had bloody Mary‚Äôs made when I walked inside at noon. I politely declined, and he offered me cocktails two more times and then a beer at dinner. 

Y‚Äôall. 

I said no - to every opportunity. And man let me tell you, that‚Äôs tough. I‚Äôm bummed out because I wanted to play games and be at my house, and currently I‚Äôm laying in a 5th graders bed (my niece is letting us borrow it don‚Äôt be weird-shout-out to my personal FBI agent) and I‚Äôm just reading Reddit and chillin‚Äô.

And she always asks me to dance with her. I have this vivid memory from about 5 months ago where I was hungover and laying on the couch while she watched Zootopia. A song came on and she got up and started dancing, she looks at me and says ""mommy, come dance!"" and I told her I didnt feel good. And then she looks at me again and says ""come onnnnn, dance!"" and I didn't because my head was pounding and I was so nauseous. Thinking back to this makes me so sad. My drinking prohibited me from dancing with my daughter. I know it may sound silly, but my mother was an alcoholic (thankfully she has been in recovery for 5 years now). I vowed to myself that I would never make my daughter feel dissapointed, sad or angry due to my drinking. And in her little 2 year old mind, not having her mother dance with her was very heartbreaking.


I am happy to say that tonight while I was cooking dinner, she ran in the kitchen and said ""come on mom, lets go dance"" and I happily stopped what I was doing and danced with my daughter. She had the biggest smile on her little face and a wave of emotion hit me. Emotions of happiness but also shame for my past mistakes.

It was 31 days ago when I couldn't get out of bed because my head was pounding and I was feeling extreme anxiety. I couldn't eat and I couldn't drink water. I had a small get together I needed to attend that afternoon, so I forced down half a sandwich and then started drinking in hopes that I would feel better. The first part of the afternoon was rough, but once I drank a few and got high, that ill and anxious feeling began to melt away. Once again, I found myself drinking late into the night. It was 30 days ago when I woke up feeling the lowest I think I ever have. I was hungover, extremely anxious, and depressed. I felt completely worn down and I couldn't stop bursting into tears with every thought of myself and my life. I wondered how I ever got to this point. How I could be so irresponsible and reckless? There have been so many times I have convinced myself that I didn't have a problem. That other people are much worse off than me. It hasn't been since my early 20's that drinking has affected my life (I lost everything back then and nearly my job). I thought...now I am able to manage my professional life, home life, and party life. Boy, was I so wrong. I started to piece together the ways my drinking has changed every aspect of my life. My job, my marriage, motherhood, friends/family, and my overall well-being. I frequently experienced terrible mood swings and took it out on everyone else, including my children. My self-confidence was basically non-existent and I relied on people around me to make me feel better about myself. I never took the time to find things I love, or just learn about who I am as a person. I never chose healthy habits to build my own self-esteem and confidence. I've never really been happy in my own skin and I hated everything about who I was. 30 days ago, I decided to quit drinking for a month. Let me tell you, the first week was probably the worst week of my life. I cried, and I cried...and I cried. I barely dragged myself into work. I felt like I'd been hit by a truck and my body was shutting down. I was feeling ALL the feelings that I hadn't since my marriage had started falling apart. It was terrifying. I knew it wasn't an option to fall back on my crutch(es) so I just had to keep going. A day at a time. Then, everything started to get better. I learned to crochet and I hope to have a large blanket completed in a few months. I've been reading. I've been walking and practicing yoga/meditation. I am taking a self-defense/martial arts course. I spend much of my time reading posts on this sub and I listen to The Bubble Hour weekly. I write in a gratitude journal (almost) daily...still working on that. lol. I quit smoking cigarettes (28 days!). I go to therapy. I am a WAY better mom - so much more patient and kind. The more I type I am starting to get very emotional...because now I am seeing what has changed in only 30 days! I'm proud of myself for the first time, ever. There is still a lot of work to do and a lot of pain ahead of me, but I am going to keep going. I see so much more beauty within myself, my life, and all around me. Although I have felt quite lonely, I am starting to see that I won't feel this way forever. I'll find healthy, meaningful connections with new people in time. I need to focus on myself and keep building and improving. I know there is so much more good to come from this journey!",24,0

I'm finally here. It's been on my to-do list to post here for, what, 2 years? 3? And my therapist gets back from vacation today and I promised her I'd do this so‚Ä¶ :-)

Ugh. I really didn't and don't want my drinking to be a problem. But it is. I wanted to be able to manage it, drink just socially, enjoy all the nice things about the buzz of the champey and all those bubbles going up my nose. I \*still\* want the happiness it brings, the way it opens up my silliness and somehow connects me to my verve.

These days, the depression, the ongoing horror and sadness at what is happening in my country these days, the extreme loneliness, the craving of human touch and just hanging with my friends again...so much loss of so much... It's all made alcohol even more appealing because it gives me a desperately needed respite, a little shot of happy when happiness is a rare thing.

But. It's a problem. A big one. Can't deny it. I'm drinking more and more. It's feeling like an actual crutch these days. The staying up late and the hangovers are eating up a lot of my life. I This depresses me more, of course. I don't progress on the things that are important to me. I'm not developing skills I need to manage life as it currently is--true skills of self-comfort, managing anxiety and depression, finding hope, building a strong core of Me that I can truly count on.

So, here I am. I've tried to reduce/stop on my own. But no matter how resolved I am, I drink again. I want that relief so, so, so bad. But I want to know and grow my inner strength, resources, and self-love more.

I've been a lurker. I know you all can relate to at least some of what I'm saying. I want to start coming here, a lot. I want to check in and get support and give support and know there are others out there who are struggling like me who care about my struggle too.

I'm probably gonna check out other stuff like AA. Open to any more suggestions. I know I can't do this alone. I need you guys. Thanks for being here. (there, I made myself cry).",15,0

I took my first dose (50 mg) last night and waited 90 minutes before drinking. During that 90 minutes, my body felt very strange, sort of spacey and‚Ä¶odd. Honestly it almost felt like an opiate, rather than an opiate blocker. 

Then when I drank, I still very clearly felt the effects of the wine. Maybe less so than usual, but not really? I still got drunk. I had always heard that folks who tried it would have a feeling of the booze didn't impacting them at all, and I didn't have that experience.

Once I got out of rehab and started attending AA habitually, sobriety just stuck and I'm very happy to be sober.  I've certainly had the occasional desire like we all do, but nothing too overwhelming and I've never really come close to a voluntary relapse.

&#x200B;

This past weekend, I went to a charity event that I've been going to each year since I got sober.  I'm actually the one who got them to be a bit more creative in carrying beverages for us besides ""Coke"".  It's an arts collaborative that my partner sits on the board for, they're all great kids, and the moment I asked three years ago, they dove in and started also serving mocktails at this event, for which I was very grateful.

&#x200B;

This year with the covid restrictions, they made all the drinks ahead of time and put them in pouches for serving.  I'm always very careful when I order at a bar to watch the bartender make mine, just because I know how easy it is to switch on autopilot and forget I said no booze.  Well, long and short of it is I grabbed pouch from the ""virgin"" side and drank about half of it before my brain kicked in and warned me it tasted like vodka.  I had my partner confirm, and yup, I just drank half of a very generously spiked beverage.

&#x200B;

I don't know if it was my panic or my total lack of tolerance, but I almost immediately felt intoxicated, and it was AWFUL.  Knowing this feeling was something I'm not allowed paired with my adrenal glands pumping at max output was hellish for about half an hour.  I probably honestly didn't drink all that much, but it was not fun at all.

&#x200B;

I guess I'm actually kind of grateful this happened.  My slip was a mistake and certainly unintended, so I think I get a mulligan here, but I also got to have the experience of how shitty returning to alcohol would be.

I‚Äôve been drinking, usually daily for the better part of 19 years.  I would take a month off here and there over the years but the rest of the time was spent either drinking openly or hiding my drinking so I could drink more without anyone noticing and commenting on it.  The past year and a half I‚Äôve tried on a number of occasions to take that month break and would usually make it only a few days before a ‚Äúreason‚Äù to drink would pop up. 

Drinking was my identity, drinking was what connected me to people.  Every time I thought about quitting I would immediately think about all of the ‚Äúfun‚Äù events I would miss out on.  I would think of the breweries and wineries I loved to explore when traveling to a new place, I thought about the post-run beer (or 4) that always tasted so good.  Alcohol never interfered in my life to the point that I lost anything physical, but the mental toll it took became overwhelming.  I hated the lying, the hiding, the excuses of why I was vomiting in the morning, the excuses of why I was sweaty or shaky at work the morning after having ‚Äúa few drinks to unwind‚Äù.  

It reached a tipping point in June when my partner went out of town for work and I just binged all weekend.  She arrived home from the trip late, around 11pm, and I held a full conversation with her that I barely remember.  The next morning was my official re-birthday.  I was just done, officially sick of myself and the life that I was struggling to maintain.  I was completely honest with her about my entire drinking life.  She is incredibly supportive and feel so lucky to have someone like her in my life.

I feel lucky to have the support and friendship that I do.  I feel lucky that I made this decision before I lost anymore to alcohol. I‚Äôve struggled with mental health issues my entire life and I feel proud that I‚Äôm taking this journey and I‚Äôm doing it for me.

\*\*If you choose to read further, it's disorganized, it's rambling, it's cursing, it ridiculous. It's me. You've been warned.

I(m40) have had a drinking problem for the last 20 years. I need help. I feel like I'm not the usual drunk, but don't we all.  Due to my job, I absolutely can't drink every 3rd day.  I guess I could, but I'd lose said job immediately.  

I already exercise daily.  I don't look like an alcoholic. I'm extremely fit and in shape.  My workout is basically the only thing that stops me from drinking all day.  As soon as a workout is done, that's when I start. Doesn't matter if it's 8am or 6pm, I will get it done. 

I've told myself that it's not that bad, it's just beer.  It's not like I'm drinking liquor every day.  But it is that bad.  I don't even drink so much I'm hung over.  The anxiety and depression are worse than any hangover I've ever had. 

I have a lot of problems.  I used to think that if I could quit drinking that it would solve them all.  That's not the case, but I do believe I can't start to solve anything and drink. The truth is I hate myself.  (I've thought this many many times, but damn it feels weird to type it). I don't know how to be happy sober.  The thought of sobriety feels awful.  

I've taken breaks.  I didn't drink in January and I started sober October.  That said, I only made it 21 days before a bad day made me give in.  I certainly feel better, but not that much.  I still have that self hatred, depression, and anxiety.  It's just not quite so loud in my head.  My sober brain is slightly more quite.  But not a lot.  I've had terrible thoughts. Thoughts I'd never act on because I have children.  They're all I care about.  Other than them, I couldn't care less about myself or anything else.  And I still feel this way after a few weeks of being sober, I'm just less likely to day dream about steering my truck into a giant goddamn tree.  

I feel guilty for not being happy too.  My life is easy compared to most people.  My children are healthy, intelligent, and they love me.  Why do I hate my own existence so much? I joke that I'm the luckiest unlucky mother fucker ever.  Meaning I am healthy(ish), my kids are perfect, I have a home, I have a truck, I have food.  But if eeny, meeny, miny, moe was between a handshake and a kick in the balls, I'm getting sacked 100% of the time. But I won't die. 

I should see a therapist.  I looked into it, and I can't even come close to affording it.  I have pretty decent insurance too.  

Covid hasn't been that bad on me. But it's not helped.  Due to the nature of my job, I never stopped working. Good fucking thing too, I don't have enough savings to last a month. I'm always in my shit box house with my kids doing homeschool or something.  It's also rained all goddamn summer keeping them inside my shit box house too much.  I'm single.  Even if there was somewhere to go and meet people right now, I really don't have time to date.  I always have my kids if I'm not at work.  And I don't want to change that.  I wouldn't want to date me either though.  If I hate me, I can't expect someone else to like me either.  

I'm not motivated at all.  I'm lucky that fitness is a deep seated habit for me. All I want to do is sit in my spot on the shitty sofa I have, drink beer and watch movies and tv shows.  

How did I get here? I was motivated. I started a side  business.  I'm good at it.  What I'm not good at is selling myself.  It's hard to hate something and sell it. Now I'm not even trying.  I was making a little extra with potential.  Now barely anything due to lack of effort.  I can't force myself to do anything.  Nothing.  It's weird too that if I put something off once, I won't get it done at all. I never put something off once, it's at least 5 times if I do it at all.  I hate this about myself 

I feel like if I don't change my life, my children will  not want to be around me any more.  They'll get tired of broke daddy in his shitty house when momma makes a fuck ton of money and love to spend it. I feel like I'm going to end up with a DUI. (had one at 21 years old).  If I got one now, my job is gone.  

I feel like there's 100 things weighing me down right now and the drinking is the zip ties hold my hands behind my back.  How to I want to be sober? How do I not want to numb this shit? 

I tried Kratom one time in an effort to quit.  Talk about losing my mind, while I have self destructive thoughts now, coming off that stuff made me seriously consider suck starting a shotgun.  

I'm scared of anti depressants as well.  There's no chance I'd take those things correctly.  I can't take anything correctly.  And honestly, if it weren't for my job and being tested regularly I'd probably have drug addictions to add to this list.

Here I sit the next morning‚Ä¶or should I say afternoon. I‚Äôll preface this by saying I never really considered that I had an actual problem with alcohol. I‚Äôm in my early 30s, and have just recently quit drinking in the last couple months. Never felt like I had too much of a drinking problem, I‚Äôve just partied so much since my late teenage years that I started to realize what a late start I was getting in life. Been stuck in a dead-end, shitty job in the same industry since high school (restaurant work where binge drinking is highly encouraged), living in a shitty apartment, with a group of friends with zero aspirations. I don‚Äôt know where or when my life took this turn, but it has been a long time in the making. I have had a one beer or one glass of wine in the past couple months with no real issue, although if I‚Äôm being honest I‚Äôm only drinking that because other people are. It‚Äôs so strange how people make you feel like YOU are the weird one for not wanting to even drink one beer while hanging out. Anyways, last night we are having a group of people over to hang out. It is a weird feeling having people over nowadays, as there is a little anxiety if people will be able to have a good time even if you are staying sober. In the morning, I start to think about an airplane bottle of booze I know is in the house. I start to think I‚Äôll just drink part of a coke and pour the airplane bottle in, that way I can have my one drink and I won‚Äôt have to deal with any weird looks of excitement of a friend seeing me drink. This idea excites me, so much so that I‚Äôm thinking about it all day long. I start to think maybe one more might even be more fun, since it‚Äôll be a secret too. Next thing I know I‚Äôve gone to the liquor store. Friends arrive, have a fun little night but I am sneaking off time and time again to pour another airplane bottle in my coke. I laid in bed last night feeling buzzed for the first time in months‚Ä¶and the shame is starting to set in. I think how odd it was to have been sneaking off, and how I was worried someone would notice at first but after one drink I didn‚Äôt even mind. I sit here the next day, feeling a hangover for the first time in months. Ashamed at how quickly I spiraled from a sober friends night to one drink to a secret agent mission to get drunk alone. I‚Äôve already considered going to get fast food and taking a nap, more things I haven‚Äôt done in months. As I start this journey for the hundredth time, I feel like I just gained an incredible grasp on what my alcohol-loving brain is capable of. And for that, I am thankful.",6,0

It‚Äôs generally something I have control over, until I don‚Äôt. Last year my alcohol use led to a cocaine habit that started to run my life (and therefore my girlfriend‚Äôs too) and I knew it had to end. I took 100 days sober and it was honestly the best 100 days I had experienced in years.

On my birthday I decided to have a couple of beers. I love craft beer, and hey it‚Äôs my birthday, why not? Things went great. I was in control again, the cocaine was out of my life, I was at my ideal weight, and summer was good. Things rolled along fairly smooth for the most part as months went by. I could actually just have 1-2 and stop. 

Then March hit. The pandemic hit. Life hit. My gf and I weren‚Äôt doing well financially and our roommate informed us we needed to move out of her house. Great. Once I was furloughed from my job and started making 2x the money on unemployment than I made working full time, the demon came back. I was hitting the liquor store 2 times a week at $100 or more each time. Two months go by and I‚Äôve been drunk for every single day/night of them. I‚Äôm drinking nearly a 750ml of liquor to myself a night, along with 6-10 beers/seltzers. 

Summer comes around and I realized that I needed to get outside more. Ride my bike. Take the dog for a walk. ANYTHING. I cut down a bit but was still drunk all of the time. My gf and I moved and it was a weight lifted off our shoulders to get out of our roommates house seeing as she is a big time coke user. The drinking came with us though. I had just gone back to work but still was living like I was in unemployment. My girlfriend had multiple nights of coming out at 7-8am to a passed out me in my desk chair at my computer. I was pale, cold, clammy, and struggling to breathe. She had to wheel my chair to the couch and shove me onto it. It was a nightmare for both of us.


Fast forward to now: I realized this was unhealthy as all hell and knew I needed a change. I had never had alcohol withdrawal because I had been drinking so much and so frequently that I never gave my body the chance to experience it. I tried to stop cold turkey and day 1 became such a nightmare that I caved. I looked into proper ways to taper and began that process. That was last week. Saturday night I had 1 beer. Sunday and Monday night I had 0 drinks. 

Waking up today clear headed and not hungover is a gift again. I feel like im on the right path again which is beautiful. Had a STRONG craving last night and almost pulled up to the bar while just going to the grocery. Pulled a U-Turn last second and just got snacks and La Croix instead.

This past Sunday I had a softball game and a couple of us went out after the game. 2 of the people I had not hung out with outside of the sport itself in a long time so was nice to catchup, but I got tempted to have beers while out with them. I couldn't let my teammates drink alone. Overall while I was drinking I felt pretty good. The first beer was nasty and thiccccc (Brown Ale, which I used to love) and the second was a nice Belgium Ale that was actually really good.

Everything was going well but when we decided to leave the bar I felt like I didn't know what to do with the rest of my day. It was a rainy day in Chicago, so would have been nice to chill out and read a book or maybe do some food prep, but because of my changed state I couldn't focus on any of those things. I went for a long walk which made things better, but when it got time to go to sleep I could tell my body temperature was raised and I had a hard time relaxing. I think it's directly related to drinking the beers, even if it was only 2.

I think my point here is even if you are feeling good after a few months of not drinking and think it might be ok to have 1-2, it's not worth it. I do feel like my rhythm bounced back faster than it did when I was drinking on the regular, but still not worth it.

TLDR; having one or two after months of being dry is not worth it.",36,0

I tried for more than a year to not drink, and rarely strung together more than a few days at a time. When I finally fucked up enough to ask other people for help, I had no confidence that I could make it more than a few days without drinking. I was participating here on SD for weeks before requesting a badge. It didn't feel like the reminder would help, and I was worried about being demoralized over resets.

I requested my badge after three plus weeks of successful not-drinking. I can't say I was confident the number would keep going up, but seeing numbers in the 20s was helpful and made me proud. There were milestones to celebrate. My badge was an amazing reminder of how far I had come.

As the number displayed got bigger, it became less important. Not-drinking became my normal. It was no longer the focus of my life. Living and being was. I'm still proud of my badge, but I don't notice it or pay attention to the number displayed. I did see I was heading towards a fun number...

So here I am, marking an arbitrary and amusing number on my badge. **Please celebrate with me, whatever day you are on and whatever your current struggles are.**

33, looking on it had GERD since childhood, my teeth are a wreck (blamed on sweets and soft drinks), had persistant cough and sore throat a lot of my life, always blamed on allergies and heartburn.

Fairly heavy drinker since 18.

Also big coffee drinker.

Diet isn't great either.

Not overweight though üòÉ

Night sweats and low grade fever started a year ago but were brushed off my my GP, bloods all normal, no raised glands etc.

Sat down a few weeks ago, long time after eating and had massive aching discomfort just below my sternum, this did not get better after downing milk which has been my go-to for years.

Looking back over the last 6 months, beer in particular has been hard for me to drink in any quantity without feeling nauseous.

Current symptoms:

Sore throat.
Pain swallowing deep down.
Hacking cough originating from deep in chest when I eat or drink.
Difficulty swallowing due to discomfort deep down
Hot flushes.
Persistent pain under my breast bone, not associated with eating.

Haven't eaten for a few days now, symptoms are just the same. Losing weight fast.

The cough and persistent pain worry me the most, and the fact that I've had this all my life but never this.

Endoscopy is next Friday, need to get through to then, instead of being the absolute mess I am right now, basically bedridden!!

No-one can tell me I'm low risk with my history but if lots of people can tell me that they've lived a similar life then that would help I think!

Against all odds, I'm 11 days sober today. This is long but I just wanted to share the experience, so thanks for reading if you have the time. 

We've had this party planned for months. Only 12 people but some traveling 1-3 hours to be here and most we were seeing for the first time since Covid, some in over a year. I did not even think about cancelling because I wanted to see my friends and family so badly. I went about preparing right up until the last minute -- cooking, decorating, curating the playlist-- totally calm and collected. 

An hour before, I panicked. I'd texted ahead of time so almost everyone knew I wasn't drinking, to avoid anyone offering me alcohol or bringing a bottle as a hostess gift, but there would still be plenty of people who would themselves be drinking. So yeah, I panicked. That pre-party drink was what always got me through the social anxiety jitters and it wasn't coming this time. All of a sudden I realized with crystal clarity that I had never been in a large group situation without a drink and at least two of my guests I'd never even hung out with in a non-drinking situation. I cried. I shook. I sat in a corner and told myself over and over again that this had been a bad idea. I was only 8 days sober. This was crazy. This was a bad idea. I didn't want to do this anymore. My sobriety was more important than this party and I should just cancel it. 

But then I had another thought. There would always be a reason to drink. I could claim a sudden fever and make this whole thing go away, sure. Many people further into recovery than me would probably have told me to do so. But next week is election night. Then Thanksgiving and Christmas. New Years. Planning two kids birthday parties in March. Cinco De Mayo. Summer vacations. My birthday. And just like that, Halloween Party 2021 would be here. I can't make life and events and the fact that almost everyone I love drinks socially go away in order for me to stay sober. I have to want it for me. No one is forcing me to stay sober and no one can do it for me. 

So the party happened. My friends and family brought me food and even fancy teas. One guest who didn't know in advance brought a bottle of Patron and asked me to do a shot but I said ""I'm actually sober, 8 days"" and they said oh, that's cool and did not ask again. I drank three sparkling grapefruit waters. I laughed and danced and took a million pictures. I had THREE different people pull me aside to drop major life bombshells they desperately needed to talk about and I got to be there for them. Sober. I got to be the friend they needed: I listened, I consoled, I gave them my time. I didn't give a quick hug and flippantly tell them everything would be okay and then wander off for a shot like I probably would have in the past. 

At the end of the night I cleaned up. I cleaned up the night of the party! I tucked both of my daughters into bed without slurring my words or trying to keep them from smelling my breath. I woke up the next morning to a clean house. I remembered everything that happened the night before, no shame or worry, and for the first time since I was 19, no Sunday morning post-party hangover to nurse. 

All my fears about not having fun or being too anxious with all these people and no drink in my hand were completely unfounded. I had an amazing time and ate good food and laughed a lot and I am so glad I did not cancel. I got to see a glimpse of who I want to be and that's a good friend and a good mom and a fun girl who can have fun without a drink or ten.

Anyway... I guess I just wanted to share my first small victory with people who would understand what it meant to me. I'm not claiming that being around alcohol this soon was a good idea or encoraging anyone else to do so. We are all on our own journey; this was the choice I made and I am thankful that I was able to maintain my sobriety through the challenge. I am thankful for 11 days sober, for supportive friends and family, and for hope in a future free from the grip of alcohol. I'm beginning to feel the inkling of a future of peace with myself and with who I am for the first time in a long time.

The house was an absolute mess. Floors covered in spilled liquor punch, garbage and cups everywhere. And in walks my precious little boy looking for dad. 

I had to pull it together and started frantically cleaning the house while he hung onto my leg and wanted to be carried. As I dumped the rest of the keg onto the lawn with him looking up at me I had never felt more ashamed of myself in my entire life. I made a promise right then and there that I was done forever. My son deserves a dad who will always be capable to look after him and I don't want him growing up in a house that normalizes drinking like I did. 

To be honest once the decision was made it was relatively easy for me to stick by it. I still went out to bars or get togethers and never really felt compelled to drink. I'd order club sodas at the bar or bring my own soda waters to a party. The only thing I wake up feeling after a night out now is hydrated.

Woke up in the middle of the night last night after an intense dream state with the realization that every time I've fallen back in my old ways prior to this. In far away times and recent,  It was because of my need as a person to be a natural people pleaser and that I didn't want to make them uncomfortable or be the party pooper and my need for my own comfort. So I have always given in to peer pressure and allowed alcohol lizard brain to take over from there.

What I mean by this is I've never actually fessed up and told anyone, ""I have a problem."" It's always been ""I'm stopping for fitness"" etc etc. Partially because I didn't want to make myself uncomfortable or them and partially because I didn't want to change the dynamic in between myself and the person/people even though it needs to be if that makes sense. Whether that makes them and myself uncomfortable or not.  I also think I've always ""wanted"" a way back into drinking because if it was always just for ""fitness"". They wouldn't be horrified to see me with a drink again, even though they all probably know deep down I don't need that drink or any for that matter.

I guess what I'm coming to realize is, my sobriety is more important than anyone else's or my own temporary discomfort because I'm genuinely more happy when I am sober!

 I am Landon, a 63  y/o woman,  disabled and determined to find the way to earn my living  doing what I  love: blogging about my recovery, personal growth, and  crafting. I also  want to return to school. One of my biggest goals is to  get myself off  of welfare and out of poverty FOR.GOOD. If I can do that  for myself, I  can help others too. That alone is an enormous need I  crave.

About  my  background, I drank dangerously for 30 years of my life, stopping  and  relapsing many times. I began my most productive alcohol recovery  on  11-16-2007. Finally, I could no longer ignore the fact my life was  out  of control and being drunk every day would not help me.

Back  then, I did  not understand what was ahead of me. Raised in a monstrous  household by  my sadistic psychopath mother, absent father and two  older sisters who  were mother's thugs, it is a miracle I am alive. My  childhood was so  abusive, I locked most of it up in amnesia and complex  ptsd flashbacks. I  sat down one day to write out what I could  remember: I wrote less than 3  pages, 8 by 11, Ariel size 11 font.  Almost every memory I have includes  abuse. And because of those  impairments, I became learning disabled.

Catapulted  into  promiscuity, alcoholism, self-loathing, self-destruction, and  more  because of that upbringing, my first therapist diagnosed me with   clinical depression in the early 1990s. Then, I realized how close I had   been to danger, plus my flesh and blood family were criminals. It   shocked me! I also remembered I had engaged in incest with three male   cousins who took advantage of my vulnerabilities. That happened when I   was around 13 and later in high school.

Decades  after  that, I worked to better my mindset. I went to psychotherapy and  AA  meetings. The therapy helped me more than the meetings. I respect  folks  who benefit from AA because different people respond to different   approaches, but there are some aspects of AA that bothered me.

In  doing years of  therapy, I got to the place where I could not figure  out why I kept  sabotaging myself. It was on the floor staring at me; I  could not escape  it unless I relapsed. I had to stomach what I ran from  my entire life:  my blood mother and sisters hated me and tried to  destroy me. I worried  what they pummeled me with was true: That I was  defective and no one  would ever love me. That was what I ran from.

 I had to undergo  hypnosis to get  those stuck emotions going; that is how buried and  cemented in place  they were. It took me weeks of listening to my  recorded hypnosis  sessions 2 or 3 times a day to cry as much as I  needed. I saw firsthand  how much better I felt when I faced and accepted  the emotional horrors  that tormented me, the very horrors I drank and  drugged to escape. I  was hooked and kept working on those issues and  anything else negative  that bothered me. It is a TON of work, but I have  healed enough that  now I can embrace the negative wounds to heal them  to the best of my  ability. They are MY wounds; they are as much a part  of me as my toes  and fingers are.

The therapy took.me.YEARS. and I still have a ton of work ahead of me; recovery is   for life. We know that. That is how complex it is. But, for me, it has   also been *rewarding*  because I  have a lot to be grateful for and am happy about. Slowly, my  mental  health has gotten better and some of my physical health has  improved.

One  last  important thing I want to share is when I stopped drinking, my  over  eating worsened. (That is another chapter I will write about  another  day.) And still not having most of the important needs met  today, I  still struggle with overeating. I have gotten my cravings to  stop and to  not bother me for weeks on end. I have lost up to 28 lbs  during those  quiet periods, only to regain some weight back when the  cravings  returned. I know the cravings return to compel me to get those  needs  met. One way emotions work is to tell us something is off and we  need to  fix it. And believe me, I am doing everything I can!

I  know I can get  them to stop completely, and that is my focus. I am  pulling together  every resource I have to get myself there: Satisfied  with my life and  all needs met to the best of my ability.

So, all that said, I am glad to be here and am looking forward to making new friends!",68,0

So much money, so much potential, and especially all the TIME that I will never get back.  So many nights spent drunk watching TV, stumbling home from the bar, or passed out on the bathroom floor.
Why?  What was the purpose?  Could I have learned as much if I never started?  Would pushing myself to accomplish more in life (academics, career, musical training) led me to deeper addiction?  I am feeling quite a bit of guilt about this.  
How could I have taken better care of myself without knowing how?  Thank you all.

Turned 43 this year and have been drinking my entire adult life. Of course it progressed until the point that I'd wake up at 8 am and start drinking only to be passed out by the afternoon. Hell, if my eyes were open it was time to drink. 

Just like everyone else on this sub I knew I had a problem and needed to stop. I've tried so many times but couldn't put together anything but a couple of days. Then I'd start to feel better and drink again. A few months back I managed to put together 3 weeks, but fell back into the trap.

Here I am again with 7 days and feeling great. Surprisingly it hasn't been all that hard except for a couple pretty tough challenges. This past Friday my wife decided to go hang out with her sister. This is a major trigger for me. I've always used that as some ""free time"" to drink away the night. Even though our son was with me the thoughts started racing through my head. This was also the eve of our 11 year anniversary. Took my son to the grocery store for some anniversary dinner items and flowers and there it was. The liquor store in the same plaza. Typically during checkout I would get some cash back and head into the liquor store to grab a couple half pints. This time I started playing the tape through.

I thought about what it would be like on our anniversary. Another day of disappointment and heartache. Hungover, feeling like absolute shit, shaking, sweating, nauseous, and guilty. I didn't get cash back and on the way out of the store and I didn't even glance at the liquor store. Took my groceries and my son to the car, got in, and drove away. FUCK YOU ALCOHOL. 

The weekend was fantastic. I was able to make a delicious porterhouse steak on the grill and enjoy the weekend with my wife and son. We rode bikes, completed chores, walked the dog, watched football, and just enjoyed being around each other.

Monday (yesterday) comes around and I'm still feeling great. Even better actually. I take my lunch every day so I don't leave work and get some vodka during lunch, but my wife sends me a text telling me I forgot my damn food. Triggered, but not defeated, I order a sub online. Go out to pick up the sub from the store in a plaza with another liquor store. Usually I would park near the liquor store since I would again get cash back and grab a couple half pints. This time I started to play the tape through. On my way to get lunch I thought about how I'd feel in a couple hours. The foggy brain, sweats, bloated stomach. I thought about how I'd feel in the morning. I thought about how far I've come. I parked far away from the liquor store, ran in to grab my sub, and got the fuck out. Again, FUCK YOU ALCOHOL!

So here I am on day 8 with a couple small, but huge victories behind me. One day at a time. One hour at a time. One minute at a time. FUCK YOU ALCOHOL.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

**This pledge is a statement of intent**. Today we don't set out **trying** not to drink, we make a conscious decision **not to drink**. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't**: A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hello! If you're checking in for the first time or missed yesterdays check-in, my name is Nikki and I'll be hosting the DCI until October 31st. Thanks to those who shared their preconceived notions of recovery. It seems like we had a few things in common especially when thinking of who treatment and recovery is really for (spoiler: ***it's for anyone in need!***) . For today, let's dive into the act of grace.

When I went to treatment, one of the first behaviors I had to unlearn (and fast) was beating myself up. I suffered heavily from [imposters syndrome](https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2013/11/fraud) at work and it took a lot for me to accept positive remarks from anyone about anything. If it was something positive, I couldn't accept that they were talking about me and if it was negative, well of course it's my fault.  On Sunday's post, I briefly mentioned this, but I had overslept due to a new medication, and missed a class. I woke up in a panic and I was balling my eyes out because ***I*** kept telling myself that I let everyone down and that everyone thinks I'm not taking this serious. The first thing my case manager and therapist told me to do was to get a grip, think rationally, and practice giving myself grace. They asked ""Did we tell you that you let us down?"" Obviously, no. ""Did we tell you that you're not taking it serious?"" Again...no. ""Did your friends or family members who are hundreds of miles away suddenly pop up and say you're letting them down?"" Okay. I get it. I eventually sat and thought on it and I realized that I was able to give grace to **EVERYONE** except for myself. I was my #1 hater. 

Giving grace, like meditation, is a practice. I am no where near where I want to be in order to allow myself to be ok if I make a mistake or do something good, but I'm much better about it. When I left treatment, I became overwhelmed because in my discharge plan, I had written out how I was going to live the rest of my life! I was going to wake up at 7am EST and do yoga, go on walks, etc. But this was where I needed to live life on life's terms. I put too much on my plate for someone just getting out of treatment.  It wasn't until recently that I realized I need to break up my plans and do it piece by piece. I had to understand that even though waking up at 7am EST was easy to do in treatment, I was in a different setting with a less rigid schedule and different responsibilities. During this time, I also found out that there is a thin line between giving yourself grace and excusing bad habits, so much so that you may not even notice until it's already happening.  To help track, I learned of a tool called the ""[Personal Crazy Index](https://medium.com/transformations/keep-your-sanity-with-the-personal-craziness-index-333b5b9f96be)"". In short, it's a list of categories you choose that, when you're doing them regularly, you believe your life is in balance and all is well. Everyday, you rank yourself on if you're maintaining these categories or not. Missed a day or two a week in a category? It's ok, you're only human. Missed 4 consecutive days in many categories? It's time to put yourself on alert and find out what's causing the imbalance. 

Whether you're Day 0 or Day 1000, in my opinion, giving yourself grace is necessary during your recovery journey. It's ok if you stumble as long as you can eventually get yourself back up. It's ok if you don't have the answers now as long as you keep trying to find them. Despite being on this life changing path, we are still human and there is nothing we can do to change that, so make sure you keep living your life :)

My question for today is: **Do you find giving yourself grace is hard and if so, what have you been doing to work on it?**

*Today's song of the day is ""*[Shake it Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc-tf09Dl4M)*"" by Florence + The Machine (CW: drinks referenced at 4:49). When you stumble, don't keep dragging a horse you don't have to. Bury it and keep going.*

*Please feel free to share a song that hit home for you, I‚Äôd love to expand my recovery playlist and of course,* ***just for today I am not drinking.***",104,0

Boy this month has been amazing.  


The first 7 days were rough, but around day 12 or 13 I really felt my ""vitality"" in general start to come rushing back.  


With all the money I stopped squandering into alcohol, I reinvested back into myself and my business, and for once I finally feel like I'm getting back on track with my life and career.  


So far since the initial withdrawal and boredom wore off(day 12/13), I really haven't found myself desiring a drink. I believe there were a few separate occasions I had the desire to unwind, but it was quickly dismantled by thinking of all the hangovers I've had, and how great I feel these days.  


Also, my room-mates haven't stopped drinking and I've had many opportunities thrown at me, to which my willpower has easily overcome.  


This truly feels like a turning point. If anyone out there is struggling or asking themselves if it is worth it, I can say with certainty that it really is.  


A few drawbacks of not drinking I've noticed:  
\-I'm way less fun, but maybe I just ""thought"" I was more fun when I was drinking  
\-My insomnia is back to pre-alcoholic levels, I'm learning to just live with it  
\-There is a certain kind of comfort in having a hangover and fucking off for 10 hours while lying in bed, ordering food, and binge watching TV. But the benefits of not drinking or having hangovers far outweigh that.  
\-My hyper-analytical mindset, uninhibited, comes off very ""on the spectrum"" and it is off putting to people. I used alcohol to treat this, but it's unhealthy and just like the insomnia, I'm going to learn to live with it  


Conclusion:  
While I'm going to stay dry for as long as I can, my pledge is to never drink by myself(or accompanied) at home again. But I never intended to go full abstinent. I do imagine I will eventually drink again while out at a special occasion or event, perhaps new years at home, but if it devolves back into drinking after 5pm at home ""to take the edge off"" I'm cutting myself off permanently.",14,0

I don't know where I would be with out the support systems I've been able to accumulate over the last 11 months, but I know one thing for sure and that is that I would not be sober.

A lot has happened over the last 11 months. I haven't been arrested in that time. I haven't gotten into fights with friends because I can't remember what I was arguing about. I haven't had to be rushed to the hospital after hurting myself. I haven't endangered other by driving behind the wheel while intoxicated. I have no missing memories in the last eleven months. I haven't walked out on any bar tabs, and daily since I started this journey I have not systematically poisoned myself to the point that I hated my existence and got to a point where I  had to apologize for my behavior.

In the last 11 months Ibhave been working on getting physically healthy again. I have been learning a second language, which I'm shaky at best but its at a point where I can hold a conversation in it. Ive been able to delve back into litrature, which is something I really missed. I started my own business with helps from my support team that has been doing really well. My relationship, with my girlfriend who couldn't watch my try drown my sorrows anymore, is better than it has been in years. My parents can look me in the eyes again and say they are proud of me. My mother doesn't have to worry anymore that the next phone call she receives will be to say that I passed away. Last but not least my beautiful baby daughter arrived into the world and if that's not the greatest reason to stay sober I don't know what is.

It hasn't always been easy, hell some days it was down right torture. But every minute has been worth it not be in that place anymore. Quiting drinking didn't instantly make my life better. That took hard work and determination, but not poisoning myself everyday was a good place to start. I know if I hadn't started that journey 11 months ago I wouldn't be here today. But with one day at a time anything is possible.

I wish you all the best on you sober journeys.

Literally haven't thought of tying one on in over a decade.  My triggers were anxiety and apathetic depression, but life has been structured, active, and rewarding.  I don't even think twice of ordering a glass of wine at a fancy dinner or nursing a beer at a BBQ.  More than one would just make me feel gross.  People know I don't like to drink, but it's more not-a-drinker as opposed to in-recovery vibe.  I know most people would disagree with the term ex-alcoholic, but it seems to fit.  Or seemed to fit...my tense has actually been a bit off so far.

Once again I find myself in a lonely (though much nicer) apartment.  Lockdown wasn't so bad at first.  Work from home.  Socialize from home.  Entertain yourself from home.  The usual home activities as well of course.  Key term is home. Then with some lifted restrictions and summer weather, it almost felt like life as normal.  Now though things have tightened back up.  It's cold out.  It's dark out.  I have a big work project coming up that I'm starting to feel anxious about (primarily driven by putting things off due to the anxiety).  Routine is breaking down (what's the point of showering every day if I'm just here all day)?

Tonight I got off work with no evening plans.  Mind still racing and overwhelmed.  Apartment a bit disheveled and no drive to do anything.  Suddenly I realized there was a fancy bottle of scotch someone had gifted me that had been sitting in my cupboard for a couple years.  Take a few slugs and just zone out a bit right?  Wait what the fuck am I thinking.  Maybe just one properly prepared drink though would be fine.  I mean I did that with my brother last new years.

Ugh.  Well it's now been flushed (I think it might have been like *really* nice haha) and after a bit of googling I found you fine folk to post to instead.

I just wanted to vent a little.  I have had a rough couple days since yesterday.  Big fight with the wife, staying in a hotel last night and tonight.  Today was a lot of thinking about the big old Divorce word.  We've been down this road many times before, especially in the last 6 months, but I think it's finally over this time.  Anyways that's the issue that set things off. 

Today all day I had the itch to drink.  I knew I'd be alone at a hotel tonight.  I knew that if I bought a 12 pack of Budweiser, or a 6 of Fairy Dust IPA, I'd be able to never say a word about it to anyone and therefore it wouldn't exist.  I toiled with this idea between working and running around getting my life together.  It was like it was an intrusive thought over-and-over all day.  Whereas I'd normally shake that feeling quickly, that wasn't the case today.  I went to Target about an hour ago and got a few things.  Thankfully, I had just seen my 2 daughters about an hour before that for a few minutes while I picked up things at my house.  But despite that I still had the itch for booze walking through the store.  I saw the liquor aisle nearing (Jack whiskey bottles on the end cap) as I pushed my cart through the other aisles and whispered to myself ""FUCK THAT.  Fuck alcohol.""  And I felt it *IN MY SOUL*.  

I will not drink today.  I will not drink ever again. 

I got to my hotel and put down my things on the table and said out loud to myself ""I love my family.  I love my wonderful kids.  Fuck alcohol.""

  
Now I have a lump in my throat writing this as the weight of the situation sets in.  Thank you all for the support here.  I thought of this group many times as well today, and the people in my life that support me, and that meant the world to me.  THAT kept my head right in the end.  Much love.  IWNDWYT.

Proud to say that I‚Äôm almost at the end of 19 days sober. I‚Äôve been a very heavy beer drinker since I was 18 years old and have been battling with the ‚Äúam I an alcoholic question‚Äù really since my early 20s. I‚Äôm 41 years old now. My family is split down the middle, my mom‚Äôs side of the family are all sober and my dad‚Äôs side are all heavy drinkers.

I‚Äôve tried desperately hard to be like my dad for the past twenty years, truth is he is 73 and still drinks around 3 whiskeys and a bottle of wine a night. Highly functional alcoholic. My career has been in the hospitality mgmt so it has been easy to mask/hide my problem from others. 

I am happy to say I have walked away from the restaurant business for good. There are so many triggers and co-workers who also battle with substance abuse. I‚Äôve spent the past seven months unemployed waiting for my restaurant to reopen and I finally had to give my notice. These seven months have been rough, I was drinking a lot of beer every day while doing my best to home school my children. I got really good at hiding my beer cans from my wife, but one night three weeks ago she had had enough. I was intoxicated and belligerent and she called me out the next day, gave me the ultimatum. Not a proud moment.

Since being sober, I have refocused my passion on a 2nd career in teaching high school. I am about two months away from being eligible for a teaching job. I could never conquer this goal if my mind was obsessing over beer every day. It feels like I‚Äôm in a dream, that God has given me a second chance. 

This is my first post. Y‚Äôalls posts have been a huge support for me along with AA and therapy. One day at a time and lots of sparkling water. Much love to all, keep sharing.

Being inebriated doesn't benefit me at all even in moderate amounts. It doesn't bring me any step closer to my life goals either. It's just mere, temporary pleasure followed by a comedown resulting in a hangover. I'm not telling anyone in real life I'm stopping drinking btw. Does more harm than good from my personal experience. Also makes people question their own habits/addictions too.

At the tender age of 22 years old, I've had enough of the emotional, mental, and physical damage alcohol has caused me. In the meantime, I need to watch out for what type of music I listen to and generally the content (podcasts, tv shows, videos, etc) I consume in the foreseeable future. All said factors can trigger a relapse in the wrong capacity. Have a great week ahead, everyone!

This was after drinking for 25 years which got worse and worse until I had to seek help. As you might imagine, there have been many, many benefits of sobriety. 

The most difficult part now is that I've lost interest in just about everything. Alcohol was always like a carrot on a stick for me. It was my rocket fuel so to speak. If I didn't feel like going out or being social, I always knew alcohol would help. If I was in a depressed mood, I always turned to alcohol. 

I've talked to my primary doctor and two counselors and I basically get the deer in the headlights look when I explain this so that hasn't been helpful. I attended a few AA meetings but due to my social anxiety, I was not able to speak. Also, I'm an atheist, so the God/higher power part of the program doesn't speak to me. 

As it stands, I don't look forward to anything, I'm not interested in things that I used to do when I was drinking and I avoid social situations all together if I can. 

I've even lost interest in sex. So what I have left is food and sleep.

This is my 365th day in a row without alcohol. I honestly cannot believe it. I really didn't think it would be possible, way back when. 

I still struggle with the guilt that I feel for all of the stupid shit that I did while drunk; most things I only know about because of day-after stories. I still struggle with the pain I have caused others. I often think about how disgustingly terrible I treated a few people in particular and have to fight the urge to breakdown because I really was that horrible. I still struggle with how far I strayed from my morals. I used to be a happy-go-lucky, good kid. I didn't even start drinking until I was 21. How did everything change so fast? How did I spiral so far out of control so easily? I always had strong ambitions. I was a hard-worker when it came to sports, grades, and my job. I wanted to become something big. And all I became was a big disappointment. 

I can't go back and change anything that I have done. My only option is to take responsibility for the decisions that I have made and move forward. I would love to erase the person that I was when I was drinking, but that is simply not possible. She will always be a part of me. But I know that I now have the willpower and strength to overcome that demon. I have the willpower and strength to make the positive decision to not drink again. This past year has been full of ups and downs but the downs were still countless times better than they would have been if I had been wasted.

I have some good things going for me, though.  I'm happily married, I have a good job, I'm financially secure, I have good friends and live in a place that I love.  I just requested a referral for outpatient treatment, and I know I can do this -- I know that if I cannot do it, I will likely die an early and horrible death.

Just because the world has gone to shit does not mean that I have to keep treating myself like shit.  I thought I was getting drunk to escape reality, but it never worked.  Reality is still there when I wake up, hungover, even less prepared to deal with it than I was before.

Some advice could be helpful, though.  I currently probably average 10+ strong drinks (almost always strong IPAs) a day, and have been doing this for a long time.  Should I try to titrate?  What's a good timeline / schedule for this if I do?

I know I'm going to have trouble sleeping at first.  Any recommendations on how to improve this would be appreciated.

I'm also sure that I've wrecked my body nutritionally.  I have no appetite and can barely keep food down right now.  Recommendations for how to ease back into a healthier diet (or a diet that isn't composed mostly of beer) would be helpful, too.

I need to stop killing myself this way.  I owe better to myself, to my wife, and to my friends.",5,0

I woke up today in a panic. I feel like a piece of shit.

I had a weird sleep where I was having nightmares, but knowing I was in them. I was trying to wake up. When I did, I was drowsy and kept hearing noises as I tried to fade off to sleep that would shoot me awake. But I knew they weren‚Äôt real noises, just mental ones.

I woke up not wanting to get out of bed because I already felt incredibly anxious for having drank so much. I feel on edge and anxious, and really awful.

Work ended up throwing a ton of tasks my way out of the blue, I realized I‚Äôd accidentally overdrawn my bank account for the first time since high school (which I was completely unaware I had done until I saw an email), and my friend told me that they may have exposed me to covid.

I‚Äôm almost numbed with how overwhelming this morning has been and I have only been awake for three hours.

I know that if I hadn‚Äôt drank, I‚Äôd be able to handle this better, I‚Äôd have way more money in my account, and I‚Äôd feel good knowing my body was healthy if covid was coming my way.

I guess I‚Äôve reached another big wake-up call and I think this really needed to happen to me again.

I‚Äôm ready to take this dive back in and surpass my last break. I want to keep this up. I want to do better for myself, my job, my finances, and my SO.

Two years ago today I I went to rehab. 
Two years ago today I decided to take control of my life!

I started drinking at 14 years old. I battled that demon until I was 41. I tried to quit a zillion times. I put together a week here, a year there, but I'd go right back to the bottle. 

Not this time! This time I was truly done. Something clicked. 

My life today is pretty amazing! I have a great life. My kids have a Mom who is present and loving and clear headed. My Husband has a wife who is happy and loving and helping to create a beautiful life with him. My job is no longer an after thought. I don't call in sick. I show up and put in my best work. My friendships are meaningful, powerful and fulfilling. My health is improved. I've lost 20 pounds. I sleep like a baby. I haven't thrown up in two years. My digestive system is normal. My skin is clear and glowing. 

I do not miss drinking. The desire is gone. I DO miss being part of the group. When others are drinking (at a BBQ, wedding, sporting event, etc) I DO feel like the odd one out. But, I've accepted it and I've learned to be okay with it. I don't put myself in those situations often and it's doable. 

I hope I never drink again. I don't believe I will. I may have two years and you may have one day, but we are the same. We're both just one drink away from losing it all.

It‚Äôs been hard, it‚Äôs been easy, it‚Äôs been insightful, it‚Äôs been grueling, it‚Äôs been sad, and weird, and amazing and wonderful. It‚Äôs been worth it.

Things I‚Äôve learned:

Expect to get to know yourself in a way that you‚Äôve never experienced due to discovering new interests, hobbies, coping mechanisms, strengths, weaknesses, having to break old habits, shedding relationships/environments etc. If you stick with the hard work of sobriety, it‚Äôs the beginning of re-discovering your true self. 

Alcohol use distracts us from truly experiencing our feelings and thoughts. It may be overwhelming and emotional but at the end of the tunnel is clarity and a better ability to cope with life. 

It‚Äôs scary to face life with a clear head. Forge ahead anyway. This is true strength and courage.

I didn‚Äôt realize how much I was using alcohol as a means to avoid uncomfortable things. 

I didn‚Äôt realize how much my conscience was suffering from engaging in destructive behaviors. I no longer suffer from the painful internal duality of knowing I am doing things that I don‚Äôt want to do.

I was in an Uber on my way home from my third binge of the month. I had spent well over $1,000 on drugs, alcohol and hotel rooms and it was becoming a habit. My life was spiraling and I couldn't take it anymore. I called my mom. She drove me to an AA meeting that night, and I've been sober ever since. 

I got my first job out of school and have been working at my organization in a comfortable, stable job for 16 months. I've made amends and healed relationships with friends and family. I never got along with my family, but these days we hang out most weekends. 

My golf game is COMPLETELY revamped. It's hard to play sports when you're hammered, who knew!? 

I've been living on my ""own"" (with my girlfriend) for over a year, and I've been able to pay my rent, my bills, keep on top of housework and save money. In fact, I opened up a retirement account and learned how to invest myself. 

I did my taxes! Not only did they get filed, but I even did them myself. 

And yesterday, I was trusted. I went to the liquor store, and I bought a bottle of wine for my girlfriend, and a couple non-alcoholic beers for me (I have these from time-to-time). I didn't panic. I wasn't scared. 

Final thoughts: Your path doesn't need to follow mine. AA is not necessary for getting sober, there are lots of ways to get sober. Keeping working at it is the way to get sober. Never stop trying. I believe in you all and want to thank you for all the help you've given me. I mostly lurk, but reading your stories helps me stay sober. Thank you, thank you, thank you.",77,0

How do I feel? Not hungover!!

Today marks my 80th day and also the day I realized I may have turned the corner on this. While going through the process the previous 79 days I found myself telling me that it was over. I had read ""This Naked Mind"" was experiencing no cravings and generally had the feeling of not wanting to drink. But I was never truly tested. 

I passed that test last night. The wedding was great and although I wasn't the life of the party like I'd always been in the past it wasn't the dreadful, dull experience I was fearful of. It was nice. There were times throughout the evening where I thought to myself ""why not"". What was illuminating is when I asked myself this question the answer I told myself was because I simply didn't want to. I didn't want to dilute the experience. I didn't want to get hazy and lose my sharpness. Drinking alcohol wasn't attractive to me...and if its not attractive for me at a wedding reception at a brewery I think I can overcome any situation that comes my way.

I was sober for about five years in my mid-30's and started occasionally socially drinking four years ago.  I thought I had it under control and mostly did until the summer of '19.  


It then turned from socially drinking into drinking more.  I don't want to get into the stupid shit I did, but it wasn't good.  With covid and being stuck home all the time it's come to a head and I realize I'm either going to get sober or this is going to take over my life.  


When I got sober years ago, I wasn't this bad.  I'm coming off another weekend bender after successfully having my shit together from Tuesday until Friday afternoon.  Then ""oh I'll have a couple"" turned into a couple bottles. 


I'm going to try to hit up some online meetings, and am posting my beloved (no seriously, I'm going to miss it) whiskey collection for sale.  


I've been hiding this from everyone, but I don't want to live like this anymore.  I will not drink with you today.",59,1

I have to admit, it was very tough. I'd walk by all the hotel bars and could definitely see myself getting belly up and having five or six bourbons..next morning get the mimosa or beer at breakfast...but not this time.

I almost broke to be honest.  We were at an outdoor lunch beer garden place. I ordered a diet coke with lime while I debated it.  A short while later my daughter started crying and we had to leave.  Looking back it would have been terrible to lose my streak, currently at 92 days, just for a few sips of beer, whiskey, whatever.

One year ago I woke up hung over from a Halloween party where I blacked out due to drinking the one thing I knew I shouldn't...tequila. The worst part was my kids were with me at this party. 

My 13 year old daughter had to see the worst side of alcohol and was not impressed with me at all. I knew an apology wasn't going to cut it, so I made the biggest promise I'd ever made to her and my son, that I would stay away from alcohol for a whole year. 

I isolated myself through the holidays knowing I needed to take myself out of the picture to adjust to this new normal. I got really into Christmas for a change. Lots of decorating, baking, and movies! 

Once New Years came I was able to go out on the town and enjoyed being the DD. I thought maybe it'd be ok to start hanging out again but still sober, then my dad got serious health issues. 

My dad hadn't taken care of his Parkinsons and had to be admitted into care. He spent January and February in the hospital and in physical therapy while I ran around getting power of attorney, cleaning out his house, signing him up for Medicaid, getting him into assisted living and an array of other shit while being a single mom. I am so thankful I was not drinking through this. I also quit cigarettes Sep. 2019 and am so grateful I didn't have smokes and booze in the back of my mind through all this. 

Finally on March 1st I got him into assisted living and then right when I thought I could take a breather, Covid panic really started to settle in and then the day after my birthday, quarantine began. 

Many of you can probably appreciate how thankful I am that I didn't desire alcohol by this point. I felt the feelings, and I took care of myself. I wasn't at home drinking myself stupid. I couldn't relate to the memes about wine drunk mom teaching her kids at home. 

When it got nicer out, I was nervous about doing all the things I love while sober. How was I going to go camping or kayaking without a cooler full of beer? Turns out, doing those things sober made them that much more rich and vibrant. I love setting up camp and nesting my area rather than being annoyed and setting things up quickly because I'm waiting to sit down and drink. 

This was about the time I started to really notice my brain chemistry changing. I wasn't as snappy. I wasn't as irritated. I remembered so many things. I wasn't repeating stories. I genuinely felt happier. I had already seen the physical effects from losing weight and pooping normally, but my mind seemed so much more clear. 

I began to look into facts that I hadn't known. Everything from alcohol making you produce more cortisol that stresses you out, to it being a carcinogen to every organ in your body. I wasn't even missing alcohol in the slightest 

As the summer went on I cut off toxic people from my life, watched my dad suffer from being locked into his new home. I went through all this political nonsense, Covid, and watching the world be burned to the ground. I sipped my La Croix and tried to find positivity where I could. 

My challenge to myself ends today. I couldn't have chosen a better year to quit. But this whole experience does make me wish I quit sooner. I thought a year ago I'd be racing out to buy a bottle of wine today because that's how alcohol makes you think. But I've come to love my alcohol free life. I have so much money saved and so much more to show for myself. 

I don't want to go back to a version of me that is numb. I will not drink with you tonight.",2271,3

I know this is a common post and probably not a huge milestone for some. I just hit one week sober for the first time in at least 6 or so years. The first 3 days were rough. Constant cravings, trouble sleeping at night, and the sweats. Day 4 stared the repair process. By day 6 and 7 I feel fantastic! I sleep great, my energy levels are through the roof, no more cravings (so far), and my skin is a lot healthier which I didn't expect. This past weekend I was extremely productive for a change. We had family over for the kids to paint pumpkins and I entertained them for hours. The next day I mowed my mother in laws yard then came home and did drywall work on a bathroom remodel. I never would have had the energy for that before and would have started drinking to ""wind down"". 

I want to thank this sub. Anytime I had a craving or trouble sleeping I would pull up this sub and read others  stories. It kept me inspired and felt like I wasn't alone. I feel like a new person and can't wait to be a better father to my son by setting an example. To anyone lurking like I was and battling quiting, you can do this and you are not alone.

I made it several times during my year and a half of sobriety, but I feel *sneaky* as I'm getting ready to cook it again.  I only need a half cup, but ""oh look, the grocery store doesn't sell those tiny bottles individually anymore, they come in four-packs that are more expensive than the cheapest regular-sized bottle of white wine.  Might as well get that and pour the rest down the drain.""  At least that's my thought process.  It was also my thought process when I made risotto 15 days ago too and that turned out...poorly.  Medication and lengthy sobriety had whittled my tolerance to 0, and I was sick for a day and a half on two-thirds of a bottle of very cheap, very strong white wine.  It was never my poison of choice, but any port in a storm, right?

I went shopping at 6 this morning to beat the crowds, but forgot the cream and couldn't buy the wine because it wasn't 7 yet, so I guess I'll go later.  Really hoping the other grocery store has the tiny bottles or I'm going to slip again.  (Is it a slip if you plan it out in advance?)

My stomach hurts just thinking about it and the part of me that doesn't want to feel like crap is shouting at me.  I'm not sure what I hope to find other than a short break from stress and fear.

I've reclaimed my weekends. No more laying around hungover and in misery. 

I've reclaimed a part of myself that feels sharper. It's hard to explain....I feel less of a fog, and week before last when I was doing weapons qualification with my national guard unit, I actually shot the M4 half decent, zeroed on my first attempt, and I felt myself grasp the fundamentals in a way I hadn't since before I turned 21 (8.5-9 years ago).  There's a lot of ways I feel sharper that I can't really explain but these are examples. 

The downside is that I am feeling things more intensely,  two bereavements, covid stress, my anxiety.  I've noticed myself having a shorter fuse than normal, and I think that's due to all the emotions I'm just now processing...the ones I tried to drown with booze.  I think once I've processed everything I'll be out of this hole for good. 

I've felt the desire for beer, but I very easily suppress it long enough to get home and hit up a gaming friend online that has been there for me and knows what I'm going through.

The first 10 days were hour-by-hour, the first 100 days day-by-day. The second 100 had their ups-and-downs. And now not drinking is just normal. 

I thought this anniversary would be a good chance to offer some words of encouragement to those who think they're too far gone - as I did when I began this journey. 

I was a heavy drinker, daily, for 20 years straight. A couple of beers and two bottles of wine a night. I used alcohol to hide my depression and anxiety. I tried to quit once or twice, but never lasted more than a month.

I decided I'd had enough late last year and threw the last of the wine away on December 29. It was a rough few days, but nothing too extreme - headaches, super anxiety and a craving or two, but it eased.

I don't have any family or any friends (my drinking drove them all away) so had to do it by myself. I live in a small country town, so AA and the like wasn't an option.

But I made it here. I'm still too scared to go to the doctor, fearing what they might find after two decades of abuse. But I still going.

For those who don't know how they'll do it, trust yourself. Do it for yourself. And remember, someone always has it worse.

Drinking destroyed my 20 year relationship, and we had a 7 year old son at the time. It all ended 21 months ago.

I'm struggling to accept it all, still. I look back now and I can clearly see how I neglected her, how drinking was everything.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

**This pledge is a statement of intent**. Today we don't set out **trying** not to drink, we make a conscious decision **not to drink**. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't**: A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

For today, I want to talk about the maze of recovery.

When I entered rehab and started going through the daily routine, one thing that kept sticking out was the reference to a Higher Power/God and my body pretty much went on alert. I'm Agnostic, but I lean Atheist. I've been comfortable with this for 15 years. I earnestly tried giving A.A. a shot, to be honest, it was the only thing I knew of regarding recovery and even then, those ideas were formed from TV shows and Movies. Soon, I just knew it wasn't for me. We had a ""motivational"" speaker who pretty such said if you don't have a higher power you're doomed and the ""We Agnostics"" chapter in The Big Book was oozing with judgement.  Not to mention, even though I had plenty of staff talk to me and tell me Higher Power =/= God, it‚Äôs hard to believe that when God is referenced in The Big Book about 400 times.

I didn't know where to go from there and I felt like I ***had*** to do something because I was told over and over that I couldn't just believe in myself because I wouldn't be here (rehab) if I just believed I could do it.  They weren't wrong, but at the same time, it just didn't sit right with me. I had to figure this out or I was going to be at a standstill for the rest of my time in rehab.

There was one video that ended up impacting me heavily. It was a [TEDx Talk by Michael Brody-Waite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUnRKf2CemA) and in this, he mentioned three key principles he lives his life by:

1. **Practice rigorous authenticity**
2. **Surrender the outcome**
3. **Do the uncomfortable work**

I don't know why it stuck with me, but everyday I thought about it. In the 30 years I have been alive, I had done none of this. I saw myself through others eyes, I tried to control as much as I could due to fear, and I shied away from sticking up for myself and taking accountability when I needed to. Crazy idea...what if I just...I don't know...started doing those things? As my clean time stacked up and I was taking my medications regularly, I found my confidence and self-esteem growing as well. My mental health was becoming balanced and the ability to live by these principles were starting to become easy. With that, I began to (respectfully) challenge everyone who continuously said I needed to find strength in something other than myself. While I couldn't stop myself before I hit rock bottom, my life was significantly different now. I spent 45 days in rehab and during that time, I was rigorously authentic with myself in that I left no stone unturned. I surrendered the outcome when I set my boundaries and began to enforce them. I did the uncomfortable work by bringing **ALL** of my destructive behavior to light and actively working on it. I also did find a [Twelve Step ""Program""](https://www.amazon.com/Staying-Sober-Without-God-Alcoholism-ebook/dp/B07MBVCS29) that I resonated with. With all these tools, I finally felt comfortable I had found the right path.

So, what's my point? **For those who struggle in trying to find what works for them, realize that there is no blueprint for recovery and what works for some, may not work for you. Most importantly, do not compare your progress to others.** I kept asking myself why couldn't I just ""get it"" but then I began to view recovery as a sentient and ever changing maze. Even if someone gives you a map that leads you straight to the exit, there could be other paths that gets you to the same place. My map I was given had the A.A. path and while this map helped many others, this path had a wall that I couldn't get through. I had to accept that this well traveled path was not for me and explore other areas. I'm at peace with that and happy where I'm at in my recovery. Don't lose hope if you're feeling stuck, we've all been there.

Today, my question for you is: **What were your preconceived notions of recovery before you actually dived in and how did you fight them? What has eventually worked for you?**

*I'm giving y'all* ***TWO*** *songs for today. I realize that not everyone on this subreddit may have a long clean time and I want to recognize those people who may just be starting or have slipped and jumping back in. The first song is ""*[Sunday Best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_83KqwEEGw4)*"" by Surfaces. I heard this song on the radio in rehab and while it's simple, the lyrics are exactly what you need to hear when you feel like you failed or just feeling rough. The second song is ""*[Bounce Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXZCtuyGP04)*"" by Big Sean. For me, it's just a good song to vibe to when you need to pumped up after a rough day.*

*Please feel free to share a song that hit home for you, I‚Äôd love to expand my recovery playlist and of course,* ***just for today I am not drinking.***",84,0

I got really hard into drinking after years of binging two years ago at 22. I knew in my first bout of AA I didn‚Äôt have a choice of balancing drinking, but the life stressors of living with a racist roommate made it unbearable for recovery for me. I know it‚Äôs an excuse in retrospect. I moved out of  ew England to be with my father‚Äôs family, and found out after ten years he was a functioning alcoholic. It broke my heart. I was coming off two DUI‚Äôs in three weeks from a manic episode, and wanted the escape, but it was misplaced. A year later, I‚Äôm back in the same state with the same feelings. My best friend birthday is tomorrow, and i intend despite the first meeting i‚Äôm attending after all this time tomorrow to drink to be transparent. I‚Äôm okay with it after all this time since my friend has been super supportive prior, and I want to watch over her. I know I couldn‚Äôt possibly excuse her full day of drinking with waters, but i‚Äôll try to space mine. I‚Äôm just so scared to go sober. I don‚Äôt get the shakes yet, I had them last time I tried to stop, but I don‚Äôt know where else to turn for a support network. Other subs get toxic and I just want support with understanding. I want this bad, and I just want people to talk to that understand. I pray that someone sees this, please help me. I don‚Äôt want to lose what I have.",4,0

Since my early teens I may have gone more than a month a few times. I'm 40 now and this is something different. This is the first time I'm adapting to a non-drinking lifestyle rather than just delaying drinking for a bit. 

But... Now what? I'm facing reality more and more. I live in a high COL in area, without the skills or job to justify living here. I pushed away friends, relationship, and family. I actually get along with people fine but didn't want to inflict my alcoholism on others, or put anything before my drinking either. 

So, I'm alone with decades of regret during a non-optimal time to meet people or start over. I didn't feel alone when I was drinking, because I was occupied by drinking, but I feel more alone as my sobriety stretches on.

Probably 4 nights a week on average, with rarely more than one day of sobriety between sessions. Last year I was thinking and realized my longest stretch had been 5 days. And quite a bit in volume as well. Finishing a fifth of vodka or 12-16 ice beers was par for a night. I never really had any issues with horrible hangovers. Sometimes nothing would happen at all.
Then a few months ago, kind of suddenly, my hangovers became accompanied by horrid levels of depression and anxiety. It doesn‚Äôt start immediately, it usually begins when my bac (i have a breathalyzer) hits zero. It‚Äôs so bad all i can do is walk outside all night. If i stop the panic hits too hard. And even when the anxiety dies off, the depression is still there. Last night i walked 35,000 steps. Which is about 17 miles.

After this happening a few times (i guess i‚Äôm a glutton for punishment) i think i have to say goodbye to alcohol. My options are to either stop forever, or drink forever with no off days, and that‚Äôs a pretty easy choice.
And I remember thinking, very early Saturday morning, right before passing out, that I wasn‚Äôt even having a great time. That the next day i‚Äôd be trapped in a crappy situation for nothing.

Still emotionally numb and like an empty vessel at the moment. It's as if I'm a shadow of my former self right now. Although to be fair I've been feeling blue for years even before I knew what alcohol was (I'm 22 years old). It's worth noting, however, I went on a three-day bender the last time I drank. Could that be one of the reasons the positive effects of sobriety haven't fully kicked in for me yet? 

Depression and anxiety could also be playing a pivotal role in my current stance, but I'd need a qualified professional to assess said issues and reach an informed conclusion. I don't wanna assume my mental state and throw terms around loosely. Labels, self-fulfilling prophecy etc and all.

I had some bloods tested for a non-liver or alcohol related reason.

Turns out that the doctors tested my GGT levels (as well as my initial issue) and they said that they were double what they were supposed to be üò≥

Although the doctor said my levels weren‚Äôt ‚Äúalarmingly high‚Äù and that I needed to take a break from drinking, I took it as a big wake up call to quit alcohol and to take better care of my health and body. Drinking affects so many aspects of my life negatively, and I couldn‚Äôt think of a better time to stop and reflect on that.

I‚Äôm 2 weeks in to no drinking, and to be honest I‚Äôm really enjoying it! In particular, how I feel about myself and my body. My anxiety is way down, exercise is a lot easier (and more frequent!) and had some really good sleeps. This is the best I‚Äôve felt in years (I‚Äôm 28 btw, started drinking at 16).

Week 1 was tough, and a few nights ago I went out and had a 0% beer (which was surprisingly good!). I‚Äôm completely happy with this substitute and had no urge to have a proper beer at the time. I‚Äôve been in a couple of situations where drinking was involved, and in habit I was going to have a drink but stopped myself and had non-alcoholic drinks instead. I walked away with my head high and happy with my decision.

I just wanted to share this for anybody who might be thinking or talking about their drinking habits. A simple blood test has changed my life, and probably for the best.

Just wondering if there‚Äôs any good stories of people who have successfully reduced how much they drink and now have a healthy balance? 

I drink too much, I know that and once I start I find it difficult to stop. I‚Äôve started not drinking on Monday and Tuesday and on the Wednesday and only allowed 3 drinks, a beer when I get home and a couple of wines when cooking/eating dinner. 

I‚Äôve still gotta get on top of the Thurs/Fri/Sat/Sun because I don‚Äôt have any real limits and end up wasting days feeling like crap, less exercise, eating worse, you know the story. 

Problem is I do enjoy a drink to relax and it certainly helped with stress and parenting (got two crazy boys lol) and sometimes a glass of red just helps you get thru the mental evening. 

I‚Äôd ideally like to find a nice healthy balance where I can enjoy a beer or a wine or two and it doesn‚Äôt have a huge impact on the rest of my life but don‚Äôt see much discussion around this, it‚Äôs usually all or nothing.

Long time lurker, even posted on an old account at the beginning of the year. Well, I am back at yet another day one. Looking for your infinite wisdom :)

With everything that's going on with COVID, I feel like alcohol drinking went sideways for me in the past few months. I am on a very slippery slope at the moment. 

I know I can stop, I have done it in the past for long stretches of time. However, after awhile I tell myself : you got this, just moderate. Right ? No. I know for a fact it is impossible for me to moderate. 

My body has been sending me signs too. My right side (liver I guess) hurts when I drink, it wasn't like that before. I'm pretty big on the ""listen to your body"" too and for obvious reasons, I don't listen to that particular signal.

What is the worst is that I'm actually scared to stop. That life will get boring you know. Hanging out with friends and not drink with them ? Boring. No drinking on a vacation at the beach ? Boring. Reward after a hard day or week ? Nope can't do that anymore. It's like I have to let go of many things.

I know what I have to do. Question is  : can I do it ? Let's find out.

Some days are hard. Some days I come close to messing up. But ... just taking it one day at a time and remembering that, when \*wine-o-clock\* rolls around and my head starts messing with me, the truth is that moderation is not possible for me. My old habits are too deeply engrained; one drink turns into two bottles. 

The positive: waking up with no hangover feels good. It feels good to not wake up with the 2 am sweats. It feels good not hiding empty bottles from my kids, or lying to my coworkers or clients. Even though, for so many years, I tried to escape from my stresses with alcohol.... because dealing with my stuff felt overwhelming and I just wanted to numb out.... that escapism just created more problems. 

Learning how to deal with my stresses, my emotions, my life... it is challenging. But that challenge is a hell of a lot better than waking up feeling hung with even more challenges piled up.

20 days isn't that long, on paper. But I am proud of it.

One example is that I normally keep to myself, and don‚Äôt enjoy small talk with people, not even my family members. But people have been talking to me either in person, through text, or over the phone. And I‚Äôm thinking to myself, ‚ÄúWhy are you talking to me?‚Äù

I‚Äôve been drinking too much for the past few years, and definitely ramped up after the coronavirus lockdowns started.

I would drink to try and feel better about my life, rather than trying to make my life better. That‚Äôs a doomed routine. And it‚Äôs getting extremely, extremely old. 

Anyway, to help keep myself accountable, here are some reminders of things I won‚Äôt miss:

‚Ä¢ Spending way too much money on alcohol 
‚Ä¢ Nervously checking my texts, social media, etc. the next morning to make sure I didn‚Äôt say anything terrible 
‚Ä¢ Way too many mornings feeling nauseous, headachey, dehydrated, puffy, and generally hungover/ill 
‚Ä¢ Being cranky about having to wait until after errands, meetings, etc. to start drinking 
‚Ä¢ Constant anxiety about where the next drink would come from and having ‚Äúenough for the day‚Äù 
‚Ä¢ Constant guilt over how I was treating my body 

On one hand, the prospect of not drinking is definitely daunting and stressful: it‚Äôs a major unknown! I‚Äôve been leaning on this stupid crutch for years, and I know standing up straight is going to be challenging and uncomfortable as hell, especially in these initial stages.

Have had weddings, office happy hours, bachelor parties, all the holidays, celebrations and sad times, even dealt with all of corona sober.

I knew the big test would be one day a serious death in the family. It happened. Unexpected, young, and no answers to why.

This was about 4 weeks ago. I did not drink when the news came, I could have, was alone, no one would have cared.

I did not drink at the wake/funeral. I could have, everyone had flasks,  even one of my family members knew I was sober but said who cares because its hard time. 

I did not drink when I pulled my car over the other day to park and cry my eyes out, and happened to be parked right near a liquor store.

I did not drink when my anxiety that I had for 15 years and was my main reason for drinking, came back after not being around since the week I stopped drinking. 

Drinking in any of these situations I figured would happen at some point maybe when I am older and have been sober for awhile. Like if I was in a nursing home and 80 and said who cares at this point.

Did not have a drink and am able to properly deal with my grief, but most of all, I can be FUCKING reliable. I am not a drunk in the corner of my room, throwing up, someone needs to pick me up, drop me off, having anxiety aka withdrawals, missing out helping with the family because I am at the bar, liquor store, back room drinking alone, etc etc.

When bad things happen, turning to the drink is the most cowardly act we can do. It is an excuse and we use that trauma/death/horror as a happy excuse to drink.

i was a really good kid in high school and it wasn‚Äôt until college that i began drinking. it was just your regular, college-age drinking at parties and tailgates, although to be honest i partied quite a bit. it wasn‚Äôt until 4 years ago, when i started working at a restaurant, that my drinking started to get really out of hand. i was drinking pretty much every night of the week; it was typical for all my coworkers to get a drink and maybe go out after work. i have always preferred smoking weed to drinking, and while i have outwardly acknowledged this, i would still continue to drink and very heavily, i might add. almost every night of drinking i ended up binging and totally blacking out, waking up feeling so shitty. my roommate at the time would often just suggest for us to go out to breakfast and get mimosas, which i always agreed to. at one point i was so depressed during my last year of college that i drank a bottle of wine every night. 

it has been within these past 4 years that drinking has resulted in some of the worst mistakes of my life. i‚Äôve slept with people i never would have wanted to sleep with, and had no recollection of it, and for me that is just so scary and disturbing. i‚Äôve run away from all my friends, finding somewhere to ‚Äúhide‚Äù and fall asleep and have had cops take me home because i was sleeping on the street. i had my car stolen because i was drunk sleeping in my car in a bad part of town with the doors unlocked. last year i was arrested because i tried to attacked a cop while intoxicated. i‚Äôve forced my friends and even my own father to take care of me because i‚Äôve been so drunk i can‚Äôt walk. 2 weeks ago i went on a roadtrip with my friends and while in vegas i left my friends to go with some random guy to his hotel, wasn‚Äôt answering my phone, and i of course have no recollection of any of this and was totally blacked out. the only reason my friends found me was because i share my location with them. 

it‚Äôs so scary and i swear every morning after drinking i feel so shitty about myself and who i am when i drink.
literally woke up today at my friends house so hungover and sad and i just have to ask myself why i keep putting myself through this. i want to stop but i also feel like my social life will take a hit. almost everyone in my life drinks. i want people to respect my decision and not question me. but i so easily to succumb to peer pressure. this is like the 6th time i‚Äôve tried to give up alcohol. i‚Äôm hoping this subreddit will help!!!! thanks for listening",8,0

For the last year when ever my wife and I go to my parents house I drink, and get too drunk to drive. She fucking hates this, and she isn't afraid to say it either. This happens every 3 or 4 weeks. rinse, repeat. well, my drinking days have finally come to an end. I physically just can't do it anymore. I'm doing and saying things that aren't even lies (they are, but not at the same time? I don't know how to explain this.)  because they're so farfetched. They're borderline ludicrous by my standards anyway. 

This last Tuesday my wife and I went to my moms house and I proceed to get a cool drunk on, nothing crazy just a normal night at my parents house. Dinner, talking, laughs and good times. Well my wife drives us home and she goes to bed, a little pissed that I got drunk at my parents again, but still not in such a bad mood that it effected her too much. Well she goes to bed, and I wait until about 1am to go walk to the gas station and pick up some beer and proceed to just get absolutely obliterated. I didn't throw away my trash and passed out on the couch to save my wife from my incessant drunk snoring. Thinking I did the right thing, I thought all was well. Guess how that went. Apparently I had promised my wife that i was NOT going to do exactly what I did do and she tells me how pissed off she is that next morning. 

Wednesday, My mom invites both of us to get lunch with my sister and my grandmother who was in town to visit. we meet at the place and it's right on the beach, awesome views the whole 9. Get some fish tacos. My sister is drinking some white wine, offers me some and it's pretty good so I get a glass myself. My wife gives me the raised eyebrow, and reminds me that I'm driving. Well lunch wraps up and my sister says she has about 4 bottles of this wine at home and we should drink a bottle, and take one down to the beach to watch the sun set. My wife is all for this. She's not going to drink because it's the middle of her work week, but she is always down to watch the sun set on the beach. Welp, I proceed to get smashed per usual. The rest of this is all second hand, from my wife. I only remember bits and pieces of it. Apparently, my wife took a small edible (not enough to really impair her, but enough to take the edge off.) and we race down to the beach. We miss the sunset, but we're all for drinking on the beach at night. I apparently keep going back and forth from the car to where we were on the beach, and I couldn't explain why. Still have no idea why. The edible kicks in for my wife and it's close to the time to take her BC. I apparently volunteered for this mission and I grabbed it. Forgot the water, grabbed that, forgot that I put her BC in my pocket and then when my wife asks me what time it is, I keep telling her it's WAY later than it is. MY wife thinking i'm messing with her, but I'm completely adamant that it's either 11pm or 1am. She starts to have a panic attack, but my sister and her roommate calm her down and let her know it's only 7:30pm. I had my phone in my hand. I even looked at it. I tripped up the hill and fell off the landing to get to the sidewalk. The last thing i remember is having the absolute worse acid reflux I've ever had and taking like 4 tums, and generic prilosec and my wife basically yelling at me to shut up because I was saying ow every time I hiccupped. 

Thursday, I wake up and as completely expected, I'm so hungover and I only slept like 3 or 4 hours. I spend the morning throwing up nothing but water and wine and the tums I took. I couldn't even eat food. I try and sleep some more, and try to rest up enough to go to work. Time comes to get ready and I'm as close as i can get to being functional for work. I can't find my wallet. This is a BIG problem, it has my parking badge, my clock in badge, and another card I use for work in it and all the other things in it. Did I loose it when we were on the beach? Did I leave it at my sisters house? No idea. I figured a way to get into my parking garage and just try and explain to the parking attendant the situation, and hope for the best. Wallet was found, but I'm still hit with the 40 dollar parking ticket. 

After all that, this was the deciding factor in quitting. I've been to much farther lows, but this one cut deeper. I've hurt my wife. I've lost her trust in me with certain things, and I can only fix it with my actions. I'm done drinking, and I'm never touching this shit again.

577,2020-10-25 08:44:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jhsrdx/pointing_at_others/,Pointing at others...,"Years ago I heard a saying about to watch when you are pointing a finger at others...while the index finger points at the person you are complaining about, judging, making fun of, whatever, your three other fingers are pointing back at you.  Basically, the fault we find in others is often what we most dislike about ourself.

Having embarked on this sobriety rollercoaster, I have had a realization...a few weeks before I quit I was having drinks with two friend I haven't seen in almost a year (busy lives, COVID, etc.).  At some point they ask how my relationship with my husband was going.  I talked of all the things that he does that I cannot stand (he is very negative about the world and sometimes goes on hour long rants first thing in the morning about everything that is wrong in the world), and finished by saying that I had lost respect for him.  One finger pointing out, three back at myself...could it be instead that I had lost respect for myself?

So, still pretty new at this alcohol free life, but already I am feeling more respect for myself.  Waking up fresh (and early!  5:30 am today!) and not having to try and remember if I said anything nasty the night before, having energy to accomplish things during the day, realizing that I have more determination than I knew...many different things that are helping me to respect myself more.  

My husband still rants, pretty much every morning about how humanity is failing, and it still drives me nuts (I can't convince him that his ranting is doing nothing to change things, only making the two of us miserable), but at least I am not having to hear it with a blurry head and a nauseous stomach!

578,2020-10-25 08:44:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jhsrbg/going_to_try_to_stop/,Going to try to stop.,"I just joined this sub. Been reading posts for the past couple hours. Daily drinker for too many years. Thing is, I don't like being drunk, but I like drinking. I don't drink to get drunk. I am not a good drunk....and after blacking out one too many times in my early 20's, I decided I wanted to remain ""in control"" when I drink. Problem is, I just drink slowly, and mostly alone at home. I rationalize it because I'm still being productive and getting things done....but, the thought of doing certain tasks without a beer in hand....well, but, how can I do it without a beer? 

I've had more non-drinking days this year than I've had in the last 10 years, but I know my drinking habits are not healthy. I've been examining my relationship with alcohol and know I want to end it, but  it's hard to break a routine. Especially living alone during a pandemic. 

I just like having a beer to sip on; like all day I can sip on beer. Like drink through a 30 pack in two days. It's gross. But if I drink 15 beers over 12 hours, I'm never drunk, because I don't want to be drunk. But I find myself getting really anxious about getting more beer if I'm running low. It's so stupid and I hate it, but that's what it's evolved into. 

Working from home makes it really easy to just sip on beer whenever I want. ""Eh, fuck it"" is usually how it starts. ""It's 2 pm and I've already gotten xyz done today, I deserve a beer."" It's mental, and I feel guilty and weak when I can't go more than one day without a drink.

So, maybe posting on this will help me feel more accountable for my actions. I do better for myself with an audience. I'm tired of hiding my shame and I want to be free from all of it, but I don't think I can do it alone.

Thanks for reading. I'm going to try to not drink today.",2,1

I was hoping I'd have some huge wall of text to tell you guys. I got here just like the rest of you. One day at a time. What helped me stay sober and remain sober has ultimately been r/stopdrinking and the 255K+ people that interact on here in some way everyday. Seriously you guys help a lot! Another huge driving force in my continued sobriety is to practice mindfulness. Being mindful and present has helped me remain sober as well. Some people will have an immediate react first think later response. Choosing to be mindful in these less than perfect situations and reacting with a clear mind has helped me remain sober. Another helpful tip that has kept me off the booze is to ""embrace the suck"". Heck we all know that life isn't all sunshine and rainbows! Some people will have a bad day crawl into a little ball and disappear into a bottle. How does that help anything?? Answer: it doesn't.. on these crappy days it's important to dig deep to the knitty gritty unpleasant area of your soul and say ""I am a beautiful strong person and I deserve love and respect!"" And is it ever a bad day? It's probably more like a bad ten minutes or a bad hour at the most. So ""embracing the suck"" is hard it's an unpleasant thing to do,  it's out of your comfort zone.

589,2020-10-25 05:33:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jhqozn/today_is_my_6_month_point_of_quitting_alcohol/,Today is my 6 month point of quitting alcohol,"It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve posted here but I‚Äôve been lurking in the background since the start of my alcohol free journey. I‚Äôm 32M in the UK. Spent my 20‚Äôs playing rugby (very boozy culture) and in the Army (again very boozy culture). I was always the happy party guy when it came to drinking. I‚Äôd never miss a night out and would often drink until sunrise and then see it as a point of pride that I was able to run a 5 miler with work. I never considered that my drinking was an issue as I felt ‚Äúeverybody did it‚Äù. I‚Äôd go away for months at a time with the Army where I wouldn‚Äôt be able to drink but as soon as I returned, I would be straight back on it and would drink heavier than before. 

I got married at 24 which helped to calm me down but the heavy boozing gradually continued. Getting drunk 4-5 times a week wasn‚Äôt uncommon but I thought nothing of it at the time. 

My drinking was a contributing factor to so many of the bad decisions I have made. Booze fuelled bar fights were standard in my 20s. I‚Äôve woken up in so many strange places with no memory of how I got there, often missing a shoe, a phone or worst case my wallet. A couple of years ago I finally went to hospital with severe stomach pains (which would happen every few months over a period of 8 years). After having a camera down my throat and into my stomach, the doc showed me the damage my drinking had done. My stomach lining had perished and there was lots of blood instead from the excess acid caused by drinking. Even seeing this wasn‚Äôt enough to stop me from boozing. 


In 2018, I decided to leave the Army to travel the world on bicycle having dreamt about doing it for years. My day became focused on moving my body, meeting amazing people and living in nature. My thirst for alcohol wasn‚Äôt gone though. At every opportunity, I would get drunk. Stopping in hostels meant I always had a new crowd to get drunk with. My marriage ended on the bike trip (alcohol was a huge contributing factor). We biked together for the first 6 months but a number of drunk fuelled events (read adultery) on both sides led to our break up.

After the break up, I cycled through S Korea and Japan and enjoyed as much sake and beer as I could afford. I then flew to Alaska and started making my way south. I cycled into major cities like Vancouver, San Francisco, Las Vegas and New Orleans and spent every night in these cities getting wasted. I would party hard with my new found freedom as a single man but it only made me feel unhappy. 

After 505 days on the bike, I decided to return to the UK and put more stability into my life. I returned with a feeling of deep sadness and continued to drink and party with old friends. When Covid started, I found myself with no pubs or bars to go to so instead drank alone at home. My had put on a lot of weight and my stomach problems were back. I knew I had to make a change.

One morning after drinking a couple of bottles of wine during a group zoom chat with friends I decided I‚Äôd had enough. Even though I had put years of energy into being the ‚Äúparty guy‚Äù and ‚Äútop boozer‚Äù I no longer wanted to be that guy. 

I initially quit drinking quietly to myself. Covid lockdown helped as the opportunity to socialise had been taken away from me. Initially, the thought of never enjoying beer garden beers made me question my decision. I couldn‚Äôt imagine socialising without alcohol. I then read This Naked Mind after seeing it recommended in this subreddit and it changed my whole perception on what alcohol meant to me. I thought back to my days in the bike in countries like Malaysia where I had countless sober nights as alcohol wasn‚Äôt available with the hosts I was staying with and I had a better time than any drunk nights. 

The last 6 months of being alcohol free have been the most clear minded of my whole life. Gone are the stomach problems, the poor drunken decisions and the constant hungover feeling. I spend all of my spare time running, cycling, climbing or in the gym. I feel more dependable and stable. 

I‚Äôd like to thank this group for your help. You may not realise it but reading your stories have helped to inspire me to stay sober. 6 months in and I feel no desire to drink ever again. Here‚Äôs to the next 6 months.",158,3

TLDR at bottom. Hi everyone. This sub has been so helpful and wanted to pass on some encouragement and insight for those newly AF and navigating those ‚Äúbig day‚Äù celebrations, especially the holidays around the corner. I have quit drinking in the past‚Äîsober Octobers, no drink November‚Äôs, but found that my relationship with alcohol would always creep into the territory of being unhealthy overtime. 

I know it‚Äôs controversial in this sub about labels around alcoholism, and I‚Äôm one of those people where that ended up being a hinderance for me, so I do want to go on a tangent for a bit if it serves other well. I don‚Äôt consider myself an alcoholic, I never had issues around physical dependency or side effects, and if alcohol wasn‚Äôt in the house, I didn‚Äôt really feel an urge to drink‚Äîout of sight out of mind. That said, because I didn‚Äôt have a lot of the tell-tale signs, I was too slow about taking steps to get my drinking under control. I‚Äôm a very petit person and if I kept up with my other friends, I would always be the drunkest person at the party. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I only had three beers, if I‚Äôm getting drunk, feeling guilt for my actions, and getting hungover the never day‚Äîthat diminishes quality of life. That IS a problem for me. 

So after a particularly messy drunken evening, I just decided that it wasn‚Äôt worth the guessing game any more.. moderation wouldn‚Äôt work for me, and I wasn‚Äôt having fun. I knew that I had to be AF.

And let me tell you. These two months have been phenomenal. It‚Äôs not just the freedom from alcohol, but the freedom from the decisions around drinking themselves‚Äîthere‚Äôs no guessing, there‚Äôs no ‚Äúmaybe just another one‚Äù it‚Äôs clear it‚Äôs concrete and it works for me. 

The main benefit I would say is improvement in stress. By taking away something that was a crutch, I‚Äôve had to face my stress head on‚Äîit‚Äôs hard, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but after about a month I started feel much less ups-and-downs and a better ability to handle acute stressors. Before, I used to only be able to deal with stress on a daily scale (e.g  let me just get through today) but now I feel like I can ‚Äúsee‚Äù my full week and allocate my time and energy much more efficiently,

The other huge benefit is the sheer amount of time I‚Äôve ‚Äúbought back‚Äù by not drinking. No hangovers, less social interactions revolving solely around drinking, no work that I had to put off ok the next day from drinking too much that evening. Even less trips to the UDF for wine. I‚Äôve gained back hours each week.

I‚Äôm still dealing with mental health issues, as everyone is during the pandemic. I still have trouble sleeping (which is one of the main reasons why I would drink before bed). But overall I‚Äôve been much happier and more productive than I‚Äôve been in years.

Despite all those benefits, I was second guessing myself today during my best friends wedding‚Äîreally wanting an excuse to drink and enjoy the festivities in our small group. I told myself I could handle a few drinks, and that getting drunk under these circumstances isn‚Äôt a big deal if I just got back on track. Fortunately, I had the restrained and stayed AF. It is a huge accomplishment at this stage in my journey and I‚Äôm proud to share with you all. You CAN do it‚Äîeven if it takes time. IWNDWYT 

TLDR. Sober two months, labels around ‚Äúalcoholism‚Äù made it difficult for me to commit to AF earlier. Observed Benefits of not drinking: more stable moods, more time and energy. And I made it through my first big challenge of not drinking during my bbf wedding",10,1

Over the summer two raised beds turned into eight, and now we have an awesome collection of different veggie and fruit plants to enjoy. Last night, we noticed that our bok choy has attracted a bit of a slug problem. In order to combat them we decided to make a trap and with the advice of the internet, we are using beer as bait. You know what's cool? I have absolutely zero urge or interest in the two bottles of beer we now have in the house. What a foreign feeling. He told me he purposefully got natty ice in order to quell any temptation (lol), but I can honestly say that I wouldn't be tempted even if it was a fancy craft brew.

I've stopped drinking before with my longest stretch being a year and a half about five years ago, but I kinda felt like I was white knuckling it that time. I'm no longer in my 20s and feel like I've gained some life experience. Since I decided to quit (for good this time), I've lost weight, I no longer wake up in a literal panic because I can't remember the night before, I've got a bit better handle on my anxiety and depression (work in progress), I've picked up a 20 mile a week running habit, learning guitar, my ability to remember things is coming back, I'm a better spouse, a more reliable employee...there are too many positives to list here. I'm not throwing that away for anything, let alone some skunky ass natty ice.

I hit what I thought was rock bottom in June and swore to finally get sober.  And I did well, some days.  Others were harder and I did sneak in a wine cooler or beer or something on occasion. But then I got unexpectedly pregnant in July and chose to have a safe, medical termination at 5 weeks 1 day which was in retrospect, the hardest decision I have ever had to make.  And because of that guilt, I had a bottle of champagne and a few seltzers to forget about everything and then I chose to drive.  Drunk.  And I crashed.  And I'm not going to lie, I totalled my car and I broke my body but I was able to walk away.  So I tried to stay sober again.  But then the arrest came and it showed that my bac they took from the hospital labs showed a level above .15.  That's twice the legal limit.  Twice. The. Legal. Limit.  Because of alcohol.  It is a beast and an addiction and the worst love/hate relationship I've ever had.  Since then, I've had to get a breathalyzer installed in my car and I have to attend outpatient therapy (they also found edibles in my car which is still illegal in my state).  So, it sucks man.  And I'm so sad today.  I've dropped out of school.  The relationship with the father of that pregnancy ended today because he said he thought I'd have a better chance of keeping custody of my two kids if I focus on fixing my broken shit rather than him or us or whatever.  The father of my actual two kids has been patient but he knows my cycles and he knows my battles.  And he wants to shield the kids from my self destruction, which I can't fault him for.  But I'm sad today guys.  I'm so sad and I want nothing more than to crack open that bottle of vodka and just go to town.  And it's hard.  It's so hard and I'm just so sad today.  This is the struggle of addiction and I'm trying so hard to stay sober.  But my god sometimes I just don't want to.  I hate this cycle, I hate alcohol, and I miss my comforting bottle of beast.

I‚Äôve cut back substantially this month. 
I‚Äôve gone 8 days clean and another handful of single alcohol free days. 
The thing is, before making the absolute decision to quit, I had a fairly extensive liquor cabinet. So gradually I finished my favourites, then some less favourite stuff. And finally, yesterday in absolute desperation I drank a straight bottle of vermouth ü§Æ.
It was gross. It tasted bad. I felt pathetically desperate. And it got the job done - I was good and buzzed.
Today I looked at the remainder or my liquor cabinet and it‚Äôs all mixers, schnapps, liqueurs, aperol, ect. 
And I knew I‚Äôd eventually polishing off those bottles - gagging them down just to get that buzz. 

So today I gathered up about 15 bottles and donated them to a sibling, who doesn‚Äôt have a drinking problem, and will use them appropriately and moderately in cocktails.

My house is 100% alcohol free, and I feel fantastic about it. 
I don‚Äôt doubt I‚Äôll have my temptations again, but at least there‚Äôs no bottles sitting on my shelf - convenient and ready to entertain throwing down the hatch.

How could I, whose personality was so wrapped up in booze and bars and getting blind drunk nearly every night, actually stop doing something that was so deeply engrained in me? 

I guess at a certain point it becomes obvious that this thing you do that you supposedly enjoy has become more detrimental to your physical, emotional, and mental health than not doing the thing. With help from this sub and Annie Grace‚Äôs book This Naked Mind, I was finally able to really understand that booze was doing me absolutely no favors. 

The first hours, days, weeks, and months are incredibly difficult. But at some point it just became second nature to not drink. I don‚Äôt miss it at all anymore. I still down seltzer like it‚Äôs going out of style & Polar should hire me as a brand ambassador because I‚Äôve gotten more than one person hooked on it. 

But I don‚Äôt miss the taste of booze, I don‚Äôt miss being so drunk I have barely any control of my actions, I don‚Äôt miss the shame spiral of hurting other people and then drinking even more to escape from reality, and I certainly don‚Äôt miss being hungover. (Honestly, not being hungover never gets old!) 

But, those fears that booze was too deeply ingrained in me to quit permanently? Turns out they were unfounded. It was just one of the many lies that booze told me. 

I‚Äôm still me. A little more reserved in social settings. A lot stronger physically thanks to weightlifting. A lot stronger mentally and emotionally now that booze isn‚Äôt clouding my mind and my judgement. I‚Äôm still not a morning person. I‚Äôm still pretty dang funny. I‚Äôm still all of the things I was, and some things I was not. Just without the insecurities that alcohol brought into my life.

While trying to recollect where I drank the 1.5L, I'm just perplexed because what I had today makes me wonder for what I'm living. Days like these are so horrifying. Shook. About 5L of beer.and 25 cigarettes. God please help me!! I turn forty tomorrow and all I can look forward to is giving the booze up. Nothing else. I'll booze tomorrow as I have to accomodate a few good friends..communicate my new.plans and be sober. Just horrifyingly lame but it is what it is for now. Just hell bent on make it a life of tears and thorns.",11,0

I'm free tomorrow and the day after. This would be a typical drinking session:  

1. Promise myself that I will not shitpost on Whatsapp to friends and family
2. Promise myself that I will not get sick because of drinking way too much

\#1 would fail as always, and then I would feel ashamed again for the next couple of days.  

\#2 would probably succeed, but perhaps also not.

So now I have a free evening, and I feel a bit bored. That's not too bad. The thing is that I remind myself every now and then that the consequence for ordering drinks may look small (I can have a bottle of Bacardi here in 30, 40 minutes), but it really is not. When I would order drinks the exact same evening and shame after would occur that I want to move away from. 

Also, the consequence is always small: If I would order drinks now, then why not again next week?

So I will not order anything. This weekend it feels easy. Even the boredom is not so bad. I'm browsing games and I'm having slow fun. 

I do recognize the trap of buying a bottle 'only for this one time', and I must try to simply not do that in the weeks to come.",4,0

My eyes begin to see previously-concealed forms emerging and becoming clear. 
What is clear to me now is the tragedy of a drunken life not lived to my potential. Yes, there had been bright moments, as if I had turned on a flashlight in the pre-dawn darkness, in one direction or another, seeing a short way ahead of me.
The form of my overall life was undefined in my darkness. But the missing shapes were always filled in by my drunken mind, as if...
I could have, I would have, I should have. I pointed my flashlight here and there,  thinking I could, I will, and I should. For brief life-fulfilling moments I saw and I created the forms of my world. The sights I remember in my journey are those I had trained my flashlight on. But during nearly 40 years of drinking, my batteries were weak and my vision was fading, as if Dawn was Dusk, and the forms around me were never really there. And some, when illuminated, were never fully formed. 
In this past year of sobriety, as dawn Illuminated everything, including those partial forms I did not wish to see, I discovered that I had started my journey willing and able to do anything. Then I proceeded to dim the lights, still claiming my clarity of sight! Instead of a brilliant life, I constructed flashes of brightness surrounded by fantasy and bullshit; But now In the broad daylight I see a landscape littered with unfinished projects, destructive habits and a undisciplined mind.
Oh how I struggled to maintain my illusions, and oh how  I thought It was getting light! It took a lifetime for my sun to set, and my light to dim, but it did.
The rising sun now doesn't negate all the good in the life I passed through in the dark, but certainly shines a light on all the unfulfillable dreams and lost potential, which could only made whole by bullshit. 
Sobriety also illuminates possibilities that I just could not see before. It highlights where action replaces fear, where discipline creates completed dreams, where hope is stronger than the lies of alcohol. I can finally look around and live a life in broad daylight.",8,0

SO before anyone bashes me on taking a trip during this time, know that I was completely careful and responsible with the guidelines of this 2020 situation. BUT drinking on the other hand... I had a huge scare that happened to me which now makes me almost a week sober. But let me start where my drinking habits began..

 I started drinking about 19 years old and I LOVED it in the beginning; to be able to take a drink and completely feel relaxed, powerful, have instant fun at your fingertips anytime of the day was magical. I had the typical early twenties phase, drinking, partying,  meeting new people, it was funnn. It then turned into a bad habit QUICK. I drank for any reason possible. Day off tomorrow? DRINK. Had a ""bad day"" at work, DRINK. Got into a small argument with the  boyfriend, DRINK. Btw I was a closeted, filipino, Christian boy at this time and any chance to rebel or escape was an excuse to DRINK. I started to notice it was getting a bit carried away when I got drunk before Church, it was my Birthday so why not?  No one noticed, just thought I was in a good mood because it was my Birthday.  Moving on a few years with almost a day to day habit of drinking I got a DUI. Young me honestly should've had more than one DUI and thinking about it now im terribly sorry for all those times I drank and drove, oh those many many many times, maybe my parents were praying so hard for me not to get into an accident or even worse kill someone... so thank you Lord for your divine protection. 

Almost there.

I then moved out of California to Hawaii, the island of Maui, where I was born.  When I first moved out here I barely drank. I was purely excited to be here, meet new people, a new job, be with my family, and be with my biological father more often, a NEW life.  Well, it was definitely short lived. I met a guy, well actually I've known him through church and he lives here on Maui and sub story I thought he was straight but he's gay but besides the point he never really drank but now we've been drinking so much together and deep down I feel horrible.  I dont want to rub these habits on him but I did.  We both don't go to church at all anymore, we drink, got into some pills, I started up smoking ganja out here, it basically got worse yet in my eyes more ""fun."" 

Currently:

I am now 32 years old.  A heavy 13 years of my life. I dont regret anything. Not one bit. I knew what I was doing, I knew the choices I took, and yet by some miracle I am here today sharing a piece of my story.  I do believe in a higher power  but as the Bible goes being homosexual blantely states I am going to Hell. Did this fuel my desire to drink? Yes. Did my relationship with my  parent's divorce and new step father inspired me to drink? Definitely.  I can go on and on with these...excuses but at the end of the day it was my choice, and now I am choosing not to drink. I'm not sure how long this will last but I hope and pray it does.

Oh yeah! My Vegas trip. Almost done, sorry lol but thank you reader if you made it this far.

Alright so vegas 2020. Typical drink drink drink, but we were going IN on this trip and it was early in the day already drunk and my friend pulls out some Molly. I've drank and done molly many times before so im like Why Not. We popped 2 pills and it was pure blisssss for a few hours. This is where it happened, I go to sleep and I feel the need to burp, like indigestion? I never felt this way before. I then had the need to throw up so I rush to the bathroom and out came a deep red wine color that came gushing out. I was confused. I never ate anything that color nor did I drink wine... then another vomit the color got a bit lighter. Still feeling out of it and dizzy I just flush the toilet but one last one came out and splashed the toilet with... BLOOD. I was immediately scared yet in awe with how the blood was swirling with the new water, creating something I've never seen for all the times I've thrown up, this was different.  I woke up my bf (still the same church guy we've been dating ALL this time, I Love him) and he insisted on going to the Hospital but I just wanted to sleep and so I did. Thank the Lord once again; for,  another day I woke up. It was only day 3 of my 7 day trip of my trip and I was completely BUMMMMED. I knew my health comes first so everyone agreed I shouldn't drink for the rest of the trip. My anxiety rose but my concern ran deeper.  Still the party ran out and I was there, sober, and feeling alone in all places...VEGAS. 

I can continue with my experience of the last few days but this should be enough.


In Conclusion, loll 

I am now back on Maui, tourists are slowly coming back but im taking this time to reallllly reflect on things. Well, I'm trying to.  Its almost a week coming up and I do feel great, I'm planning on seeing a Doctor (I should have at vegas to be honest) but I tend to care yet not respect my life as you all can tell.  I've been having INTENSE dreams and honestly I picked up a handful of CBD gummies in vegas and its been working wonders with helping me fall asleep and keeping me calm and collected.  If you're still reading this God bless you, if you don't believe in God or anything believe in yourself if you want to make a change. Even if its a simple thought to make a difference in your life at least you thought to do it aha. 

Until then, you.",2,0

My sister is one of the worst alcoholics I've ever seen. She is the definition of a person who has the illness alcoholic. She has been drinking from a young age, we all did back then. As the years went on she has gotten to the point where she would dissappear for days and weeks at a time to the most squalid places to hole up and drink. Recently found her in a condemned house she used to hang out in with a bunch of old hobos. Passed out drunk.. she had been missing 12 days.

Thats just the most recent of hundreds of times she's done this. But the last few weeks have been different. She's spiraling out of control. She has a 13 yr old daughter and 3 yr old son. They barely see her because of her illness and most of the time they're with my father or their father( who is almost just as bad as her.)

Our mother died from the same disease not long ago. Almost 2 years probably. I don't know what to do any more me and my big brother are out of ideas. Proper rehab for her would cost hundreds of thousands we don't have. Insurance covers a couple days in a facility and then your back to it. 

I've been prepared for the news of her death for years just like I was my mother but, i want her so badly to get her shit together and be there for her children. I dont know what to do, i think she's so far gone any intervention wouldn't work, and definitely not alanon.

Does anyone know of any better resources or ideas? I'm quote sure a lot of people have experienced this, bit has anyone been able to pull the other person back from the brink?",4,0

In the initial moment of clarity, I‚Äôve said the same rehearsed line we‚Äôve all used: ‚ÄúThis time is different. I‚Äôm going to do it this time‚Äù. 

Of course later in the evening after a few beers, turns out, not so different.

15 years ago I gave up a three pack/day smoking habit. I started when I was 13 and finally hung it up at 25. I tried and tried and tried to quit, but it was only because I knew I had to, not because I wanted to. One day I woke up and told myself today is the day. I don‚Äôt want to do this anymore, and the feeling of relief was immediate. It was a different kind of feeling. Not will, or determination, or even anger with myself. I had just finally accepted that there‚Äôs life on the other side without cigarettes. Now, I won‚Äôt lie and say that it was easy. It was a mental and physical nightmare for months, but eventually it got easier and now 15 years on, I rarely think about it. I even forget that I used to smoke sometimes.

So on to the point, I‚Äôve been drunk or at least drank some alcohol every day for the last 10+ years I would say. The usual ‚Äúfunctional alcoholic‚Äù lifestyle of the Midwest. Over the last year or so, the mask has started to come off. My cold amber toned friends were starting to really take away my already low ambition. My depression was off the charts, and my family... well they honestly didn‚Äôt really notice that much because I would the the old sneaky trick where one drink in public was two in private. They see me drink 3 beers, but in reality i probably had 10+ ...anyway, I‚Äôm rambling.

Last Sunday I only had two beers left. I drank both of them and instead of planning the usual beer run, that same feeling came over me that I had 15 years ago. I said out loud ‚ÄúWhy are you doing this?‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt have a good answer and here I am on day six of no drinking. Withdrawal has been mild (headaches, a little nausea), and cravings have been manageable.

It is truly refreshing. 

I am in my late 30s and have been abusing alcohol since I was a freshman in high school. Drinking was a rite of passage where I grew up. I never had much confidence in school back then, and my athletic career has just about peaked. So I was not the braniac or the jock. I was just an average kid looking for his identity in high school. That identity eventually became the ‚Äúparty guy.‚Äù I was known for being able to consume large quantities of beer and being the life of the party. 

Fast forward to college, same song, different channel. The party guy who was known for getting drunk and saying and doing dumb stuff (didn‚Äôt seem dumb at the time).

Post college, living in a city, it was a lot of the same, going out drinking Thursday through Saturday, suffering on Sunday/Monday and repeating the cycle the following Thursday. By that point I found that I was drinking alone before going out (liquid courage, I guess) and having a couple more once I got home. As friends grew older, got married, and moved away, there were fewer and fewer drinking buddies. So, I started going to bars by myself and drinking on the couch. 

After grad school, in a demanding/hectic job I didn‚Äôt (and don‚Äôt) enjoy, the drinking became an every night thing. Anything from beer, wine, vodka, whiskey or some combination. I often find myself falling asleep/passing out on the couch. Getting to bed is often considered an accomplishment. When I drink, I smoke cigarettes and eat unhealthy food. I am now at an age where I am concerned for my health with these habits/vices. It‚Äôs not uncommon to wake up with bumps, bruises, scrapes and not really know where they came from. I often have to muscle through hangovers at work, which prevents my best work.

I recognize the above is long winded, and I hope some of you will take the time to read my story. I have given up drinking in the past: Sober Octobers, Dry Januaries (one that led to 100 days), and random breaks when it feels completely necessary. But I always seem to come back to my old ways. I am no longer that ‚Äúfun‚Äù party guy. I am now a lonely, sad, anxious, often depressed guy who leans on alcohol to feel better. I am currently trying to take another extended break. I am not sure if I want to give it up all together, but maybe that‚Äôs just me being naive.",5,0

671,2020-10-24 12:23:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jhbr4z/just_a_rant/,Just a rant.,"Hi everyone, first time poster here.

I'm not really sure where I'm going with this post, but I've been wanting to get some stuff off my chest and put my voice out there about how things have been since I stopped drinking. I come from a family of drinkers, and I've casually drunk since middle school. I always had older friends, so it was easy to get people to buy some for me.

Once I turned 21 my drinking went from a bottle a week to multiple. It was never enough. I would finish more than half a bottle, pass out, then wake up having to buy a new bottle because of the rush of anxiety I would get from knowing that I didn't have enough to get me through the day. This went on for a good 4 years. It's caused me to neglect my relationships with old friends, family, and my own daughter. 

It's been difficult, but I feel like I'm getting to the point where I feel more in control. I got this far before, around a month sober and I let myself get too comfortable and had a drink with my dad. Then before you know it, there I was again on a 5 month binger. This is probably the second time in a good 4-5 years that I've been sober this long. I don't know if I can ever trust myself again to have just one drink.

So here I am, having coffee and will be celebrating my daughter's 6th birthday later today. I may not ever have the strength to confidently say ""No, I don't drink"" but I will at least say IWNDWYT! Thank you ,everyone. Reading all these other stories has really helped a lot with me to process everything.",9,0

Stress is a huge trigger and I was feeling pretty good about myself not drinking. However, the week and karma did not stop with Monday. On Thursday a wildfire flew towards our town and we had to evacuate. An organization that I actively volunteer with wanted to do something nice for me, and sent 3 bottles of wine to where I am staying during the evacuation. So, I‚Äôm stressed from possibly losing my house to a fire, and get rewarded with wine - the poison I am trying to give up! Fortunately, my husband looked at me sternly and said ‚Äúyou are not touching this!‚Äù, so I gifted the wine to the people who have kindly taken us in as a thank you for that. Meanwhile, the friends have very limited wi-if and I forgot to pack my password book, so I couldn‚Äôt check in here to talk myself out of wanting to drink (I‚Äôm logged in on a wi-if only tablet, not my phone).

I went to a very small gathering last night with a few of my wife‚Äôs closest friends. It was my first true challenge of being the only sober one in the group. I‚Äôll admit it was tough. I felt out of place. There were times throughout where I really just wanted to be home in my pajamas away from everyone or worse yet raising a shot glass full of liquor. But I decided to make the best of it and enjoy the night. I engaged in conversation, laughed with others, and frequently hit the delightful cheese and veggie trays. I noticed something though. No matter how hard I tried to appear I was having the time of my life, others noticed that I wasn‚Äôt my typical (drunk) self. I kept getting asked if I was okay. I was told I wasn‚Äôt my normal ‚Äúvibrant‚Äù self. One of my closest friends there even said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this you‚Äù. It was definitely hurtful. I wasn‚Äôt being a fuddy duddy pouting in the corner because I couldn‚Äôt have a drink. I felt I was being my best self considering the circumstances. But I wasn‚Äôt drunk.

There‚Äôs no pounding headache, no regret, no lapse in memory, no guilt from driving while intoxicated, and no wondering if I said or did something stupid. And on top of that, most importantly, my kids saw their dad come home from a gathering sober. I was able to hug them goodnight without the stench of alcohol on my breath.

I did not have fun. Nothing about it was fun. I missed class, hurt my best friend (because I missed plans), disappointed my spouse and on and on. 
Worst of all, I entered a major depression swamp. I literally just wanted to not live anymore and contemplated suicided (I didn‚Äôt have a plan). Fortunately, I‚Äôm slowly wadding out of the swamp now. That was a scary place to be and the scariest experience I‚Äôve had from drinking.

I have realized and admitted I am an alcohol for 5 years now. In 2019 I has a sober streak of 114 days.  At the start of 2020 I hada sober streak of 75.  But I have fallen back. My cycle is entirely predictable:  for 2 weeks I am sober and it is super easy for me. Zero desire to drink. Zero. Then after 14 or 15 days, strong cravings, and I give in. I am an alcoholic, and yet I don't even listen. I keep doing it. Stuck on a 2 week loop.

Please do not say ''well you were sober for 15 days, that's good!"" I really don't wanna hear that. I feel like total crap today because I drank last night, and here is the thing:  just one binge will f\*uck me up for several days, meaning very poor restless sleep, exhaustion, bad mood, etc. 

What triggered me last night? I felt tired and depressed. It's stupid. I also find it really telling that when I make the decision to head to the liquor store, all of a sudden I'm not tired anymore. Adrenaline? Or is it using alcohol to self medicate depression?

So I told myself I would drink enough Scotch to get pretty drunk, and that's it. But I'm AN ALCOHOLIC. I did get drunk, but as you guessed, I went right back out to buy more, but was saved by the fact that it was past 10pm and the liquor stores were closed by then. So right now I am hungover and miserable, but if that liquor store had been open, I would have gotten twice as drunk and been feeling twice as worse.  Moderation is 100% impossible for someone like me. It never ever works, I always want to get more.

So my cycle is so predictable. I want nothing to do with alcohol for 2 weeks now, but then the cravings will return. Will I actually listen?  The problem is not just the cravings though. I need to find a way to be happy and at peace in my life because that is what pushes me to drink in the first place. The booze is a symptom of an unhappy, lonely life.",4,0

I was fighting this bastard since the moment I tried it. The killer was the moment that I tried to really break up with it in 2017, it dug it‚Äôs heals in and did some real damage. Like a jilted ex, it was out for blood. By the time I had reached December of last year, I was unrecognizable to myself. Everyone I knew had lost faith by then. The few friends I had left, along with my family, accepted the reality that I was most likely gone. 

The end of 2019 was the end of hell year. Three failed rehab stays and an ended engagement. I got fired December 10th, too. Corner office that I barely scraped myself together to get at a new firm, gone after just 3 weeks there. I barely scraped up enough confidence and the energy to get the job, it was like putting lipstick on a pig. I landed it though, but was so utterly consumed by the booze, I couldn‚Äôt stay dry more than a week. By day 7 I was secretly drunk by noon in the office, and by day 14 had a seizure attempting to detox because I just couldn‚Äôt stop. The breakup didn‚Äôt help. Who was this person? After the dismissal, a brief rampage yielded me a stay in the drunk tank. My suit laid crumpled and soiled in a bag in some holding cell while I laid on a cement floor in government sweats. Ego death is a hell of a thing. I knew that I couldn‚Äôt get any lower.

I was defeated. I begged and pleaded for some sort relief from this burden that had been consuming me since God knows when. Somewhere on that cement floor: starving, cold, thirsty, ashamed, battered, and disgusted, I realized that the answer is to just walk the fuck away. The battle was over, and I wasn‚Äôt going to fight it anymore. It was time to surrender. Not just the word ‚Äúsurrender‚Äù, vaguely. But the most contrite, accepting, chill surrender. ‚ÄúFuck it‚Äù, I‚Äôm done. Chapter closed. Something clicked, I guess.

737,2020-10-23 18:06:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jgwwwg/i_fcked_up/,I f*cked up.,"Last year, I got really drunk one day.
By myself, at home. How sad? My girlfriend and I were meant to go out that evening, and I was too drunk to make it out of the house. 

Fast forward to yesterday, and now we have a 5 month old.
I went to work, and was in the office by myself. I thought, ‚ÄòI haven‚Äôt seen a friend of mine in a while‚Äô, so we organised lunch. I‚Äôd told my girlfriend that he had asked me if I wanted to go for drinks after work, but I said to her that since she‚Äôd had the baby all day, that I MIGHT (I didn‚Äôt actually confirm whether I was going to go to lunch with my friend) go to lunch with him. 

So I go to said lunch. I had five pints. 
The messages start coming in - what time will you be home? Are you really at work? Etc. 

I didn‚Äôt reply, and for the next 5 hours I kept saying ‚ÄòI‚Äôm on my way.‚Äô The usual bullshit. 

She was and is incensed. There are reams of messages now saying that I‚Äôve ruined everything, that she wants to leave etc etc. 

And rightly so. 

For some context, I stopped drinking for 10 months. 

Over the last 2 months or so, both of us have started to drink a little more. A glass or two of wine in the evenings with dinner, date nights would be a little more, maybe a few beers with lunch. 

The problem is that I did not recognise that this was creeping back. My issue has never been with frequent drinking, but losing all control and binging, just like I did yesterday. 

Her problem is that I lied, I don‚Äôt even think the actual drinking is why she is angry, although when I came home absolutely out of my mind with drunkenness, that certainly became an issue. 

I‚Äôm at a loss as to what to do. 

She‚Äôs my soulmate and I feel that I have totally fucked up here. 

I‚Äôve spent all day apologising and trying to rationalise with myself why I‚Äôve done this. 

I‚Äôve had a family member diagnosed with terminal cancer on Monday which has thrown me into a bit of a crazy head space, but it‚Äôs inexcusable for me to then project that emotion onto her through drink. 

If anyone can help me try to come to a resolution here that would be great, because her thoughts are that it will happen again, whilst I know that it won‚Äôt because I am committed to never drinking again after this. 

Thank you all.",6,0

Smoking copious amount of weed, drinking lotsa coke zero. Last time I reached 3 days I wasn't really into it so I kept at the bottle. This time around I read a couple chapters of ""alcohol lied to me"" and it really helped to put things into perspective. My friend group I physically see is small and we drink every time we get together, so it's going to be weird explaining my lack of alcohol use. I might tell them I'm doing Sober October, No Alcohol November, Drink Free December, and so on. I hate the pressure of not being allowed to drink (I have O.D.D. so that sort of restriction makes me want to do the thing I'm not supposed to do more) so in my head I tell myself if I am out at wing night and I want a beer or wine, then whatever. But I want to be in a place where I just don't care much to do so. I am proud of myself and I hope to keep it up. Ironically I am graduating with a criminology and addictions certificate, so I would also feel like a load of shit dealing with addicts while still in active addiction. Alcohol takes away all of my mental energy from school, makes excuses to not pick up extra shifts at work (I already had a couple of drinks at supper, can't come in for night shift), and is actually making me stupid. I'm 23 and I can feel myself getting dumber, slower to understand things people say, not as witty or quick as I used to be. It's frightening. Then waking up in the morning and spending the day feeling like shit and totally guilty for laying around sick while my partner is working. He hasn't said anything about my drinking, but I fucking fear the day he does, I would be mortified. So I decided to try my darndest at this sober thing again, not my psychiatrists way, not AA's way, but my way. I learnt that my health care covers up to 2g's of a therapist so going to seek one out to maybe help with the process. Bless the good lord I don't have physical withdrawals (yet?), but I've been on tramadol due to a minor day surgery, so maybe that's helping.

Somehow we started making out. Before? Once we got there? I don‚Äôt know. And kept doing so. More beers were involved. I was completely blackout at that point. Ugh. She was kinda maybe soberish? Things kinda just started going downhill, apparently. 

She left. I crashed. Woke up just sick and sick of myself and full of guilt. And that WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED I DONT KNOW panic. Just snippets here and there. Tried to sleep and just rolled around in anxiety. And fear. Add in the Corona concerns and it was just awful. Still is. 

Got some shit done eventually. Got some decent rest. Dragged myself outside for some exercise and social, which was so good for me. Even if I initially didn‚Äôt feel like it. 

Came home to a text from her. She had a decent time but apparently my actions towards the end of the night were off putting. I think I may have gotten a bit too overly affectionate and a bit pushy.

Hi Everyone,

I‚Äôm 35 and stopped drinking a year ago at 34 after after 18 years of heavy drinking. At the same time I quit drinking, I had to quit the antidepressants and other meds I was on. After years and years on them, in combination with the drinking, something happened where I started to have paradoxical reactions that were scary (severe panic attacks, dizziness, dilated pupils, massively high blood pressure, high heart rate, severe persistent dizziness). It has taken a FULL YEAR to feel somewhat normal again. Many months into my sobriety I got in touch with my psychiatrist to try different medications in very small doses, hoping that I would be able to tolerate something and unfortunately the same thing happened sober, I had bad reactions. I mention this because the first inclination is for people to recommend pills (which I totally understand) but that unfortunately do not work for me anymore. I also found psych meds to increase my alcohol cravings. I have had lots of therapy and try to live as healthy of a lifestyle as I can but I feel lost. I don‚Äôt know who I am without the alcohol and pills. I feel almost trapped, which is ironic because for the last 1.5 years that I was using, I was agoraphobic and could barely make it to and from the grocery store. Daily life feels either very boring, depressing or I feel trapped by constant self doubt and rumination. Yes, addiction was miserable but there were long spans of time where I felt happier and more excited about life while using. I didn‚Äôt second guess everything, I travelled, I got on planes. I thought anything was possible!!  How will I ever do it sober? To tell the truth, I would not have stopped if I hadn‚Äôt had the full body and brain breakdown that I did. I get these photo memory reminders on my iPhone from a few years ago and it‚Äôs sad looking at someone who isn‚Äôt there anymore. I really miss the old me a lot. I have no confidence or motivation at all anymore, even if what I had was fake, I miss it so much. I also feel so incredibly behind in life (unmarried, no children). I want a family so much and I‚Äôm running out of time but feeling so stuck in this mental rut.

Have any of you hit a rut like this in sobriety? Depression, anxiety, identity crisis, familiar things not feeling familiar? No imagination? No confidence or motivation? Any tips would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much.",8,0

I‚Äôd like to give you guys my story of where I was, and some improvements I‚Äôve noticed in my life since I quit drinking.","Hi friends! I‚Äôve been lurking here for the better part of a month, while I contemplated (and ultimately decided upon) sobriety for myself. As the title states I want to give you some insight to where I was. 

I like 40s. Like, love them. Yeah, basically some of the shittiest, cheapest booze out there that favors quantity over quality. My normal ‚Äúday‚Äù would go something like this. 

4pm-5pm: Wake up. Feeling very unrested, always hung over, despite me telling myself I was just tired. 

5pm-7pm: Sulk in bed. This is where I spend a ton of my time. I‚Äôve got my small home theater at the foot of my bed. Between it and my phone, I suck myself into the screen, until I pause for...

7pm-8pm: The store run. I had a circuit of three or four gas stations I would alternate between, for a couple different reasons. These gas stations carried the 40s I liked, not all gas stations carry all 40s, and since I actually live in a bougey part of town (predominately white suburbia) I would have to travel further than usual as the closest ones actually carried no 40s at all. Acquire booze. Four 40s. I preferred the ones in plastic bottles as it made my trash bags lighter. I alternated gas stations to avoid consecutive visits, and to also make sure that I would not buy out their stock of my preferred 40. and usually pick up some food on the way home, if I wasn‚Äôt doing uber eats (HUGE money sink, but when you‚Äôre too drunk to drive to get food, this is what you rationalize). I would always get food that would reheat easy or could be eaten cold, because most times on this run I wouldn‚Äôt even have an appetite and only eat about 30% of the food I picked up. Usually pizza, hot chicken, or Jersey Mike‚Äôs. 

8pm-11pm: Try to eat, start to drink. The food gets picked at, usually stored away. I do 90% of my eating and drinking in my bed. After the first few sips, the 40 honestly doesn‚Äôt taste good. But, it‚Äôs my drink of choice because fewer trips to the fridge, despite having one IN MY ROOM, and easier to regulate than liquor. The first 40 eventually goes down and that brings us to...

11pm-?am: ‚ÄúHappy Place‚Äù. I‚Äôve got my buzz now and the 40s taste good through and through. It doesn‚Äôt take me 3 hours per 40 after the first one. But, to make sure it ‚Äúlasts‚Äù I usually smoked some weed somewhere in the middle as it would make me drink slower, as well as fade me out a little more. Lots of video games, some movies, occasional snack/second dinner breaks, usually getting up only to piss. Which I didn‚Äôt do often despite the volume of alcohol consumed because I was so damn dehydrated. Eventually pass out with the morning sun nice and bright at this point. 

Rinse. Repeat. 

After stopping, it took some readjusting to even attempt to get back to a semblance of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. My sleep schedule was fucked. My first couple days of sobriety I would just stay up, and eventually pass out fatigued around 10-11pm, just to wake up at 1am because my body thought I was just taking a nap. The next couple days to follow I would take 50mg of Benadryl in an attempt to help me stay asleep. It worked for the most part, enough to get me waking up early so I would be tired around a normal time. 

I‚Äôve tried to give myself tasks to do during the day. Nothing significant really. Apply to a job here or there (restaurant I worked at closed permanently due to lack of business from covid), go for a walk or mainly disc golf. Gave me exercise, got to enjoy a hobby, and also assimilate myself into an environment in which I drank often to get myself more comfortable being around alcohol while not drinking. This would leave me tired and hungry and I could finally eat and then shower and sleep. Things are beginning to take shape!

Yesterday, I started Zoloft (I made my appointment about the same time I started lurking here). No noticeable effect yet, it will take some time and I‚Äôm okay with that. 

My appetite remains shaky. I try to at least eat three times a day, even if it‚Äôs very little. I‚Äôm hoping this will improve. My sleep is getting better every day. I don‚Äôt need to smoke weed anymore (it gave me bad anxiety anyways). But the most important thing is I finally feel like I‚Äôm regaining control. I have a lot of work to do in a lot of areas of my life, but this step towards sobriety feels like the biggest I‚Äôve taken in years, and I think I‚Äôm ready to stick with it.

And I've told the people closest to me and they're proud of me and everything. So it's all good.

But what do I do with these couple of moments where the thought of ""fuck I need a drink"" just hits me like a freight train? Do they stop coming? Or is it just something I'm going to have to learn to live with now?

I'd get a DUI and be court ordered to AA...but, then I'd go out drinking again.

Prayed to God for help.

I'd be living in a halfway house, and have to go to AA meetings as a requirement to stay there...and I'd go out drinking again.

Prayed to God for help.

Was in jail, and AA would bring meetings inside the jail...would get released and go drinking again.

Prayed once again for God to help me.

A story that relates to my experience:

&#x200B;

**There was a certain man that lived along a river. During a terrible storm, his property began to flood up to his front door.¬†He and his neighbors were visited by the local Fire Department and told to evacuate.**

**When the fire truck came to his house, he said, ""I'm staying. My faith is in God, He will save me."" The truck drove off. The man went inside to pray.**

**And so, the flood rose up to the second-floor windows of the house and the man was then visited by a rescue-boat, and again the man told the rescuers, ""My faith is in God, He will save me."" The boat sped off without him. He went back inside to pray.**

**Finally, with the water level all the way to the top of the house, the man was standing on the peak of¬†his roof, and a helicopter flew over and dropped a rope-ladder down, but the man refused, screaming up to his would-be rescuers, ""My faith is in God, He will save me!"" The helicopter flew off. The man sat on the roof and prayed.** 

**The flood rose, drowning the man.**

**When the man got to heaven, he was furious that God had not saved him from the flood. He said, ""Lord, I strongly declared my faith, confident that you would save me. Why didn't you?""**

**God said, ""I sent you a truck, a boat, and a helicopter!""**

Today, I'm 10 years sober in Alcoholic Anonymous and so glad I grabbed the rope ladder. The people of AA were the ones in the truck, boat, and helicopter. AA just might be the answer to your prayers...your rescue sent from God, or the Universe if you will. I always thought it would come some other way. Something to consider. Best to you!",8,0

It sounds like its a situation of the sibling being an addict and trying to get money by any means necessary to keep their addiction going.  

Reading this made me reflect on my own struggles with addiction and my path to recovery. It's been almost 4 years since my last drink and just thinking back on why I quit I feel weird I guess. I want to say it's because I was drinking myself to death in front of my family. Hearing their pleas and worry in their voices and how my blackout angry rants made them feel. How my brother was scarred of me when I was drinking. And all the other terrible things I did while being drunk. And honestly I think this is part of why I quit drinking hell I know it is. But honestly.... the true reason quitting became so motivational for me was much much more selfish. 

I just couldn't stand going through withdrawal honestly. I was a binge drinker especially during my ""prime"". Hell before I quit drinking I literally told myself I couldn't be an alcoholic because I would go 2 weeks at a time without a drink. I mean.... yea I would drink a 30 pack+ on the weekend by myself and miss work on Mondays sometimes because I was too sick to go to work. But obviously I didn't have a problem right? /s. 

But as my addiction worsened and withdrawal became a thing it really opened my eyes to how drinking in my life was just not going to be sustainable. That and I just couldn't even get a buzz from drinking anymore. I would feel nothing until I was wasted and then would be too drunk to have ""fun"" being drunk anyways. 

So yea... ultimately the not being able to feel that sweet sweet buzz that I was always chasing without getting blackout drunk combined with being sick for days made me start to resent drinking. I guess after all this time I just still weird thinking about it lol. Like I want to say it was for all these noble causes that I quit, (which are definitely many perks of quitting). But the honest to God truth I generally keep to myself is I quit because I just couldn't stand being sick for days after my last drink. Not being able to sleep because my body was so dependent on needing alcohol to sleep. Plus realizing how much anxiety drinking gave me once I had some sober months under me. When I play the tape forward and think about how mentally & physically sick alcohol makes me I just cringe at the thought of consuming it. This has what kept me sober for almost 4 years now. 

So why share this? Honestly I am unsure. I guess when I listen to peoples stories everyone always list reasons not to drink. And they are all good reasons and like I said their is insane number of perks to quitting. But I think at least for me what made it possible for me to quit was focusing on my highest priority my highest motivation to stop. And to me that was not feeling sick and like I was going to die every time I quit drinking. That fear of going through withdrawal again is more motivation than anything I have ever needed to stay sober.

Today, Unlike last year, I was able to go to my annual health exam without worrying that my lab results would be all messed up from drinking heavily the night before. And I told my nurse practitioner that I had made a big decision this week to get my drinking under control. 

Last night, I actually said no to a beer that was offered to me after work and stuck to my plan to have one low-alcohol beer after dinner. To taste, sip, enjoy instead of downing as fast as possible. This makes five days in a row of not getting quickly drunk before dinner. 

Last night I dreamt that I went to a bar and asked for a low alcohol beer to sip. 

Every morning this week I‚Äôve remembered the ending of the TV show we were watching the night before. 

Every morning this week the kitchen has been clean - thank you, not-drunk me from the night before. 

Sunday I told my spouse I was tired of drinking so much every day. The anxiety of even contemplating a change was heavy in the air all day. So that actually gave me a big push to go through with it. 

Over the last year I probably spent more mornings than not thinking ‚Äúugh, I drank too much‚Äù.

June 7, 2020 was a night I shall not forget. It was the night that the universe finally had **enough** of my shit, and worked it's magic to put a stop to it. I'm a firm believer that things happen for a reason, and being arrested was one of them- I hold no regrets towards it, I look at that night as something that needed to happen in order for me to really understand I was on a destructive path. 

Around 1:00 in the morning, I pulled out of the parking lot of the sports bar we were at. Almost immediately after I was on the main road, blue and white lights flicker behind me. I wasn't at a safe spot to stop, just coming off a windy bridge (one of those weird ones to help traffic flow better where you drive on the opposite side of the road and then switch back over). I turned my hazards on to signal that I saw them behind me, slowed down, and looked for a safe place to pull of- it's my biggest pet peeve when people suddenly pull over when being stopped. I was able to make it into an empty parking lot of a car wash. The officer, a woman, walked up to my window and asked the typical ""do you know why I pulled you over"". She then asked if I had been drinking, I didn't lie- I told her I had a few drinks at the bar we were at previously. She asked me to step out of the car and she performed a field sobriety test. Once that was finished, we did the breathalyzer test (yes, i know- you should always refuse the breathalyzer to better your chances when they take your blood- but everything happened so quickly I did not think about it.) 

My breathalyzer read .18 (to preface- the legal limit in America is .08- this was double). The officer looked confused and tried a few more times, each reading close to .18. She seemed as though she did not believe that was correct.. that it was *too high* of a number for me (at the time 98 pounds 24F). She arrested me there and told me they'd conduct another test with my blood to get a more accurate reading. 

I was confident that my blood would come back lower than my breath, I felt fine. Sure I was a little drunk, but not shit-faced by any means. I shared this thought with my therapist, excited that it would be lower. That was, until she informed me, it is not uncommon for heavy drinkers (such as myself) maintain a blood alcohol content above .08 - ""Fuck"" I thought, but still hoping for a better outcome.

My court date happened Tuesday of this week, and I finally got to see the results of my blood test. Turns out my therapist was correct- my blood alcohol content came back at .226 (almost 3x the legal limit). To some, it may seem strange how I was even able to WALK let alone drive my car a mile before getting pulled over (I got pulled over for an incorrect lane change on that windy bridge I was talking about). Even during my field sobriety test, I felt cool, calm, collected for the most part. But holy shit... am I fucked now.",34,0

I recently came to terms with the fact that I'm an alcoholic. It's been a long time coming, and I've mentally juggled with the idea but always ended up convincing myself that I wasn't. I'm able to control myself in situations where it would start being apparent that I'm drinking, or in situations where it would really mess up my day. So I never ever drink on a work night, or when I have something important to do on the day after.

But whenever I have a day off coming, the craving is really intense and I have trouble stopping myself. It's not that big of an issue on normal weeks, but it becomes a huge issue when I'm on multiple days off in a row (like when I have a week, or two, or three off). In these times, I always feel like I need to drink beer in order to really make the day worthwhile. And the only days I end up not drinking in these times, are when I really feel I need the day to recuperate.

So now I'm trying to stop, starting with this weekend. I've convinced myself to not drink, but the craving is really high right now and I keep coming up with excuses to drink tonight and stop drinking starting tomorrow. But it's what I always do. And I'm tired of it. Hopefully I can make it.

Well, it turns out I‚Äôm actually a very light sleeper. I wake up several times a night - my dog‚Äôs snoring, or shuffling around; a particularly vivid dream; car headlights shining through my window; my neighbors playing music at 5:00am. 

But even with all the interruptions, I wake up refreshed. Also I changed my sleep schedule to 10:30pm - 6:30am, and I read a bit before going to sleep. It‚Äôs awesome.

Earlier this week I ended up getting a job doing pools, it wasn‚Äôt the best paying job from what I‚Äôve been paid for before but I really wanted a job to keep me accountable as well as make some money so I‚Äôm not financially stressed. Well, I was told I‚Äôm not a good fit because I have my own little pool route I‚Äôve been building up for a few months, but it‚Äôs just 3 pools, super quick. I told him I could easily do 40 pools Monday-Thursday but I need Fridays off so I could do my own. 
He said he didn‚Äôt like that and he needs someone that can do more, so I said, ‚ÄúI could easily do my pools after, my clients are super flexible with my time because they know i so a fantastic job‚Äù but he said that set a bad precedent and is worried id put my 2 customers in front of his business clients.
So he paid me for the week and then I took off. I got really sad and contemplated buying some beers and liquor at Costco, cried a little on the way because I felt slighted, my thinking was... I only have a week not drinking, so what if I throw that away.
I put on my headphones and walked into Costco and started walking, but then I thought about what that‚Äôs going to do to me mentally, and then I thought about this sub and I chose not to get anything except some strawberries, chips and popcorn. 
I got home, told my gal what happened and she gave me a long embrace and I started feeling better.
Later that night I get a call from one of the guys who was apart of the pool crew and he was really sad I didn‚Äôt get picked up. But he also said he liked my work ethic so much that he has some side jobs he does with pump replacements, heater installments and other handyman jobs that he does as a side hustle and wants me to work with him when he does it. He the. Invited me over for beers and ribs which I declined.
I didn‚Äôt post yesterday morning and it felt weird. But today is a new day, I have my little pool route, then I get to come home and play with my pup and other animals :) Day 8 and I WILL NOT DRINK TODAY!

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hey folks!

&#x200B;

Today I just want to brag about my son. He is 19, and the only child I have, and he was definitely an ""accident"". But I'm so glad I was young and stupid enough to go through with it. Today he is this incredible person. He is thoughtful and caring. He is intelligent and wise beyond his years. And his compassion for others is truly astounding to me sometimes. And somehow he came from me.

&#x200B;

One of the most painful ""bottom"" moments that I had was waking up one morning with bandages on my chin, and finding out that I had fallen down and cracked a flower pot with my face and that my son had been the one to bandage me up. He was understandably upset, and he told me that day that I really needed to stop drinking. That was the day I realized that my problem was a problem for more than just myself. It was affecting others. I said to him that I was so sorry for being such a terrible mom, and he said to me words I will never forget, and will always and forever cherish. He said, ""You're not a bad mom. I honestly think you are the best mom I know. You just drink too much."" His love and grace and compassion towards me in that moment felt so undeserved, but they were a much needed balm for my soul. That will be a year ago on Halloween. I didn't quit that day (Well, I did, but it didn't stick), but it was a real turning point. Coming face to face (or face to flower pot) with how my actions were affecting the person I loved most in the world was devastating. But his love, and his words saved me and let me know that I could come back from this thing, and that I was not irredeemable or unlovable. I just drank too much.

&#x200B;

In the months since I've quit I have shared very openly with him about the work I've done, and how hard it can be, and he's seen me relapse twice, and he's been really receptive and understanding. And he's really grateful to all of you. He knows how much you mean to me and how much you've all helped me. Somehow I did something right when I screwed up and got pregnant at 20. He is now and always will be the thing in my life that I am the most proud of.

&#x200B;

I was starting to worry about losing my job or getting fired.

I'm getting things done, my focus is back and I'm learning fast, my writing is better, I'm not battling sickness all day.

Needless to say, this band brings back a lot of memories of when I was young and seeing them = drinking beer. There‚Äôs almost no way around it - the ‚Äúscene‚Äù isn‚Äôt complete without it. 

So we went. As we walked onto the patio, I looked around to see if *anyone* wasn‚Äôt drinking. No one wasn‚Äôt drinking. When the waiter came to the table, I came so close to ordering a drink, but I didn‚Äôt. I thought about the books I‚Äôve been reading that explain homeostasis, how I didn‚Äôt want to re-set the counter back to day one again, knowing if I had one glass of wine, then I‚Äôd have two, and then come home and probably have a few more.

Reading this board makes me realize I was out of control a long time ago.  I used to think to myself that I was ""only"" clinically an alcoholic, but because everything else in my life was under control I was fine to keep pushing on.  

I was also happy when I drank, never violent, no DUIs (although only by sheer luck).  All of that doesn't even matter--fundamentally I was still poisoning my body.  My hygiene, bleeding mouth, GI issues, excess weight.  There are gaps in my memory that started spanning 3 or 4 days.

One moment its I am alright with you living with us until July (due to covid I have not had a job so I am trying to make my own business) the next its you shouldnt be spending your time on something that wont work out and just get a job. It has put so much stress and doubt on my goals. Maybe I shouldnt go for it since people need help right now...

idk I want to be able to get to a place where my business can hire recovering addicts, mentally disabled workers, or really anyone who has a hard time in this world. It would be a place I feel people can reconnect with what actually matters in this world. I could care less about being rich and in all honesty if I did get rich I would be pissed at myself that I didnt put more into helping others. Everyone in my family worries more about ego and money than other things...

this is just the first time I have had this type of fire in me and courage to want to actually take actions to accomplish it. I just fuck sometimes outside noise really makes it hard to hear your own voices.",14,3

I was 22 then, now 25/m. 

This money would not include weekends or holidays. 

Since The $20 pay was Monday through Friday only, I went through horrid withdrawals every Weekend. 

Multiple Annual Holidays, also had No Pay ($0.00). 

This Routine Drinking had since contributed to horrible consequences. 

I even had many weekend and holiday overnight Hospital stays whenever my parents refused to give me anything after I begged them to avoid these horrifying withdrawals that they were unintentionally contributing towards. 

When $10, even $5 worth of Alcohol would have been infinitely better than no money at all ($0.00).

It was not pleasant in the slightest. 

Since June of this year, I have now politely asked My Parents to please stop paying me $20 every weekday ($100/week) because it was doing far more harm than good.

Back at the end of December I stopped cold turkey and proceeded to go through complete withdrawal. (I also stopped a daily marijuana and tobacco habit four weeks prior to this.)

I feel better than ever now. 

What I can say to anyone setting out on this for the first time is that IT TAKES TIME.

&#x200B;

It took FOUR months for my fingers to even stop twitching and for the full blown-panic attacks to subside. While my physical withdrawal lasted for two weeks (complete insomnia, the shakes, vertigo, horrible anxiety, drenches of sweat, balance issues, dpdr), I had other withdrawal symptoms lasting for months. It was also fueled by high anxiety hypochondriaty that made me think I had every physical illness imaginable. POST ACUTE WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME IS REAL. I am a firm believer that it takes 1-2 years for PAWS to subside.

&#x200B;

I am saying this for the people who might have just stopped and don't feel ""better"" yet that, trust me, its normal. You will feel better. In fact, I  felt leagues better at the 9 month mark and I expect this to continue every month.

&#x200B;

It helps to just think of myself as a ""non-drinker"" now. I don't drink. I'm not a drinker. This gives me nothing to ""beat"" or to ""prove wrong."" I simply just don't drink.

I'd say my wakeup call is when the withdrawals started setting in while I was sleeping (tingly and burning hands, sweats, anxiety, waking up every night between 1 and 3). Well I tried to quit on my own but just couldn't cope with the withdrawals. So I finally told my wife I had a problem, which floored her because i was a closet drinker, minus the few beers I'd drink in public. 

I self referred to the Army's rehab program called SUDCC. That's where the REAL wakeup call happened. My liver enzymes were in the mid 200s and he rushed me to the ER becauae my BP was 190/110. Typical visit: EKG, IV, Ativan. Results were my heart is fine and to take my BP medicine.

But as anyone with anxiety knows, this just makes it worse in the long run.  Like it got to the point where the only time I wasn't anxious was when I had a significant amount of booze in my system, and in between drinking sessions my anxiety was so bad that I could barely sit still.   
 Concentrating on anything for longer than a few minutes was near impossible.  My attention span had drizzled down to next to nothing, and I couldn't even sit through a half hour TV show at this point.

But after 38 days, I feel like I'm finally getting my attention span back.

Quitting drinking has helped my anxiety tremendously along with taking my prescribed medication correctly without interference from all the alcohol, and I've found that my ability to concentrate without my anxiety flaring up has improved dramatically.  Before I was constantly on edge, trying to distract myself from my anxiety whenever I had to sit still for more than three or four minutes.  Now I can comfortably engross myself in a task or watch a TV show/movie without that creeping nervousness setting in.  

It sounds silly but being able to watch an episode of the X-Files from start to finish without having to go on my phone as a distraction feels like a real accomplishment.

This sobriety thing, it's quite enjoyable.

Proud to say today is the start of day 3 for me and I feel better already- not perfect as still have sleep issues and sweating and all that, but already feeling more clear headed and encouraged.

Since it's touching on Hot Cho-co-late time here, and I finally got my kitchen somewhat arranged, offered to make some.

It came out gorgeously.  He took a sip, then apologized.  ""I'm sorry, this is Good, but it would Really Good with some rum.""

""Don't apologize.  You're probably right.  But I'll bet I have something even better than rum to go with.""  Offered him some candied ginger, and told him to take a bite between sips.  

I was right:  candied ginger was better than any alcoholic accelerant that could've been added. 

This weekend, I think I'll start tinkering around with a mulled something other than wine.  The spices will smell so good, and I have the nicest glasses to drink it from.

What was once an enjoyment of the art - craft beer, cocktails - and only done socially has become an unstoppable train. I can't just have one, and there's no respect for the art, for my health, or for those around me. I drink alone. I discretely went through a whole bottle yesterday but continued to work, to cook dinner, and interact with my wife and kids. And they have no idea. I ended the day with a long video conversation with a senior individual at my company with just a couple ounces left in the bottle.

I can rationalize moderated, social drinking. I can't rationalize drinking a hidden bottle a day all by myself. It kills my interest in getting my checklists done, makes me short with my kids and my wife, and in general turns me into an out of control cynic. I shop at different stores around town so the regular cashiers don't think I have a problem. But I do. Until I can do it responsibly, I won't do it at all.

Unfortunately, I have been diagnosed with cirrhosis. I am working through it with my doc, and even though when you read about it you will find that it is supposedly irreversible, my doc, who I believe is a really good doc, thinks that with behavior changes (i.e. no drinking), diet changes, lifestyle changes (i.e. exercise), that we can effectively work through it. I have another appointment with him beginning of December to check progress. I've been doing all those things. 

Now the inspiration part. Knowing that it is supposedly irreversible, I have remained inspired by stories I've heard from people I know personally and also here on this sub about coming through liver/cirrhosis problems successfully. I know the body is quite amazing and resilient, and I'm hoping to become one of those people. 

If you've had an experience with ""beating it"" or at least successfully managing it, I'd love to hear your story.

15. When the crave comes, just sit there, mindlessly. Just as quickly as it comes in, it goes out! Quite miraculous!

16. The Untethered Soul by Michael Singer is teaching me so much about the mind. And that's where it all starts, and ends! Received bad business news of a 2021 contract cancellation- the thought to drink left just as fast as it came in!

17. Sleep not so good but I'm doing it with only a Benadryl. 5 hrs. 33 mins & 69 sleep score last night.

21. Been doing well but notice my thoughts going somewhere unsafe. Up to me to redirect. If I don't, I'll cave. 3 weeks in.

23. Started back up reading The Untethered Soul and wow, what enlightenment. I need this book for this time. Grateful. Sleep was really good last night- 7 hrs 1 min @ 83 sleep score. Stretch of sleep @ 4 hrs 18 mins. Wish I could consistently get a 5 hr stretch.

24. Last time I caved it was Day 24. After 12 days I started over at Day 1. Not going to happen today!

24. Did not cave, but WOW that was tough. The crave pulled at me all day. Trigger- dark gloomy day. Perfect for wine, bed, movies, escape.

25. So it really IS true. The day after you almost drank you are saying, ""I'm SO glad I didn't cave yesterday!""  I have to remember this.

27. Tough day. Why? Rained all day, a little bored, frustrated, discouraged. All triggers. Did not cave though. 

28. 5 hrs 16 mins sleep. Up @ 3 AM. Not a great start. . .

29. Yesterday was tough but I powered through. I guess it is that same desire to ""escape"" for a while. The gloom & rain just exacerbates it.

**30. Thirtieth Day AF.** I've pin-pointed triggers, which is helpful. That driving Need to Escape feeling is the reason I drank and still causes the crave. Learning more about that and different coping mechanisms is this next 30 days' goal. Finish reading The Untethered Soul will be crucial. I don't know if it is important or even feasible that I figure out why the drive to escape is so strong, but I know that if I don't learn how to deal with it in a better way than losing myself in the bottle, I'll never experience freedom.",9,0

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning Sobernauts!

Today I would like to take a minute to appreciate that what we're doing here totally goes against the grain of society. We live in a world where drinking is so incredibly ubiquitous that people find it odd if you  don't do it, and yet here each one of you are today. Every one of you came here today because being a better person means enough to you that you're willing to buck tradition to make it happen. We're here giving the finger to ""mommy wine culture"" and saying, no thanks, I'd rather be present for my children. Throwing off the idea that a cold beer after work with the boys at the bar is just what men do. We're standing against all the advertising and messaging in movies and TV shows that we've been bombarded with our entire lives that tell us life is better with alcohol. And I just want to say, how badass is that? It is really and truly us against the world, guys. And I, for one, am super proud to be standing here with each one of you. You are all so brave just for being here. I hope you really know that. Take a a minute today to appreciate what a renegade you are. And know that I'm honored to stand in this fight with you.

Through the years I feel like it has always brought me down. In my mid twenties I made it through a suicide attempt, I had three close friends pass away and used drinking, partying, and sex as a bandaid. (that obviously didn‚Äôt work) After that I stopped for 6 months got my stuff back together, got into shape, and developed a pretty good mindset. 

This was the beginning of a path I set for myself and I‚Äôve maintained it pretty well. I started drinking again, not anything too crazy but it was always around.......fast forward and I‚Äôm 36 now. I moved to a new state a year and half ago and found myself drinking a bit more, mostly out of boredom. 
I met a woman who drinks more than I and then found myself drinking more with her. We were together from late June until this evening. I can count on one hand the nights we have had no drinks throughout the last four months.

9 days ago I decided that I can‚Äôt let alcohol back into my life this way and decided to take an open ended hiatus from it. It‚Äôs possible I put it down for good but for now it‚Äôs a day at a time and I have no intention of drinking anytime soon. 
Anyway, she was supportive of this and I pointed out the 5 day thing and asked her if she felt she has a problem as she‚Äôs told me she‚Äôs been drinking this way all year. 
Since then she has distanced herself from me and as of tonight that relationship is over. The truth is that I‚Äôm happy that it is done, I completely own the fact that I made the choice to drink more with her but it‚Äôs also hard to be with a partner who drinks heavily when I want to get healthy and happy.

A little backstory: My best friend drove me to the hospital 61 days ago (Aug 23) for alcohol withdrawal. After being transferred to another hospital, I was diagnosed with acute liver failure, alcoholic hepatitis, AND both hepatitis A and B on top of that. They told me that if I kept drinking the way I was, I wouldn't live to see today (October 22nd) (and I'm only 27). I was being pumped full of antibiotics and other drugs to help with withdrawal symptoms. I got transferred to another hospital, where they surgically inserted a stent into my bile duct since my gallbladder was also failing along with my liver. I'm also starting to plan a liver transplant with a team of surgeons. All in all, I spent about a month in the hospital and lost probably 30 pounds due to not being able to eat and constantly puking for that first week. 

Fast forward to now. In order to keep track of my sobriety, my sister has been letting me stay with her. I was finally allowed to get out of her house last week and visit my boyfriend's house to find all the stuff I'd had there was in boxes. I was upset and asked if he was trying to subtly tell me something. He told me no, and I didn't push him further. 

Today, he finally opened up to me and told me that he had no idea what was going to happen, he thought I was going to die, and had my stuff packed up 'just in case'. I kept my cool about it, got home and played with my nephews to keep from crying, but now its sinking in how incredibly sad I am that I put him and my loved ones through that. 

I didn't even realize how sick I was until a couple weeks ago when I was walking up and down my sister's two flights of stairs with ease and thought, ""Nobody even trusted me to use the stairs by myself a month ago because I was so weak they were scared I was going to fall."" Everyone is commenting on how proud they are that I'm eating again and that my jaundice is slowly fading along with my distended belly from how bad my liver was. I'm not 100%, and probably won't be until I get my transplant, but at least my family is finally trusting me enough to let me move back into my apartment tomorrow (hopefully!) 

If you made it this far, thank you for letting me vent and get this all off my chest. Being sober for the first time in almost 10 years is actually a lot better of a feeling than I thought it would be.

Total surprise to me, but only bc I didn't have any clue about symptoms of HT. Eg I chalked my shrinking eyebrows up to just ""shit-that-happens-and-sucks-as-you-get-older."" 

Having spent about 24 of the 36 hours since my diagnosis reading up on HT, I have realized 2 things: 

(1) yeah, I have had a LOT of these symptoms...I just thought it meant I was getting lazy and burnt out on an emotional/moral level; that is probably still PARTLY / MATERIALLY true, but this thyroid shit has been a real issue on a physical level and I never knew. 

In the last month or so, I have had some episodes that were quasi-narcoleptic. Sober, doing work, then wake up realizing you didn't choose to go to sleep but had conked out for 15 hours anyway (again, sober). And being too tired and lethargic to give a shit and just going back to sleep (again, sober).

This has done wonders for my career, as you can imagine.

(2) Jeez, based on what little reading I have done, it seems like I am going to have to learn a lot of shit quick. And none of the ""experts"" agree. So there is T3 and T4...I know those matter, but I don't know why yet. 

REALLY fucking confused about how T2 is going to fit into this. 

I mean, ""Terminator"" was a good movie, but the sequel ""T2"" was..meh. And is a Schwarzenegger flick relevant to my thyroid or not? So many questions.  ; )

BUT, did want to throw ONE post out seeking folks who have dealt with both alcoholism and hypothyroidism at the same time. Bc HT looks scary and shitty as fuck to me on a standalone basis. 

Given the universal shittiness of 2020 that we are all dealing with, and my own alcoholism, I felt I was already playing the game of my life on the ""difficult"" setting. 

Throwing hypothyroidism into the mix makes me feel like the dial just got turned to, ""impossible; no, really impossible; just pack it in; you will lose.""

+++++++

On the flip side,  and more optimistically / productively, I have also had very happy and hopeful moments in the last 36 hours when I have thought, ""if the f'ing difficuly level on a video game makes you not enjoy playing it, you quit playing it. And you pick a different game.

I should have changed a lot about the ""game"" of my life many years ago. That is absolutely true. And I ignored the signs.",3,0

Here is a little quick background of my drinking...

Over a year ago I entered rehab after drinking up to 20 drinks a day after losing my job, losing my family, girlfriend etc...  I was in for 50 days and it was actually an incredible experience. Fast forward 3 months and I was rooming with a good friend I met in rehab in our new apartment that ultimately lead to us drinking again in moderation to start. Us alcoholics all know how that ends up. He fell off the wagon hard and ended up having to go back to rehab while I was hanging on and managing my life to an extent drinking every now and then like everything was going to be ok. 

Fast forward again to early this year when I had a new roommate moved in (non-alcoholic) and we‚Äôve been getting along great! 

I‚Äôve gotten back to a routine in which I‚Äôve drank about 8 drinks a day in which in my experience gets me by, but not enough to be the breaking point of helplessness like I was before that ultimately lead me to rehab. 

I have been stricter in my drinking moderation, and tapering for long enough now that I really feel I‚Äôm right there on the edge of stopping, but just can‚Äôt. It almost feels like a habit to just grab a few after work. Why is that? And what can I do and focus on to finally stop??

I‚Äôm hoping and praying that maybe someone here has experienced something similar. Again, I taper to a specific number of drinks which is considerably better then my previous drinking routine, but can never get to ZERO. What helped the most in getting there?  Thank you all so much in advance. You‚Äôre my family.",6,0

Me: ‚ÄúHi I think you guys have my jacket from last night when could I come collect it?‚Äù 

Club: ‚Äúlost property can be collected between 10pm and 11pm any night and is held for 14 days.‚Äù 

Me: ‚Äúnice thanks.‚Äù 

Club: ‚Äúyou were not so nice last night!‚Äù 

Me: ‚Äúlol sorry I was very drunk‚Äù 

Club: ‚Äúit‚Äôs really not ‚Äúlol‚Äù and it‚Äôs the door staff you should be apologising to. I was just observing. The Manager‚Äù  

How embarrassing. Imagine being such a drunk asshole that a club tells you over messenger the next day! 

I didn‚Äôt reply but do remember the deep burning shame. I didn‚Äôt even ask what had happened but had blacked out many times before and knew I had been a complete asshole. I tried to go back there with my friends a few weeks after but was refused. My nonchalant attitude in my answer shows just how far deep in denial I was and how I couldn‚Äôt face up to my problem. I thought I could just laugh it off. I thought it was all fun and games and a great big funny joke. I like to think I‚Äôm more mature now and whilst this was hard to read (I forgot it had even happened!) I think it shows how far I‚Äôve come - sober for over 18 months and wouldn‚Äôt dream of replying to something like this in that manner now.

I was always proud that for a thin woman I could ‚Äúhold my alcohol‚Äù - or so I thought. One night last week, I finished a bottle of wine and 4 shots of whiskey. After the wine was finished, I decided to record myself for the evening and I was so embarrassed by what I saw in the videos. I normally sing and dance and what I saw in those videos was TERRIBLE. I mean, if you have ever seen the high school reunion episode of It‚Äôs Always Sunny in Philadelphia (the dance), that was essentially me. I recorded AMAZING ideas that I normally would share with a friend in-person or over the phone. I felt so inspired and wanted to capture it. 

I‚Äôm (31, former tech exec) normally polite and well-mannered and the ‚Äúme‚Äù I saw in those videos was frightening. Even more frightening, that ‚Äúme‚Äù (in my videos), is the only image some people have of me if they‚Äôve seen me drunk. 

Whenever I drink, I wake up the next day cringing with apprehension when I pick up to my phone to check call and messaging history. Alcohol puts me in a perpetual fog of dread. 

Last year I was 6 months sober, but this year I have yet to make it a full 30 days. I have gotten to the point where I am drunk at least once/week. The night I recorded those videos, watching them in the sober light of day really woke me up. I haven‚Äôt drank since. I keep telling myself to just get through today, and I kept those videos to look at any time I think about drinking. 

I never saw myself drunk before the videos. I don‚Äôt want me, or anyone else, to see me that way again.

Because of everything, there are a bunch of new people who have no experience working the polls, and I found myself as basically the supervisor of my polling location today with a total of three hours experience under my belt. I was pretty nervous because I'm clearly very inexperienced, but I stepped up to the challenge and tried to recall as much of the training as I could to solve a whole myriad of problems that arose.

At one point, someone asked our actual supervisor at the end of the night where we put a certain stack of papers and I somehow remembered reading earlier that they go in folder #3 of the handbook. I told her where they go while my supervisor was looking up it up himself. One of the other judges told me, ""It's amazing how you can pull that off the top of your head!""

I wanted so badly to tell him it's amazing that anyone would ever say those words to me again.

Me now, one year sober: new apartment with a good cleaning schedule, debt paid off, new job + recent promotion, loving and healthy relationship, absolutely SPOIL and pamper and love the heck out of my cat, all old taxes taken care of, healthy hair and skin, HYDRATED AS FUCK, cooking healthy homemade meals daily, have an actual hygiene routine, always in clean clothes, developing close fulfilling friendships, a closer bond to my family than I‚Äôve ever had, overall well adjusted and stable. 

Dude. Getting sober was the kindest thing I‚Äôve ever done for myself. Of course there were other factors involved in my life improving. Lots of help. Lots of luck. But the help and the luck would‚Äôve been useless had I not taken that first step. Getting sober was step one to opening many of those doors. 

Drinking drained the life out of me. It made me a selfish, directionless, miserable person. I thought I was happy.

As crazy as this sounds, last weekend was my first real social setting where we were around a group of people all drinking.  I was asked if I wanted a beer or wine a couple of times, but I headed things off by having my Yeti mug filled with flavored sparkling water in hand.  Just said, no thanks, I already have a drink.

For whatever reason, I am still not ready to take the plunge of telling people that I am not drinking right now.  Maybe I don't want to deal with the questions. Maybe I want the safety net of being able to drink next time without more questions.  Honestly, I don't really care.  Addiction and rehab experts would probably say I need to do things differently, but again, I don't really care.  I am doing this my way, what works for me!

For me, I was pleased to make it through the event without even having the slightest bit of interest in having a drink.  I don't need their acceptance, questions or praise!  I certainly don't need to be the center of attention for NOT doing something!

I've told a few people and some don't believe me! Oh well, all that matters is that I believe in me. And I will not drink today.

I have joined AA and tonight I am doing my first reading! Yesterday, today and tomorrow. And here it is for anyone who doesn't know it:

There are two days in every week
about which we should not worry,
Two days which should be kept free of fear and apprehension.

One of these days is YESTERDAY,
With its mistakes and cares,
Its faults and blunders,
Its aches and pains.
YESTERDAY has passed forever beyond our control.

All the money in the world cannot bring back YESTERDAY.
We cannot undo a single act we performed;
We cannot erase a single word we said.
YESTERDAY is gone.

The other day we should not worry about is TOMORROW
With its possible adversities, its burdens, its larger promise.
TOMORROW is also beyond our immediate control.

TOMORROW, the sun will rise,
Either in splendor or behind a mask of clouds,
But it will rise.
Until it does, we have no stake in TOMORROW
For it is as yet unborn.

This leaves only one day - TODAY.
Any man can fight the battles of just one day.
It is only when you and I add the burdens of those two awful eternities
- YESTERDAY and TOMORROW -
That we break down.

It is not the experience of TODAY that drives men mad.
It is remorse or bitterness for something which happened YESTERDAY
And the dread of what TOMORROW may bring.

Let us, therefore, live but ONE day at a time

Have a great night or day or afternoon to all of you out there not drinking!

I had plenty of distractions that kept myself from accepting the truth. I hated myself for it, for something I couldn‚Äôt even find the courage to admit to or fully remember. I am learning it is all part of a process, a process we might not like but it is necessary. I hate the cliche of being part of a journey yet I know it is true, how else could we describe sobriety? There are so much imprinted thoughts of abuse in my mind that I know it will take years to heal. 

I have to believe my sobriety is part of a general philosophy, amongst many others, that life will never be as easy going as you wish it to be and you must always fight, and unfortunately for people who believe they are inherently bad will only stay that way unless they are willing to challenge their waking conscious thoughts.

Both of our families have a long history of addiction issues. It's taken being sober my entire pregnancy only to start spiraling a few months after giving birth to realize moderation isn't realistic for me. My fiance supports me and says he'll do everything to help except getting sober himself. I understand. I want him to have that realization moment for himself instead of me forcing him, even though I want to. 

My question is, how can I do this? He says he'll be respectful and not host get-togethers or drink in front of me until I say I can handle it.. but I'm scared of triggers I don't know about yet until they happen. I know this is my own journey, I'm not trying to put my addiction on him at all. I guess I'm just looking for tips to stay strong or any insight at all.",1,0

I used to love sugar-free Redbull and vodka with a slice of lime. This sustained me for years, then I moved on to a cheap Redbull alternative,  Great Value brand powdered energy drink pouches. One of those added to some carbonated sodastream water, 4 ounces of vodka, and we're good to go. 

Well, after I stopped adding the vodka to these drinks, I figured they were ok to have all day long, and I over tripled my intake. They felt like the only thing keeping me going through covid times, even though I was having some trouble holding it all together.

At some point it occurred to me that whatever goes in those mixes, as well as the caffeine, might be what was causing me to be increasingly irritable. 

I quit cold turkey, and while the first few days were hard, a month in, I can definitely say I feel much more level, and on the whole, have more ""energy"" than when i was banging 200 mg of caffeine, taurine, and fuckknows what else a day.

Some days I started right when I woke up, drank until I passed out, then started again in the evening. Some days I wouldn't start until around 4 or 5pm, but that was because when I woke up at noon I was too hungover to drink. I could probably count on one hand the number of days I didn't consume copious amounts of alcohol since March.

I was bored, out of work, but still was able to support myself relatively OK (live with my parents, good unemployment check for a while, + I had some money saved up). I thought, hey, whatever right? I'll apply for jobs every now and then and eventually something will come up to keep me busy again.

But nothing came up immediately, and I started to get very relaxed about applying for jobs (IE: stopped). It was a lot more fun to be in quarantine drunk as hell all day every day instead of doing ""productive things.""

At first I justified it. Saying ""well, we're  still all locked down, so who cares?"" Then came May, June, July, ...etc. I was going through a handle of alcohol every 2-3 days. I was eating like crap because hey, junk food tastes great when you're drunk. Sometimes I only left my bed to use the bathroom. I gained 50 lbs. in 8 months. I noticed something was wrong back in May when riding my bike on what I used to consider ""easy"" rides put me desperately out of breathe. I went on a hike in July and my legs ached from the physical activity for almost a week.

Back in September I said ""enough was enough."" I decided to not go cold-turkey, but cut down some until I eventually stopped (or, well, maybe back to one or two days a month like I used to do). I made it two days. Stuff came up, ya know? Birthdays, that debate, zoom calls with friends. But inbetween then, I still had the bottle of alcohol and nothing else to do. So I went right back to it. By that point I had given up. ""Who cares now.""

I don't know what is giving me the motivation to try again. Maybe it was that I went to the doctor last week and that is where I had learned I had gained 50 lbs. and had borderline high blood pressure. Maybe it's because I know that if I don't stop now, I won't be able to be productive enough to actually look for work, or exercise, or do anything useful.

Thanks for reading. Just telling my story. I never thought I'd become such a full on alcoholic. I used to love being active, going out and seeing things and doing things. I still do. And I will again. I don't think I'm gunna be able to hold off for a long time, but if I do slip up and drink again I will try to maintain the strength and energy to say ""NO"" the next day, and hold off a little bit longer after that.",7,1

My sole regret:  I wish I had quit long ago.  Moderation was an exercise in futility for me.  I realize it now but I didnt want to accept it then.   Believe me, it's a lot easier and more enjoyable to abstain than to moderate.     It was all in my head.

Added bonus:   At a recent physical my doctor noticed my liver enzymes were ticking higher.  Had I been a drinker, my doctor would have very reasonably blamed alcohol, but since alcohol is out of the picture, he had to dig a little.  Turns out I have hemochromatosis, a genetic condition that is easily addressed but is often undiagnosed.   Left untreated it could have caused me serious problems down the road.  Had I kept drinking, I might never have been diagnosed.

I'm sure this has been true for many‚ÄîCOVID has been increasingly hard for me, and I've been having a harder and harder time at work. At this point I can barely focus and I'm so far behind on everything on my to-do list it's laughable. Several weeks ago, I was so actively depressed that I was spending most of the day crying; these days, I'm marginally more functional, but just barely. 

I'm lucky to have a supportive supervisor, but I'm really struggling, and I'm beginning to think that taking a week off would not be a bad idea. I did *just* take vacation last month, so I think I'd have to be very clear with my supervisor/team that I'm doing this for health reasons. I work a 9-5 white-collar job, for context, and my organization supports its employees quite a lot. But I'm feeling pretty guilty about the idea, and feel like I'm making a big deal out of nothing. 

On the other hand, clearly what I'm doing right now isn't working, and I wonder whether taking a solid week to try to heal and get back into balance might be a possible solution.

I know 10 days is pretty lame, but it's still something. I plan not to drink at all untill Halloween.

How am I doing currently? Alcoholic is not the word, but abuser probably is. Been drinking heavily for the past 20 years. I have met only one person in my life who enjoyed drinking more than I did. He was the best man at my wedding. A few months ago he checked into AA and then completely wanished off the face of the earth. No one knows where he is now.

Five years ago I started feeling a pain in my liver. Got scared, stopped drinking, went to see a doctor, got scans, everything fine. Pain went away, slowly got back to the average 20-25 drink weeks (one drink = one 12 oz beer).  The quantity is one problem, the binges are another. This shit goes down in only 2-3 days. This Sunday I had 9 beers, constantly drinking from early afternoon 'till bedtime.

Tried doing Dry Feb this year, failed. Had no alcohol for 27 days but also 2 binges of like 15 beers.

I don't have enough motivation, but I know I have to do this. I will trick myself into it.  Let's go!

EDIT: DAY 1

Boy, if there was ever a day to have a drink, that was yesterday. So many annoying things happened during the evening that I got pushed over the edge and I decided to have a last one and postpone the start of my 10 day challenge... No big deal, I can start tomorrow, right?! From 5 'till 7 I was convinced that I'll go buy beer as soon as the kids were in bed. At 7:30 I went downstairs, opened a ...  can of ice cream (!) and a book. The craving faded a little . I thought ""okay, if I can make it through the next half hour I can probably do this"". I went to the fridge again, saw some radishes. Cleaned and chopped them, sprinkled with salt and got back to reading. Ice cream and radish did the trick, maybe I'm onto something here. The alcohol craving was gone and by 9:30 I was in bed, completely sober. Only 9 more days!

EDIT: DAY 2

It was one million times easier that day 1. I felt very little desire to drink.  Breaking the streak is hard, it seems, should hopefully get easier from now on? Sleep was okay, neither better nor worse than usual. My gut seems to be doing better though (all that yeast is probably clearing out from my system). Pretty uneventful as days go. Happy to have 48 hrs under my belt. Weighed myself, losing 1-2 lbs at the end of this would be nice.

 EDIT : DAYS 3, 4, 5

A Friday and the week-end, toughest part of the week. Bought non alcoholic beer, non alcoholic wine, apple must and a bunch of other sparkling drinks. Only one tough moment, when a friend of mine called, a guy who lives in a different country with whom I usually have a chat over a beer or two or three. The cue was his call, but I didn't act on it, opened a can of non-alcoholic beer and had a nice 45 minute conversation without drinking. I think it might actually have been a deeper and more enjoyable conversation than usual. I still feel a bit of a something in the right side of the abdomen, probably liver but could be pancreas or bowels. It's there when I wake up in the morning and very briefly when I finish a meal. Definitely something a bit off with my digestive system still. Halfway through, I should probably start thinking what to do when the challenge is complete. For now the plan is to watch Deadpool 2 and have 4 beers on Halloween. Can't say I really look forward to that, but I have to reward myself somehow. Very possible that I won't enjoy drinking all that much at that point.

EDIT : DAY 6

This was a tough one because lack of sleep. After a 4 hour night rest my self control is not as strong as it could be. Thought about drinking but changed my mind. Discovered what seems to be a good website promoting a book - [alcoholexplained.com](https://alcoholexplained.com). Learned a bit more about alcohol's effect on the body, understood why I feel energetic after drinking and most mornings after. It's not the alcohol, it's the body's response to a depressant. The brain tries to make up by producing extra activation hormones, essentially.  So what good is then alcohol, exactly? Also started taking 5-HTP, we'll see what this does.",10,0

I‚Äôve cut the booze a few times and gave up for a full 8 months a couple years ago. Been drinking for over 30 years and being from U.K it‚Äôs associated with just about everything social. 
At my worse it‚Äôs was about 3 cans of strong beer a night and probably a 2/3 bottles of wine at weekend. 
Still 3-5 times recommended weekly limit, but not the 24 cans a day of some. The sobriety breaks have helped cut this back a lot and probably twice recommended limit at moment. 
But, it‚Äôs a struggle, to keep it back and I‚Äôm sure you all know, 1 can, turns in to 2...
I don‚Äôt think I have ‚Äúthe alcoholic gene‚Äù, but could see it becoming that way if I carry on. I do definitely have an ‚Äúall in personality‚Äù. As they say, ‚Äúno one sets out to be an alcoholic‚Äù. There has been a couple of cases of alcoholism in my family. 
Anyone recall the point where it went from something like this to a lot more serious?

But when they stopped drinking, those thoughts faded to the background or disappeared entirely. 

I'm finding, however, that when I get a really bad craving‚Äîwhich luckily seems to be on the weekends when my routine isn't as structured‚Äîthe dark thoughts (i.e. ""you're worthless,"" ""you won't cut it,"" ""you're an adult with no coping mechanisms beyond drinking? how pathetic"") come fast and furious, and it's hard to see beyond them.

My longest sober streak is 6 years, 2 months and 11 days. I started drinking after that sober streak because I thought I had alcohol under control. And for seven years, it was under control. But grief does crazy things to a person and it once again became a problem. I realize now that I was a dry drunk, and that drugs and alcohol will always be a problem for me.

I have been trying to quit drinking for about two years now, with not much success. I have strung together quite a few five day streaks for work, a couple week long streaks, but most fail after just a few days. I have read this naked mind, as well as attended meetings and read about why we get addicted. So I am very well aware of the dangers of drinking and why it is bad for me, but also why I get the urges and why it is not easy to quit. The problem is, once I get feeling good, which only takes a day or two, something changes. 

I don‚Äôt argue with myself much, it seems that my brain just flips a switch, usually towards the end of the workday or during a Saturday that‚Äôs going well, and I‚Äôm just in let‚Äôs get drunk mode. It‚Äôs like there isn‚Äôt some internal struggle, my addict brain just takes over and I ignore all that I‚Äôve read, all the mistakes I have made because I drink, what it does to my body and my relationships, it just gets turned off temporarily while my addict gets a pint and drinks it quickly in secret. It‚Äôs so damn frustrating because I don‚Äôt even feel good for more than a few minutes, most of the time passing out within an hour or two. 

So there is nothing left for alcohol to offer me it seems, but I continue to let my brain betray me and I don‚Äôt even have a chance to fight it before I‚Äôm at a gas station getting it. I just want to be able to say no and fight it. I know I have discipline, and I know I can‚Äôt keep doing this, I‚Äôm only 25 but I know this will end bad if I don‚Äôt stop. 

Do any of you have any advice for how to get out of that stupid mindset I seem to get where my brain just ignores all the reasons I have made this decision to quit hundreds of times? I‚Äôm sick of this and I want to quit forever, but even taking it a day at a time, the addict in me tricks me into buying and drinking. I know there has to be something I can do about it mentally. Any advice would be great, I love this community and it really has been helpful for me, even though I haven‚Äôt successfully put the bottle down for good.

At the ripe old age of 32, I feel most days as if I'm 58. I feel tired. I feel worn down. I have struggled my entire life with crippling anxiety and depression, sprinkled with a healthy does of depersonalization/derealization. My mind goes, nonstop, 24 hours a day. It's my own worst enemy. I've lived with my own worst enemy as the voice in my head since I was 15 years old. I've let it run amok, unchecked, and with careless abandon.

I've read the self-help books from quasi-intellectuals. I've read the ancient Buddhist texts on mindfulness and meditation. I've preached and preached to no end the benefits of all these things...all while keeping myself numb and never actually DOING anything about it. I have become a junkie for checking my phone 250 times a day, searching out the easiest dopamine hit I can get. 

I have become everything I promised myself I wouldn't. A user, fixed on his next hit. I drink to numb. I drink to silence the voice in my head. I drink to not have to feel. I drink to avoid responsibility. I drink because I'm complacent and bored. I drink.....to drink. I obsess about it. When I decided to only drink on weekends, I thought all week about what beers I would get...how much of each...how I could ""pace"" myself to not appear too drunk throughout the day...strategizing, planning. When Friday night came....off to the races I go. Beer. Wine. Sweet, sweet elixirs. Wash, rinse, repeat.

&#x200B;

I know this is nothing new to anyone here, and I hate to sound like the broken record of addiction and relapse and recovery. But, for my sanity, I needed to put this out there.

It's weird, I wasn't particularly unhappy or wanting to escape and I wasn't like ""oh time to celebrate"".

Maybe I just lost sight of the peace of mind I've gained in the last 12 days maybe?  Or the ""pink cloud"" has started to wear off a little?

Have known I need to stop for a while now. Yesterday I started drinking as soon as my husband left the house at 9am and eventually passed out around 9pm. Woke up at 2am to the reality that I was probably obviously drunk for 2 separate work meetings. I'm really good at my job and no one has ever said anything...but if I don't stop now, they'll start to notice. 

Unlike a lot of people I've seen, I didn't start drinking until I was almost 21. I'm 30 now and have been using the pandemic as an excuse to get blitzed a LOT. The truth is my mental health is in the shitter and I'm using alcohol to escape from that and my relationship problems (my husband is in DBT for borderline and that is rough for both of us)

Not to mention, I need to save money. Lucky enough to have bought a house in June, but in the aftermath we've racked up about $10,000 in credit card debt. My husband is currently on short term disability but that will run out eventually, and his treatment is at least 7 more months. The mortgage is about 60% of my take-home pay.

I am often in denial thinking that my life 'isnt that bad' so I shouldn't complain/feel bad. So writing out all the stressors helps me see...oh yeah, I am maybe dealing with a lot right now. But the drinking is only making it worse, not better.

TLDR: first attempt to quit, (possibly moderate but likely not). Sober four days, longest in five years. Expected to feel energetic and focused. Instead exhausted, groggy, starving, craving sugar. Is this normal?


Longer version:

Background: my parents are functional alcoholics. I started drinking at home when I was 10/11, glasses of wine at Christmas etc. Even then I enjoyed the buzz. Had the classic teenage years (in UK) alcohol pops, then cider, then rose wine, then beers. Often drinking to vomiting as I learned my limits. 

Had a few years of normal drinking, particularly when I was just legal. Then a series of sad events in my life led me to blackout drinking and passing out in the streets. 

By the end of undergraduate and start of my PhD (2015) I was a normal drinker for my age I would say. 

Over the last few years though I've slowly lost control. I've become more and more dependent on alcohol. In the last two months it's reached critical point. I've known for a long time that I can't ''take it or leave it'' but didn't want face it. After two weeks forced isolation I started ordering food delivery and ended up drinking a bottle of prosecco a day in secret, plus beers, and hiding the evidence from my partner. 

I have a couple of beers plus every evening after work. Last weekend I drank to blackout, again. 

My partner is getting fed up. I'm fed up. I'm sick of the guilt and fear and the ""what did I do after X last night?""

I'm four days sober, longest I've gone in five years. Even last week I'd have thought this wasn't possible, so small win. On the first proper day, (day after the hangover) I was so energetic and cheerful and i accomplished alot. Since then my energy has tanked. I'm exhausted, can't keep my eyes open, can't stop eating. I'm so thirsty and just want to lie down. Yesterday I had a horrible headache.

Well i‚Äôve never had a problem with drugs. Never abused one and for the last 3 years i didn‚Äôt even smoke weed just because i lost interest in them and i find them boring.Well I cant say the same thing for alcohol and cigarettes. Most of the days even when im alone i‚Äôd drink 3 pints of beers or a bottle of wine or some cocktail to get some buzz and you know listen to some music or to read or to write you know. Well 2 years ago i started going to gym pretty regularly. It kinda changed how i view alcohol. I gave it drinking for 4 months and i‚Äôve noticed that i felt much more confident. I looked better too. I felt happier, i felt worthy!Then it changed my relationship with alcohol now i knew that it was changing me. After 4 months i said you know im in my early 20s i should be having fun so i started drinking again. But this time i was able to control how much i drink since i knew that it‚Äôs not a good thing. But then some bad things started happening in my life its where i lost myself and i started to drink to shut down my feelings and my thoughts whatever i will try to keep it short. I don‚Äôt think i have a too big alcohol problem. I don‚Äôt see bottle of wine is too much of a alcohol or it doesn‚Äôt effect my daily life. I can go to my school or i can do whatever im supposed to do in my days or wake up at the time. I do exercise regularly i am not fat i pay attention to what i eat i do eat healthy i stay away from sugar and whole fast food and junk food industry. What bothers me is waking up with a guilt,red eyes with bags under my eyes. Seeing how my skin looks. I don‚Äôt like the mental after state of drinking and knowing that i am depending to this nightly wine routine of mine...

Well last night was the night where i had my last drink. I am going to stop drinking for at least a year. The only thing that bothers me is sleeping without having a drink since i did stop drinking for 4 months before i know i have sleeping problems and it was one of the reasons why i drink so often to sleep easy!I bought myself a melatonin to get ready for the first few days of quitting...

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

What secret super power do you have? Are you good at keeping houseplants alive, or do they keep dying on you? Do you like cooking, or would you rather not? Hobbies? Intererests? Tell us anything, just give us a little taste of what makes you you because we love you and we're so glad you're here, and we'd love to get to know you better.

I almost never think about alcohol anymore.  Which is crazy because I used to think about it all day.  How I was going to sneak alcohol into the house... how much did I have left at home... how much could I drink and still function the next day...?

My body chemistry feels normal, my eyes are clear, and I sleep better.  I actually used some of that money I saved to get my pilot‚Äôs license, and my daughter and I love to go flying.

I have struggled with alcohol but only been a daily drinker once before. I had the news that my cat, who is MORE than a cat to me, had mild kidney disease ""most cats live months to years after.."" in an email written to me. I ... I drank daily. I had, as of Solstice, begun drinking 8 to 12 beers at  a time instead of 6. I drank for three weeks, tried to give it up as usual, had withdrawals, was told to wait for medical detox. A couple weeks later I went through 5 days of valium, wherein I drank once after five days, and one final time after six. During all this time, I had realized some things: the days I drank til morning and skipped my sleep meds I felt loads BETTER despite having fibromyalgia. i began tapering off after ten years; i felt better, and better. I realized the med sedated me greatly, gave me a drug hangover, etc. I had already tried tapering off Lyrica, which I KNEW sedated me, blunted me emotionally, made me apathetic, time went super fast, and there was memory loss and cognition loss. (those last two are documented side effects and the company has been sued.) i had tried going off, but it is extremely hard, and at that time there was wildfire smoke and with covid and pain, i thought ""why not let time go by so fast for a while longer?"" Anyway, I had been sober several days - I had been taking kratom to sleep and to mimic alcohol in the evening until the night before. The night before, I took no sleep meds or anything, woke up feeling great, had a nice cuddle wiht the cat, and I had my internet back. I had lost the internet and phone for a week, and I am also addicted to these things. During this week, I had experienced MUCH less anxiety and I already knew for yrs I was not there for Sebastian as much as I was spending hrs dialed in or watching tv. We used to cuddle, but my new space cramped things up. I sobered up that week, I read a book that helped my sobriety ""Wild"" I cried with him and it was DIFFERENT this time. I bought things to help me and I was creating new habits. that day was the first day to myself in weeks; id been spending several days a week with someone who gave me great anxiety due to not taking proper covid responsibilities - he had his last days coming 2 weeks. i had just had a scooter after ten years of difficulty with mobility and sometimes housebound, so i explored outside in the failing summer to minimize covid possibiility with employee. i have low night vision, the mask fogs up my glasses, and i live somewhere where its rainy and gloomy nov - march or so. i had been taking time to explore in the final weeks; it was over, that day. it was done. I told him i wanted half a day to watch tv - cuddling him off and on - and i told him i wanted to go for a walk and after dark we would stay off the internet and begin cuddling more and being present. he was hungry but on a diet. i decided to call my family instead of heading straight off and that was when he had the stroke.   i WOULD have actually pet him prior, but he was cuddled up and resting after asking for food / attention for a couple hrs (the diet was strict, it was newly re-inforced, i was trying). I...i have no words. I stopped smoking a month ago, I sobered up FOR sebastian, I went off drugs FOR sebastian, i had  a deal that if i did these things while he lived I could forgive myself for the last two years / two months.  (He was minimum 18 and a half, I knew it was his last yr). We ruled out everything but stroke , meds helped him revive enough to say goodbye ...i tried for 24 hrs ...

he wasnt just a goddamn cat, btw. the moment i met him we loved each other. i just had disconnected in the last yr or so. i hated myself during these times. i kept telling myself; daily - sober up. get off the internet / tv. cuddle him. he will be gone soon.

but why would he go to the moment of my goal being met? i did buy peppermint foot cream whihc unknowingly had the essential oil i adamantly stayed away from for a decade, but i only used it on my hands that day twice and the bloodwork and labwork was clean. do NOT tell me otherwise. I can survive his loss but i will never, ever, forgive myself...anyway i was told it was definitely not but it got in my head. 

his kidneys were fine, on the labs, he'd lost two pounds, he was great lab-wise. he let go the moment i could sober up.

no, im not drinking. yes, i talked to my counselor. i talked to my friends. i finally had no company now. 

the hardest part is how cold my bed is without him. how i cant close my eyes, because the spot he slept in obscured the view that is now visible. i have to bundle up for once and move the bed, too...

im sorry this is so long. he wasnt a cat. he saved me. i would have killed myself hundreds of times if it werent for him. i only had him half his life. they told me he was 12 when i got him and to prepare myself. he lived 10 and a half yrs and had his age regressed to 8 at time of adoption. i wasnt supposed to have him, but he connected with me and when i chose not to adopt him because it was against rent rules (turns out it wasnt) i had the strongest psychic dream ever TELLING me to adopt him. this is too long to explain it all. the last two weeks, id had two dreams where one, he told me he was hanging on just for me, and the second was a friend telling me i needed to let him go. the night he was kept overnight (supposedly in a stupor) i dreamt i was in an airport, having come from a foreign land with many new things that fascinated. i wasnt sure if i wanted to go back to the foreign land, or come home. i was leaning to the foreign land..to the adventures there. i know what that dream was.

i only wanted a few months with him sober and clear-headed. i wanted to give him good memories. he did revive for a few hrs of goodbyes where he blinked with his one eye his love to me, when i spoke to him all the things, in which i asked if he forgave me for X, and his eye became overwhelmed with love and i received the message ""forgive for what? i was so happy"":

but now im here and im alone and i dont want to drink or take kratom. i dont eat or sleep. i dont know what to do in this stupid apartment during covid / so far from the few ppl in my life. 

i did pull an oracle card multiple times the last couple days for his life message to me: ""live in the moment.""

so there you go. go be with your kids, your pets, your family. put down your phone, even though its election time im still dandy without news - dont put it off, not even half an hr.

(btw, he had the soonest vet appt availabe to address his decline - i had bought new things to help him., to help me take him to the vet, it was BEING DONE. Also, all along was treating his pain and kidney disease sober or not. I just felt like there were hrs each day we were all alone and all I had to do was cuddle him not dialed in..)

So I just went through my first DT last night and holy that was single handedly the worst experience of my life. I‚Äôm currently at the hospital getting IV drips and asking for advice. 

I don‚Äôt know how but I can permanently see my laptop screen so it look at a wall for example I can see windows opened in video too not just stills.

It‚Äôs slightly getting less noticeable as this day goes on. 

I was going through my usual withdrawal process but then out of where I start seeing two dudes in my mirror ms reflection having a cigarette and then a guys head disappearing into my wall. That‚Äôs when I new some shit was fucked up but then as I walked to check out it they were real i notice the sunlight feels more sensitive on my eyes so I go to the bathroom and check my pupils and they were literally zooming in and zooming out right in front of me, and then the panic, that anxiety everyone says about it kicked in like I‚Äôve never felt that much fear I was literally thinking I was going to die. 

And then I knew some shit was fucked so I just jumped in the Uber and came straight to the hospital, had to pull over a few times to vomit on the side of the road.

They IV dripped me and also gave me the drug that stops you from feeling nausea just so I could take orally administer meds.

My head feels like fucking shit and I‚Äôm honestly so traumatised I don‚Äôt even want to go back to my apartment

I'm a 25 y/o female and I've been trying to get sober for two years now (sat in my first AA meeting almost two years ago to the day and have been in and out - mostly out - ever since). The longest I have managed to say sober in those two years is 23 days in July/August of this year. In fact, I think that's the longest I've been sober in the past 5 years.

&#x200B;

Recently I seem to have just given up all hope and resigned myself to a crappy life stuck in a drunk/hungover cycle. Because of this diminished hope I have started to drink the second I wake up in the morning, and have spent the past 3 days drunk. These benders are a common occurrence these days. The only reason I'm not drunk right now is because I don't think my body can take any more booze. I hate myself, I hate this feeling. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with these feelings of guilt and shame? I need to feel some hope, and I really want to get out of this 'what's the point in even trying' mindset.

First time I'm posting on this sub and the first time I've been one week sober in months. I've recently relocated to a new area (self-isolating for 14 days as we speak) so I'm using the transition to gain leverage over myself as no memories have been attached to alcohol in my current environment yet as opposed to numerous in my previous setting. Time and space is a huge factor when it comes to psychological addiction. It's worth noting that I nearly became chemically dependant on alcohol at one point during university and consequently almost failed my degree.

I feel numb, irritated, agitated, and restless right now. Music sounds weird (in a strangely good way though) at the minute (I've been so used to listening to it intoxicated in the past). I've also suffered from bouts of short-term memory loss and I'm only 22 years old (just graduated from uni). I've attended rehab and AA meetings pre-covid as well. Hopefully, I can get a good run of sobriety this time around. Some benefits I've observed thus far are a better quality of sleep, mental clarity and an improved outlook on life.

Any thoughts appreciated.

I quit Diet Coke before really facing the fact I needed to quit drinking alcohol, which was a truly disgusting, bad habit. I also just started eating better - more whole foods and I have lost 12 pounds. It has been a very healthy domino effect.

I was the typical ""I don't have a problem because I only drink on the weekend and special occasions"" guy. But that was a lie...I did have a problem. What made me realize it was the week long hangovers I would get. Always filled with anxiety, guilt, shame, depression...you name it. I just got tired of it and couldn't take it anymore.

The past year wasn't without issues. I dealt with PAWS big time. Started around the two month mark and lasted for a couple of weeks, then again around the six month mark for another few weeks. For me that was the worst...all the same hangover feelings coming back for no reason. Especially the anxiety!

But, I just kept reminding myself what caused all this mess and that was enough for me to not want to drink.

I have ""stopped"" probably about 5 different times during that period as well.  The longest I have made it was a month, and the very next day once Dry Whatever or Clean Something was over I was back at it.  

I just finished a 5 day bender, more or less.  Since Thursday night, I couldn't even tell you how many things I have consumed.  I capped it off last night with meeting a friend who texted me at 5p, and of course ran over and had more drinks.  

I woke up this morning at 4a in a puddle of sweat.  Stomach was turning.  For the last several months that feeling would have me counting down the hours until it was lunch time, when I could go get 2 beers to feel normal.  I would drink some water the rest of the day and maybe a glass of wine at night and feel like the next day I was going to not drink at all.

Then the next day comes, and the hardest part for me seems to be the whole ""social aspect"" problem.  I convince myself that every time I meet someone, it should be in a bar.  Every time I get a text to meet, it typically involves meeting at a bar.  Trivia night?  Happy Hour?  All alcohol centered.  Even though the previous day I would think I had no reason to drink for the next 2 days, something would come up.  Thursday would roll around, rinse and repeat.  

It hasn't affected my life like it has the homeless I drive by on my way to work--at least I tell myself that.  I am a male in my early 30s.  I put in a lot of work early in my career and at this point run a very successful business that I no longer have to manage daily and as a result my absence(s) are not missed.  

That being said, I can see my addiction increasing in severity.  Despite being able to look like I am present and listening, I am starting to forget entire evenings and have no recollection of conversations.  I shower infrequently.  I shave less.  I find myself hiding beer cans in the bottom of the trash can so my SO doesn't see them.  

It is difficult for me to see any clear path forward that isn't total abstinence.  That brings on the typical thoughts of ""Am I not going to be able to enjoy a glass of wine with my SO?"",  ""What about our yearly holiday party?"", etc.  Inevitably though they always bring me back to square one, full of chest pain and lethargy.  I still grapple with this and probably will for some time.

>Hi, Everybody,  
   
   
 I am Landon, a 63  y/o woman, disabled and determined to find the way to earn my living  doing what I love: blogging about my recovery, personal growth, and  crafting. I also want to return to school. One of my biggest goals is to  get myself off of welfare and out of poverty FOR.GOOD. If I can do that  for myself, I can help others too. That alone is an enormous need I  crave.  
   
 About my  background, I drank dangerously for 30 years of my life, stopping and  relapsing many times. I began my most productive alcohol recovery on  11-16-2007. Finally, I could no longer ignore the fact my life was out  of control and being drunk every day would not help me.  
   
   
 Back then, I did  not understand what was ahead of me. Raised in a monstrous household by  my sadistic psychopath mother, absent father and two older sisters who  were mother's thugs, it is a miracle I am alive. My childhood was so  abusive, I locked most of it up in amnesia and complex ptsd flashbacks. I  sat down one day to write out what I could remember: I wrote less than 3  pages, 8 by 11, Ariel size 11 font. Almost every memory I have includes  abuse. And because of those impairments, I became learning disabled.  
   
   
 Catapulted into  promiscuity, alcoholism, self-loathing, self-destruction, and more  because of that upbringing, my first therapist diagnosed me with  clinical depression in the early 1990s. Then, I realized how close I had  been to danger, plus my flesh and blood family were criminals. It  shocked me! I also remembered I had engaged in incest with three male  cousins who took advantage of my vulnerabilities. That happened when I  was around 13 and later in high school.  
   
   
 Decades after  that, I worked to better my mindset. I went to psychotherapy and AA  meetings. The therapy helped me more than the meetings. I respect folks  who benefit from AA because different people respond to different  approaches, but there are some aspects of AA that bothered me.  
   
 In doing years of  therapy, I got to the place where I could not figure out why I kept  sabotaging myself. It was on the floor staring at me; I could not escape  it unless I relapsed. I had to stomach what I ran from my entire life:  my blood mother and sisters hated me and tried to destroy me. I worried  what they pummeled me with was true: That I was defective and no one  would ever love me. That was what I ran from.  
   
 I had to undergo  hypnosis to get those stuck emotions going; that is how buried and  cemented in place they were. It took me weeks of listening to my  recorded hypnosis sessions 2 or 3 times a day to cry as much as I  needed. I saw firsthand how much better I felt when I faced and accepted  the emotional horrors that tormented me, the very horrors I drank and  drugged to escape. I was hooked and kept working on those issues and  anything else negative that bothered me. It is a TON of work, but I have  healed enough that now I can embrace the negative wounds to heal them  to the best of my ability. They are MY wounds; they are as much a part  of me as my toes and fingers are.  
   
   
 The therapy  took.me.YEARS. and I still have a ton of work ahead of me; recovery is  for life. We know that. That is how complex it is. But, for me, it has  also been *rewarding*  because I have a lot to be grateful for and am happy about. Slowly, my  mental health has gotten better and some of my physical health has  improved.  
   
   
 One last  important thing I want to share is when I stopped drinking, my over  eating worsened. (That is another chapter I will write about another  day.) And still not having most of the important needs met today, I  still struggle with overeating. I have gotten my cravings to stop and to  not bother me for weeks on end. I have lost up to 28 lbs during those  quiet periods, only to regain some weight back when the cravings  returned. I know the cravings return to compel me to get those needs  met. One way emotions work is to tell us something is off and we need to  fix it. And believe me, I am doing everything I can!  
   
   
 I know I can get  them to stop completely, and that is my focus. I am pulling together  every resource I have to get myself there: Satisfied with my life and  all needs met to the best of my ability.  
   
   
 So, all that said, I am glad to be here and am looking forward to making new friends! üì∑",101,0

Spoke very honestly and directly with the doc for at least 60 minutes JUST about my alcohol use and the path forward (he is very generous with his time). No more awkward than or different from talking to him about having a common cold. 

He was great and I have a brand new Naltrexone prescription!!  And normal liver panel results!!

Was so happy and relieved that by the end of the physical I frankly wanted to give the guy a smooch on the mouth in gratitude (ordinarily, I would consider that forward, but after the hernia check and testicular cancer exam...why not??).

THANKS!!!: Never would have done this wo reading and being inspired/encouraged by all the posts here for the last 2 years. Would have been a LOT more fragile mentally and emotionally on the way to this physical this morning wo the outpouring of support I got from you last night. 

I literally will be eternally grateful. And will try to pay it forward. 

My family has been read into my alcohol issue for a couple years. They have heard me mention r/SD a 1,000 times. E.g., ""I know it sounds weird, but this community of strangers is the most compassionate, loving, brave and wise group I have ever been a part of. For example, just the other day u/ CatTurdChucker_74 made a great point about....""

Never shared a link to r/SD with them till last night. My Mom and Brother told me they read every comment. Their response was, essentially: ""HO. LY. SHIT. We never really got or believed what you said about this group before. But, HOLY SHIT. You weren't exagerrating. You were being understated. This is an amazing community.""

Long story short. My drinking landed me in the hospital last year. It felt like my real rock bottom moment. The hospital didn't care for me either. So with the help my my Significant Other I got onto 8 months of amazing sobriety. I found a very low stress part time job and things were seeming bright.

Then I was laid off. Initially this didn't bug me too much as I felt I could get another job easily. Then the lockdowns started. Suddenly my future (like everyones) was just a giant unknown. So I grabbed a bottle, and another. Crying and moping around the house. Wasting so much time. The part that really brings me down to this day was the waste of time. I managed to get back up to 3 months. but with the days blurring with each other I was looking for an occasion to drink and my birthday in late summer was that occasion.

To be frankly honest. I hide my drinking from my SO. He's an amazing person and I know every time he finds out I am eroding what we have left of our relationship. I keep telling him I want to stop. Because I do. but then an opportunity opens up and my brain just tells me (""this will be the last time""). It's been hard to get past a week again over the last two months. I want to so bad. I want to repair my life and stop wasting so much time. I just turned 30 and I feel like I have very little to show. Most of my friendships have slowly drifted away. If I don't get this right I will really be alone. I don't want that. I want today to be the change. I want to make this the moment that changes me.

Sometimes I could stop for a week or so, but I never really had the motivation to stop. Two Saturdays ago I got really wasted. I cried at a bar to my friends about how I lacked confidence to follow through with my writing. When I woke up I felt completely empty, like someone had tipped me over. It was freeing actually. I have not had a drink (or cried!) since that night. I have been writing so much, creativity seems closer in reach, my relationships are improving. There is nothing like surprising a loved one right? For me, my grief from losing many friends and family to things not unrelated to drinking was paradoxically making me kind of a bad friend and lover. I was so hurt that I was guarded. I was dogged about needing to ""take care of myself"" which often translated to going on a bender or eating crappy food. Something had to give--and it did! I quit drinking and I have honestly never been happier. I am running, dancing, moving, just so much more moving.

I can just drink once a week!"" brain lies, I started out my sober journey by hoping I could go back to being a casual drinker. However, I've stopped worrying about trying to moderate and have been focusing more on how it feels to just be sober. I've been only drinking once a week but since cutting back I'm finding I don't even want to get drunk anymore when I do.

I never fully realized how I used to look forward to social hangouts because I could drink. Dinners, parties, etc, all focused around drinking. I've started only making plans if I actually want to see and enjoy peoples' company rather than doing anything for an excuse to drink. It's been hard honestly, but has helped me get out of that habit.

Cutting back has shown me that I love being sober. I know it isn't for everyone and at first it was hard to have those large gaps in between but it has made me appreciate mornings without hangovers, the abundance of energy you have when you're not hungover, and way less anxiety. I also have been enjoying activities, meals, and people around me without focusing on who will drink with me, how much I can eat so I'm able to get drunk, how much fun I am sober (I think I'm actually way more fun now). My goal is to go into 2021 sober and staying there for good.

While I do not think I am an alcoholic, I do recognize that I have a problem with alcohol. I am a 24 yo female whose father was just diagnosed with Alzheimer's at 59, just graduated grad school, and started a very stressful job in the past 2 months, and live across the country from all of my family. 

This weekend, I made a fool of myself. I blacked out, tried to make out with a friend over and over again, got in a fight/screamed at someone, and woke up with vomit all over myself and my bed. I have had nights like this in the past, but they have been few and far between. Recently, I have found that I rarely have a night where I stop at one drink or do not blackout. 

I am a loving and caring person, so the fact that my actions have turned into this is just appalling to me. My roommate even told me the next morning that she is worried about me and that I was not myself. I am on Lexapro. So I am not sure if that affected my actions, but I feel as if it may have. 

I do not want to wake up feeling like this anymore. Both of my parents were adopted, but we do know that addiction runs in my family. I could see that this could lead down a troubling road if I continue with my actions. I have always been friends with crowds of heavy drinkers, and my family likes to drink heavily as well, so I am nervous as to how I will handle all this. Alcholol is littered all over my house. 

I am nervous, I am scared, but I am determined. My goal at this point is 100 days. Please wish me luck and provide me with any podcasts/books that you have found to be most beneficial to you in your journey to sobriety. Preferably by a female.

All that said, I‚Äôm really struggling with procrastination on all other fronts. I think this was always a defect of mine that I drank to ignore and ultimately blamed the drink for to begin with. Now, 3 weeks sans drink, my procrastination with work, working out, reengaging with all the responsibilities I put on the back burner because of drinking are piling up. The result is a feeling of crushing anxiety which I meet with, you guessed it, more procrastination. I keep cutting myself slack by telling myself, as long as you don‚Äôt drink today, everything else is fine. But it‚Äôs not fine to keep putting off responsibility and I know it‚Äôll catch up to me sooner or later.

It's just over a year since I had a drink.

The first time I quit was a genuine struggle. I found it hard not to drink and I found it hard to be sober. When I reached a year I let my guard down and a couple of months later I was drinking one or two every now and then. Predictably (to everyone except me) this drinking became more frequent and within a few months I'd had my worst ever binge. At this point, I admitted to myself that my core problems were depression and low self esteem; alcohol was an indicator of these problems, and a crutch, and while taking it away helped in many aspects, it didn't solve things.

So I went to the doctor, cried uncontrollably and ended up signed off work for 6 weeks, seeing a therapist and taking antidepressants. The process of therapy when you've bottled up or ignored depression for 15 years is quite unpleasant - but gradually I gained some useful tools to help me live in a happier way. 

It's been a year since I was brave enough to ask for help, and I'm in a much better place. Because it isn't, I won't pretend my life is all sunshine and rainbows, but I have many fewer down days now. I haven't sat awake at night criticising every decision I ever made for months now. I haven't had a hangover since that last binge. I no longer regularly address myself with hatred and loathing. I have spoken to strangers at networking events without being drunk or giving myself palpitations. Things are getting better, and I've had to work hard to improve them. I can't imagine any of it would have been possible with alcohol in my life.

What I want to say is that if you are quitting alcohol, if you don't recognise the happy, shiny sobriety euphoria often expressed in this forum, if you don't feel magical, lose 20lbs and feel like you could carry a wardrobe up Kilimanjaro 3 weeks after quitting, then don't worry and don't give up. I did some field research and alcohol doesn't improve things. What may improve things is hard work and help from others. 

I feel better now than I have since I was a teenager. Quitting alcohol is a foundational reason for that, but it's not the only reason. Continuing not to drink will be a fundamental part of my future happiness, but not the only part.

What I have been typically doing the day after I consume more than I'm comfortable with is taking a break for a few days, and by then I feel better and have convinced myself that I don't have a problem to face.  

I don't drink to blackout.

Yesterday I was scared and ashamed and hurting emotionally because I felt trapped in my own rationale.

I set up the call for this afternoon so that I couldn't back out of it when I felt better this morning and started thinking ""It's fine..."" again.

I‚Äôve been to every single detox Long Island has to offer. 7 rehabs. 2 psyche wards and countless hospital stints. I used to wake up in the hospital once a week due to being unresponsive in my apartment whenever someone would come and check on me. A DWI with a .44 blood alcohol level at 830 in the morning on the way to the liquor store.

I was in a coma for 8 days after having my second grandmal seizure in 12 hours. I was sleeping on a friends floor when he woke up to use the bathroom and saw me choking on my own vomit having another seizure. He performed CPR on me until the ambulance got there. 

I have had countless bottoms. Bottom after bottom after bottom after bottom. I never ever thought I‚Äôd be able to go a week without drinking. 

YOU CAN DO IT. That‚Äôs my message to anyone struggling. I share my message in rehabs, detoxes, AA meetings and it opens my eyes to how sick I truly was and just how far I‚Äôve come. My life is amazing now. I used to not put my seatbelt on when I got in the car because I wanted to die, but by ‚Äúaccident‚Äù.

I‚Äôve been sober and going to online AA meetings for two months. It‚Äôs been difficult but it‚Äôs slowly working. I don‚Äôt have a sponsor yet, but was actively looking for one until yesterday. I attended one of my favorite online groups, where everyone is usually supportive and there is a diverse mix of newcomers and veteran AA members.

I felt really comfortable with this group, so I finally opened up about being assaulted by a taxi driver while I was blackout drunk 5 years ago. I‚Äôve been to therapy for it, and it‚Äôs taken me years to not actively blame and hate myself for what happened. To my surprise, the response from the group was that it was partially my fault for getting so drunk and that now I could take responsibility for it. I was and am so crushed by this response. Part of me believes it, but I KNOW in my heart that I did not make that man violate me and that it was a defect in HIS morality and character that instigated what happened. 

I‚Äôm so mad, and I don‚Äôt want to go back to AA, but I need it. It‚Äôs the only thing that has helped me stop drinking for so long.

I‚Äôm a progressive, feminist, atheist (but culturally Jewish and spiritual - it‚Äôs complicated!), so I occasionally go to agnostic AA but have found that the majority of those meetings are spent debating God and not alcoholism. I love the format of sharing and connecting with alcoholics, especially because I don‚Äôt know anyone who has gone through the same thing in real life.

She had enough of my excuses.  I'd made unkept promises one too many times.  She'd given me every opportunity to change, to turn my life around, to be truly honest with her.

She knew I had a problem.  I just couldn't admit the depth of my shame.  I drank excessively, she knew it.  I tried to hide the extent of my drinking.  It was bad.  I would drink the equivalent of 15-20 units a night...every night!  Yet she stood by me, knowing that I had this huge heart that was been drowned in alcohol, and neutered me of my ability to be a success in any aspect of my life.

I was an exceptional student, and graduated top of my class every year.  I was average working class and had a tremendous work ethic.  I have a great family and am still close to them all. 

I landed a dream job before I even graduated, and was earning more that my father that first year.  It just got better and better and I was making several million a year at my peak.

I left corporate life to start working for myself, and that's where things really started getting bad.  Occasional binge drinking turned into every day drinking, turned into drink myself stupid EVERY DAY.  I started drink driving regularly...never got caught, and thankfully never killed anyone.  Started drinking in the morning more often, and would be hammered by lunch.

My business stagnated.  I lost 2 fortunes in the process.  All my fault.

I went to rehab twice...I only told my closest friend many years later.  The first time I lasted 10 months before I broke my sobriety on my brother's bachelor weekend.  I convinced myself I was cured.  The second time, I lasted 3 months.  I gave in on a first date after I was queried why I wasn't drinking.  Social pressure broke me. 

I have had a real problem with alcohol for 25 years.  Now I find myself single, no home, failed business and living in a foreign country knowing no-one.  Is it possible to turn this around and find happiness?

This is day 2 of my latest attempt at sobriety.  This has to be the time I change.",3,0

Things I have noticed,"So I woke up today and it is day 9. This is the tied for the longest I have gone in 15 years. I'm 30 years old and half my life has been a haze. Here is what I have noticed so far.

A couple days ago I slept through the night for the first time. Holy smokes I forgot about actually sleeping.

I am so hungry all the time. Something is up, I just can't get enough food, it's like I'm ravenous, and developed a huge sweet tooth. At least I am not drunk but I definitely have not lost weight.

I have had deep conversations with friends. I guess people like when you listen to them and remember things they just told you.

Work goes by faster. I like my job, but hung over me counted the hours to finish. Or honestly I would just start drinking by noon or in the morning to take the edge off.

I am more irritated. I have to work on this, I've been a bit snappy.

I get cravings and triggered all the time. Multiple times a day, I am in a constant battle with my drunken self.

I can actually eat spicy food. Looks like my stomach was taking a beating from all the vodka. My stomach is not as sensitive as I thought it was.

Sex is better for sure, wife is happier.

I'm no longer pretending I remember episodes of TV shows. I actually remember them. 

My anxiety has dropped by about 75%. Waking up in a cold sweat in a crippling panic isn't ""just how I sleep"".

I figured out on weekends I can get everything done around he house by 1...WTF do sober people do with all the extra hours. Non-alcoholics are a crazy bunch sitting there in their own thoughts.

My abdomen is no longer tender to the touch. My back hurts less as well for some reason. 

Now for my objective this week: learn and retain my neighbors name that I have seen and spoke to multiple times a week for over a year. Do one more scoop for hidden bottles around the house and get rid of them. Call my grandparents.

The hardest time is around 4pm EST. 

Once the thought creeps in it‚Äôs already almost over. It‚Äôs a demon I can‚Äôt shake. 

Quarantine has made me lazy and drinking easy. I‚Äôm lucky to have only gained five pounds. Quarantine was supposed to be a restart. Get healthy, forge a new path, etc. Instead I‚Äôve just disappointed myself and my husband. 

He was diagnosed with cancer a few weeks ago. Papillary thyroid, so after surgery he should be okay. But he, and I, truly want to turn our life around. 

Drinking makes me so tired the next day, even if it‚Äôs not that much. (Our go to is to split a six pack, a shot, and a daddy each, most days one or two beers more.) Then I get nothing done. It‚Äôs sucking the soul out of me. Neither of us are strong enough for both of us, and I‚Äôm struggling to be strong enough for myself and it‚Äôs becoming a feedback loop of drinking. Drinking to forget being in my own fat, lazy body is making my body fat and lazy. Not to mention the anxiety and brain fog I‚Äôm personally inducing. 

On top of all that, my husband and I fight with each other over stupid things when we‚Äôre drunk. Not all the time, but too many times to know we‚Äôre poisoning our marriage right alongside poisoning our minds and bodies. 

Today HAS to be day one. And I, at the very least, need tomorrow to be day two. I‚Äôll be back for help and encouragement soon. Thanks for reading.",6,2

""\_\_\_ CAN YOU HEAR ME?"" she bellowed several times in a panicked, worried voice; gibberish came out my as I tried to string together a few words.  ""Do you know who I am?"" she queried realizing that I was alive despite being what I later found out was a essentially a lifeless blue & yellow corpse collapsed on my back office floor.   ""Sister!"" I vaguely remember saying as I rolled over.  She had sped to my house from her apartment down the road at the request of my wife after she called 911.   I was wearing no pants, pints of vodka littered the floor, and the last two things I remember were them pulling a pair of gym shorts on me and 6 county sheriffs carrying me to a gurney in the hallway.

The next week or so is still a total blur.  I only know what I was told by nurses, doctors, and my wife about those days I spent in the ICU.  They had me strapped to the bed so I could not move, IVs in both arms, and a catheter inside of me.  For days I had gone through prolonged periods of DTs, hallucinations, 2 seizures, and the whole gamut as the vigorously worked to keep me alive.  Finally regaining my wits about myself, I was told that I need to go to an inpatient facility for a 30 day program or lose everything: my family, my job, my house, my freedom, my life.  I tried everything to get back to my house before going:  ""I need to go home and pack"", ""I need to make sure my dogs are okay first"", ""I need to straighten things up with HR before I take leave"".  In reality, I just wanted to grab some more drinks and continue my, what I thought, functional alcoholism.  The center and my family had no part of my shenanigans.  After 10 days in the ICU I was medically transported to my first inpatient program.

It was here the medical director told how bad I really was.  When they took my BAC from drawing blood it came back as .74........Yes, that is not a typo.  Nearly 10 times the legal limit - most people enter a coma or die around .35-.4.  How I was alive was nothing short of a miracle and the determination of a fantastic hospital staff.  He had never seen anything above a .55 in his 30+ years of working in treatment.

You see, I had only started drinking a few short years (3) ago.  There were no repercussions really.  No DUI's, no financial strain, no issues at work, just an ever increasing amount of consumption when I got home from work.  However, COVID hit and we began to telecommute.  ""Work from home, amazing!"" I thought to myself at first.  I can fucking drink all day while working.  This is going to be great.  This started the morning drinking.  I knew I was an alcoholic but I did not know how cunning and powerful this illness was.  My drinking had increased to around 8-10 pints a day from the moment I woke up to when I fell asleep.  I was ""managing my drinking"" by only drinking in pints.  Fucking ridiculous line of thought but hey, that's what we do.  We rationalize.

30 days had passed, I told my family I had acquired all the tools I needed to stop, and told everyone around that ""I got this.""  Boy was I wrong and those three words are probably the any addict can utter.

About 7 hours after being home it was back down to the liquor store.  A few days later I was back at treatment for 30 days at a different facility with a BAC of .61.  Hey I was making progress I joked with the other patients.

Thankfully, I was granted FMLA so I knew my job was secure.  Okay I kept telling myself.  This time will be different.  I was going to do this for myself - not for my family, friends, or anyone else.  I had to do this for myself.

Nope.  I was told with everyone relapse things get worse and I did not heed the warnings.  I again starting drinking again.  The ""Big Book"" says our disease is cunning, baffling, and powerful and they are right.  The drinking started again and now I was facing financial stress from being on unpaid FMLA, doubts from my employer about my ability to do my job, marital issues, the whole nine yards.  So - one more go at treatment.  Back to the first place I went.  My entire summer and part of fall was spent in treatment.

I actually listened this time, I participated in the meditation, I searched for my higher power (I am a pretty hard agnostic).  The doctors worked with me to convince me about trying medication for depression (I knew I always struggled with it but could just shove everything down in me) despite me being against prescription meds.  I told them I had no interest in being medicated but they told me straight up I have been self-medicating and something clicked.  I heeded their advice.

Anyways, today I am SIXTY days sober for the first time in a long, long time.  If you have made it this far in reading my post thank you and I would like to offer a few things that I have learned, and continue to learn, during this journey.

1. It's clich√© but It works if You work it and you are worth it.
2. Don't be afraid or hesitant to enter a facility.  Don't be embarrassed to stay longer or go back.
3. Rehab is just the first leg of your journey.  The after-care is where the work really begins.  This was my initial fuck up is I thought ""my plan"" was going to work.  I could just stop drinking!  Nope.
4. A wise man told me my third go around 3 things.  Pray, Go to meetings, and Don't drink.  The first two are the ""hard"" part, the third comes if you put in the work.
5. One day at a time.  The world record for not drinking is 24 hours.  We have today.  If we alcoholics can not drink today that is a win.
6. Talk to people.  Just talk to people.  Call them, text them, walk across the street and shoot the shit with your neighbor, post on Reddit, whatever.
7. There is a lot more out there than AA.  Smart recovery, Recovery Dharma, NA, NAMI, etc.  I switch up meetings and especially with COVID you can find a meeting any time of the day, anywhere in the world online.

Number \*5\* has probably been the biggest realization for me.  Thank you again, you - everyone- and I can do this, and IWNDWYT!!!",36,2

Since then I've quit I don't know how many times and then gone back to drink. I don't drink a huge amount, but I drink everyday or every other day.

I didn't feel any great cloud lift when I was sober, and I definitely don't see it happening right now. I'm at my wits end and about to lose my relationship and my home because my partner is fed up of me lying.

There's only so many times I can say sorry before it loses meaning.

And yet, there's a part of me that still doesn't want to quit. I suppose that's the addict? And another part of me that doesn't understand why it's so hard too, so I must be an addict right?

I've tried everything I know of to find some motivation around not drinking but nothing seems to work. Podcasts, apps, running, walking, yoga, swimming, nice food instead, hair makeover, false nails (I'm a nail biter), seeing my ""future sober self"", therapy, group meetings, online meetings, 5 day courses.

I honestly don't know what the fuck else to try. Why am I missing something vital here that can give me the strength to do this. I'm feeling so alone, and so very lost right now after boozing again yesterday.

The funny thing is, I clearly remember the point in which I blacked out. My blackouts aren't of a ""he ded"" kind - I'm still having fun, and nobody knows. In the morning though, I have no idea where 4 hours of my life went. 

It wasn't my first time. Luckily, it was just another time where nothing bad happened. Some people found it funny, maybe even admirable a bit when I told them about it. Hey I actually made a friend while, well not being there.

But for me it's not funny anymore. My fianc√©e tells me to ""just stop when you feel too drunk"", but it's easy for someone who can control it. I have no such system. As they say, ""you only drink your first shot"", and holy shit that hits home for me. I tried many ""limitations"" - only the weekends, only the ""solid"" occasions (""Friday is not an occasion""), only beer, only whisky, drink water between drinks... 

It's not like I got super wasted each time I was near alcohol. Most of the time I just don't have enough batteries though, so it's ""I'm on a diet called *there's no food in the house*"". 

My hangover wasn't ""the day"". I had those ""oh I'll never drink again"" thoughts, but it was mostly physical suffering speaking, at it goes away, right? It's not like it's serious. 

Yesterday, for the most part, wasn't ""the day"". In the evening I spoke with my fianc√©e that I'm going to quit. She was moderately supportive - I mean, she is, but for her it's not clear why I can't just ""limit it a bit and simply not drink that much"". 

I found many reasons why I drink, apart from the biological ones. I used to drink when I was afraid of the peer group I was in, when I felt I don't belong. To silence my huge ego and low self-esteem (shitty combination, I tell you). To silence the things I should just think about for a few minutes to get rid of, but was too tired to do it. To have ""a shtick"" because I don't think I'm interesting and funny enough when sober (which is a huge fucking lie because my sense of humor goes off the rails after first drink). 

So, today, after multiple attempts during my life, I decided that since yesterday I'm a non-drinker. And I'm gonna treat it like I did quit cigarettes - I went from 2 packs a day to 0 in one evening. I'm not hoping for it to be easy, but in such cases I kind of wait for the challenges. I know that it's gonna be hard. Or not - we'll see. 

And I know that there are not many people in my peer group that will support me on that. They all will say that ""oh come on, just one shot/beer/night/blackout"". Some will be afraid to find that they're in the same position and will try to sabotage this for their own sense of ""serenity"". I know it will happen, and so the more I'm willing to sacrifice my ""cool factor"" I owe to drinking. For me *and* for them. 

I've lurked this community for a long time and I know that most of us aren't that different, even though we're here for plethora of reasons. I see the struggles we share and as much as I hope I can count on you guys, from time to time, I also hope I'll be able to share my wins with you guys, for those of you who will need that.

After being sober for so long the hangxiety, guilt, and crushing loneliness that drinking causes hits so much harder. 

I don't really know why I drank. Well I mean I do, despite the logic of it. After 6 months this was my first day off work where I was completely alone, which triggered the worst cravings I ever had in my life. The night before I relapsed my boyfriend held me in his arms as I cried and cried because I wanted to drink so bad and this journey is just so hard and not for a single day does it get any easier. I was anxious and lonely when I found myself here by myself and I just caved. It didn't feel as good as I hoped and I just kept reaching out to strangers on the internet and streamers to make me feel less alone. That wasn't fun and now I feel stupid for acting the way I did around those people just being a drunk mess and then never speaking to them again.

I tried so, so hard to not drink but it's like it has been literally the only thing on my mind these past few days. I might distract myself shortly but then it just keeps breaking through. Every single thing I try to do to distract myself isn't enough. I find myself spacing out fantasizing about drinking or scheming up plans to drink without even realizing it. It's hell. I can't enjoy anything without booze screaming into my brain.

I'm just trying to stay positive. I never knew I could go 6 whole months sober. That's crazy. But I don't want to relapse again. I wish I could afford therapy or something. For now I'll just try and learn and keep fighting...",40,0

I'm writing this not because I want to, but because your encouragement and relapse reports have been so helpful to my own sobriety.

After 111 sober days, my longest streak since I picked up drinking, I got drunk on Saturday. I had first planned to go 100 days and then break it for a friend's bachelor party. Around halfway through, I decided I'd keep going. Sobriety was so nice, and my life had become better than I ever anticipated. But when it came to most of my friends, I felt like I was sitting on the sidelines. They'd call me in to play only if there wasn't some party or happy hour. I'm in my early 30s, so this sense of isolation hasn't been too bad. I hike often and love spending time with my wife and dog. But I didn't want to feel like an observer at this bachelor party. I agonized over it for days, if not weeks, and ultimately decided it was worth drinking for.

I cracked open the first beer and felt like I was 17 again. Like I was doing something wrong and the cops could come at any moment. It neither tasted great nor produced the kind of feeling that I thought I was missing out on. I kept drinking, albeit more slowly than everyone else, for the rest of the day and into the night.

I didn't do anything bad. I had a fine time. I wasn't depressed about breaking my streak. But chaos colored the occasion, and I was right there for the ride. In the end, the day was a mess of jumbled memories, half-present conversations, and movement.

I know I would've enjoyed myself just as much, likely more, had I abstained.

Now, I'm on day two of a hangover. I slept much of yesterday away. In between naps, I ate a bunch of junk food and battled physical pain. I'm exhausted today. I won't work much, which is fine because I make my own schedule. I probably won't exercise. I doubt I'll eat healthy. It'll be another wasted day.

But it'll be another sober day.

Here are some reasons why I don't intend to return to drinking, regardless of the occasion.

- Getting drunk isn't as fun as I remembered. The day sped by and left me little to show for it.

- Being hungover sucks. Period.

- Even when a drinking session goes all right, it's wrong. I can't help but think how much I enjoy my sober time and self. I have more to offer everyone when I'm actually me. I'm more fun and a better husband and friend.

- Drinking interferes with good habits. I've worked hard to build routines around exercise, particularly hitting my spin bike. I'm letting myself off the hook right now due to the hangover, and that's a tough consequence to consider.

- Drinking prevents me from doing what I actually want to do. Had I stayed sober this weekend, I would've went hiking. Being physically, emotionally, and physiologically available for treks through the woods is a big reason why I cut down my drinking three years ago. Sacrificing a day to the gods of the couch feels awful.

- I don't need drinking to bond with people. My friends are my friends. They might have their own struggles with the bottle, but they don't expect me to indulge. I learned on Saturday that they respect the hell out of what I've been doing. Some have avoided hanging out with me because they didn't want to tempt me. Others want to quit drinking themselves.

My return to drinking delivered precisely what it always has: a cloudy time followed by days of lethargy. That's something I'd rather leave in the past. Because no matter its strong associations to good times, drinking takes much more than it gives. And I'm done letting it rob me of who I really am.",221,0

I wasn't ever a raging alcoholic, but when I drank (like most Brits) I drank to excess, and made some very questionable decisions. Since going sober, my life has been on a huge upswing, and although I think giving up booze had a lot to do with it, it would be nice to sit and have a drink with my partner again.

I went cold turkey on the drinking for the first month, and reintroduced occasional weekend ciders here and there.

I also worked up to walking the dogs 3.5km every morning, two 3km afternoon runs a week and a 5km parkrun every Saturday. I went from 89Kg to just under 70Kg in about 9 months and my 5km parkrun time went from a wheezy 48 minutes to my PB of 26:50 ...

All was going great, I was healthier, happier and only having the occasional drink.

Then COVID hit, along with a heel injury. I already work from home, but being cut off from my weekend activities just made having an extra drink and less than healthy food too easy. parkrun being cancelled was the final nail in the coffin, I kept up the Saturday runs for a couple of months but lost motivation about a month ago.

And so I sit here on my 48th birthday, back up at 83Kg and looking at the two bottles of bourbon that I was given for my birthday. And I did not drink them, put them in the back of the cupboard and made a promise that I will not drink again until I get back down to 73Kg, and even then only in moderation on special occasions.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hello my friends! I hope you all are having a nice Monday.

I talked yesterday about discomfort and learning to embrace it rather than avoid it it. Today I want to share a quote I love and talk a little bit about grief. The quote is by Rumi, who to be honest with you, I actually know very little about. Other than what a quick Google search taught me once. But the man is very quotable, and has some profound words of wisdom. The quote I want to share is, ""Grief can be the garden of compassion. If you keep your heart open through everything, your pain can become your greatest ally in your life's search for love and wisdom."" I find these words to be very true for me. and when I first heard it, it made me think of all you wonderful people here. We all have a shared pain, and many of us have felt at times like we were perhaps irredeemable, but it is exactly that pain that makes each one of you so unbelievably compassionate, and your compassion is what makes SD so amazing, and brings so much healing and light and love into so many lives. And not just the lives of those of us who post here, or lurk here, but the lives of our families and friends. There is an amazing and beautiful ripple effect at play. So today I'd like to invite you all to reframe the pain, shame and grief that you might have around your drinking, and consider that perhaps the very things you might hate yourself for are the exact things that have helped to make you amazing, beautiful, compassionate and wise.

There is another Rumi quote that I love, which is along similar lines. ""The wound is the place where the Light enters you."" The wound caused by my drinking is the place where the light of knowing you all has entered me. And words will never properly express my gratitude for that. I'm so thankful for each of you.

I'm youngish (25) and the one thing that always gets in the way of my sobriety is the thought that I won't ever be able to drink again. Like my life won't be enjoyable or that there has to be some moments in my life where I'm going to drink again. I guess when I'm daydreaming sometimes about being succesful and happy, I'm thinking about being on vacation or in a cool setting somewhere and having a drink. (There is also some FOMO because I'm at the age and have a friend group where drinking parties are still a main source of fun.)

Maybe the reason why it's so easy for me to do 3 months is because in the back of my mind I'm telling myself that I will be able to drink again.

I know that I won't ever accomplish the things I want to accomplish if I have alcohol in my life but i still find it hard to accept a life without alcohol for some reason.

Any advice to get over this way of thinking? Or any advice in general is appreciated

I‚Äôm new to the community. I‚Äôve quit drinking several times in the past few years, but never with any lasting success. I‚Äôm at it again, though. 

I was actually at a used bookstore a couple of days ago looking for poetry. It was one of those bookstores with books covering all the walls from floors to ceiling and with so many shelves you can actually get lost in it. I was trying to make my way out of the maze to check-out when, out of the corner of my eye, I saw the Addiction and Recovery section. I hesitated for a moment and self-consciously looked around me to make sure I was alone. Then I tentatively perused the shelf until I landed on the 30-Day solution. 

I know I‚Äôm only on Day 2, but something feels different this time. Maybe it‚Äôs the fact that I‚Äôm getting older and my health has become a genuine concern. Or maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm performing all the action steps in the book diligently. Either way, I wanted to introduce myself to everyone.

Here‚Äôs what I think I‚Äôve learned; if you can develop a Faith in Hope, you‚Äôll do well. 

Now add to that a willingness to work, to actually have the courage to make your ideas into action. That takes courage. A courage that can be mustered up with Faith in Hope that your actions will be rewarded and accepted by the World. We all have ideas, have the courage to step out and create. All of Life is Artistry. In that I mean, an Artist has an idea and then goes about a series of actions to bring that idea into realty. Most every move we make has a thought/idea/intention that we then make into realty. We each do it all the time. Start breaking big ideas, or dreams of what you wan, into small bits that you can act on. And then like a hike, start moving through life one step at a time on your way to a bigger goal. The metaphor extends in that like a journey along a path; we don‚Äôt often know what lies ahead. Sometimes we worry that there‚Äôs no way around or over, but as we take each step closer, the path continues to reveal itself. One step at a time. Don‚Äôt forget to appreciate the view as you turn back and see the progress you‚Äôve made. 

And lastly, treat people well. Be warm and friendly. Engaging. Want the best for everyone around you. And then behave as such. Being outwardly friendly draws more people to wanting  good for you. And trust me, throughout life, having the people around you wanting good for you pays off. That energy comes back best in the form of reciprocity for good energy we put out. And that is something we can be in control of. This speaks back to what I was saying before; our intentions are the ideas that we bring into realty through our actions. For whatever reason, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but the World seems to respond best to those that go out and engage in it. Through observation and personal experience. I‚Äôve decided that‚Äôs a behavior I‚Äôd like to emulate. Anyways, be warm and giving and honest with people. They respond well to it. It puts us in a better frame of mind too; thinking more positively about the world since we‚Äôre looking to interact with it in a positive way. 

So I kinda skipped the have Faith in Hope part so I guess I‚Äôm gonna go on a bit more. Here‚Äôs how I developed a Faith in Hope. I started setting about with these ideas to actively engage the world. Be open hearted. Started taking small steps to actually be who I thought I wanted to be. And I spent some time pondering how I wanted to be. That‚Äôs when I realized it‚Äôs one thing to say you want to be something, it‚Äôs an entirely different thing to do it. All About That Action Boss. I decided it was better to expend the energy to walk a few minutes to enjoy the sunset than to watch one on TV. As I started really putting words into actions, I noticed good things happen. Little by little, things started looking up. Shit, I remember just being happy to make eye contact and smile at strangers. But as you pay attention and notice little positive outcomes of the effort you put forth, the confidence in the process begins to build. Eventually you find you‚Äôve bought in. So it‚Äôs kinda like the hiking thing of taking small steps towards a goal and the first part about, essentially, actions speak louder than words. 

Thanks for reading if you hung around. Just reflecting on a hectic period on my life and dissecting how I got to this point. The hectic part is actually the last part of bringing a remodeling a house. Even with a contractor, this is so far over my head and has such a big payoff for us, I‚Äôm sort of amazed that it‚Äôs all coming together. But I think these things, in my few years in so far are some of my biggest takeaways.",8,0

Long time lurker, first time poster.

I am working on sobriety this year, have been since rehab in July. I've had a few slip ups, but am currently on my third week. After rehab, I went to a doctor and had blood work done. Turns out my red blood cell count were shockingly low. Bad enough anemia that I was referred to a hemoglobin-ist at Florida cancer centers of America (how's that for terrifying).

They did some initial lab work and confirmed my red blood cells are so low, I was very close to needing a transfusion. Instead, I had two iron IV treatments, and was scheduled for blood work in six weeks to see how it went. The doctor marveled that I hadn't collapsed on the floor from lack of energy. I'm 31, female, drinking for 15 years, heavy binge drinker with the occasional break the last three or four years, if that helps. 

I am getting more and more nervous as the labs get closer. Has anyone here had a similar issue? Did it resolve? Did you have the iron treatment thingies or something else? I used to get terrible episodes of gastritis after a couple weeks of binge drinking each time, but I had no idea that would ever lead to an issue like this. Thank you all for being here, this community has helped me tremendously the last few weeks.

I‚Äôm in a better frame of mind now. One thing that really holds me back, is I really feel like I gave life 100% and it still didn‚Äôt work out. I was always depressed and just couldn‚Äôt work through it. I occasionally binged on porn or beer to cope, and off and on did it regularly. I always felt so alone, because there was no one close to me who loved me or knew what was going on. Probably having it together on the outside made it worse.

In one sense, I feel like I owe it to myself to try again. I can find and attract good women but I have emotional issues and a fragile social network. It will be easy to relapse-not so much on alcohol but on cam sites, and if I do that on top of having emotional issues most good women won‚Äôt stay with me or be very happy about it. And I‚Äôll feel worse and likely act out more.

I can find good male friends too, but I‚Äôm so negative or anxious a lot of the time they don‚Äôt want to be around me.


I feel like the answer here is, yeah life is hard. It will not be easy to give up porn/cams, learn yet another job while trying to cross train, find a girl, start a family, build a social network. I feel very lonely and like being loved is at best a fragile, passing thing.

But the best thing I can do is take it one step at a time, and do my best. If it works out I‚Äôll be happy I did it. And if not, I was going to die eventually anyway. At least I stuck it out for a while.",4,0

I commented. And that day counter, man-oh-man, I checked that thing at least twice a day. Seeing that number hit 100, then 500, then 1,000 made me so proud of myself. I didn't every want to loose those days and start back at zero. I was in awe of all those with day counts in the thousands.

See, back then all I could do was think about alcohol. It was my singular focus. At this time, my brain wanted me to think about it as a best friend who had left and wasn't coming back. But the people here, with their stories and heartaches, supported something I already knew deep down; I was saying goodbye to an enemy. An abuser that never deserved my time or friendship.

So here I am 5 years later. I don't even know my day count anymore. I read a post in the sub every once in awhile, and I hardly ever post. The reason that my attention to it has shifted is in part because of the big impact this sub has had on my recovery. I am grateful to each of you and your effort to battle and support one another in this most valiant of tasks.

5 years ago I didn't even know how to visualize having joy without alcohol. An alcohol free life seemed like an infinite chore, void of the best pleasure life offered - inebriation. But knowing that others were making a push for a better life, seeing that day count, and reading the experiences of others in the struggle, helped me to slowly gain those sober moment of joy. 

If you are in those early days, keep stringing together those hours and then days. Eventually, you might start realizing that you're counting years. Joy without alcohol exists. Just like when I was drinking, joy can be fleeting and difficult to find. But in sober life, when joy comes, I am present and I will always remember every moment of it.

I've always felt incredibly stressed and exhausted when I get back from trips because I would drink the whole time. This time I slept well, ate a few delicious meals that we cooked, saw so much wildlife, went on countless bike rides, played chess, drank a quiet cup of coffee by myself and watched the birds each morning... it was wonderful.

I can't believe I actually did it! My liver enzymes went back to being completely normal and I even got a positive comment about my cholesterol panel!

I've haven't felt this clean and cozy in a long time, it is the best feeling!

&#x200B;

One of the best things that has happened in this short time is that I had my birthday, the first one sober in years and years. My father, who is getting older, gave me a really really special meaningful present of a few things that he has held on to for years (think a family keepsake). He was quite emotional giving it to me and I just couldn't even begin to say how grateful I was to be sober for the moment. Previously, I was just fuzzy all the time and would have been drinking wine for half the day before any kind of social gathering. Being able to really be present for that just felt like such a gift and that's one of the main things that I have realized about being sober.. how much I was using alcohol to avoid having deep and meaningful relationships with people. I forgot how damn important that is and am so grateful that I get to be really close and present with the ones I love right now, especially since everything is so precarious and scary right now. Another really good family thing that has happened is that my mom, who is not a black out drinker but is a religious 2-3 beers a day drinker, has also been cutting back and has said that she feels inspired to do so because I have been telling her about how much it helps with sleep, mood, energy levels, etc.

&#x200B;

Anyways it has just been overwhelmingly positive so far, honestly a spiritual experience getting sober, even though obviously there are days where I still feel heavily tempted to drink. But I don't think there's any question that sobriety offers us such a more connected way of living and I can't wait to keep going. I hope that anyone who is thinking about trying out quitting gets the chance to; I was seriously so locked in shame and depression and regret and self-disgust and I cannot BELIEVE how much my life has improved in only two months.",41,0

My closest friends have not taken it well and I refuse to justify or apologise for finally doing the thing I wanted to do for a few years. 

For context I (25f) used to be a party girl. I have been a binge drinker since 15 and that became part of my identity. I tried to cut down and quit many times before and always just gave up or slid back into old habits. A few years ago I wrote my closest friends and family a letter letting them know I couldn‚Äôt keep on drinking like I did and needed to get sober. It didn‚Äôt last very long. And now I have finally done it. These 40 days have been difficult. No one tells you about the depression and the feelings of isolation (especially when it‚Äôs such a big part of who you are and how you socialise/ face life‚Äôs challenges) but overall it has been amazing! And i am so proud. Two weeks into my sobriety I went to my closest friend‚Äôs birthday. My friend got very upset with me when she found out I wouldn‚Äôt be drinking at her birthday. She said she wished I had told her before I came that I wouldn‚Äôt be drinking.I told her and my other friends I was not drinking because it is really messing with my stomach (I have gastritis)I didn‚Äôt want to get into my depression etc.I still wanted to be there for her and have fun with everyone. I had a good time and left at 2am (usually I would be out until 8/10am) I was proud of myself and had a good time. I told my therapist as much.

Fast forward two weeks and my friend and I have felt very distant. I have been reaching out and she‚Äôs been cold. I felt horrible that two weeks. I had crippling anxiety and couldn‚Äôt eat. I finally speak on the phone  with her and she says she was upset because I hadn‚Äôt made it clear I wouldn‚Äôt be drinking and that I seemed like I wasn‚Äôt having fun ( came across cold and judgmental about everyone else drinking, despite me pouring drinks for everyone and participating in the drinking games with juice) so she decided she would give me the same energy. I explained I was always depressed and anxious after my binges and couldn‚Äôt keep drinking as I did. we planned to meet in a few days. I think we both expected me to grovel and go into detail about what I was going through and apologise for not being ‚Äúfun enough ‚Äú (I even considered showing her my correspondence with my therapist to prove I had had a good time)but when I saw her I decided I don‚Äôt owe anyone an apology or explanation. I don‚Äôt need to breakdown my suicidal thoughts in order for the people that claim to love me to accept I am no longer drinking. I don‚Äôt have to give my closest friend a warning that I am not drinking before I come to her birthday. Maybe I was off but maybe shouldn‚Äôt have implied I needed to warn her I wasn‚Äôt drinking as of she would disinvite me.

I didn‚Äôt tell anyone I wasn‚Äôt drinking but just slyly ordered sparkling water and lime all weekend at the open bar. This was a heavy drinking crowd and everyone got so hammered, I don‚Äôt think anyone really noticed I wasn‚Äôt drinking. I actually had a lot of fun and danced and got to act silly with everyone- except I actually remember the night! I slipped out around 11pm and went to bed early. Was actually way more fun than when I used to drink and black out. 

27 days sober under my belt and I‚Äôm feeling so strong, positive, radiant, and healthy. Everyone was commenting on how nice I looked all weekend (no joke! Sobriety must be doing something). It‚Äôs such a drastic change from when I was drinking (at least) a bottle of wine every night on weeknights and for a wedding I used to pregame hard and typically be blackout on the dance floor before getting carried home.

Not going to lie- I had SOME MAJOR CRAVINGS when I got to the wedding weekend. I almost caved. But then I promised myself that I would just make it through ONE night with no drinking. I looked at my counter and saw how close I was to 30 days and that inspired me to make it one more night. Once I decided to stay sober one more night, it felt manageable. Thanks for that tip you all.

My problem has always been porn and recently cam sites but generally groups dedicated to sex don‚Äôt help as much for me. Probably because church/shaming was one reason I developed a problem. Maybe family problems too.

I started drinking alone, specifically for effect ~8 years ago when I was 23. Was 20 drinks/week for a long time, then pushed up toward 35 in 2018. Continued pretty steadily until this year when I was averaging 50-60 during and after Quarantine. I had it back down to around 30 and then had to travel for work, so recently I‚Äôve had none for 2.5 months.

The alcohol hasn‚Äôt really been a big deal for me. I tried taking some sleep aids and 4 shots of listerine at one point, but just felt nauseous. No buzz. I feel like I process emotions almost exclusively through either porn or alcohol. I‚Äôm not sure what to do.

This week, planning to stay off caffeine entirely or pretty damn near. Limit porn use to 20 min/day, and no cam sites. And continue not to drink. Start going to the gym, diet.

I don‚Äôt know how hard to specifically to hold myself accountable, because I tend to get overwhelmed and relapse if I go too hard. But I need to also try my best.

Anyway that‚Äôs what‚Äôs up with me. I really liked this video and hope I can find this type of healing, feeling, self knowledge and community, too.

I've tried all the tricks and tips in the book. Left clothes and blankets that smell like me, tried the litterbox, warmed up fishy food. My friends and family did a wide perimeter and handed out fliers to neighbors. We asked for permission to look under their porches and nothing. Put up posters in the area and alerted the local shelter.

He's a giant scardy cat so I still believe he's just hiding somewhere but I can't find him. All of my neighbors but one were very friendly and said they'd keep an eye out (one lady said he was probably dead like a cold-hearted witch). I don't know what to do I just keep imagining him scared and hungry.

I know its a waiting game at this point to see if someone spots him but it's killing me on the inside. I had an outdoor cat get run over about 5 years ago which is why I made my new cat strictly indoor and I'm devastated right now.

I used to be an alcohaulic and drug addict.  I‚Äôm 29 and have 3 kids I am so beyond proud of and a beautiful wife of 7+ years.  

I got a few stories among a lot to share and not one of them is the reason I‚Äôm sober today. I will be sober from alcohol 1 year on the 25th of this month.  And then 3ish years sober from drugs. I don‚Äôt remember the last time I used so idk.  But sober! 

I am the type that can drink ALOT and maintain.  I could be blacked out drunk and still coherent to the point where some don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm that drunk.  I made a habit of 6-10 IPA style beers a day  and then I‚Äôd drink cheap ass whiskey and coke.  As far as drugs went I used heroin. I smoked it.  

1. About 5-6 years ago I bought this big jacked up truck. It was an old square body Chevy sitting on mammoth tires.  Big heavy ass truck.  I didn‚Äôt have that truck a week and me and some ‚Äúfriends‚Äù got to partying and decided to go four wheeling up on this notorious mountain near where we live.  I ignored my wife the whole night.  We end up at some high school bonfire.  I get blacked out and decide it‚Äôs time to go home about 2-3 AM.  The people I‚Äôm with don‚Äôt even try and stop me.  It‚Äôs a good 15 miles down the mountain to the highway and then another 10 home.  I didn‚Äôt make it to the high way thank god! I fell asleep behind the wheel and the truck drifted off the dirt road and the 40‚Äù tire grabbed the bank and I basically rolled the truck a couple times and then walked to a point where I had to knock on some ones door so I could use their phone.  I had my new wife who was pregnant come pick me up.  The truck was totaled.  I spent my tax return on it   

2. A few years after that I had a better job and a nicer truck.  Again a big lifted jacked up heavy truck.  But this time I owe on this truck to a bank.  This truck was my dream truck.  Still doing drugs and drinking a lot.  Same story basically.  I didn‚Äôt make it to the high way and had fallen asleep and put the truck on it‚Äôs side.  Thank you Jesus for not letting me make the highway.  Both stories I would have killed someone if I made it to the highway.   
That same evening I crawled out of the window of my rolled dream truck and instead of grabbing my wallet or phone or jacket (winter time) I grabbed my hand gun and went off walking towards the closest friends house which was MILES.  At some point I slipped on the icy road. I had both hands in the front pocket of my hoodie holding my gun which was loaded and no safety.  As I was falling my hands were cold and clumsy and I could only get my left hand out in time to block my face from meeting ice. Well right hand was on the gun and it went off when I hit the ground. A gnarly hollow tip went through my left arm missing everything important.   

3. This takes place before the two previous stories.  At 19 I got 2 duis within a month    I had to go to jail for a month, I had several months of an alcohol monitor that was on my ankle, 1 month of house arrest, 1 year of court appointed classes.  


On the 25th of last year I found myself very drunk and SCREAMING at my wife and her mother over shit that is not important.  I almost hit my wife.   Almost.  At this point we also have our son.  So I just stopped.  I didn‚Äôt want my kids growing up always seeing a beer in my hand.  I was Ana amazing athlete and threw it all away to party. I don‚Äôt want my kids doing that too.  I have almost killed myself several times and have paid thousands of dollars all due to alcohol.   

The drugs stopped because alcohol was better and easier to get.  I worked on the road a lot in the last 10 years so that helped as well because I would be gone sometimes for weeks and then come home and get high as fuck. Eventually I just stopped caring about heroin which started with pills in high school.  My cousin has hep c now and unfortunately never pulled away.  

I don‚Äôt consider myself a recovering alcoholic I just don‚Äôt look at it that way.  It was something I used to do and now I fuckin don‚Äôt.   I cannot lose what I have now.  I‚Äôm lucky I didn‚Äôt kill someone. 

 I drove drunk sooooooo much. Because of my line of work I was always in a different town and I got into the habit of driving around smashing beers and listening to music. My wife didn‚Äôt come with me much on the road.  

4. I was in Yakima Washington 2 years ago. I was working in a rock pit. I decided to go to this awesome brewery which was across a town I didn‚Äôt know.  I got hammered and some how made it back to where I was staying. No recollection of driving.  No underwear or socks and I shit in my pants.  Not a lot but it was there.  

5.  A few years back I was I North Dakota working. Me and couple buddies needed to go to Walmart for supplies which is about 45 minutes from where we stayed.  We bought a 18 pack on our way out of town. I had 3-4 on our way.   After Walmart we went bowling and I had several beers and a couple jack and cokes. We head home and still had some beers so we were drinking those.  We end up getting pulled over for speeding  and everyone‚Äôs obviously drunk.  I can hold my composure tho and the cop walked up on the passenger side. I told him I was their ride and hadn‚Äôt been drinking.  He gives us a warning and we‚Äôre on our way.  Instead of going home I go to the bar with those same guys. We close that place down.  This time I‚Äôm a lot drunker.   I go to drop the one guy off and as I‚Äôm leaving to take the other 2 home I was changing radio stations and didn‚Äôt see the stop sign and had to slam on my brakes  the nose of my truck went out in the road a tad bit right when a cop was driving by.  This time the cop has me get out and sit in his car with him.  Mainly because it was winter and it‚Äôs cold as shit there.  My drunk friends think I‚Äôm going to jail.  Me and the cop sat there talking about his AR sitting between us.  He runs my name and let‚Äôs me go! Twice in one night.   

6. I have ran several times from the cops drunk and got away.  

Anyways I got more just figured I‚Äôd tell a couple.  Not even sure if this is where this should be posted.   

Ultimately I‚Äôm sober now and I‚Äôve lost a lot of weight I own my own company and I make a good living at home just miles from every drug one could want and every old bar I used to hang out in.  I didn‚Äôt need rehab but maybe working out of town was my rehab.  Everyone in my life bailed on me including my dad.  We still barely have a relationship.  The 3rd child I spoke of is in their custody and I had her with an ex before my wife and I.  I was very very deep in pills and alcohol.  I‚Äôm trying to rebuild the best I can.  I hope I can teach the 2 children that do know me what life‚Äôs really about and that alcohol and drugs will own you.",11,0

I was tidying up after breakfast and as I walked through my mud room from putting out the garbage, I noticed that the main hallway/foyer of our house was tidy, floors swept and shiny, a lovely vase of harvest flowers that I bought on the table. Pass through to the family room, where the furniture has been rearranged into a nice gathering spot in front of the TV, and the two hutches I bought recently to bring some organization of the family chaos create a lovely welcoming space. It is dusted and vacuumed and no longer smells musty, and my throat doesn‚Äôt get scratchy when I walk in. 

Into the kitchen. Counters and stove wiped, floors clean, sinks and taps gleaming.

For the first time in probably 8 years, I didn‚Äôt hate my house. 

I didn‚Äôt hate the wall colours despite them being the same drab terra cotta brown. I didn‚Äôt hate the old saggy couches. I didn‚Äôt get angry at the clutter because it isn‚Äôt there anymore.

If someone called me and said they wanted to pop in for a visit in the next 15 minutes, I would say ‚ÄúSee you soon!‚Äù and throw on the kettle, rather than freaking out about the mess and state of the house. 

Sobriety is freeing me up to build the life I always dreamed I would have. I have the energy to tidy, the enthusiasm to care about what is outside me, to want the world around me to reflect how I feel inside.

I also dumped two half-drunk bottles of wine that have been on my kitchen counter for ages. Literal ages. I have no idea when I opened them or why I was keeping them, except maybe that you just don‚Äôt throw out perfectly good booze. Today I decided bugger that, I‚Äôm never going to drink them, they are not fit for company if ever we have people over again (fecking COVID), so I dumped them. I took the empties to the wine bottle recycling box in the garage and discovered a full, unopened bottle of my cheap old swill wine and an unopened bottle of rum inside. I have no idea when I bought those, but decided to put them in the liquor cabinet for my fianc√©. 

As I opened the liquor cabinet, I was surprised by what I found in it. Bottles of alcohol I used to drink, with alcohol left in them. 

I had no idea they were there, and I was so happy to realize that.

A few weeks ago, I knew damn well how much liquor was in that cabinet and whether or not I needed to go to the liquor store to stock up.

Today I didn‚Äôt. I still don‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt bother to check the volume of liquor left because I don‚Äôt particularly care. If we have company ever again I can offer it up, but I sure as hell don‚Äôt want it.

I‚Äôm building the life of my dreams and I‚Äôm so grateful. Thank you, sobriety.

I'm about a week in to this sober journey (again) and it's been pretty easy during my busy week.  Like most, its the down time where I struggle.  I'm a craft beer nut and finding and trying new and different beer was as much a fun adventure as it was about getting drunk.  

Yesterday, I found a local art and craft festival happening outdoors.  Not my typical excursion but it was outside and something fun to do.  But walking around for a few minutes I realized something odd.  Everyone had a beer in their hand.  EVERYONE.  At 11am. Seemed odd until I discovered that the back half of the arts and craft festival was a craft beer festival as well.  Even worse, some of my favorite local breweries we're pourng.  In an instant, that's all my brain could focus on.  

There was no magic or crazy technique to how I got out of there sober.  I literally had to fight my brain the entire time I was there.  I don't remember any of the arts and crafts I saw after indiscovered the beer   I was far too distracted.  There were a few moments where I my drunk brain almost won and talked me into the mythical ""just one beer"".

These are some of my closest friends for over 8 years. This year, for a number of reasons, we've been growing apart and I've desperately been trying to hold onto these friendships. Their time during the pandemic has still been going out and partying while I've mostly been at home with my significant other. I've felt left out and like their lives are going on without me. 

Yesterday, I caved and had a few of them over to hang out and drink. It still wasn't right. I thought if I did what they did and we just all hung out and got drunk, I wouldn't feel so distant from them. I was still in tears at the end of the night that I'm losing my friends. Alcohol isn't the answer.

Today is day 1. I've always used alcohol as a crutch in social situations to make me feel less awkward and like I fit in. I need to learn to have friendships and fun without alcohol. I want to have hobbies, interests, and things to talk about that aren't just drinking. I hope some of these friendships can survive, but maybe it's time to make new friends.

During lockdown I drank a lot. The case of beer on a friday night would become a case on friday, another on saturday and one for through the week. I done this for 4 months then went to a stag party the next week.

As usual far to much drink was consumed and I spend the next few days feeling like crap. It was then I decided to stop it altogether. 

That was six weeks ago and I havent had a drop of alcohol since. The first few weeks I was buying alcohol free beer and playing the xbox with friends as usual etc but as the weeks go on I'm doing it less and less and actually an starting to find my friends annoying.

I used to sit playing fifa or whatever until 3 or 4 am but I'm finding my friends are becoming more and more annoying as the night goes on as they are drinking and I am not. It's like something has changed inside me and I just cant be bothered any more.

At the start I thought I would miss drinking and wouldnt last being sober,  but the longer I refrain from it the more I realise how much I dont actually like it and how much of a dick it turns people into when intoxicated.

How do people deal with the losing friends part though? I havent exactly lost friends, it's just that the only thing I have in common with all mine is alcohol. I feel my life moving in a different direction since I stopped drinking and no longer want to do the things they do.. is this normal?",2,1

I‚Äôve been trying to quit drinking for a few years now. I know I‚Äôm an alcoholic, no question about that, and it runs in my family. 

Drinking hasn‚Äôt been ‚Äúfun‚Äù for a long, long while. I‚Äôve embarrassed myself, gotten in physical fights more than once, been hospitalized about 3 times for throwing up blood for days after going on binges, said and did absolutely horrible things. Drank f‚Äôing mouthwash when I just NEEDED another drink, but was out and stores were closed. I just have never gotten a DUI ONLY because I live in a city where I don‚Äôt need to drive and don‚Äôt have a car. Otherwise I‚Äôm sure I would have. 

I‚Äôve tried AA, and I did think it helped. But the group I went to was very...cliquey. Like extremely so and not very welcoming. They also had a weird rule that you couldn‚Äôt talk about cross additions which I felt was very unhelpful (I‚Äôm cross addicted to cocaine and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not alone in that) I also didn‚Äôt relate to my sponsor too much. Maybe I‚Äôm just making excuses...

Anyway, all friday I had another one of my blood vomiting, doubled over in pain episodes (no hospital visit though) and I just really want this to be the last time. 

I have the upmost respect and admiration for people who get sober. My dad got sober in AA and has about 28, 29 years clean. I‚Äôve never seen him drink. Why can‚Äôt I seem to care for myself like that? 

All my friends are supportive. And not one of them has said ‚Äúbut you don‚Äôt have a problem!‚Äù In fact all their reactions to when I said ‚ÄúI want to stop drinking‚Äù was ‚Äúthat‚Äôs good.‚Äù Sometimes I feel like they‚Äôre saints for not giving up on me. Although they were spared the worst‚ÄîI became a solitary drinker after a while. My boyfriend has seen the worst. Somehow we are still together after 5 years.

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hello Friends! I have the wonderful privilege of hosting the DCI this week, and I'm really looking forward to getting to know you all a bit better!

I want to talk a little bit about discomfort today. In general our lives are designed to avoid discomfort at all costs. We throw tons of money at avoiding discomfort. We hate the things that make us uncomfortable. We're so afraid of it. Yet, we are uncomfortable more than we even realize. Everything from a bad taste in your mouth, to a bug bite on your butt is discomfort. I drank to avoid discomfort. I drank because I was lonely. I drank to avoid the discomfort of boredom. I drank to make the mundane daily life tasks ""more enjoyable"". In short, I drank because I found being myself uncomfortable. I found so many of the things that make me a human living this crazy experience we call life uncomfortable, so I drank. And what was the result? The most extreme discomfort I have ever known. Then I drank to avoid the discomfort of quitting. I read over and over here on SD and in other sources from other people who have gotten sober that it was ""really hard"" and that scared me. I didn't want it to be hard. I didn't want to experience discomfort. I was in the full-time business of avoiding it. And yet I was so terribly uncomfortable all of the time.

I heard someone on the Recovery Elevator podcast say recently, ""you have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable,"" and it really resonated with me. Through being sober, and not frantically seeking to avoid all the discomfort that life can bring, I have come to appreciate discomfort. It's the discomfort of a good workout that makes us stronger. It's the discomfort of giving up our free time to practice art, or music, or writing that improves our talents. It's the discomfort of helping a friend move that makes us a good friend and the one that can be called on in difficult times. As parents, it's the discomfort of disciplining our children that helps mold them into good people. It is the discomfort of painful emotions that make our lives meaningful and rich.

I know that wiser people have put what I'm trying to say more eloquently, but what I want to say is, don't be afraid of discomfort. It is where the rewards of life can be found. So often we want to avoid the hard things, but it is the hard things that really make us. They make this whole experience worthwhile and meaningful. Get cozy with your discomfort. Get cozy with those cravings you might be feeling, because even though they are uncomfortable, sitting with them is less painful than running from them and trying to escape. I got cozy with avoiding pain and discomfort, and it brought more pain and discomfort than I could have imagined. Don't be afraid of difficult. Embrace it. It is truly where all that is worthwhile comes from. The difficulty and discomfort of doing what is good and right will always be preferable to the pain that comes from avoiding it.

So, that said, I hope you all have a very comfortable Sunday. But should you find the limits of your comfort tested today, be fearless and lean into it. You won't regret it.

I love you all, and I will not drink with you today!",100,0

There were 4 of us, and in the past we would put away some pretty good amounts of wine, beer and liquor.  Tonight's event was alcohol-free.  In a phone call to the host earlier in the day, I said, ""Hey look, I know that you would usually have several bottles of wine on hand when I came over, but I wanted you to know that I stopped drinking last January.  So no need to lay in a supply of booze for me.""  He was cool about it...he said he had cut down to ""one beer a week"" himself.   When I got to his house he offered beverage choices of water, ice tea, beer and wine.  I said, ""Water with a little ice, thanks.""

Everything was fine at the get-together except for one guest who kept chirping about how she wanted a beer, and ""isn't anybody going to have a beer with me?  I don't want to have one if no one else will,"" etc.  The usual stuff.  We all said no thanks, but she brought it up 2 or 3 more times until I finally said, ""Will you just get a beer if you want one?""  She never did, and she also never stopped talking, all the way through the game, and I noticed that the host upped the volume on the TV...I think he was trying to drown her out.  Geez, I wish she had just had that damn beer and mellowed out  a bit.

Anyway just wanted to share that I was successful in not drinking, at the first social event I'd been to in 7 months.  We maintained social distance, and I had some tasty grilled pork ribs,  baked beans, and water.  It can be done!",11,0

Exercise is the miracle cure we've always had, but for too long we've neglected to take our recommended dose. If exercise were a pill, it would be one of the most cost-effective drugs ever invented. The benefits of increasing our activity levels and minimising our sedentary time are huge!

The idea behind this thread that u/Accomplished-Today has been doing a **fantastic job** of pioneering is to get team SD acting together and supporting each other so together we can make a real impact on our health.

Whether you are just starting out (which can be a little scary) or a seasoned fitness fanatic then this is the place to talk about it. Sharing our highs and our lows, our wins and our losses and our fitness, diet and weight loss goals can really help to keep us motivated. Everything counts here, if your raising your heart rate, breathing faster and feeling warmer you're doing it!

When it comes to exercising, it's important to find your own exercise path - you have the freedom to do whatever activities you like. If you hate the gym, you don't have to join one to get fit. If you hate running then don't do any! There are countless ways to exercise. Consider boxing, hiking, mountain biking, or dancing? Find out what you like and forget the rules.

Over the years the list of stuff I've done in the name of exercise is quite long. I've hiked, I've biked, I've hit things with racquets, I've hit things with bats, I've hit things with clubs. I've kicked stuff, thrown stuff, and ridden stuff. I've even climbed up cliffs and scrambled down caves (spelunked!), I've flown high up over the mountains, I've swum, sailed and surfed! When it comes to exercise there is a world of choice out there. Find the thing you love and live it!

This week for me I have got three runs in the bag. I have been struggling for time a bit recently since I am juggling childcare and work a lot more. It's been about a 19 mile week in total. One of those runs was a flat out 5k but the course isn't that flat so it wasn't going to be a PR.

I've still got two strava challenges to complete this month which are the harderst ones I joined! I've got a half marathon to run and a 100km bike ride to do. I'll have to crack on with these next week.

I suffered a pretty serious blow today. 

I had a dear friend who precipitously left me two years ago. This whole time, I have been occasionally (every four or five months, I guess), I would check their FB page to see if there was any activity. There never was. But on their birthday or a family holiday, I would leave a message telling them I missed them and wished they would contact me. 

Ten days ago, they did. I was able to FaceTime with them for about 15 minutes, and before we hung up, we talked about making plans to call again to play D&D as we used to do, although it would have to be telephonically since we now live in different stars. They said they had a full set of dice, but none of the books. 

They never called. I texted. No reply. I left a message on FB, telling them I had found the books online, and they could read them from there if they have a computer (they‚Äôre on PDF), but the hardcover books themselves run about $130 each. Nothing. There were about four or five attempts, all told, over the two weeks of my trying to get up with them. 

More Nothing. 

Finally, on Friday, I saw they had posted something on FB. It had nothing to do with me, but at least I knew that they SHOULD have seen my attempts to reach out. I waited one more day, and on Saturday afternoon I actually called them on the phone. They answered. It sounded like they had been sleeping and I woke them up. I asked if they were still interested in playing D&D and they said they were. I arranged to call my friend at 8 to talk about things, so they could go back to sleep and in the meantime, I would work on getting ready to roll up characters and hammer out a speech to lay out the campaign location and back story. 

I bet you can guess what happened when I called on FB‚Äôs Messenger app. You guessed it, my call failed to go through. I tried again, same result. So I called on my phone. The call quickly shunted me back to the keyboard. I tried again, and again it failed. 

Obviously, it wasn‚Äôt sunspots or a bad battery, the person was refusing my calls. 

I swear by my left testicle that if I had had any firewater in my house, I would have given my throat a right scorching from the 151 proof rotgut I used to drink. But I didn‚Äôt have any, and the store wasn‚Äôt going to be open at 9 on a Saturday night. 

So I have had some time to cool off. 

What helped was that literally seven minutes after I tried to make the calls, a VERY interesting post on FB showed on my screen. It was about how I (the author of the post) share my affection openly because I know what it‚Äôs like when nobody tells you they they have affection for me. I offer to help because I know what it‚Äôs like to need help and nobody offers, and I know how hard it is to ask for help. I have a lot to offer, and I know there are people who could use some help sometimes. But when I am taken for granted, or dismissed, I will bow out. I don‚Äôt give up when I‚Äôm needed, but if I‚Äôm not appreciated, I won‚Äôt be bothering you, or myself over you, anymore. 

I saw that post as being TOO timely as just coincidence. It was just exactly what I needed at exactly the time I needed it. It was, no doubt in my military mind about it, a miracle sent from God directly to me. 

I am already healing over this episode. I am still sober, and my stress is still over 400 some-odd days. (I am not looking it up right now, for fear my phone will delete this post if I minimize Reddit to look at my NOMO app to find the exact number of days.)

So, again and still,

I will NOT drink with you today.",13,0

It has been a rollercoaster ride. I struggle with alcohol but am very good at ""managing."" I don't drink in the morning, sometimes in the afternoon, but very frequently at night. On the weekends, I will blow out at least two nights and do some day drinking. I know alcohol has control over me because I spend so much time either planning my next drink, fantasizing about getting drunk, or nowadays I am consumed fighting with myself to NOT have that first drink that leads to hell. I look forward to a time when it doesn't cross my mind at all. 

I'm by most accounts successful at my work for decades now. I never drink at work. I have a family, and my great shame is that I have done so much drinking in front of my kids. I fear I have set a bad example for them, as my father did for me. I wish I had found help years ago.

I've been thinking for awhile about what I should say for this occasion, and I think this is it:

\- Stick with it! Day one, three hundred sixty-five, or ten thousand.

\- It gets better!!! I promise you no matter how dark your present circumstances are there \*will\* be better days ahead.

\- If you're just starting out, please take care of yourself. Consider asking your doctor for help if you think you need it. Detoxing cold turkey can be really dangerous. I regret my experience now. It was hell for the first few weeks without help. There is no shame in asking for help.

\- If you are crushing the carbs after quitting, it's normal. Ice cream and sour patch kids were my saviors. Remember, you're not quitting just one addiction. Don't forget alcohol is sugar. Your body will tell you what it needs.

\- If you can, talk to people you trust. If not, post to SD even if you need to share, or just vent. We're here for you.

\- Don't beat yourself up! No matter what you've done or think of yourself, that's in the past. You are a human being with inherent self worth. This might sound corny, but I used positive self-affirmations anytime that internal critic showed up. It took time, but it eventually worked. That voice went away. Maybe this will help :D

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd3g0K9KlBI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd3g0K9KlBI)

\- Break the cycle. This might be painful. Are those people you drink with really your friends? I know it can be tough in a relationship, but something to consider. Get a change of scenery. Try a new activity. Anything really to break the habits that trigger you to drink.

\- Last, remember that recognizing you have a problem and asking for help is not the act of a weak person. You are being courageous and brave setting on this path.

On an closing note, I thought I'd share something ironic that happened today. I just got home from visiting family for my recent birthday. On the way home, I stopped at the local grocery to pick some things up. On the way out, I ran into an old drinking buddy I haven't seen in almost a year. We talked for awhile catching up on the old gang. She mentioned that the old local spot was open with my favorite bartenders and some regulars there. I figured I would stop in quickly for a mineral water and order some food to go. Sitting at the bar, I realized I was sitting in the same spot where exactly one year ago I finally decided I was done drinking for good and having my last round. The bartenders and regulars were all super supportive. I just thought that was an interesting way to end this part of my journey.

Much love! Stay safe and strong friends. IWNDWYT

Here are the good things that I've noticed: No more hangovers. No more sneaking liquor around. No more worrying about what I said to my wife. No more hiding little bottles at work that id drink during my breaks. No more wondering what happened the previous night. I have always been relatively fit, so quitting drinking didn't lead to weight loss, but I am definitely more ripped and lean.


Here are the bad things that I've noticed: life is dull. Life is boring. I don't enjoy the things I used to when I used to drink. The shows I watched or the movies I'd see no longer amuse me. What was funny then is no longer humorous. I don't find anything entertaining. My life is dreadfully boring. I don't enjoy going to restaurants anymore because the food doesn't taste the same. I don't enjoy hanging out with my friends because it's weird being the guy not drinking (they're not alcoholics by any means, but a few beers in bbqs are nice). My family gatherings, while still great to spend time with them, don't excite me like they used to.

I feel like I made alcohol the key to excitement, but without it, I feel empty inside. I much prefer my life without liquor, don't get me wrong, but I do miss the fun that it brought.

I am staying sober for ME now (I tried doing it for other people, inlcuding my parents, in the past and it never stuck). I am proud of my progress but damn if it doesn‚Äôt also feel good to make them proud as well. In past sobriety attempts, I didn‚Äôt want to tell them because I think I knew I was going to continue to drink and disappoint them. This time I dont feel like that. 

I have told others too. Other family members, some friends. Even dates, people I had only just met, a casual ‚ÄòI dont drink‚Äô if it comes up. I used to feel shame that I couldn‚Äôt drink like a normal person. Now there‚Äôs a little bit of pride in knowing myself and staying clear-headed. 
 
Everyone is different. There is no one path. I just wanted to share my experience about how its been a nice benefit to update my parents (minimally) on  my sobriety. One day at a time, IWNDWYT",26,0

I started hiding bottles a few months ago, and last Sunday I went overboard. Of course my partner of 2 years knew something was up, and once I passed out he found 1 of the bottles. I woke up (probably still intoxicated) got out of bed, saw the empty bottle, and my heart dropped. Not only was I lying to him, but the way reality hit me in that moment I knew I was lying to myself too. I showed him the 2 other bottles I was hiding and we had a long and honest talk. In the end I can't believe he has decided to stay with me, I've done really fucked up things to him while drunk/blacked out before and I don't feel like I deserve his continued support.

I talked to my family and best friend yesterday and they are supportive of my decision to quit drinking too. My mom admitted that she was worried about me too, that she could smell vodka on me anytime I was visiting.

I wanted to post here to hold myself accountable and possibly for some support. So far being sober hasn't been as shit as I thought it would be, except for the occasional craving and trying to sleep at night.

1333,2020-10-17 16:06:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jd255f/struggling_a_lot/,"Struggling, a lot.","I've tried to write this post for months, and keep deleting it. I know I am an alcoholic (in the sense of dependance on alcohol). This is going to be a long post. For reference, I'm 34 and male.

I was a ""drinker"" in college/grad school, but didn't start till I was 21 and legally able to buy alcohol. I can't say it was a terrible habit, just not a healthy one, because I was a broke kid. Typically my roommates and I would go get a 30 rack of the cheapest beer and a handle of bourbon. Because it was a dry county, the trip to the liquor store was always a pain, so typically it would be once a week or two. This continued for around 4 years (along with some minor cannabis use).

I was always active - soccer, racketball, rock climbing, bike riding, etc, slept (generally speaking) well (7+ hours pretty regularly), did well in undergrad and grad school (honors), and ate healthily.

Once I finished grad school, I moved up north (New England) to live with my (now) wife. I started my career (tech sales), and began building up my skill set and what not. Drinking continued about the same, never really care to be drunk (tolerance red flag), alongside drinks with colleagues and new friends in social settings.

It was never really a problem - continued activity, continued working hard and effectively with promotions and all, and then about 2 years in (2013) shit hit the fan. My (now) wife and I broke up, she moved out and I got a crazy roommate who knew our friends. Being depressed and distraught due to my choices, my drinking spiked significantly. I would sit in my room after work with a bottle of 1800 tequila and play video games if I wasn't working. That was life for a few months.

After the lease ended with crazy pants, I moved in with another friend for a year, reconnected with my wife, and things were okay. I'd still drink at home, but I wouldn't let anyone see it. No one necessarily knew (or at least didn't say anything) and I'd replace everything quickly to avoid notice.

However, that habit of drinking to deal with stress ballooned a lot. Over the next, let's say 6 years, my habit has increased *significantly*. It started with a poor decision on my part that has caused me quite a lot of guilt, and probably a childhood friendship. While that is pertinent to the overall situation, that's not the part of the story to focus on at this moment. The drinking, as it continued to increase, became a nightly increased habit...and then it started impacting my sleep. I didn't know that at first because - while I'm a pretty slender dude, my family has a history of sleep apnea that my PCP thought I needed to get treated. Sleep specialist (after a sleep study) did not diagnose sleep apnea and I assume my sleep issues are because of my alcohol consumption.

I know I should be more honest with my doctors, but I have never truly stated how much I drink. I know, it's not wise, but I can't bring myself to do it.

Fast forward to a couple years ago, new job at a great company but very stressful. Drinking gets worse, to the point where I'm carrying half a water bottle of vodka to work, daily. Sip here, sip there. Still high functioning, but definitely affecting my output. I'm still doing well, but I know my motivation, my memory, my commitment to excellence has slipped far, relative to the start of my career.

At this point, I'm going through probably two handles a week, and I hide it well. Due to COVID and not returning to the office anytime soon, that has become much easier to do, as well as to hide.

My sleep is still crap - maybe I'll get 5 hours a night, wake up, take a shot, and go back to sleep for another hour or two. I essentially drink all day long, but I can go several hours without issues until my anxiety spikes, or I start feeling a little jittery and uncomfortable. I'm sure this has impacted certain aspects of my life - sometimes, I can't hold a proper conversation without at least a little alcohol because I can't seem to be myself.

So - I started following this sub. I have read Naked Mind, many many posts here, but have never shared any of this in the past.

I don't believe AA is for me, and I am not prepared to tell my friends or family about this right now. The current world's political climate is not helping with the situation, and I become more and more worried about the ramifications of this election and what the outcomes will mean for my wife, our friends, and others who don't look and act like a certain demographic of Americans.

In summary, this is just a post to get it off my chest. I will try, every day, to NDWYT - and I just wanted someone to know so that you can send some good vibes my way for success.

I rarely remember my dreams, and the ones I do remember are usually pretty boring - mostly just endlessly wandering down streets that are ungainly mutant amalgams of the various cities I've visited in the past. Occasionally I'll do something really exciting like go to a comics shop and flip through the longboxes for what feels like hours at a time. I must be satisfied with my relatively quotidian real-life existence in some deep psychological way, because my sub-conscious - the part of my mind where I'm supposed to have tucked away things like repressed desires and secret wishes and fantasy scenarios both inspiring and unnerving - is a dreadfully dull place. Anyway, even my morning nightmare was boring, but it was notable for being a new scenario and vividly real in a way that rarely happens. Side effect of new sobriety or coincidence? Don't know and don't really care, but thought I'd note it. 

Had some mild temptation yesterday but was able to ignore it without too much trouble. Later, my wife offered me a beer while she was making dinner last night, but I was like naah.

Problem drinker since 21 and I‚Äôm 30 now. My longest time sober was 1 year and During that time I was pretty excited about it and proud of myself. At the year mark, I drank again (it was semi-planned so not a relapse per say as I took 1 year off booze). 

I promised myself when I returned to drinking that if i ever blacked out again I would quit and That happened 3 months in. 

So I‚Äôve quit again now. I know logically that sobriety is the right choice because the blackouts and anxiety are too much to bear.

I want to step into my power. But I‚Äôm not convinced.... 

my narrative around this story used to be more like: drinking was getting in the way of my potential and I can‚Äôt moderate it, so I‚Äôm being brave and making better decisions. 

But now it feels more like: I tried to be a better drinker and I failed, now i won‚Äôt be successful or fun or carefree again. People won‚Äôt want to hang out with me and every social event will be tiring. 

I feel lonely in sobriety. I don‚Äôt have any friends who are sober. And as a woman and former party girl, i find it really hard to move on from wine & party culture. Finding it hard to say goodbye to it all ... :/

Even grocery shopping. I would drink to be the better version of myself. The one who could hold conversations. Who was bubbly and funny. Who was ‚Äúfun‚Äù. 

It was all a facade. 

I have a new sense of self worth, confidence, and goals. I no longer suffer from extreme anxiety or bloating. I wake up every morning at 6am and I run 4x a week. Sometimes I don‚Äôt even recognize who I have become, but I am thankful that I have made it to this point. 

Whenever you feel as though you can‚Äôt do something - believe in yourself. You can do this!

I have a friend there that introduced me to her social groups and I got to meet some incredible and warm people (who were not drunk despite going downtown and karaoke). I was staying at my friends home and my access to alcohol was limited for the trip. For the first time in probably 7 years I woke up without a fresh hangover. The following day we went to a wildlife preserve/park and walked through a forest, taking in nature. I fell in love with the city, the forest on the outskirts, the lake, and the people I was fortunate enough to meet.

Those folks showed me that I don't need to drown anxiety and depression in alcohol, and that I can have a better life without substances. I have connected with a counselor for my underlying issues, and I am committed to sobriety for my upcoming move.

I made it one year without drinking. I alternate between being proud of myself and upset at the fact that I slipped so far and had to hit my rock bottom to stop in the first place. I almost didn't even post today, but maybe my story will help someone else. 

One year ago my wife found out I was hiding how much I was drinking. I was always in charge of the finances and she never thought to check so it was pretty easy for me to hide it. I was basically going to the liquor store every day after work and buying a pint of vodka. I would take a few good pulls on my short drive home, and then through the evening find various reasons to go outside and sneak some more and eventually finish off the bottle before bed. Eventually my insane working brain figured out what I was doing wasn't normal or right, but by that time Alcohol had me. I couldn't stop. Believe me I tried. I dont know how many days I woke up in the middle of the night saying I was done, how many days I got up in the morning feeling like crap saying I was done, how many times I left work with the intentions of going home without stopping at the liquor store only to find myself right back there. I was scared for my health, scared of what people would think of me, and scared of losing my family. I continued to hide it, and I continued to try and fight it on my own. It was a joke of a losing battle. That's why I will always be so thankful my wife caught me. 

The day she caught me was probably the worst day of my life. I was pretty sure that would be the end of our marriage. The way I look at it, I had been cheating on my wife with Alcohol. Taking money from my son and giving it to Alcohol. I still feel like the worst person ever about it, and thats why I struggle being proud of my sobriety. 

The first thing I did to try and turn things around and save my marriage, relationship with my son, and sever all ties with Alcohol was to set up an appointment with a mental health specialist. This later turned out not to be all that helpful, but I was all in for all the help I could get. The second thing I did was go to my first AA meeting. I really recommend trying AA to everyone. You don't have to go all in with the program or follow all the steps or whatever, but it is AMAZING to talk face to face with other alcoholics. You quickly realize you are not alone in this, and that's huge. I still like to go to a meeting once a week or so to stay grounded and probably will continue. The third thing I did was read some books about being sober. I recommend: This Naked Mind, Alcohol Lied to Me, and The Year of Less(this one is less about alcohol but still mentions the struggle of it). 

I'm not going to say that it was always easy or what worked for me will work for you. It isn't easy and just like all humans are different, you will need to find your own path. I just want you to know you aren't alone, and it can be done. 

I am so much happier today than I was a year ago. Work is easier and I dont miss going in feeling bad from the night before at all. Also, I have kept a workout routine for almost the whole year and love it. Its nice to finally enjoy exercise instead of it just getting in my way of when I can drink again. I feel great! Im probably in better shape than I ever have been, since high school anyway. The most important thing to me is that I have repaired my relationship with my wife and am much more present for my son. I have learned to be more open minded and less selfish, and our relationship has never been better. We just celebrated our 10 year anniversary last weekend and it was wonderful. 

I know there will be challenging days, and I just take it one day at a time. The cravings are much easier to deal with. I cherish all of my memories of who I was as an alcoholic, because I can pull them up anytime I think I want a drink and it helps me get past it. I still have dreams where I drink and wake up in a panic, but I feel a ton of relief when I realize I'm still sober. Its still awkward when I pass on a drink when out, but thats just the society we live in. Either way, my life is good and I'm happy to be sober with all of you today. Keep at it, I promise that its worth it. You are not alone!",10,0

Last night, I was pouring a glass of wine for my wife, nice red wine like I really would have enjoyed with the steak dinner that we treated ourselves to at home. Her glass of wine smelled so good in combination with the smell of the steak when everything was on the table.

I spilled a drop on my hand and my immediate reflex was to lick the drops of wine off my hand. I caught myself the instant I tasted the drop of wine and thought about how permitting myself that drop would lead to permitting myself a sip from her glass, and maybe just one glass, ok well maybe we just split one bottle between 2 people, after all that would be progress compared to the 2 bottles I would have easily drank myself every night before I got on the wagon. 

In that moment, after that all played through my mind, I  made the decision that the drop wasn't worth it and I grabbed a towel and wiped the wine off my hand. Felt like wasting perfectly good wine, but I did it.

I woke up sober again today, looking forward to my coffee and going to the gym and doing laundry. I feel better every day that I wake up without a hangover having not had thousands of calories of booze (I'm dieting now too).

Not having that drop of wine was a tiny victory, but also a big moment for me. Waking up without a hangover is a treat I look forward to every morning and I made the decision to treat myself to another one. And no resetting my days sober counter thankfully.

Best of luck everybody with the weekend and all the crazy shit going on out there in this mad world.

1357,2020-10-17 11:46:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jcxfyl/2_months_sober_with_reflections/,"2 months sober, with reflections","I'm actually more like 9 weeks sober I believe, but life got a little busy and I forgot to take the time to check in when I hit my 60 day mark. Checking in here has been very helpful and I thank anyone who is taking the time to read this. I don't have time to read this sub every day or look at everyone's posts, but the recurring theme that I see in all of them is so helpful. For those who are struggling or failing, please keep at it and don't beat yourself up too much. I find that my biggest problem is that I beat myself up too much even though I am succeeding.

Quitting alcohol has been such an interesting experiment. I feel like I am my own science fair project, you know, the kind where kids have to say ""what is \_\_\_\_ effect on \_\_\_\_."" For me, that's ""What is the effect of removing alcohol from so-and-so's system?"" Well, here's what I've noticed:

* Dating: I had a breakup earlier this year, which is part of why I decided to quit (lots of drinking with my ex which lead to plenty of unnecessary arguments and likely contributed to the breakup), and I was afraid that I would not be able to date if I am sober. Even though I have not found anyone for whom I have strong feelings, I have found that dating is not an issue at all. I have even gone to bars and bought my date a drink or two while I sit there and sip water. People are very understanding and I am not getting any judgment or pushback in the least. I simply explain that I am doing this for health reasons and it seems to impress girls rather than disturb them, as I feared. So, all in all, I have been on plenty of dates and it has not been an issue. I do not think I would date a heavy drinker, but I feel comfortable enough with my newfound sobriety that I could be around a girl having a few drinks and not feel tempted myself. Ideally I would find a girl who doesn't drink at all, but that's kind of rare, and I'm not exactly dating to jump right back into another relationship.
* Running: I used to be an avid distance runner, and now that I'm not drinking I have gotten back into it. I'm still not quite where I used to be, but I'm going on 6-8 mile runes and getting much faster at it. My overall fitness is getting back to where I was at my peak in my late 20s. My abs are showing, and I have dropped about 20-25 pounds since I was drinking earlier this year. If I keep this up I should be able to achieve my goal of running a marathon in a year or two.
* Work: My job is stressful, I'm a teacher, so you can imagine how difficult it is during a pandemic, but you know what? I'm on top of it. I'm not stressing out like my co-workers. I feel calm and collected and on top of things. It's nice. No more hangovers. No more wasted weekends. No more bad nights' sleep.
* Money: I'm easily up $1000. I did the math, and I was spending about $500/month on booze (bars, liquor stores, boxes of wine at the grocery store). So that's awesome. I stand to earn an extra $6000 over the coming year. If someone told me I could have a $6000/year raise I would be thrilled, and it's like I have given that to myself. That's especially helpful on a teacher's salary, because I don't make enough money to be spending $500/month on alcohol. Going out to bars, I would easily justify spending $12 on 1 drink, or end up with a $50 tab, but I simply can't afford that, and I finally have a more realistic view of my finances and where I need them to be.
* Friends: Quitting drinking has not impacted my friendships at all. My friends who drink are still my friends, and anyone who does not agree with my decision or who might judge me for it was ejected from my life long ago. For those of you who are still wallowing in friendships that are solely dependent upon getting wasted with one another, like so many of mine used to be in college & my 20s, please know that it is not worth your health and potentially your life (jail, money, depression, etc.) to keep hanging out with bad influences. If all you do with others is get wasted, and you don't know what to do with those people once you remove drugs or alcohol from the equation, then your relationship with them is not healthy and it can be discarded. There are plenty, PLENTY, of wonderful people in the world. You just have to put yourself out there and try to find new ones. Pretend like you've gotten a promotion and had to move to a new city, even if you're staying put, and go out there like you have a clean slate. You can always reinvent yourself. It's easier than you think.
* Depression: I suffer from this. I take medication for it. I won't lie, it is still rearing its head, but I think I am handling it better. I am processing my feelings, my breakup, everything, and even though I sometimes have days where I can't get out of bed, I tell myself that it would be a million times worse if I were drinking. Being depressed is one thing, yes that sucks, and I might have to deal with this for the rest of my life, but being hungover and having doom-ridden anxiety on top of it was way worse than I feel now.

So yeah, that's my list. I have to run. I hope that resonates with some of you, and I will try to write more if I think of other things, but those are the most important changes or observations I have noticed. Best of luck to you all (and to myself) as we try to turn this ship around.",17,1

&#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, it doesn't always rock and it definitely has not always rocked during sobriety. But I'll take the feeling when I get it. I got up today, made a pot of coffee, started a fire, and ate a good, healthy breakfast. Yesterday, I took a walk with one of my closest friends and told her about my drinking problem. Then we went and swung on a swing set for about an hour and a half and just talked.

Now, when I think about drinking, it's much easier for me to say no to myself and the urge to drink floats away. The romanticism of drinking has lost its charm. Reasons not to drink have outweighed the reasons to drink. If I'm frustrated about anything, it's the stigma and shame that comes with drinking culture.

I'm currently on day 290 of non-drinking and it's going surprisingly well. Friends and familiy have been highly supportive of my non-drinking (my girlfriend even mostly quit drinking too!) and although I've been close to drinking quite often during my sobriety, it is going very well and I feel like the grip is softening each day.

I became a heavy binge drinker during the four years when I joined the university and the whole college drinking mindset that came with it. There I drank almost daily and heavily binge drank weekly and often more times each week.

It is now going well and I live healthily, there is however some part lurking in my thoughts and that's the 'fear' of having damaged myself and mostly my cognitive functioning. I value my intelligence (even though I'm not *that* intelligent to start with, I guess) and I love learning new things, reading and trying out new activities. I have the idea that my memory isn't as good as it was when I was in my early 20's (I'm 28 years old right now) and I fear that I've cognitively declined because of my drinking, but this could be some sort of hypochondria I have about this.

I've been to a GP about this and asked whether there is some way to check how and to what extent I've been damaged, but she told me even a neurologist would unable to see any difference, unless there's symptoms of the illness of Korsakov or Wernicke, which there aren't symptoms of.

So I have this fear I have negatively impaired my thinking and cognitive abilities and I can't shake the feeling that this is true. I also fear that I'll mentally decline a lot faster at an older age (If I manage to get old) then when I would not have been drinking this much for those years. I often wonder whether the damage is repairable or whether I've been permanently damaged.

Do any of you recognise this fear or can someone say something about this?

Thank you and IWNDWYT.",3,0

A friend stopped by and offered me lunch.  I had just eaten so we went shopping instead, I had a little project in mind so we stopped at Home Depot.  My friend again was pushing this lunch date which he detailed as bloody mary's and burgers.  He knew I wasn't hungry but the usual me would have of course opted for just bloodies.  I then informed him I was ""trying not to drink during the week"".  I did not feel like getting into the whole truth that I'm literally an alcoholic with a f\*$#@ problem. I insisted we go back to my house so I could work on my project and I could cook him a burger.  We stopped at the grocery and he bought meat, vodka and bloody mix.  He made the drinks and for some reason I had to drink it in order to keep my cover.  I just had one. What a joke it is having one drink.  What the hell is the point? I seriously do not understand the people who insist they only have one or two drinks for the day.  Maybe they catch a buzz...who knows.

I had a few cups of coffee with dessert because food coma was rapidly approaching. We had a wonderful visit and I got to talk with all the family and everyone had a great night. We got home around 1030 and I hopped on my Xbox to play a few games before bed. Right when I was about to throw in the towel my friend texted me asking if I was busy. He wanted to run a game of warzone so I said sure one game at 1130. It is now 3AM and we just stopped playing. We won the last round and then looked at the clock lol. While I was talking to him he told me his girlfriend and himself had tested positive for Covid and that he would have to quarantine and we wouldn‚Äôt be able to hangout. He‚Äôs been my main support in this battle with my addiction. He went through the same thing and understands how it is just starting out. He‚Äôs been sober for several years. We had so much fun and it honestly was 10 times better than being at the bar.  I had my gaming rig all done up we cracked jokes and eventually started a new team and it was just fun. I can‚Äôt remember how many times at 3 am I would be still drinking and just absolutely hammered dreading waking up at 8 am to start taking care of my kids. Now I‚Äôm gonna be a little slow moving to start and need some more coffee in the morning and maybe go to bed earlier than usual tomorrow but knowing my head won‚Äôt be pounding I won‚Äôt have dry heaves and the bubble guts is so rewarding. I can‚Äôt believe this is my new normal. While we were talking we set up a new thing Friday night game night. After his wife and himself quarantine and are clear we will probably do board games now and then but for now Xbox live is my source of hanging out with my support and I‚Äôm ok with that.

This year has  not been the most pleasant of years for me for a variety of reasons - the obvious (COVID), employment problems (being ""managed out"" from one job, and then laid off from a subsequent job that I moved cross-country for), some family health scares, and more.

But despite all these difficulties, I still have a lot to be thankful for today. I have been taught how to face my problems head-on, instead of running and  hiding at the bottom of a bottle. I have friends that I've made in sobriety who I can draw strength from. I have a rock-solid  relationship with my wife, which has not always been the case, and a young son who brings me joy every day. I've been learning in AA and in therapy how to stay in today and focus on the next correct step, rather than stressing about the future or beating myself up over the past.  I'm slowly learning to be kinder to myself and to those around me.

At the end of my drinking career, I hated myself to an extreme degree. I felt like I couldn't continue on the way things were going, and I couldn't seem to stop drinking. More than once, I felt so hopeless  that I tried to end my own life. I was about as miserable as I think it is possible to be.

Today, I don't hate myself. I feel like I have a lot to live for. And as hard as this year has been, I remain hopeful that things will improve (and as of the last few days, they seem to be). I would even go so far as to say that I'm actually pretty damned happy today.

I still need to take some steps to maintain my sobriety, but I don't find them to be a burden - I talk for a while with people I consider to be friends, read and comment here and elsewhere, attend meetings, and so on.  In exchange for this fairly simple  maintenance, sobriety has given me, and continues to give me, gifts I could never have imagined possible.

I could not have gotten sober without a ton of support and this place has given me that in spades. If you participate here, as a newcomer or as an oldtimer, thank you.

&#x200B;

So each evening I've been drinking at least 3 liters of beer for the last 18 months or so, maybe even longer, I've lost count to be honest. Fortunately I mostly stayed away from the hard liquor - this time...

&#x200B;

Over the last 6 weeks or so, I've first started ""watering down"" my beers while keeping up the daily volume (3l), effectively cutting my alcohol consumption in half. Then I cut the volume in half while still watering it down; 1.5l, 1l. Now finally only one bottle (0.5l) to keep the monkey from rioting too much.

&#x200B;

It wasn't and isn't smooth sailing, though. I had one bad evening where I relapsed. I hope I can resist the next time. I also hope I find the discipline to also get rid of this last daily bottle.

But it IS much better than getting up, noticing you're drunk and hungover, but you have to get ready for work.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

M,

I guess it‚Äôs the romantic in me that you considered so annoying. But a part of me hoped that maybe you were out there. That maybe you decided to stop too and found this place and were checking-in everyday, trying to figure out how to live this life sober. I thought maybe you‚Äôd recognize my story or I don‚Äôt know. I mean, wouldn‚Äôt that be something? Drinking tears us apart and sobriety brings us back together. Yeah, too good, right?

Remember the first time I spoke to you? Me thinking I was something extra when I approached you and said you had the most beautiful silhouette. You laughing, telling me I shouldn‚Äôt drink so much. And then we floated in and out of each other‚Äôs lives for nearly a decade, unable to leave well enough alone. Every time you had to stop you‚Äôd reassure me you‚Äôd come back someday. ‚ÄúNo joy without sorrow,‚Äù you‚Äôd always say. ‚ÄúNo joy without sorrow,‚Äù I‚Äôd whisper back with blurry eyes. Always with tears in my eyes. The hurt made each time better than the last. I think I convinced myself it‚Äôd never end, that you couldn‚Äôt live without me. But it is I who cannot live without you. It‚Äôs been almost 6 months now since I‚Äôve heard your voice. Six months since the last time that you touched me. I knew it was the end right after the vile words spilled out of my mouth. But they didn‚Äôt stop. I couldn‚Äôt stop, I can never stop when I get going like that. And if anyone would know what that is like it‚Äôd be you! To lose control entirely. No. Sorry. No excuses, no bargaining, no negotiating my way out of this one.

But I think you‚Äôd be impressed. I‚Äôve made some big changes, got rid of a lot of the crap weighing me down and cluttering my mind. I know, I know. I always used to talk about all the nice stuff I was going to get. Remember how I made you watch those silly home improvement shows with me? And how I‚Äôd blabber on about hardwood floors? Ugh. Ironically, now that I have less I have so much more. I wish I could tell you that when you start thinking of sobriety as a way of enriching your life rather than as a kind of deprivation then you don‚Äôt miss drinking. Or I mean, not as much. And that by giving up the booze I gained the thing I always seemed short of, time. Did you know Sandburg called time the coin of life? I like that. And I liked spending mine on you.

My dad warned me once that alcohol has a way of severing ties. Maybe he saw himself in me, saw that same anger and rage that made him the worst kind of drunk. I always thought he was wrong, told him that drink strengthens bonds if you can handle it. But he was right. He was speaking from experience after all. Even after the diagnosis my mom won‚Äôt speak to him. But I believed I could fix things if I ever messed up, that nothing was irreparable. That is the idealist in me that you scoffed at. I‚Äôve discovered some things really can‚Äôt be fixed. A line has been crossed. Trust violated. There‚Äôs no going back to before those words were uttered. It took hurting you for me to quit. After everything I‚Äôve done and said, after all the pain I‚Äôve caused, losing you was the only thing that got me to finally stop. Dad was most definitely right.

I‚Äôm going to let this hurt, and not mind that it does. But my god if this isn‚Äôt one hell of a gnarly wound. Remember when I first saw that movie and went bonkers over that phrase? Yeah, I‚Äôm still pretty crazy about it. Not minding that it hurts has come in real handy lately. I‚Äôm not going to lie. I‚Äôve been listening to Edit the Sad Parts for hours on repeat now. You loved that song. And I want to grab a couple bottles of red and a pack of yellow Spirits and just let go. Drift away to where it‚Äôs just you and me. But I won‚Äôt because I‚Äôll wake up and you still won‚Äôt be here. No, I‚Äôll let this hurt.

So I‚Äôm going to stop now. I have to stop waiting, hoping. No more looking forward to the day we meet again, to the day when I get to know you for the first time. I know I‚Äôll never really stop though. Your pull is too much. I guess what really hurts is that I worked so hard to get you thinking about me, missing me, wanting me. I tried to make it so you remembered me fondly if it ever ended. Make it so your smile had just a hint of sadness and longing whenever I crossed your mind. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be smiling if you do think of me. Know that I will be. I miss you like hell. Hey! Remember when‚Ä¶okay okay, I‚Äôll stop.

Thanks for reading my ramblings! It was a privilege to be your host, I really enjoyed the opportunity. If you would like to take over the DCI for a week and have at least 30 days of sobriety, just let SaintHomer know. Have a great weekend Everyone.

Doc: when do you drink?
Me: anytime I can find it. 
Doc: what time do you start?
Me: 6am. 
Doc: what do you drink?
Me: anything I can find. 

Managed to avoid inpatient detox, because my doctor is a saint. So now I‚Äôm on day two with benzos. Shakes are gone but still not great control of the fine motor skills, auditory hallucinations are still hanging around, started keeping down food and even showed up at the gym today. But these meds are making my brain slow and mushy. 

I‚Äôm lucky. I have insurance. I have help. I‚Äôm now taking naltrexone. She prescribed me Xanax for now. My husband is holding my hand through this and supporting me. And it still feels just yucky and lonely. Like no one gets how damned hard this is!

That being said...day three is one day closer to clearer mind and a healthier body. 

Y‚Äôall. If you‚Äôre lonely, I‚Äôm here if you need to chat.

After having one of the most depressing withdrawal experiences I am starting to feel better too!  Yesterday I had no will to do anything, today I am 40% better I'd say.  There's a light again.

I am actually starting to look forward to my Asheville trip on Sunday for my anniversary.  I had only ever wanted to go there for the breweries mainly.  This trip also just kinda came up out of nowhere, wasn't even our idea, but then it became a thing, originally with breweries in mind still.  Now I'm looking forward to going hiking, seeing some fall foliage, exploring, picking apples, you know, not drunk human stuff!  All of the great stuff I wouldn't have done if I spent the whole time getting shitty at breweries.  I think it will be great for me to get some nature in my soul and fresh air in my lungs.  My birthday is also on Sunday and I will ring in 33 SOBER!

And lastly, a random thought I had today.  I was feeling sad for myself, thinking ""Poor me, I'll never be normal for the rest of my life"".  Then a glorious thought came to me.  How many people are downing a moderate-ish amount of drinks every week, maybe a little more here and there, not living to their full potential and thinking that they are normal?  Maybe we are actually blessed to have gone to the depths and now we get to climb to the top!  Others maybe just get lost in the trees somewhere halfway up.

I can tell I'm getting to the emotional part of my ""dryspell"" because that just made me tear up, as have other thoughts today.  The emotional rollercoaster has left the station, guess I'll pull my lap bar down. üòÇüé¢

It was the first night and I couldn't find him last night but my dad said to just wait till tomorrow since he was probably just hiding. At 7am I fed my other cat and he still didn't show even though he's normally the one to wake me up.

I put his litter box outside, checked under our porch and practically the entire neighborhood's porches. We have a sliding door where my roommate might have not seen him sneak out at night since he's mostly black.

I know I should be thinking positive but I'm worried sick and can't imagine what I would do if something happened to him. Hes an indoor cat and we live in the mountains with bears, coyotes, and other wildlife. I hope he is just hiding inside but it's very uncharacteristic for him not to come out for food.

Tummy can't handle drinks anymore?,"I'm a 21 year old university student and I've recently realised it's very likely I suffer from GORD. I get gnawing tummy pains, heartburn and an inflamed throat everyday. This has become noticeably worse over the course of a year, though I can recall always having some vague gastro issues. The symptoms get worse when I eat, lie down, exercise and you guessed it, drinking!

I actually really enjoy drinking, but my last attempt to drink a few months ago ended in the usual 3-day hangover and nasty health symptoms despite limiting myself to one small drink. It's become clear through trial-and-error that my ability to handle drink without severe negative consequences has nosedived to the point of impossibility. Even without drinking, my GORD symptoms now affect me everyday. I have decided to stop drinking, which is heartbreaking because I enjoy it and I'm only a university student surrounded by party flatmates still. I find it impossible to party without alcohol.

Have any of you had experiences of stopping drinking not so much to addiction, but because of gastro problems? Your body/digestive system just couldn't cope with the cocktails anymore? Did you ever drink again, or do you avoid it completely?",2,0

I remembered last night that I still had some of Jamieson's Relax and Sleep herbal supplements, and took a couple a half hour or so before bed.  Shortly thereafter, a nice warm feeling spread across my abdomen, and I drifted off to sleep.  

More than 10 years ago, I was at a doctor's appointment, a follow up on a previous appointment where I had admitted how much I was drinking.  I had started using this same supplement and had told my doctor about how when I took this supplement, my urge to drink the next day was drastically reduced.  My doctor at the time was very against using any herbs or supplements, but she found it interesting that the supplement reduced my urge to drink so she grabbed a herbal reference manual that she had and looked up the ingredients, which include valerian, hops, catnip and passion flower.  I can't remember which herb it was (maybe hops), which in her reference stated that it could help with addictions or withdrawal symptoms, or something similar (can't remember exactly).  She said she would make an exception to her ""no herbal supplements!"" rule, as it seemed to help, but that if she was ever to prescribe me any medication, that I would have to make sure and tell her that I was taking this supplement.  

I wasn't successful in quitting drinking then...don't really remember what happened to put me back to the bottle, probably a handful of things including not really wanting to quit, so it's not like herbs can do the magic for us, but in my experience this supplement takes the ""edge"" off of the cravings the following day, and helps me get a good nights sleep....now for the disclaimer ""I am not a doctor, anyone considering using herbs to help, particularly if they are on any prescribed medications, should run it by their doctor"", but it may be of help to some of you.

I don't want to wake up one day down the road and think about everything I missed or everything that is a blur because I wasn't present.

I'm on Day 2 right now, and I'm ecstatic knowing I can breastfeed my little one today.

I'm the daughter of alcoholics, so drinking has been a normal way of life since I can remember. My mother actually has Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome directly caused by her heavy drinking. I also live in an area where daily drinking is extremely common. Because of this, I've never known the line I can't cross. I spent all of my teenage and young adulthood years drunk. I want to live life instead of recovering every day from the night before.

Anyway, I may or may not have eaten an entire bag of chips and drank too much coffee yesterday, but I was able to read my son a bedtime story last night and put my sober head on my pillow.

Today being Friday, it'll be a little harder not to have a drink, but I know I have the strength to not drink today. I keep reminding myself of this quote: ""If one is never enough, have none.""

I made a list of 7 consequences from that night in an effort to remind myself that nothing good comes of drinking. You can view the post in my profile history if you'd like.

Well, add ""caught coronavirus"" to the list. I received word that one of the six colleagues I had over for drinks that night tested positive recently and I've confirmed that I have it as well. So, if you needed another reminder that drinking still has consequences even when it's not reckless, this is it!

The city I live in has about 1 active case per every 4,000 people, so I didn't think there was a risk if I only had a few close friends over. I was wrong. I would not be sick with the virus right now if I would've stuck to my guns and not drank. The worst part is knowing that I could have made others sick had I been out and about this week (fortunately I am working from home!).

I would very much appreciate it if you would keep me in your prayers. I drank to hide my anxiety and I'm obviously very concerned about facing covid without my crutch to help me out.

I imagined how I usually down whatever wine or beers I would get quickly so it will do its job.  Its actually nauseating.  It also got me thinking about how in the past my depressed mood got worse after the initial euphoria.  I decided just to keep treading along as I was without adding alcohol to the mix. I had an unproductive night and ended up going to bed early anyways leading to me getting up at 3AM wide awake still kinda anxious however i started thinking about what would happen if I drank and how waking up at 3AM might be like.

The fucking boredom. 

I know this is nothing new and everyone struggles with occupying time that was once so easily consumed with drinking. 
On the full spectrum of sobriety challenges, I know boredom ranks far below the mind-bending agony of  anxiety, paranoia, shakes, sweats, sleepless nights, heart-pounding nausea and overwhelming shame. 

While I can hold onto how grateful I am to be over the physical withdrawal hump (17 days sober), I just need to screech it out of my system that the boredom feels like someone bottled an endless feeling of sandpaper against my skin, and through some alchemy bullshit injected it into my veins, all the while dull nails slowing drag down a chalkboard to round out the anthem. 

To manage, I‚Äôm 10000% on top of all my shit at work (I love my job and it has been the anchor that has kept me going through my years burrowing into the Mariana Trench of addiction.) I have Marie-Kondo‚Äôd the shit out of my apartment, I‚Äôve caught up on all the doctor/psych/therapy appointments I neglected over the years. 

I run every day. Running  has always been my main hobby to occupy my time outside of work (and in the past I used it as a crutch to justify my superfluous drinking schedule); however, I broke my ankle/leg last Christmas, which required surgery. A metal plate, ten screws, and eight months later I‚Äôm still in PT, and limited to 3-5 mile runs 5 or so times a week.

To cope, I mix running up with biking, I read voraciously, I‚Äôm working on a puzzle...yet I still find myself with buckets of surplus energy and time in the evenings where my mind plays on blast, ‚ÄúI AM BORED!‚Äù. 

The only reason I‚Äôve made it this far is because I started taking Antabuse two weeks ago (after a few years of conversations with my psych/therapist I finally got to a place where this was the best strategy for me to try). It has been a fucking game changer, where the voice in my head that plays ‚Äújust one...just one...‚Äù on repeat 24/7 finally shut its hole. 

Now that I‚Äôm not constantly quibbling over whether or not to drink every second of the day, now it‚Äôs like the ‚Äútick...tick...tick...tick...‚Äù of the 60 Minutes stopwatch is my new anthem for all of eternity. 

I know it will get better, that Ive hit the impermanent wall after the high of the pink cloud, and the pink cloud of enthusiastic sobriety will return. I would love to hear others‚Äô experiences and struggles, words of wisdom, advice, and commiserating stories about the mind-fuck it is to relearn and remember how to pass time sober.",2,0

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Have you ever read up on cortisol? It‚Äôs fascinating stuff really, how complex and consequential it is. Too much or too little of the stress hormone can have serious ramifications on your physical and mental health, the severity of course depending on numerous factors. Cortisol helps to regulate a lot of things. Mood, immunity (kind of important right now), blood pressure and sugar, pulse, all kinds of cardiac processes. I became preoccupied with how much cortisol my body was producing after I quit drinking, reflecting an obsession with my health. My newfound concern with the inflammatory effects of stress also indicated a dramatic shift in priorities and sensibility. After all, a person who drinks as much as I did on a daily basis has no business being concerned with their general wellness, let alone cortisol levels.

Going through my internet search history over the past few months would lead one to assume that I‚Äôm basically a reasonable person with your normal everyday interests and habits. OK, perhaps I am a bit too engrossed in all things relating to my health. Searches for ‚Äúbest position for restorative sleep‚Äù or ‚Äúhigh intensity interval training‚Äù are pretty common, I think. ‚ÄúNutritional value of pumpkin seeds‚Äù not so much. But hey, the fact that I am this focused on improving my wellbeing holistically is a sign of real change, of real progress. I mean consider the final web search on my last day of drinking: ‚Äúman punches kangaroo vid.‚Äù Wow. I think I‚Äôve come a long way.

Walking has been far and away the thing I‚Äôve researched the most. There has been no other activity that has come close to helping me get and stay sober than a nice long walk through nature. It is strange to me that we have to remind ourselves to be present, but nevertheless modern life and all its concerns have us stuck in either the past or future. By walking, especially during those god forsaken spells where I have intense cravings for 10 glasses of red, I become centered, anchored in the now. I lose myself in the chorus of sounds surrounding me as I feel the weight of my body shift with each stride. I enjoy maintaining a measured pace and observing my unique gait as my feet hit and roll off the ground. Do you know there are 26 bones in your foot? 26. And once you‚Äôve generated momentum the whole process is remarkably harmonious. There‚Äôs a kind of serenity to the whole thing. I read somewhere once that after being outdoors for 30 minutes your visual acuity is heightened. Colors become more vibrant, matter more alive.

I‚Äôve been reading a lot lately about the history and science of walking. I‚Äôm particularly fascinated by paths, both physically and conceptually. Taking different routes or traveling to new destinations has been shown to increase the health benefits of walking because the novelty creates a whirlwind of brain activity. This phenomenon is often referred to as ‚Äúmind in motion‚Äù or ‚Äúcognitive mobility.‚Äù In addition to uplifting your mood and regulating a host of physical processes (like keeping that cortisol level steady!), the structure of your brain is actually altered by the act and experience of walking, becoming larger and affecting how you retain and creatively use information.

What is really interesting to me about walking is the idea of paths. By this I mean how we use the term conceptually to describe various religious or secular quests or journeys. Think about your sober journey. Using the counter we measure our progress or distance from drink in terms of days. But we also describe the nature of our quest using common markers such as skin quality, sleeping patterns, weight loss, and so on. Some of us think in terms of a mental fog clearing as we move further into sobriety. While the process of physically staying sober is incredibly difficult and a daily grind, according to Torbjorn Ekelund, the concept of a path provides narrative ‚Äúorder in chaos.‚Äù Paths serve as a framework for interpreting the nature and objective of the journey, and help explain what success means. When I was reading his *In Praise of Paths* I was struck by his argument that paths are never made by one individual alone but are products of the contributions of many. That got me thinking of SD and how we help each other by sharing our stories and offering emotional resources and practical advice, collectively creating a path or paths to sobriety. ‚ÄúThe path we walk today always connects with a path that others have taken before us . . . paths always involve a connection with other walkers.‚Äù Indeed.

So that‚Äôs what I have been up to. A lot of walking and Googling odd things. I‚Äôm interested in the differences you‚Äôve noticed about sober you. Anything particularly surprise you and make you say ‚ÄúW T F?‚Äù Or am I the only one looking up cortisol? Happy Friday All! Remember, it's about the journey not the destination.

 I feel so bad for Yuri.  I wonder what his story is, he said he didn‚Äôt have family to call and I‚Äôd guess he was from Russia.  He probably used alcohol to dampen his loneliness living in this country where he could barely speak the language.

 I can relate to that relationship with alcohol.  It feels like your best friend, making you happy and forgetting all troubles and loneliness.  But then it stabs you and robs you and leaves you bleeding in the street.

My lay-off from my company and the subsequent multiple life FAILS from 2017 (death of a good friend, fires in California, a failed attempt to help pull a friend out of his addiction, loss of my partner, a diagnosis of PTSD, a spinal infection scare.. and having myself gone off the rails into psychosis and addiction to where I alienated myself from those who loved me).

These were my truths.. but also excuses.

I was so trapped in my head with a depression so fierce that suicide seemed a very feasible option. I got sober for 9 months in 2018, then faltered and fucked up my whole world .. again. The following year, I lost who I thought would be my life partner: believe me I deserved it, and no amount of apologies would have helped. I had become an emotional terrorist.

In Feb of 2019, after two months of sobriety, I was offered and accepted a job as a traveling field service engineer. I have been on the move since Feb 2019 - company paid for my housing, and when they didn‚Äôt, I mostly rode hotel points and went couch surfing. 

During that time, I left my home in California, stopped going further and further into debt with outrageous rent, stopped going to doctors for unnecessary medical procedures, and finally stopped torturing the people in my life by dropping off the grid and disappearing completely. 

So far, I have taken all of 2020 off from drinking.

The last 18 months, I have lived so frugally and have buried my nose in the grindstone of this job.

Today I paid off the last $437 of my debt from those days: not sure of the amount exactly, but it was an embarrassing amount: multiples of tens of thousands of dollars.

My student loans still remain - but are manageable. 

I am now sober, living a better, albeit, lonely and transient life.

For those of you suffering, know it will not always be like this. 

That‚Äôs what I thought since 2017, but the fog is lifting.

I am grateful for surviving.
I am proud to have not given up.

Pandemic aside - I am ready to begin my life for real again.

Today marks 3 years sober from alcohol. Alcohol destroyed my life and I had to stop. 3 years ago to this day I did. I wish I could say everything has been great since.

I'm here really trying to be proud of myself. And I am to a degree. It hasn't been easy.

Yet I still feel fucking empty. My life is objectively decent on the outside. I'm finally finishing my engineering degree, my family trusts me, and I have a few friends. I workout. I go to therapy. I go to AA meetings.

But still there's this aching in my heart. A true emptiness and loneliness. What the alcohol was supposed to fill, but never did. Like there's truly no place for me in this world. Yes I know what everyone is thinking now...stop feeling sorry for yourself. Go help someone. Get out of your head. And while I'm not perfect, I do my best to do all of these things.

I never really fit in to recovery groups but I go. Maybe it's because of my autism that I've never even felt accepted in what should be a respite for everyone who is suffering. I've never really belonged anywhere.

I've been sober for over 3000 days. I was having a discussion with a therapist today, and I realized I had forgotten how hard it was to get sober.

I was a super heavy drinker. I'd drink over a half handle of whiskey every day, while smoking lots and lots of weed. For those who dont know what a handle is, it's over 30 oz. My poison was whiskey. My rock bottom was drinking hand sanitizer and lysol bathroom spray to get drunk.

After that last time, I called it quits for good. Went to detox and just said enough is enough. I went to AA for a month, but it wasnt right for me. I basically white knuckled it for the first year, and then the cravings, the urges, gradually faded into nothingness. I still get them, extremely rarely, but I get them. Also drinking dreams.

I guess there were multiple things that kept me going. The fear of withdrawals, which I had full blown delirium tremens multiple times. The stories in detox of being in and out of detox for 30+ years from the old timers.

I read The Alcohol Experiment right after I stopped drinking six weeks ago. I've been really surprised at how much it actually influenced the way I think about drinking. I did the ACT exercises of coming up with reasons why the opposite thought of a given belief about alcohol was more true than the original - such as ""alcohol makes me happy"" to ""alcohol is a downer."" I was like hey, it IS more true that alcohol is a downer, now that I think of it!

One thing I've heard Annie Grace say in her podcast/YT vids is ""beliefs shape our thoughts and our thoughts shape our behaviors."" The philosophical question I've been pondering is, what is a belief? It's obviously not immutable. It's not the same thing as a fact. But isn't it based in truth? Or maybe it's not and our beliefs have no connection to the objective world around us at all. Maybe some beliefs are more true than others? WHAT IS TRUTH?

Alcohol took away my ability to look at life from a distance and see what needs to be changed. 

While I am very proud of my sobriety, my biggest problems are not fixed. I tried to forget traumatic memories from events 8 years ago by drinking, which clearly isn‚Äôt how memories work. Now that my mind is healing, they are more intense and invasive than ever. My hermetic behavior had caused me to appear self-absorbed and immature to some. The truth is though, my immaturity disappeared years ago and I would please like some of it back. 2021 is going to be the year I begin my path towards mental health in earnest. I need to relearn trust and closeness. There is a lot of work to be done.

As I've rebuilt my life, I've become a new person... But sometimes, I will have a flashback or memory of one of my drunken times when I did something absolutely terrible...

About 2 weeks ago I almost had some alcohol. I chose not to. Thank God I made that choice. Because I had not had a flashback in months -months! - the subconscious thought that maybe I can start drinking again returned.

Last night, just two weeks after this ""almost"" experience, I experienced my first panic attack and flashback of a time when I was drunk - and the only drunk - in a professional setting. That night, I was a total asshole to some colleagues that I was supervising and I smelt like booze. I think I blacked out for some of it. The next day, I didn't remember half of it and my boss actually pulled me aside regarding complaints about my behavior. That night ruined my professional image and that bridge was burned forever. My now ex-boss (now a colleague of mine in the professional networking world) has 0 respect for me. When we see each other at conferences, he is kind, but it is shameful whenever I am around him. I've avoided him ever since honestly.

It was terrifying and awful to re-live that night. I didn't know that my emotions could return so strongly in just an instant. The shame came back and it was truly terrifying. I couldn't fall asleep, I was wallowing in what a 'bad person' I used to be. It felt like it had happened yesterday. My heart was racing and I couldn't breathe. Then other memories started pouring in - ones I haven't thought about for over a year now... And thank God I did not drink alcohol 2 weeks ago!


This morning I woke up and my shame had dissipated a lot. I still feel like shit, sort of, but I can now remember how much I have changed since that night. Today I woke up for work - in a new job and in a place where nobody knows about my past - and did a damn good job.

 Sometimes I feel like I am the same person I was when I drank. Like I'm still a piece of shit, and I'm a horrible person who does horrible things. But I just have to remember that's what I used to be because of what I used to do... And I don't do that anymore... So I'm not bad anymore...

My partner has been off since March and has been drinking the whole time except when he has his son. He has told me he has no plans of going sober anytime in the near future, while also acknowledging that he has been drinking too much since I‚Äôve been gone. 
I haven‚Äôt tried to push him to not drink, but I have tried to point out to him certain things, for example, we were talking about his brothers drinking affecting his relationship with his girlfriend and going into work late. My partner says he hasn‚Äôt experienced anything like that and I asked him how many times he‚Äôs put off a project this summer because he was too hungover to work on it that day. He agreed with me there. 
His drinking doesn‚Äôt bother me very much right now because I‚Äôm not there to witness it. I‚Äôm very concerned when I‚Äôm done working and go back home if it will affect my sobriety or if I will have anger issues with his drinking. 
We are meeting up in a few weeks for a weekend in Montana, I have every intention to stay sober as I want to remember our time together, he says he won‚Äôt drink very much. I‚Äôm worried because we don‚Äôt exactly have a great track record for hotel stays together as one of us would usually get too drunk and ruin the weekend. 

I‚Äôm basically looking for advice on how you cope with your sobriety while your partner isn‚Äôt sober? I love this man and I want to do everything in my power for us to have a future together. I‚Äôm terrified that his drinking will be what turns me away from him because I won‚Äôt be able to stay sober and be around him. 

He has always forgiven me for everything I have done, and he‚Äôs not the asshole drunk, I was.",3,0

1550,2020-10-15 11:21:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jbpkmy/30_days/,30 Days!,"Hey everyone - this is my first time positing but I‚Äôve been lurking this sub for awhile now. 

Just wanted to share a bit of my story - 

I started drinking heavily about five years ago after my father had a heart attack. I used to drink on the weekends before that with my friends but would never drink by myself or throughout the week unless there was an event going on.

My father was an alcoholic for his entire life. He had a lot of anger issues and when he drank, he was terrifying and verbally abusive to me. I was also the primary target for his anger after he‚Äôd come home drunk. The amount of stories I could tell about him are endless. I remember writing a letter to him the night after he came home from the bar and was raging at me. I would have been 10 years old at the time and the letter was basically just saying I‚Äôm sorry for whatever I did and I love you. He later ripped up the letter in front of me when he was drunk about a month or two later, I guess he kept it in his wallet, and saying it meant nothing to him. 

Every childhood memory I have of him I now know he was drunk in every one of them. I‚Äôve come home to my mother crying after an event they went to together - he took of in a rage and left her there. I guess cops followed him home because he was driving drunk and someone called it in.

My family has been ripped apart for years because of alcohol. It was just such a normal thing growing up. Being embarrassed as a pre teen crying to my mom after he came home yelling at me, knocking down the door to my room. I always remember the time I looked at my mom and said ‚Äúhe loves beer more than he loves me‚Äù. 

I never wanted to be like him but I turned into his twin. I hated him for a long time. But about 8 years ago he started having signs of dementia even though he was still relatively  young to get it. Now he is in really bad shape. He lost his license, he takes off without telling anyone and walks for miles until my mom can track him down. I recently found out he had an outburst and punched my mom because he wanted to take ‚Äúthe children away‚Äù (we have two cats and he had an episode where he wanted to go home and take the ‚Äòchildren‚Äô). My dad was never physical, ever. Even at his drunkest he would never do this. Dementia has taken so much from him. 

Its just heartbreaking - I started drinking every day when he had his heart attack five years ago and I was home alone for about two months. That‚Äôs how I dealt with my anxiety of almost losing him. After he came home I continued to drink because it just became a way of life. I would hide my beer cans from my mom. I‚Äôd wait until she left the house to bring the 24 cans down to the basement. I drank by myself, I no longer needed or really wanted a drinking buddy. I had fun by myself.

Then my first year of college I moved away and it only got worse. 1.5 litres of wine about twice a week, along with whiskey and as much beer as I could take. During the pandemic I started drinking even more after I realized I could order from Uber eats. It was just too convenient!

Then one day I just woke up as I usually did - feeling so ashamed, heart racing, full of guilt. I was suffering. I could feel not just my body say ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had enough of this‚Äù but my soul was dying. I‚Äôd go to work full of so much anxiety I had to go home early. My heart would be racing and I would be so annoyed at the littlest thing. 

Today - I am 30 days sober from weed and alcohol. I‚Äôve had sober stints before but this is different. I let myself cry when I have to cry, I let myself feel whatever emotion I have. I don‚Äôt reach for beer anymore because I‚Äôve learned that it wasn‚Äôt adding anything to my life but pain. It was taking away. 

I feel empathy for my father. He worked two jobs, came from poverty and didn‚Äôt have an easy life. No education but was so smart, so kind when he wasn‚Äôt drinking and would do anything for me if I really need him. I guess in the back of my mind, I want to be sober for him too. Because I know he wanted to be - and god I wish he would have. We weren‚Äôt very close before I moved out. I had a lot of anger. But now, things are different. I want to feel the emotions I numbed myself from. I want to take responsibility. 

The doctors say his dementia is caused by his years of alcohol abuse. Now his sister, who is also an alcoholic is starting to show signs too. I‚Äôm never taking my health and sobriety for granted. 

I also learned that why I failed so many times before is that I tried to do too much at once. I wanted to quit drinking, quit smoking, and lose weight all at once. My focus for the last 30 days has been working on not drinking. I‚Äôve been eating real food and just giving my body a break. I‚Äôve gained a bit of weight but it doesn‚Äôt even matter because I feel good.

Cigarettes are next but for now I‚Äôm working on this. I‚Äôve never spoke to anyone about my problems before and I know I should do that. That will be a next goal of mine. 

Thank you everyone for posting here and sharing your stories. I swear I think I‚Äôve read them all. I read this when I wake up and before I go to bed. It‚Äôs just been so helpful and you‚Äôve made a difference in my journey. Thanks for reading this if you made it this far!",16,1

I just got bailed out of jail after being in for 15 days at Burnside, which is an absolute hell hole. 

I blacked out drinking mouthwash on Sept 28 and woke up in jail the next day with charges of assault, confinement, choking, and breaches. This is on top of a number of other charges I had been dealing with and was going to get house arrest for... now that is all off the table.

I am now facing a year or more in Provincial jail if not 2 plus years of Federal time. I got bailed out yesterday by my amazing parents and am on strict conditions and have to live with them.

First thing this morning I contacted every resource I could find for mental health and addictions services and am going to work as hard as humanly possible to never ever touch alcohol again. I have been sober since September 29th.

While inside I did a lot of soul searching and even wrote myself a pledge that is now on the fridge to read every day.

I am absolutely horrified and what I am accused of, as when sober I do not have a violent bone in my body. But alcohol turns me into an evil person, I call it chasing the devil.

This has been a real eye opener at almost 36 years old. I am not the type to survive in such a violent atmosphere in jail and had my life threatened and got my ass kicked numerous times. I am terrified of going back. 

Guess I need to just vent this stuff as I don't have anyone to talk to about it. There is a no contact order with my girlfriend now, even though she wants to stay together. She texts me constantly but I cannot reply and it is killing me inside that I could do something like that.

I really hate myself right now. Im trying to take it a day at a time but the emotions and my thoughts are all over the place.

How did I used to do that regularly? Being out until 1 am having a few with the boys or entertaining a client then getting up and getting myself into the office the next morning as if nothing was wrong.

How was I able to function at such a high level for so long?

How is it that I lost a step (if you want to call it that) so quickly? I used to subsist on 4 hours sleep, plus, coffe and alcohol. I had drive and ambition like you wouldn't belive and was a top performer.

 Since I stopped earlier this year (with a couple of false starts) I'm now a bear if I don't get six hours sleep minimum, 8 prefered. Its made me less productive. My career has stalled out. The excitement of a new job that inspired this journey was short lived.

This being sober is strange. Completely forigen territory for me. I'm living healthier... but at what cost? How do you all do it? I don't want to drink to excess... but  I at the end of a long day (or week) could use a beer to take the edge of and feel ""normal"" again. Not that I'm going to...

It's disheartening, do I have brain damage? 

Well thanks to you fine people sharing your experiences my worries have been put to bed. This is apparently normal. I'm sure in the coming week(s) I'll begin to feel gradually better.  Started running and doing light workouts just help out. Always been skeptical of supplements doing much of anything, but I've been taking B-complex and will swing by the store to buy milk-thistle today.

I am on time to work, not rushing.  I am remembering my pills in the morning for my cholesterol and my blood pressure, I have already dropped 5 pounds.  I am kicking ass at my job again.  

However, it is not all good.  I do struggle a bit, mainly to go to sleep, but i survived worse, I push through.  BUT then I remember those I love, and myself.  Oh, and a special certain someone who has recently re-entered my life and has been a valuable life long friend, who I may or may not somewhat, potentially, have a massive crush on since the 7th grade (23 years)!  It feels good to feel feelings again!  That is the best part about this.  

Instead of dragging my life around hung over for the entire day, or blacking out, and embarrassing myself at the bar, nightly.  I am jogging, hydrating, eating healthy is still up for debate, but hey baby steps here.  haha

I know I am all over the place with this rant, but I just wanted to say that day 3 has never felt this good.  It's thanks to you all, all you brilliant, loving, fantastic people who cared about a random internet stranger enough that you actually changed my life.  

I will forever be grateful.  I am terrible at responding, I am at work at lot and I commute a lot and I hate typing on mobile, but I read every single last comment and DM I received and a lot of you touched me in ways (not that way) that you will never understand.  

We all, every single last one of us, we all can and are doing this.  If I had a way to repay each and everyone of you, I would.  But, now it's time to start taking my life back.  Admit my mistakes, get out of debt, fix it all.  Or, atleast give it my best shot and fix everything I am capable of fixing.    

Thank you.

From the bottom of my heart.  Thank you.

I want to be celebrating. I want to be proud of myself. I just hit 2 years Sept 16th. Drinking was my form of self medication and the years I drank were dark and depressing and miserable. However, I was never anxious which was my worst demon. I‚Äôll try and keep this as brief as possible... 

Started having panic attacks at age 9 finally went away at 18 because I used alcohol to cope with a violent relationship I was in.

Quit drinking just before i turned 22 because alcohol poisoning, several doctors visits due to drunken injuries, not doing well in school, self harming, depressed, had left my relationship etc... 

Anxiety came back way worse. It was so bad my physical health started deteriorating too. Developed an autoimmune disease, SVT, migraines and other weird symptoms we (me and doctor) can‚Äôt figure out. Not a single illness i have Can he traced back to any family history. I‚Äôm partially convinced the anxiety/stress triggered it.. I mean I‚Äôm sure there was some predisposition to it. But stress doesn‚Äôt help either.

I‚Äôve been in therapy and was showing some improvement but it stopped abruptly due to covid. 

I‚Äôm medicated, I meditate, work, eat healthy, stay hydrated, stay active, try to stay busy with school/hobbies but nothing is helping. I‚Äôm a anxious wreck and I‚Äôm seconds away from reverting back to alcohol. 

I didn‚Äôt do AA because I was in therapy, a domestic violence survivor group and a full time student/employee. I literally didn‚Äôt have the time.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I‚Äôve always loved watching home improvement shows. There is something about this genre that I find particularly calming. I can, and have, spent entire days bingeing marathons of my favorite programs on the HGTV channel. I used to think they appealed to me because I desired the things and homes that are being advertised on these shows. The personalities of the hosts certainly contributed to my fascination as well. But I seemed inexplicably drawn to the textures and patterns of the stuff strategically placed throughout the expertly designed houses. Specific materials and color schemes enthralled me, and I liked to think that by the time I got around to having some money for a mortgage I‚Äôd have developed one hell of a sophisticated aesthetic sense.

What I found so appealing was not the stuff these people were buying, however, but that they seemingly had their lives together enough to have the time and mental energy to be concerned with selecting the appropriate granite countertops and backsplashes. I believed that if they had the ability to be emotionally invested in such trivial things then they must have everything else figured out. In other words, I liked these shows because they provided a respite from the chaos of my own life where nothing was in order and everything was in disarray. Of course, this is all fantasy. You never see the actual lives of the homebuyers/remodelers, just the beautiful possibilities contained within these carefully curated spaces. For all I knew, maybe some of them lived a life similar to mine once the camera crews left, just with better furnishings. But the imagined domestic warmth and happiness depicted onscreen enchanted me nevertheless because it contrasted so sharply with my very real everyday desolation and misery.

I knew all along that I didn‚Äôt need any of the nice things or the house to be happy. I think we all realize fulfillment requires much more than stuff. But it wasn‚Äôt until after I started exploring minimalism that I entirely abandoned the stubborn belief that things would bring me happiness. Although I encountered the philosophy by accident (probably in the Netflix documentary), I was immediately taken by its basic principles of simplicity, utility, and purpose. But I think I mostly found the idea of minimalism compelling because it clashed violently with the erratic and meaningless life I was leading as an alcoholic. The more I read about the movement the more I realized that all that stood between me and the sense of peace and contentment I so desired was the booze.

When I drank I squandered lots of things, namely money, opportunity, talent. But the most precious thing that alcohol deprived me of was time. The poet Carl Sandburg poignantly described time as ‚Äúthe coin of your life,‚Äù and I had foolishly spent most of my coin alone with a bottle. Because it consumed so much time alcohol significantly complicated my life, things got done haphazardly or not at all. And if the way to maximize your time, according to minimalists, is to eliminate the nonessential things and activities cluttering your physical and mental space, than alcohol had to go. Perceiving drink as nonessential was of course a radical notion that I strenuously resisted. But I was intrigued by the prospect of ‚Äúliving by design, not by default,‚Äù as Greg McKeown put it. And I was definitely living by default rather than with any kind of deliberate intention. In his book *Essentialism*, he discusses the imperative to distinguish ‚Äúthe vital few from the trivial many,‚Äù and encourages readers to undertake a ‚Äúdisciplined pursuit of less‚Äù in order to live a more purposeful life. In short, pare things down to what really matters and aligns with your core values. And if what I consider meaningful is time with family, participating in hobbies and activities I find joyful, and my health than I had to eliminate the thing that needlessly ate up so much of the coin required for these things. After I incorporated many elements of minimalism into my life I could no longer justify consuming alcohol. I became too selective about how and what I spent my time on, too determined to actually practice the values I cherish. I love that I discovered a way to find meaning and happiness without having to purchase a smartly remodeled home. I already had everything I needed for a purposeful, fulfilling life. I just needed to renovate my mind. It's like Whitman wrote, ""Enough to merely be! enough to breathe! Joy! joy! all over joy!"" Now please excuse me while I go relax and watch a few hours of *House Hunters*. Since I didn't drink today I have a little extra time.

I'd love to hear about all the essential stuff your spending the coin of life on now that you no longer waste it on drink, the extra special stuff that gives your life meaning and purpose.

Have a peaceful day Everyone.

I've lurked here for quite some time, always toying with the idea of quitting alcohol for a long period of time, knowing that it was vaguely ""healthier"" for me, but never finding enough negatives to actually quit. 

This last year has been simultaneously the worst and best ever.  The world has been falling apart all around me and I have lost and gained a whole new home, partner, and career.  I definitely made it through these past months on sheer willpower, determination, hard work, and alcohol abuse.  I was always too stubborn to be honest with myself about the level, until recently.

I would always say ""I know when to stop"" or ""I'm a functional drunk"".  But that never could negate the night I took out my own passenger mirror driving home from the bar -- no one ever knew that until now.  It can't negate the drunken arguments, the misunderstandings.  It can't negate the times I woke up late for work, drunker than a fish and went to work smelling like a sack of dirty bar towels.  It can't negate the terrible stomach (liver???) pain I'd wake up with every single morning, and the abuse I put my body through, working 10-12 hour days making art and then drinking all night long, exercising hungover, kicking myself for not performing at a higher level, ect, ect, ect. 

I've never ever admitted it.  Pride, or just stubbornness.  I'm a nice guy, how can I be an alcoholic?

But. I'm an alcoholic.

And after not drinking for three days a week three weeks ago, and then going back to it every weekend and finding myself MISERABLE every Monday, and seeing the difference in my life without it, as HARD AS IT IS TO MAKE A COMMITMENT I DON'T WANT TO FAIL AT KEEPING, I've finally decided I'm going to stop drinking for at least this week, and take a real look at longer.

Let's be honest!  At this moment I still have so much trouble comprehending celebrating without alcohol.  But I know that as time goes on, I wont equate poisoning myself with celebrating.  I also know I can't change overnight so.  I'm taking steps. 

I'm going to begin every day this week with the intention of not drinking.  I did it the past two days, and today.  And I feel amazing.  I sleep amazing.  Even if this is a neon pink cloud -- it's way better than the fucking grey cloud I was putting over myself before.

I've been through periods where I drank even more, obviously. But I still think this frequency is not good.

Here's my logic:

* Definitely unhealthy for your organs
* Disrupts sleeps
* Bad for your wallet, exacerbated by the fact that I like to cheat myself by getting singles and pricey connoisseur stuff to convince myself that by not hoarding anything, I don't really have a habit
* 3 drinks a night can turn into 4 drinks a night which can turn into 5 drinks...see where I'm going?
* Reduces mental clarity
* Deteriorates skin quality
* Can cause excess irritation and aggression
* The more often you're drunk, the less enjoyable being drunk actually becomes

I'm ok with it. I know what happens when I drink, I know I'll never have it ""under control."" I know this has to be forever. 

It's hard, though. Something in me mourns the fact that I'll never be able to sit with a glass of wine while enjoying time with my friends. But that's only a snapshot, because once the friends leave I finish the bottle then break open another. I can't keep doing that, nor do I want to.

Stomachache and heart burn days after drinking.,"I ( 27 f ) had a pretty rough year in 2019 . Drank everyday and often on an empty stomach . After a  really bad panic attack decided to quit for a while for my mental and physical health.  I was also on some mild anti depressants for my alcohol induced anxiety and panic attacks so I did not have any withdrawal effects. The  first 2 months sober  I had terrible heart burns and could not eat foods that I used to like, like spicy food . I love love spicy food but could not eat at all during the first 2 months of being sober . My stomach was so sensitive , anything fatty or spicy or with too much mayo just really upset my stomach . Eventually I got back to normal. Two weeks ago I restarted drinking. I drank twice since then. The next few days after drinking  my stomach was so sensitive , heart burn , general nausea. Last time I drank was Monday , it is now Thursday and my stomach still feels strange . If I eat fatty foods it just gets worse . I honestly feel like I should eat just plain foods for a while.
On one hand I am grateful for this because I don‚Äôt feel the need to drink anymore but on the other  hand it is frustrating to deal with nausea and I miss eating food.

Today feels better than any new year's, birthday or celebration I've ever had in the past. My wife jumped on the sober train 8 months ago and we are happier than we have ever been.  I have been hospitalized multiple times for acute pancreatitis because of my drinking. In the past few years I have also been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and psoriatic arthritis. Not to mention the stress of losing my job as a bar manager due to the pandemic going on, so it hasn't been the easiest path. Sobriety made all of those things much easier to deal with. It changed my focus. Something that has been missing in my life for far too long.

I am now back in school pursuing a degree. I am taking my health as seriously as I ever have. I am exercising more than I have in the past which is still difficult from time to time with the arthritis, although I am taking Humira for that and it helps immensely. All of these things combined have literally saved my life. 

I thought for the longest time that being in the position I was in was just my fate and being drunk everyday just made things easier. I couldn't have been more wrong. Being sober is the best choice I have ever made and I can't wait to see what is next. I am more focused and have more drive than I ever have and can't wait for the next challenge. 

I am grateful to have an amazing wife that keeps me going and close family and friends that have supported me throughout. 

For anyone out there struggling, just remember that there is so much more out there when you get out of that loop of drinking every fucking day. I am living proof.

1643,2020-10-14 14:27:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jb6fcn/one_thousand_day_1s/,One Thousand Day 1s',"If you are starting this journey then 1000 days probably seems impossible. It did to me. It still seems improbable but here I am, ""Wow!"". In those early, gritty days it was difficult to remember that this is a long game. In the beginning, a day was a long game, then a week was a long game, then a month, then a year, now a life. Let's be under no illusions, the game at stake here is life; both quality and longevity. You only get to play the game once.

I had drunk everyday for over forty years so I knew that giving up was not going to be easy but I was shocked how hard it was. If it was this hard then how bad had I let myself get? I took the view that the harder it was then the more I needed to double down and do this. It was never going to get easier. The first 100 days were hell and I had to cling to a belief, a faith, that enduring this would be worth it for something ""better"" in the future but I didn't know what that better was. Forty years is a long time. I can now describe that ""better"" because I have experienced life without alcohol, but at the time it was a leap of faith. As the detrimental effects of drinking, both physically and mentally faded then I started to see the benefits as they grew, incrementally and exponentially. I hadn't realised what I was missing. 

The ""Tipping point"" is the aspect that intrigues me. Why was this time different from the dozens of other times I decided to give up, decisions that had evaporated by 5.01pm. I don't buy the rock bottom theory, too many times I hit rock bottom, got out the power tools and kept digging. Although I had ""decided"" to give up on so many previous occasions, this was different, it was more of an acceptance than a decision, a surrender or letting go. There was an acceptance that I had to change. A calm internalisation that I was killing myself. If I could understand that tipping point, then how many people would that help? 

If I was going to change then I had to do the changing. I had to change the way I lived and do things differently. I found that knowledge was the key. The more I learnt, especially about addiction, easier it was to regain control. The books ""This Naked Mind"" and ""Alcohol Explained"" were brilliant. Dr Kevin McCauley's talks on Youtube are really informative.  Symptoms and experiences vary wildly so I had to find what worked for me. SD helped me to recognise what I was experiencing and then suggest ways to overcome it. It put a vocabulary and a framework around the problem. Sometimes it was as simple being able to verbalise to myself ""That is a craving, I'll do this"" It's a process of learning so don't worry about set backs, it's hard and it's the trajectory that matters. Nobody gives up first time.

I thought I was just going to change my drinking. Two and a half years down the line I now realise that lots and lots of things had to change. What was cause and what was effect was blurred. Did I drink because I was unhappy or was I unhappy because I drank. (Insert whatever applies to you). The best way to find out is to remove alcohol from the equation and wait three months. It was not easy to change but it was for the better. 

I learnt not to try to solve every problem at once. I found that stopping drinking involved tackling a range of different issues; physical withdrawal, controlling addiction, Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome (PAWS), anhedonia, changing social habits, changing friendship groups, self acceptance and relationships with loved ones. Some were very long standing issues and difficult. Trust takes time to re-build.

I did all this while my brain performed some weird and not so wonderful things with my thought processes and emotions. I learnt to not to trust my thinking, which is scary, and to stand out side myself so that I could observe my thinking in a detached way; ""So why are you feeling that?"". Addiction is a bitch because it's a battle with your own thinking. The Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde inside my head. I am now in control and have become much calmer. My clarity and perspective is so much better and I believe that my reasoning and judgement has improved. It has had a substantial effect on my life.

Anhedonia; *noun*, inability to feel pleasure in normally pleasurable activities. Drinking is enjoyable. Alcohol stimulates the pleasure processes in the brain, dopamine. After long term use the brain's natural ability to produce dopamine and feel pleasure is weakened. When I stopped drinking that weakened ability left me in a desert. Life was flat, dull and tasteless. Motivation was hard and it felt a lot like depression. The desire to find pleasure, to drink again, was compelling. There is no cure, it just takes time to heal. You may not experience this and that is the weird thing about this whole process.

They say that the first year is about physical healing, the second is about emotional healing and the third is about spiritual healing. I would go along with that. Alcohol poisons and damages so much. Be kind to yourself and be patient, healing takes time, a surprising amount of time. It can be months and years.

As my brain healed and bits joined up again I found that weird, random memories would bubble up like Monsters from the Swamp. That new found clarity became a liability as the memories were often toe-curling and cringeworthy. Remorse is the natural reaction when a person has behaved in a way that conflicts with their values. The past can not be undone and somewhere down the line you have to learn how to forgive yourself. You can only look forward to living those values while sober. I am now much more tolerant of others failings. There is no moral high ground left for me to occupy. Forgiving others is easier than forgiving yourself.

I learnt so much from the people at SD and their support. I learnt more about myself from supporting others on SD. You have to do this yourself but you can't do it alone. You could say that SD is just a few kind words to a stranger. I think it is the sum of experience, knowledge, empathy and compassion which is expressed as a few kind words. Sometimes the impact of those few kind words has been enormous for me and that stranger will never know the how much they were valued. We are strangers here on SD but when we read someone's words on the screen, we hear their cry and we see ourselves; we empathise. The transition from a drinker who isolates themselves from friends and family to the person who connects with empathy is a big one. It's when someone climbing out of the pit turns to offer a hand to the person behind. Empathy is a key human quality. The Moderators do a remarkable, unsung job of cultivating a few kind words. 

I am starting to appreciate the power of small choices. We make very few big decisions in our lives, mostly it's the small daily choices that determine our path in life. Small choices build like compound interest or bank charges. They increment you up or they decrement you down. Good choices seem to beget further good choices and visa-a-versa. Just because it is a small choice does not mean that it is not an important choice. Small choices are not necessarily easy choices, some can be hard. That first drink of the day was always a small choice. Not to have that first drink of the day is an important but hard small choice. A craving is a hard small choice. Kindness is often a small choice.

I had turned my back on my friend, the love of my life, the goal of my day - Alcohol. The void was enormous, I grieved it's loss and waited for life to return to normal. I eventually realised that normal had been a long, long time ago in a far, far away land. That normal was gone and I had to find a new normal. Although sobriety was like being unchained from a madman, that madman had been me for a long time. Who was I now without alcohol? What did I do now I am not drinking? What did I like? Who am I? (answers on a postcard please to ""Who am I"" Competition, Blue Peter, PO Box....) This bit is still work in progress.

How other people react is as varied as the symptoms of giving up. Some people notice immediately, some people don't notice or don't appreciate the challenge it represents. Reactions vary from pleased, questioning, supportive and scornful. Friends want the best for you and will support you. If a person encourages you to still drink then they do not want the best for you and they are not your friend. Cut them out and leave them behind. I left a lot of people behind because I found they were not my friends. It has not been a loss, quality is better than quantity.

In my experience, team building events at work have a net negative effect. I struggle to remember beneficial or positive outcomes; on the other hand embarrassing and negative outcomes spring to mind quite easily. Have you ever heard a manager say ""Well done at the social last week""? I have learnt how to work the room, say ""Hi"" to who I need to and leave early. Do not fear FOMO. Anything that can be achieved will have been by then, after that no one will even notice you have left. Next day you will be able see the collateral damage, hear the stories and, for once, not have a starring role in them.

One day at a time turned out to be a life lesson. At first, each day was a long, dark tunnel that had to be got through in slow, nail clinging time. Then it became a dull marker, another day, just get through it, one more. Now it is the day, the day to take advantage of. Carpe Diem. It is a tool for achievement; one more day on the diet, one more day at the gym, get that job done today. You can build on sobriety, you can't build on a hangover.

No situation gets better with drinking and sobriety takes priority. Amen.

It has been a revelation and an education. I have changed in so many ways, my life is better and I now know myself far more. I have learnt about small choices and a few kind words.

I have changed but one thing has remained a constant, this is Day 1. 

Could I drink again?     In a heartbeat. 

Will I drink again?         Not today, and if you make a small, but important choice not to drink today then you will get to one thousand days. I'll see you there.

Last night we reunited and by 9 (buying booze is illegal after 11 here) he was *literally* itching. I‚Äôm fine with weed even, and he was smoking heavily, but he clearly wanted a drink and having been in that situation before I caved.

Hasn't actually been too difficult so far, and this after about 20 years of drinking heavily almost every night.

Most would, based on my drinking history, label me as an alcoholic, but the funny thing is that I have never had a problem not drinking when it is completely unavailable...I have happily signed up for a 2 week arctic kayaking trip, lots of backpacking trips (one as long as 22 days), canoe trips and other such adventures knowing that there wouldn't be a drop of booze, and never had a problem.  But when I get back home, I begin binging again, usually on a daily basis.

I guess the label doesn't matter (alcoholic, alcohol abuser, lush, wino), but it does make me wonder why I am so tempted in my ordinary life to drink to excess when I know I am perfectly capable of going without.  Boredom?  Maybe.  Coping with an EXTREMELY negative husband?  Maybe.  Whatever the reason, heavy drinking has made me boring and lethargic and fat, and moderation just does not work for me.  Sobriety has to be the only option.

A couple days into this try. Made it about a month before.

I don't usually drink to excess with people. Just alone. When I drink with people, I make good jokes and I think I'm fun to be around.

However, I reflect back on the parties/gatherings I've been to sober. I hate it. I don't like meeting new people. I don't find much motivation to be around the people I know very well anymore.

The only person I want to be around sober is my girlfriend. Now that I'm sober, I thought I could reapproach all these relationships in a new context. But I don't want to.

I remember when I was first experimenting with stopping drinking 4 years ago and I was smoking pot daily and during the day too I realized I was HANDICAPPING myself.  For fucks sake!!!!!!!!!  Why would I want to handicap myself?  Drinking daily to ""relax"" and ""De-Stress"" was due to my job.  If I hadn't been smoking pot immediately when I got off the job it would of been easier to pursue a  different line of work.  Here I am 23 years later and somehow I survived a business that washes out 95% of people within the first five years, then washes more out too.  I survived but I didn't thrive.  I have a gigantic knowledge base.  Being a smoker and a drinker was a detriment to my sales.  I am going for it now and I have the opportunity to have this all even out in the end.  It is a challenge for sure.  I need to work smart and FOCUS.  No wasting of time.  Speaking of time, it's time to get to work.  Have a great day people.  IWNDWYT",7,0

I started smoking weed when I was 15, smoked daily until a few years ago. Started smoking tobacco at 18. I started drinking at around 17. I had a period of illicit drug use in my 20's but have long since wised up to that game.

With my first kid, I briefly stopped most the poisons but still smoked. The only thing I really quit was the marijuana. Then back to the drinking and the tobacco. With my second kid, I was doing great not drinking,(but still smoking) until after he was born. Then back again to the booze right after he was born. As a single Mama to 2 really small kids, I thought this was an appropriate coping method. Turns out, It's a horrible coping method!

I have been wanting to stop poisoning myself for a long time now. And early in 2020, I made it a mission to begin that process. I stopped smoking. It was so hard, I fell off the wagon so many times. Each time I slipped up and smoked, I was so disgusted and ashamed of myself for what I had done. But eventually, my tumbles off the wagon became fewer and fewer. 2 months ago is the last time I fell off the tobacco wagon.

But I was STILL drinking! Not every day, and I did not binge drink every time I drank. Still, I was drinking enough to do real damage to my body. Then the pain hit me, hard. After a few urgent care doctor visits and some imaging appointments, I have discovered that I have beginning stage liver cirrhosis and fatty liver. Well derp, I had been poisoning myself since I was a teenager! No wonder I felt so terrible. 
And that was it. I need to stay alive to raise my kids, because nobody else it going to do it for me. That is a much bigger priority than drinking. They are 1 and 3, so I have a lot of years to go and I need to get that extra mileage out of my poor liver! 

So here I am, coming up on 2 weeks sober with unbreakable resolve and the best reason in the world to continue living. No marijuana, no drugs. No tobacco and finally, no alcohol!  For the first time ever, my body is not being poisoned by my own selfish stupidity. I feel improvements in my body already, and I hope I keep getting better and healing more every day. IWNDWYT!

So over this weekend i decided to drink. I wanted to see how my tolerance was affected. Wanted to see how quick id get drunk. Wanted to see any side effects id get later. Just wanted to see what would happen. I was confident enough in myself to stop after the 2 days. 

So bought a bottle of Sailor Jerry's and stuck to shots. Things i noticed:

My tolerance was more or less the same, which surprised me. I figured itd have gone down considerably. Nope still takes about the same amount to get me drunk.

Sleep was weird. It wasnt the black nothingness like when i drank nightly, but it also wasnt the amazing sober sleep. Woke up a couple times throughout the night because id get really hot. I felt rested enough upon waking up for the day. 

My body felt ""off"" during the day while at work. I felt slightly flushed all throughout my body but it wasnt uncomfortable. Just odd. Best way i can describe it was like i felt wet from the inside out. Idk.

Music is better sober.

The mornings were so heavy. That feeling of being slightly hungover was sickening to me. I hated it.

I found i didnt really like the feeling of being drunk either. Feeling wobbly and such is so damn annoying i found out.

And the fucking constant peeing. So damn irritating. 

The feeling of uncomfortable warmth throughout my body while drinking was annoying.

The Heartburn sucks.

Did have some difficulty getting comfortable when trying to sleep.

Instantly had mucus issues upon waking up. You would think i was sick. 

And more reasons i cant think of right now.


Cant think of anything positive really. 


I know its probly frowned upon to do what i did. But i had to know. It was helpful for me at the very least. Just further solidifies my choice to not drink. 

After the two days, i had no further urge to drink. Didnt really want to drink the second night, but i did anyways just to quench my curiosity. If im gonna test my sobriety im not gonna do it half assed. I need to know.

But it wasnt for naught at least. Probly messed up my sleep for a couple days, but im ok with that in the grand scheme of things.

Just felt like sharing. Im still not sure how to feel myself. Part of me feels ashamed, but part of me is also glad. Regardless IWNDWYT.",12,0

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I remember waking up in the hospital alone and very disoriented. I was immediately shaken from my stupor after being seized by a stream of disjointed images from earlier that day, fragments so horrific that they caused me to bolt upward in bed and survey the damage. Relief washed over me after seeing that I was intact, fine really except for a bandage the size of a wash cloth across my inner thigh. That sense of comfort quickly vanished upon realizing I'd have to make that phone call, yet another one, to my mother. ""Mom,"" I muttered, ""well, I, uh, I impaled my leg."" In retrospect I could have started with something a little less blunt and eased into it a bit. Because the sound she instinctively made was something I'd never heard before, something unintelligible, a primal yelp. It was the sound of fear, of terror. That I caused my mom that kind of distress will always bring me incredible shame.

After calming her down she asked the question I knew was coming. ""How much did you have to drink?"" It was never a question of whether or not I had been drinking, but how much. And I had drank a lot that day, starting around noon like I did everyday. After my daily bar run I scurried back to my apartment, excited to crack into a sixer I had purchased the night before. As I stepped over a short fence, the same metal fence I'd lunged over a thousand times, I tripped and fell backwards, my heavy backpack bringing me down fast but breaking my fall. Embarrassed, I tried to stand up but was stuck. ""Great,"" I said when thinking that my pants had got caught on the fence, ""I just bought these damn jeans."" But when I looked down I saw the blood, and then I saw the post jabbing out of my thigh. Panicking but not in pain due to the shock, I frantically searched for my phone but it was just barely out of reach. I screamed but no one stopped. So this is how it ends, I thought, expecting to bleed out in an apartment courtyard next to a busy city street.

Luckily a young woman came seemingly out of nowhere to help, holding my hand while we waited for the EMT to respond. I'd never been more terrified, laying there immobilized and fearing for my leg, and my life. ""I've made a huge mistake,"" I told the woman when trying to inject a little *Arrested Development* humor into what was the most horrific, embarrassing situation I'd ever experienced. I begged the medical team to not lift me off the fence, fearing the pain that would cause. But it was the only way, of course. All I remember before passing out is how scared I was as I cried out for them to save my leg so that I could play basketball someday with my then one year old son.

You would think that escaping from this situation relatively unscathed would have led me to drastically change my life, to clean myself up. Yet over the next three years I would drink more than I ever had. Because of the severity of my injury, I was instructed to clean my wound and replace the bandages at least 3 times a day. But I grew increasingly more negligent as my alcohol consumption mounted. I was incredibly lucky, on more than one occasion, to not have lost my leg due to complications from infections. Clearly, that wound was an external manifestation of some internal sickness.

Although it's a daily reminder, I was thinking about my wound and the folly that caused it more than usual today. Today marks my 150th day of sobriety. And I'm deeply, profoundly grateful. That I walked away from that incident with a flesh wound is miraculous. That I emerged from over a decade of severe alcoholism without irreparably hurting myself or others is miraculous. It took me a while, but I finally found the tools and support needed to free myself from the clutches of booze. I hope that whatever day of sobriety you're on, if it's day 1, 150, or 10,000, that you take a moment to reflect on what you are grateful for. We're all here trying to fix something we don't like about ourselves. And it's hard and it sucks but we're doing it. I'm going to celebrate the hell out of this day, and I'm going to start by playing some basketball with my son.

Thanks SD for all the support that got me here.

Have a wonderful day Everyone.

Some background information:

I used to drink every single time I was upset or angry about anything and 9/10 times this would help and the other 10% I would literally go on a drunken rage. My life is better without alcohol but for the past couple months I have no outlets for anger. My current life situation has me at home everyday of the week, I can't leave and it's not going to change for at least a year. Last night I was mad and started punching holes in the wall and right now I feel even worse, and I can't focus on my work and studies because of it.",3,0

I‚Äôm on day 60 and I feel great. I go to the gym every day now. I got engaged. I found out I‚Äôm going to be a father. I truly believe the universe has rewarded me for sobriety. 

That being said, this shit isn‚Äôt always easy. I‚Äôve been a bartender for 7 years now. I‚Äôm surrounded by alcohol constantly and temptation is always there. Even today some beer vendors dropped me off 8 different samples of beers to try. Normally I would be enjoying them on the porch after work, but today I just gave them to coworkers. I can‚Äôt just have one drink so none it is. 

Alcohol has been engrained into my life so heavily. Almost my whole family consists of alcoholics. I even remember when I got my first DUI my grandfather shrugged and said it happens. Then I got a second one. Nobody really batted an eye. I‚Äôve been to psych wards for cocaine and alcohol before. I thought I loved drinking and it made everything better. The reality is almost every single problem I‚Äôve had has either been caused or made worse by drinking. 

So at 60 days, the longest I‚Äôve been sober in my adult life, things are finally looking up. I miss alcohol. But I‚Äôve never been someone who can dip their toes in the water. I dive head first. So I‚Äôll stay away from the lake today.",11,0

When the pandemic hit home in March and I started working remotely, my drinking slowly got out of control. My commute went from 30 minutes to 3 seconds - the walk from my bedroom to my office. I could skip my often involved hair/make-up routine. With the new free time, instead of exercising or bettering myself in some way, I just stayed up late drinking every night and sleeping in every morning. Overtime, the drinking snuck up earlier and earlier in the day. I decided enough is enough in September and I'm doing sober October with every intention to continue past into November and beyond...

Going on 13 days sober and working through some gastro upset, but other than that, feeling good! Brain fog is fading, feeling better about myself, and loving not waking up feeling like death.

**The Bad:** I tried to reach out to my first love from many, many years ago in England, and it didn‚Äôt go well.

Thirteen years ago today I walked out of jail the day after crashing another car and earning another drunk driving (my second).  I was broken and demoralized and suicide seemed like a viable option. You see I had quit drinking many times, it was always after something bad or really stupid had happened while I was drunk. But eventually the intensity and calamity of the incident would fade and once again I would pick up that first drink believing that this time I would be more careful. I didn‚Äôt think my real problem was alcohol, I thought it was stupidity.  I mean really how could I be so stupid to get that drunk and make an ass of myself at grandma‚Äôs funeral.  Or how stupid was I to get that drunk and back into another mailbox.  And seriously how stupid was I to get so drunk that I wake up in a wet bed feeling like shit and not remembering large chunks of the evening.  So ya, I walked out of that jail with a loop of agonizing commentary in my head that would not shut down. I know that I never felt too drunk to drive which is... well‚Ä¶. stupid. So in my heart I was despairing because of my past inability to stay quit. My next dui would be a felony which seemed likely based on past behavior. I didn‚Äôt think I was an alcoholic and the reason for that is that I didn't know what alcoholism was.  My conception of an alcoholic was being insanely drunk everyday or being the town drunk. That wasn‚Äôt me. I didn‚Äôt drink everyday and I didn‚Äôt even get drunk every time I drank. But here‚Äôs the thing. It turns out I have a switch in me that after I start drinking it sometimes gets turned on and when it‚Äôs on I lose all control over my consumption. I don‚Äôt know when it‚Äôs going to flip on but when it does,  look out, and I don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs happened usually till the next morning.   

So I get an attorney and he recommends that I attend a few AA meetings.  I knew nothing about the program but I assumed it would be total humiliation. He said it would look good for the judge. I thought it would be humiliating and at that moment total humiliation was exactly what I thought I deserved. And that‚Äôs the mindset I walked up to my first meeting with.  Through the help I received from certain gold hearted people simply sharing their stories and hopes for me and telling me exactly how they do it,  here I am thirteen years later and I‚Äôm still living in recovery and living life.  It works for me.  I know AA is not for everyone. That‚Äôs ok.  If alcohol is making your life worse and you want to stop please keep trying.

Each withdrawal leads to more severe withdrawal symptoms than in previous episodes. Individuals who have had more withdrawal episodes are at an increased risk of very severe withdrawal symptoms, up to and including seizures and death. Long-term use of GABAergic-acting sedative‚Äìhypnotic drugs causes chronic GABA receptor downregulation as well as glutamate overactivity, which can lead to drug and neurotransmitter sensitization, central nervous system hyperexcitability, and excitotoxicity.

Drinking isn't for me.  It never was.  It takes, it doesn't give.  It causes me anxiety, it doesn't relieve it.  It's an illusion.  Alcohol is a depreciating drug that over time takes more and more from you.  I'm done.  I quit drinking today and forever.  I want to come back to this post a year from now, sober and prove to myself that I did it.

I have never woken up in the morning regretting not drinking the day before.  However I have always regretted drinking the next morning.

I'm doing this for myself, my daughter, and my family.  I owe it to myself to be clean and sober, because I am worth it.  

I will never drink again, and I will never change my mind.",17,0

Would drink redbull and vodka staying up until 2am. Then I started drinking during the week a little about 3 shots of vodka with 1 can of redbull while playing games after work.

I did this for 10 years, but now im not playing games as much but coming home from work and pouring about 4 shots in a glass and drinking it straight. Been doing this almost everyday with only a few days not because I dont feel like going to the store to get more. 

Im not getting drunk out of my mind or doing anything unhealthy like losing a job or abusing my family, in fact im the ""loving"" drinker if thats a thing. 

Im just afraid im hurting myself and my liver to much. I had to go to the ER bc of a weird chest pain that felt like a heart attack. They said my heart and stomach was fine but when I told them that night I was up very late drinking redbull and vodka about 5 redbulls I was told I need to stop that.

Im not sure if im an alcoholic or if this is normal amount of drinking or if I should really cut back or stop. This is my 1st week not drinking but I know when fridays comes in 3 days ill be back at the store buying another 30$ bottle, but im going to try hard not to.",10,0

Didn‚Äôt have the easiest time falling asleep but I eventually dozed off around midnight (thanks to Melatonin). 

And would you imagine it, I actually felt good when I woke up without a debilitating hangover! Very grateful today with my decision to not drink yesterday and as such, I pledged again to not drink today. The urges were still strong today but I found that they were easier to push away now that I feel good and have an incentive rather than going thru a hangover. I do know though at some point in the near future, the withdrawal I went through will be a distant memory and it will be a bitch to fight off the urges to pick up the bottle again.

As this thread has been so helpful for me, I figured I‚Äôd share what worked for me thus far in case someone‚Äôs in the same boat as me.

1) ‚ÄúUrge Meditation‚Äù I downloaded the app ‚ÄòDrinkersHelper‚Äô which I highly recommend to anyone fighting strong urges to drink. You can chose if you want to quit for good or just set an amount of days to not drink so it really is for everyone. It‚Äôs free but has a subscription option where I‚Äôm sure you get a lot more. Anyways, there‚Äôs a section of the app called ‚ÄòProgram‚Äô and it has several courses where it walks you thru various parts of quitting and gives practical tricks to combat them. I got the most out of ‚ÄòUrge Meditation‚Äô that basically tells you to meditate thru the urges to drink. Instead of running away from them (to the bar or liquor store) try to walk towards them in your head and note how you feel, what you feel like doing, what‚Äôs going on in your head, etc. and keep doing that until they go away. It wasn‚Äôt 100% effective and it took 5-10 mins but it was a big help. And in all likelihood, you wouldn‚Äôt be to the bar or liquor store in that amount of time so you don‚Äôt have a lot to lose. 

2) I‚Äôve been treating this account like a sobriety diary and when the urges came on strong when I stopped work for the day, I decided to read back on my last few posts to try and re-live how I felt the past few days. I also took a selfie at my worst and well... that sure was a great motivation tool to not drink. I sure hope no one ever sees that but me. 

3) I have a softball league I play in every Thursday night and to this point, I‚Äôve shown up sober but mid-binge and it‚Äôs hurts tying to play during a bender. It‚Äôs one day at a time here, but definitely no drinking until that point at least as I want to play well and not be in pain for the whole game. 

4) Monday is critical. This is something I‚Äôve known for a while but if I drink on Monday, I won‚Äôt stop drinking the rest of the week. And if I don‚Äôt stop during the week, there‚Äôs no hope for the weekend either, regardless of what I have planned. I‚Äôm a daily drinker and if I don‚Äôt set a clear line on Mondays, I‚Äôll just tack on another week to the bender. I absolutely have to stop on Monday‚Äôs if I slip up on a weekend. 

That‚Äôs all for now. I hope you all are well. IWNDWYT.",5,0

I became sober because I was starting my 2nd round of IVF. a couple weeks into it, i realized that maybe this should be a longer experience. In the past, I've gotten sober for diets (whole 30, trying to cut carbs, etc) and at most only lasted a few weeks at a time.

but the truth is that my family is full of alcoholics. we all binge drink. my dad's 6 siblings are all sober and my dad is still a raging alcoholic. (they're all in their mid 70s-80s) i grew up with him drinking and driving me everywhere. all of my 6 siblings are drinkers, and they all probably binge drink/party more than they should. my dad's parents were both huge alcoholics. my grandma would make frozen whiskey sours for all of the CHILDREN after church every sunday. young children!!! she and my grandpa had their own drinking buddies. we all struggle. meanwhile my mom has never had a drink and the side of her family doesn't suffer from alcoholism. my mom never acknowledges or brings up addiction or alcoholism ever. she just ignores it.

before this latest round of ivf, i was drinking 2-4 drinks a day. i would wake up the day after with a massive hangover and carpal tunnel flare-ups. i have endometriosis and always felt like shit. but i love how alcohol loosened me up. i leaned on it as a way to relax when i was stressed out. it helped me so much.

my whole life i've drank. like since i was 15. i've had so many blackouts. i've had sex with so many strangers. put myself at risk so many times. i was a mess.

since i stopped drinking, my carpal tunnel has been minimal/gone. i am an artist so that's been so amazing for me. i also go to bed at 9-10pm, where before i was going to bed around midnight because i just wanted one more drink.

i toss and turn in bed/get very little sleep if i drink or don't drink. i thought my sleeping patterns would get easier but they haven't. i do wake up more alert, earlier. but i have sluggish energy from my IVF.

my food/sugar cravings are through the roof. am i going to get diabetes from this? i'm not joking. i'm constantly ingesting sugars. i feel sick from IVF/hormonal shifts and don't move much, when before, i had the energy to workout/walk around.

my boyfriend is great but now that i'm sober i can tell he drinks a LOT. i don't encourage him to drink less because i don't want to be nagging. this is my personal journey. but i think at some point i am going to mention to him that we should try this together, that i care about him. a few weeks ago he bought me a bottle of wine to drink and i keep ignoring it. he finally put it away and i felt so much relief.

i try to remind myself that alcohol is poison. alcohol affects my family in so many negative ways. my family doesn't communicate on a deeper level about anythign with each other. they brush their problems under rugs and try to celebrate with alcohol as much as possible. it's all small talk with them. they dont have many hobbies besides their children, which is fine. but i can tell they don't focus on themselves. it worries me that my dad is still an alcoholic. im glad covid hit and he was furloughed from his job because he was driving around a lot for work. apparently his last job knew he drank and drove and didn't care, because his boss did it. idk. my mind is a mess.

i'm in therapy and do physical therapy and just had surgery/IVF blah blah blah. i'm going through big life changes like working on tv development and i'm just overwhelmed with covid/quarantine. i feel like this is the one thing i have control over in my life and i hope i can stick with it as long as my aunts and uncles.

Early on in my drinking I recognized my drinking wasn‚Äòt ‚Äònormal‚Äô.  At about age 21 I put myself in the hospital for 3 days due to a motorcycle accident, pretty amazing i didn‚Äôt get a DUI, but those were different days.  I did manage to quit drinking for 3 months after the accident but this was done without the support of AA.  My last day of drinking at age 23 I passed out driving home from a friends house.  I left the scene of the accident but police caught up with me about 4-5 hours after the accident and at that point I blew over the limit.   Will never forget the police officers words to me: ‚Äòson, you are an alcholic‚Äô.  

Best decision of my life was to reach out and ask for help and I got it in spades.  My employer sent me to rehab for 30 days and paid my salary (I was a mailroom employee!). The university I was attending refunded my tuition and I got great support from family and friends.  The support I got made a lasting impression and really helped me follow through with turning my life around, don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for help!

So life has been really good for me and I truly grateful.  I am happily married (33 years) with 2 kids and 3 grandkids.  After about a year of sobriety I went back to school and got my degree.  Once I got my degree my employer promoted me and I just retired with them after 37 years and at least 10 different positions.

Don‚Äôt know exactly why I have been able to stay sober while many have not been as fortunate.  A few things that have worked for me include:

* Going to treatment, yes it was a long time but it made a lasting impression for me
* Go to AA meetings regularly, for me the first year was about 2-3 meeting per week.
* My family has been there for me, my mom has been sober over 40 years and many members of my family are no longer drinking.  By the way my Mom still has lunch every week with someone she met at her first AA meeting!  
* Develop new hobbies, for me it was golfing and running
* New set of friends who support my new lifestyle
* My wife and her family completely support my sober lifestyle

Would also like to point out that even though I don‚Äôt drink I still have many inadequacies.  The objective for me is to maintain sobriety and seek serenity despite my imperfections.  I don‚Äôt know how long I will maintain my sobriety, the only thing that I know is that I will not drink today.",188,0

For the first time last night I dreamed that I was in my new house. At least it was an approximation of it being that dreams are amorphous and shift in weird ways. I was looking out over my backyard and I saw a jaguar stalking my cat who had somehow gotten outside. I was able to quickly get my cat back safely inside without any issue. The jaguar, though, kept circling the house, hunting it's prey. Looking through the window I saw it catch another cat, an orange and white tabby, and I watched as the jaguar crushed the poor thing between it's jaws while the tabby looked to me as if asking for help. It was such a brutal and sad sight, and I can still imagine the sound. I woke up briefly, thinking how strange and wicked the dream had been, but I went back to sleep without much more thought. 

Continuing on in the dream, which never happens to me once I've awoken, I found myself trying to find my cat in my new house who's rooms changed and shifted in unexpected ways as I passed through them. I looked through a window and realized my cat had again escaped to the backyard, and again I rushed to her rescue. Though this time the jaguar leapt out and attacked me, wounding me by sinking its claws into my arms and shoulders; teeth gnashing inches from my face. The pain felt so real. I was finally able to wrestle it to the ground and choke it to death before it could get its teeth around my neck to kill me.

I woke up sweating, gasping, burning up, truly afraid. It's still somewhat jarring to even recant the experience. I immediately started checking dream meanings online because of how strange and powerful the experience had been. I'm almost certain no jaguar had ever appeared in my dreams before, especially not in such a visceral way.

Miller's dream book, and several other sources, said that fighting and killing a jaguar in one's dreams usually represents the fear of encountering a very powerful and dangerous situation or entity in the near future, but also to take solice in knowing that with careful planning and honest evaluation of your life and the situations ahead you know that, like in the dream, you can overcome it. I generally believe dream imagery to be a doorway, or at least to have some insight, into one's own psyche, and I believe those sources to be correct in this case. 

It made me think of both my ongoing battle with my addictions, and with the upcoming legal battle I brought upon myself while enthralled by my addictions. In my past I know I've been much more likely to run away and hide from my problems; disregard them entirely and constantly lie about their existence to anyone who cared enough to ask. I know now that the only way to move forward is to acknowledge them for what they are and to face them honestly. 

""The jaguar"" is very real for me and I know it will crush me between it's jaws if I ever turn my back on it or try to pretend that its not there lurking in my mind.",6,0

Giving up alcohol is different.  I would want to give up in bed at night, being sure this was the best plan, yet in the morning I would over rule that idea as ridiculous and come mid day I would start to drink my way through one or two bottles of wine. I just drank it at home on my own as I worked on whatever I was doing. It seemed normal to me. I never felt angry or any of the things people speak of. I live alone, so there is no one to be angry with! 

But then I started to get visual disturbances, and high blood pressure. I was really shocked when the eye doctor told me I had damaged optic nerves, and then the next tests showed that my carotid arteries are blocked.  This concentrated the mind a bit. So I decided to give up the wine. It is quite hard though. I am at day twelve now today. I woke up this morning without the heavy feeling. I slept a bit better. I can now stay up later. I used to get so tired I was going to bed by eight o'clock. 

Those waves of urgent need for a glass of wine though are quite hard to ride.  They are overwhelming. Happily they don't last long and I can drink water or tea, and eat things to distract myself.  Currently I am eating blueberries.  

My brain decides that I don't really need to give it up, I could just have the odd drink?  I have to convince myself that I cannot have the odd drink and it will be ok.

I spent the entire long weekend drunk or hung to the roof.  I didn't do anything fun or productive except for sit in a chair in between fixing drink after drink.  I don't do anything fun or productive on most any weekend.  I usually ""celebrate"" making it through a work week by getting blackout on Friday night.  I sit in a chair hung over all Saturday, and I usually still feel bad on Sunday.  Then it's back to sitting at the computer all week by myself, as I work from home.

I've been a heavy binge drinker since I was 21.  I'm a pretty extreme introvert, and possibly autistic, so I trained myself early to believe I needed to be decently tipsy to socialize, even with lifelong friends.  Even through two DUIs and losing a relationship that meant the world to me, I never could kick the habit.  I'd use it to escape myself, to escape my racing brain and my anxieties and my fears and my loneliness.  But the pain and loneliness from drinking is outweighing all of my other mental deficiencies.  It's a cycle I am ready to stop.

I haven't drank since Sunday.  I'm feeling very tired and depressed, probably some kind of withdrawal.  I usually go a couple days, then something triggers me, and I just do it all over again.  I don't want to do it over again.

I've read many posts and stories on here today, and I don't feel so alone or ashamed of my alcoholism.  I appreciate all of your experiences and vulnerability, and I hope I can find whatever it is I need to push through to the next day.

I‚Äôve been lurking in this community for about a year now, and finally realized that no amount of trying to moderate will ever work for me. I had on Saturday what I hope to be my last ‚Äúepisode‚Äù involving alcohol. I am not a daily drinker, although before I cut back in April, I did drink almost every day or every other day. Then my husband finally broke down and explained to me that I was abusive to him while drinking. Every bad episode I have had in my life was also fueled by alcohol. Since then I have spent weeks (approximately 1 to 1.5 months at a time) sober, and then when someone handed me a drink I tried to convince myself that having ‚Äújust a few‚Äù was okay. 

I suffer from Bipolar 1 disorder and I am high functioning, but it never occurred to me just how much I was drinking to try and cope with my anxiety and agitation. The alcohol was like throwing gasoline on a dangerous fire. I become a person I do not recognize when I drink too much. I never intend to drink too much, but I have noticed that I either nervously try to moderate and never quite feel the buzz I am looking for, or I am off the rails drunk. When I am not drinking I don't need a lot of medication to remain stabilized, and I am a pretty happy/well-adjusted person. This is what I need to remember about Bipolar and alcohol - the two can't ever mix. 

I was manic this past weekend and did not realize it. I fully intended to have a fun day outside in public, and only have a couple drinks, but those couple drinks were high ABV shots that I had on an empty stomach and little water (mania impairs my ability to think clearly or rationally). Within hours I had degraded from being coherent to barely coherent and stumbling in public. I had to be escorted to a first aid tent for my safety. It is absolutely embarrassing to think that total strangers had to take care of me while I was intoxicated. I had no idea I would get that bad, and I misjudged that my mania would help me convince myself that I could have a drink. If it weren‚Äôt for those kind strangers escorting me, I could have been hurt, or far worse could have even gone missing I was so bad.

My husband is at his breaking point with me and I do not blame him at all. For years I have tried to address my Bipolar 1 disorder but not my AUD. Then I finally addressed my AUD this year, but not how my Bipolar 1 influences it. I did not want to admit that I am one of those people that cannot drink alcohol at all. But I am one of those people and life will be much better for me and my husband if I cut it out. My husband means everything to me, and I will do everything I can to remain sober. It‚Äôs very difficult to live in a society that glorifies drinking, but I know I am happier without alcohol. I don‚Äôt have to live with the fear of ‚Äúwill I lose control?‚Äù and ‚Äúwho I will I hurt?‚Äù every day if I continue to deny that alcohol is a problem for me. 

For the sake of my health, my marriage, my personal relationships, my mental health, and my job, I have to cut out alcohol completely. I wish I didn‚Äôt crave this poison and associate it with fun, because I have had so much fun in my life without alcohol. I think, as I read another user reference, almost all of my regrets in my adult life have resulted from drinking too much alcohol. It‚Äôs not worth the risk nor the daily fear. I want to live without that black cloud hanging over my head that ‚Äútoday‚Äôs the day my husband will leave me‚Äù or ‚Äútoday‚Äôs the day I end up in the drunk tank.‚Äù 

I am under the care of a medical professional for my Bipolar 1, including therapy for the mental illness and substance abuse. I now just have to take each day as it comes, I Will Not Drink With You Today. And I will try to check in here as often as I can to support others and get support when needed.

I believe it is an irish proverb, again it goes:

*A man takes a drink, the drink takes a drink, the drink takes the man.*

Essentially it means that for some, one drink is too many because it only leads to more and it becomes impossible to stop until the drink has the man completely under its control.

It might sound particularly familiar since it was quoted in ""The Shining"" sequel ""Doctor Sleep"".  Pretty good scene between an alcoholic son and the ghost of his alcoholic Father if youre not familiar with the movies/books:

Then I went to bed at 2am got up for work at 5am (to work my regular 7am-7pm shift as a nurse). I took a nap in my car during my break which isn‚Äôt technically NOT allowed but def a very weird thing to do and entirely off brand for me. Apparently I seemed odd enough and altered that someone mentioned something, and security came to breathalyze me. 

Failed it so hard, had to call my husband (who did not know about the midnight pint and was understandably livid) to come pick me up as security escorted me off premises. 

I have a call with my boss in several minutes (she‚Äôs been out of town since incident but is aware). I am ready to accept all and every consequence/action per protocol. Obviously I‚Äôm desperate to keep my job but I also feel like absolute shit for potentially endangering patients, the unit, staff, myself by drinking that pint.

ANYWAY. I am ready to try sobriety again- it‚Äôs been two days and I haven‚Äôt drank and I‚Äôve promised to get real help. I‚Äôve been so ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù for so long I‚Äôve always had that ‚ÄúI can just stop drinking hard alcohol and be fine‚Äù mentality in the back of my mind. That may very well be the case for some people, but it‚Äôs very clear to me I need entire sobriety from all alcohol in my life. My biggest sadness, as lame as it sounds, is losing my ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù of 16 years, booze. I‚Äôve had so many wake up calls I should have heeded but this one I‚Äôm gonna try to listen to. That means switching up my approach and entering a higher level of care that outpatient therapy if need be.

My question for y‚Äôall is- as I go about this journey a different way this time- anyone else feel at the time of getting sober they were losing a friend (as effed up as that sounds)? And after gaining significant sobriety (in however you personally define it), what have you been pleasantly surprised by/enjoying without booze in your life?

I‚Äôm trying to look forward to the benefits of this new ‚Äúbottom‚Äù in that it‚Äôs a true wake up call-  it‚Äôs just hard to keep that focus right now, especially as potentially compromising my job/license is causing me a ton of panic and I can use my good ole friend vodka to help me out.

Okay, so I got sober in 2015 and stayed that way for close to a year. I had to because of a custody battle for my kids and that gave me complete unwavering will power. Ever since then, I slowly slid back down to where now I have been drinking daily for the past couple of years. This has gotten infinitely worse since the pandemic and the initial quarantine.

For the past 4-5 months, once I realized how bad I had gotten, I have been trying to quit again unsuccessfully. At first, I thought I could taper, but that didn't work, so I started trying cold turkey. The problem is, I can do fine for three or four days, but then my brain somehow turns against me. I start feeling like I should 'reward myself' or have a 'cheat day'. Inevitably, even if I go back to not drinking that next day, it's always the same thing within another 3-4 days.

I feel like if I could get through that barrier and make it to a week or two that it would get easier, I just need advice on any tricks that any of you may have used if you experienced the same thing. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

For some reason I thought of what the writer David Foster Wallace used to say about the urge to ‚Äúgive ourselves away‚Äù to something, anything.  I recognized the pouring of a drink differently: as myself being poured out, rather than preparing to pour something intoxicating into myself. 

The more days of not-drinking I have, the more depth I seem to experience, both with regard to the external and the internal, personal world.  An example of this is being able to understand my motivations in certain situations.  I‚Äôm not sure if I was simply distracted before or unwilling to face these truths or a combo of both.  Whatever the reason, it is a profound experience to be able to ‚Äúsee further‚Äù (or closer, as the case may be).

I had started morning drinking and could not function without alcohol and even then I was an utter shambles. I contacted my gp and spoke honestly about my drinking. He was able to give me meds for a home detox which was brutal but ultimately successful. If I had continued drinking like I was back then god only knows if I would have survived. I was a daily drinker for about 25 years but rarely to excess until winter 2019. Once it had a grip on me there was only one way to head and that was down. I'm so happy to be rid of alcohol in my life now and I look forward to waking up each day and getting on with my life which was the complete opposite to my drinking days.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Shortly following the introduction of the eponymous character in *Lawrence of Arabia*, the most iconic scene of a film renown for its breathtaking cinematography takes place in a dingy basement. After T. E. Lawrence, a Lieutenant in the British army, lit a cigarette for a fellow officer, he casually extinguished the match between his fingers without displaying any sign of pain. ""Ohhh, it damn well hurts,"" the other soldier exclaimed when attempting to copy Lawrence. ""Certainly it hurts,"" Lawrence replied nonchalantly. When asked how he pulled it off, Lawrence famously declared ""The trick . . . is not minding that it hurts.""

Not minding that it hurts. I remember the first time I heard this phrase and feeling like I had stumbled upon a profound revelation, a radically new way for understanding and expressing all the pain and anguish within me. It's commonly assumed that Lawrence is essentially providing a standard definition of stoicism. This is understandable given that he doesn't express pain (or any emotion for that matter) in the scene, and that the words ""not minding"" could connote indifference to that pain. But as the film unfolds the deceptively simple phrase is clearly revealed to be Lawrence's guiding philosophy for dealing with suffering and struggle. Not minding, for Lawrence, means accepting that the deep emotional and psychological wounds we acquire as we move through our lives will hurt. And rather than practicing indifference toward those psychic injuries, he earnestly seeks to experience and observe them so that he can better understand and possibly dispel the pain ailing him. Over the course of the movie he suffers extensively. Wandering the desert subjects him to all kinds of physical distress and peril, and at one point he is even tortured. Yet it's the crushing feelings of loss and grief that truly torment him, and the way he processes and works through these inner upheavals is admirable. Lawrence is showing us that it's a good thing to hurt because that's what makes us caring and compassionate human beings. And while it's difficult to confront and probe the aches that afflict us, we grow stronger by doing so. Our capacity for managing and overcoming hurt expands. Naturally, we avoid pain, we run from it, we're afraid of it. But if we accept and endure the discomfort our hurt causes, we greatly diminish the power that negative emotions exert over us and that thwarts our potential.

This is how I have worked through the vicissitudes of sobriety. I always failed to even start my sober journey because I was too scared of the mental and physical struggle awaiting me. But not minding that it hurts, and sometimes it hurts terribly, has made it possible to at least give it a proper go this time round. I've done and said a lot of awful things during my drinking career. And I have to sit with myself in the sometimes horrible stillness of blank days and nights and work through those intrusive thoughts and feelings. I have to let them hurt.

I'll end with a passage from a poem by Jalaluddin Rumi titled ""The Guest House"" that I think lyrically expresses what Lawrence dramatized.

""A joy, a depression, a meanness,

some momentary awareness comes

as an unexpected visitor . . .

The dark thought, the shame, the malice,

meet them at the door laughing,

and invite them in.""

I'd love to hear of your coping mechanisms and how you get through the tough times, because you never know who you could help push through a difficult spell with a little bit of advice.

Have a lovely Tuesday Everyone!

He reminded me of Christmas time last year when I showed up in a bad state to a family gathering. The way he described it I did not do a good job covering the fact I was high on amphetamines and very drunk, he said him and his girlfriend (now fianc√©!) ‚Äúfelt bad for me.‚Äù And that the transformation in my behavior and how present I am is as if I am a completely different person.

I also told him about a time last year when I was doing 4-5 different drugs a day and spending almost 700 pounds on my habit a week while lying about it. He thanked me for telling him, and it was one more action keeping me from ever being able to go back to pretending I am a normal recreational user of substances. I am not, and I‚Äôm not going to lie to myself or my loved ones about it anymore.

As wonderful as it is to have these reminders of what a mess I was, it is also a little shameful for me to recall these moments. Along with being insufferable and spacey I appearently also looked terrible! Hearing these 3rd person perspectives remind me why I am not drinking today, and will be lucky to never drink again. My best friend who I went on this journey with relapsed today, and after she told me that I found two full bottles of very nice wine but instead of caving I immediately called my mom and had her remove them. I am solid in my decision.

I drank daily for over 5 years and binge drank 2-5 times a week for about 10 years before that. In my early 30s. Was fairly certain I had done some serious damage to myself. With two young kids, I was terrified of getting any further testing done.

Very minor fatty liver noted, but something that can be taken care of through diet and exercise.

Bullet dodged. Lesson learned. I definitely owe my body (especially my liver and brain) some good years of treating it right.

What are you guys reading and watching and listening to?

I've been talking about triggers and how romanticized alcohol is so much pop culture over the past few weeks and then last week mentioned how refreshing it is to see it portrayed negatively. Well the book I'm reading now is terrific because first and foremost it's just a really great work of literature but secondly, it shows alcohol as nothing but a vile, life-destroying intoxicant. Everything from the taste of it and the tawdry marketing on the containers to the piecing together what happened in a blackout the night before and needing to drink any disgusting alcohol that might be laying around to ward off the shakes. I'm talking about *Shuggie Bain* by Douglas Stuart. 

Big thanks to whoever recommended it to me (I believe several of you have actually). I couldn't find the comment though I dug and dug through my history. 

If you're looking for escapism right now, this book ain't it. But if you're looking for something literary and weighty, give it a whirl.

for several years i struggled to quit. knowing i should stop. But I was still waking up hungover and depressed

The more I analyze something the more obsessed with the less relevant details i get, ultimately bringing me further away from the overall outcome i wanted in the first place. (this case = sobriety).

I would become trapped by the tyranny of own mind, complicating the small moments of wanting to drink..
  i was trying to conquer these little moments soo hard, that i was consumed by the little moments. 
Everyday, Viciously debating weather or not to drink like a fish... it was overwhelming because I felt as tho my future depended on my sobriety success. 
   it starts to get out a hand and very serious, very fast.    
                        relax. tranquillo.   

    Once i shifted my goal from winning today,  to winning 1 month, then 1 year,  a single day had less power. it became easier to accept that there was no drinking today.
       After a few years i started thinking. what if i just NEVER drink again. 1 year doesn't even seem like a huge hurdle, anymore, over the spectrum of a lifetime.
  
drinking was just an obstacle that i was putting in front of myself anyway..

I've always enjoyed beer and cocktails out with friends, occasionally to excess, and ever since my mom died a few years back have increasingly ""enjoyed"" a few beers by myself. These days I drink 2-3 IPAs every single night, and I don't even really know why. I know it's not ""a lot"" compared to many, and it hasn't caused any serious problems in my life yet, but it's started to bother me that when I tell myself I won't have a beer tonight, I still find myself reaching for one, and when I say I'll have just one, I almost never do. I'm gaining weight, my sleep sucks, and taking out the recycling every week is embarrassing. My sister is a recovering addict who had many stints in jail and rehab, and her trajectory was so different from mine it was easy for me to tell myself for a long time that I couldn't end up like her, but I'm recognizing more and more that I'm on a path that's going a bad direction, and I need to get on another one.

I'm reading Allen Carr's The Easy Way to Stop Drinking and while I'm not sure I agree with everything he has to say, it has been very clarifying. One of his big points is to break down the idea that there's some sort of fundamental difference between ""normal drinkers"" and ""alcoholics"" - since alcohol is an addictive and dangerous substance, many of those ""normal"" drinkers (he says all, but I think many is probably more accurate) are sliding towards the same place, just at different rates. If you were sinking slowly in quicksand, you shouldn't look over at someone who was almost engulfed and feel like you were doing so much better than them, or envy those who were sinking even slower. You'd get the heck out of the quicksand while you still could.

Like everyone, I've been extra bored and anxious lately. I spotted some kratom at a local gas station, and was immediately tempted. I'd never taken kratom before, but I'd heard that it really works and is very opioid-like. I knew it was a bad idea given my history, but it wedged in my mind for a few days, and ultimately I went and got some. I set some guidelines (x days a week, only when y and z) and of course immediately violated those.

At first I took what I thought was a small to medium dose, and it got me so high I could barely focus my eyes. I put it down for a day, then the next day I started with half of the original dose, got a buzz, and then compulsively re-dosed every time I felt like I was going to come down for the rest of the day. Typical addict behavior.

I woke up the next morning (today) with a slamming headache, and went to make breakfast for my family. I immediately broke out in the worst cold sweat I've ever had. I was drenched, and I was wearing a t-shirt and pajama pants in a 62 degree room. It wasn't long before I started puking violently and had to call my wife for help. I came clean to her about what was up, because I'm sure otherwise she would have thought I was dying. She's disappointed to say the least.

I'm not sure what my reaction was all about. I hadn't read about anyone being this hungover/physically withdrawing from kratom after such a short time and relatively moderate doses. I know a lot of people take kratom as a harm-reduction measure, and I'm not here to tell you it's evil or that it's against everyone's sobriety, but this incident was a serious lapse in my sobriety.

I was not honest with myself, I was not honest with my family, I knew it would be a bad idea because opiates have always been a favorite of mine, and I'm in a place where I can't keep my hand out of a cookie jar filled with actual cookies, let alone a cookie jar filled with drugs that make you feel all warm and fuzzy.

October 2019: https://imgur.com/jbGD2UG October 2020: https://imgur.com/HWTQfSp

This post is meant to be about the progress I made since I quit drinking and committed to turning my physical and mental health around one year ago today, so I don't want to dwell too long on how I became a suicidal alcoholic in the first place. I think those of you on this sub probably get it. 

My 2019: 
Another traumatic event, and it felt like something in my brain broke. I went from drinking too much in the evenings, to suddenly being unable to quit drinking once I started. My drinking binges escalated to up to a fifth a day and I started getting withdrawal when I wasn't drinking. I was puking frequently; I often skipped food for days at a time, then binge ate junk food whenever I felt like I could keep food down. I went to the ER several times: for an alcohol withdrawal seizure resulting from me trying to quit drinking at home after my worst binge, two literally paralyzing panic attacks that caused my arms and jaw to seize up, and alcoholic ketoacidosis. I would manage to stay sober for a couple weeks at a time, tops, then get triggered by something and think I could have/deserved just one beer, and start the horrible cycle all over again. It was terrifying to feel so out of control. In hindsight, though, I think I needed to fail several times before I could 100% commit to getting sober. 

I scared the shit out of my family and friends. I also lied to them by promising them I wouldn't drink then sneaking booze places even when they were around watching me. The lying, then being obviously drunk around them, made me feel even more worthless. I was fat and out of shape. In October 2019, I puked after shuffling one mile in 13 minutes, and couldn't do a single chin-up. Considering I was climbing mountains and running half-marathons as recently as 2017, I was deeply humiliated. 

I felt worthless and that nothing mattered. I stopped investing in my long-term friendships and sat home alone, drinking and crying. I had no interest in my old hobbies or anything outside my own misery. I thought about suicide daily. 

I took two long leaves of absence from work. My reputation was in the shitter and I was likely very close to getting fired.

I was admitted to a psych inpatient ward for suicidal ideation and massive alcohol-induced mood swings. A few months later, on October 13th 2019, 365 days ago, I conceded my complete and utter defeat and checked myself into rehab.



My 2020 so far: 

Not a drop of alcohol. 

My depression and anxiety aren't anywhere near 'gone' - but they're manageable. And, given the state of 2020 and my track record, that's basically a miracle. Sure, some days I am angry. Some days I have a racing heart and feel sick to my stomach. I meditate, talk through it with a friend, go for a walk, or watch something funny on TV. I don't throw a pity party, drink until I pass out, or punch walls. 

I lost 30 pounds and gained some muscle. Compared to my previous benchmarks from this time last year, I can do 14 chin-ups in a row, run a sub 8 minute mile, and throw around my 70 lb dumbbell that I couldn't do anything except pick up off the ground last year. 

I returned to my old favorite hobby of mountaineering, and climbed a glaciated peak that had been on my list for years -- an 18 hour roundtrip gaining then descending 7,000 feet of elevation in beautiful but challenging terrain. 

Traumas from the past don't own my mind the way they used to. Therapy and a sober mind have helped me work through things, whereas before I was stuck, for years not able to process or move forward from wounds of the past. 

I regained stability in my job and am getting positive feedback. I was recently appointed to manage a big launch and it went pretty well. 

I was entrusted to watch over my 2 year old nephew when my sister had to go to the hospital. Nobody would have trusted me with a toddler this time last year; I wasn't even able to take care of myself. 

My relationship with my parents has noticeably improved. They went from trying to manage the crazy behavior of an adult son to trusting me to do things right. 

I regularly check up on my friends. I've had several reach out to me with concerns about their drinking and/or their mental health, and I'm actually able to support them. I remember birthdays and surgeries and other important events in others' lives. 

Instead of just being pissed off about politics, I'm getting more informed, and donating and volunteering online to causes I care about.



In term of the HOW, the short answer is: 
I woke up with the shakes and a feeling of doom one morning after having had yet another drunken depressive meltdown in front of my friends. I had a moment of clarity that if I didn't do something drastic, the situation was fucked. I had been crushed by the suicide of my best friend a few years earlier, and realized with total clarity I was following in his footsteps. Just as he had passed his pain onto me and others, I was a few steps from being dead myself and passing on my pain to those around me, which I found unacceptable. Everything after stemmed from this moment of clarity I had. 

I immediately went to rehab where I learned about how addiction works medically, and how to manage it. I was told I had only a ~20% chance of staying sober for a year, and a ~10% chance of being dead within the year. I learned about the horrific relationship between mental health issues and substance abuse. After I got out of rehab I went straight into both AA and continuing outpatient addiction therapy. 

After some trial and error, I found antidepressants that worked for me. 

I started eating better, and exercising and meditating daily. I viewed my daily self-care work as even more important than the 'actual' work I get paid to do. 

I began to understand the truth behind some platitudes: discipline over motivation, consistency over intensity, and patience and kindness towards myself. More details on this in an older post I made: https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gr8rq7/after_225_days_sober_and_120_days_of_exercise/



I also wanted to be open about my life circumstances. Yes, my brain is still healing from the alcohol abuse and I'm experiencing post-acute withdrawal symptoms which, combined with antidepressant-brain, make everything harder. 2020 has been a crazy year to be newly sober in. I'm regularly working 60+ hectic hours a week. I live alone in quarantine which has sucked. All that said, I don't want to be blind to the things I have going for me, which not everybody has, that made my journey easier:

I am lucky I never drove drunk, or got into other trouble -- I don't have legal repercussions following me around. 

I have no partner, kids, pets, etc. -- which allows me to spent a lot of time working on myself. 

My family and friends didn't abandon me when I was a trainwreck to be around, and have been supportive of my recovery -- this is not the case for many people

I am able to work from home during COVID on full salary.

I had put close to a decade of good work in before my crisis, so I am in a financially secure position.

I'm extremely lucky my manager was sympathetic to my mental health crisis and that I didn‚Äôt get fired in 2019 for calling in sick a bunch, showing up after having had a few shots in the morning to calm my withdrawal for a couple hours, etc. I don't know if they knew about my alcoholism, but my guess is yes. They actually quit the company while I was in rehab so, bad performance reports aside, I had a semi-clean slate when I returned to work.

My health insurance covered inpatient and continued outpatient care, which were both critical to my recovery.

TLDR - I worked my ass off, but I've also been lucky in a lot of ways too. I am grateful to be alive and sober.",305,2
1830,2020-10-12 15:05:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/j9x88r/i_am_an_alcoholic/,I am an alcoholic,"Hello reddit friends,

I hope someone out there manages to read this and give me some kind words. For a little story, I joined this sub in January 2018, following a horrible accident while I was extremely drunk, I had been clean (or failry clean, being honest with myself I don't feel I was doing a 100% of a good job) for more than 500 days. I had also attended a few AA meetings, I stopped doing it because 'I thought I could handle it', turns out I can't. I thought I could only manage to drink in a social way and it would be fine, but it wasn't. To be honest I never really called myself an alcoholic, not even in the meetings. 

Saturday is perhaps, one of the most horrible falls I've ever had. I attended a wedding with the guy I currently have a relationship (this relationship is quite abusive and I have yet to break it up, but I just can't find the courage). 

I got so drunk, I called one of my best friends, I can't remember exactly what I said, but she said I said so many horrible things I that made her feel very sad and now she doesn't know what to do with all of this.  She was a very good friend, I am quite aware I will probably lose her after this. I have asked for forgiveness, but I think we all know that we can't really blame alcohol for our mistakes.

I came here because I think I need help, I don't want to keep on living like this, losing people I love, not being able to go out to events because I might get my hands on a beer...

I have reset my badge, because today I have a confession to make...

Dear reddit,
I'm an alcoholic and I need help. Where should I begin?

Thank you.",69,0

Today, I'm done","Last night I went out to a bar. I pre-gamed a bit in my car, so there were empties in the passenger seat. I wasn't planning on drinking too much, but of course I did. 

I thought I need to get my car home, I'm not that drunk, I'll be fine etc. So I got in my car and drove about four blocks before realizing I was being a moron and pulled over and parked. As I parked, another car came up behind me Then two dudes came out and started walking towards me. I realized they were cops. They must have seen me leave the bar parking lot and followed me to see if I looked like I was driving drunk. They asked me for my license and ran it, then came back and asked me if I had anything to drink. I said yes.Then they asked me what I was doing, and I said I was pulling over to call a cab. They went back to their car, talked for about 30 seconds, came back and said ""Ok, if you drive the car another meter, you're going to be arrested."" Then they just left. I was scared shitless but super relived. Also, kind of surprised they just left. How do they know I actually called a cab?

I've known I'm an alcoholic for a long time, but it got super real in that moment. I know drinking and driving is bad, yet somehow I found myself doing it any way. In addition to causing real danger to the public, I could have really fucked up my life. The car I'm driving is a rental paid for by my company, and my employer would find out, as I have to report any criminal charges to my professional association. This job is also kind of a last chance for me. I've been let go from other jobs due to poor performance and being late/missing work because of drinking.

I haven't had anything to drink today and don't plan to, I'm done. This is not who I am. I have real potential both with this job and all other aspects of my life when I stay sober.",23,0

Anyways I‚Äôm feeling pretty comfortable with my lifestyle changes and I thought I‚Äôd share a few things that helped me in the tough times since we all have different perspectives. For me my life wasn‚Äôt falling apart but my marriage was starting to. Being sober doesn‚Äôt magically fix it but it helps!  So my tips to make it to 90 days:

1. Resolve. I failed at moderation and started up again right where I left off each time after a month‚Äôs long break. Recognizing that I truly would be better off not drinking at all was a critical mindset change (and yes I still have ‚Äúfantasies‚Äù but if I take the time to think, I know the truth). 

2. Community. Whether it was here or other subs, online SMART meeting, or sober friends and family, talking to people about the struggle helps tremendously when the feelings of doom are present. For me this was mostly the first couple weeks although some friendships have also blossomed from that initial reaching out for help. 

3. Mindfulness. I had toyed with meditation for the last few years, but waking up sober every morning has allowed the space for a real practice and it is a tremendous help. Especially in bringing the idea that it is your reaction to ‚Äúthings‚Äù and not the things themselves that brings suffering ‚Äî bringing that idea into everyday life is huge. I can recommend _The Mind Illuminated_ and a CBT therapist that likes mindfulness to help here. 

4. Therapy. There‚Äôs a huge caveat here though. I had gone to therapy before, knew what I wanted and emailed every local insurance taking therapist I could find with a form letter about what I wanted and what didn‚Äôt help last time. I only got a handful of replies (maybe 10-15%) but it worked! I talk to my therapist about mindfulness, relationship issues and personal accountability. He knows I quit drinking but that‚Äôs rarely mentioned.  I think therapy can help with the underlying factors that lead to problem drinking.

5. ‚ÄúMooring lines.‚Äù  I got this from a SMART meeting. It‚Äôs a metaphor for a daily checklist of healthy activities that keep you attached to the dock in the sobriety harbor and not out at sea struggling. Mine have changed over time as I finish one sheet with 2-3 weeks worth of boxes and draw a new one but things like meditate, exercise, cook a healthy dinner, practice guitar, do a social activity, check the garden, etc. should give an idea.  You check these off throughout the day and notice if there‚Äôs a trend of forgetting one. Provides some behavioral context/continuity.  

6. Doctor. Being honest with my doctor and having him say in no uncertain terms that I was stressing my liver helps with the resolve and going to a follow up and seeing the blood pressure and liver enzymes in the optimal range is really reinforcing!  Talk to your doctor about privacy if that is a concern. What he writes in your chart about drinking shouldn‚Äôt need to go anywhere eise and some will talk ‚Äúoff the record‚Äù if you ask first. If you don‚Äôt trust your doctor and feel like he‚Äôs ‚Äúon your side‚Äù, then get a new one. 

7. Structure/hobbies. I don‚Äôt always practice every day but my guitar lessons and therapy happen every week. Cooking, gardening, meditation, reading, good movies/TV, audio books, etc. fill up the tine with positive vibes and feelings of accomplishment. Another SMART meeting tip that hit home was a video called ‚Äúhow to find your passion‚Äù that emphasized that modern life lets us get dopamine from consumption instead of creation. I didn‚Äôt need to google ‚Äúlist of hobbies Wikipedia‚Äù but it sure helped to recognize how I could shift the stimulation of my reward system towards creative activities and learning instead of grasping for the easy fix. 

That‚Äôs all for now!  Hang in there it gets better.

Here's what else happened:

1. I vomited beer foam and stomach acid

2. I had an unbearable hangover that:
     
-Had me sick as a dog all day
-Made it so I couldn't sleep a wink last night 
-Gave me horrible anxiety. 
-Caused me to miss a family gathering I was excited about attending

4. I had unprotected sex with a complete stranger

5. I had a booze fueled argument with one of the friends I was drinking with

6. I lost my wallet

7. My hair and skin look awful from dehydration

This experience reminded me of something valuable. Alcohol is damaging in and of itself, even beyond its potential for addiction. By the world's standards, an adult getting trashed on a Saturday is nothing out of the ordinary. No one would peg me as a problem drinker based solely on last night, yet I came up with 7 very significant consequences that I would have avoided completely had I simply chose not to drink. 

I'm going to remember Saturday night if I have thoughts about testing the waters again in the future. Even if the best case scenario plays out and I can drink without falling back into the abyss of addiction, the outcome waiting for me there cannot possibly be better than the one I get to create with a sober, healthy body and mind.

Have a great week sobernauts! IWNDWYT :)

This time, instead of just removing alcohol and then white knuckling it, I have quit everything -- cigarettes, social media, a bad long distance relationship, and probably most significantly, I'm tapering down off of an 8-year benzodiazepine dependence (currently at half what I was a month ago). I've been trying to replace those shitty habits/coping mechanisms with healthier things, like exercise and cooking.  

I've only seen two friends in the past month. I've mostly been keeping to myself. I feel sort of weird and isolated, more distant from people than I ever have. But I've mostly chosen to keep to myself. I worry about being alone forever. I worry that I won't ever find another partner. 

I feel a bit worried that I am only semi employed and am living off of savings. I don't really know what I want to do or where I want to be. The thought of getting back in the employment game seems like trying to jump on a moving train traveling at high speed. 

I'm slightly anxious thinking about this anniversary because it makes me think about the last time I decided to quit drinking, just over two years ago. I made it 53 days. I remember trying to do similar things: posting in here, trying to exercise a little by going on jogs, trying to eat healthy. It was so very easy to slip up once, and then let two years pass in a blur of alcohol. That said, this time feels different. I feel ready to let the old me go.",7,0

We are both remote from our families and while we have never had a perfect relationship, we take care of and love each other.

However the tension in our relationship has built since the pandemic hit and it has become more and more unhealthy with very unpleasant arguments and outbursts. They don't occur while I am drinking but my drinking definitely exacerbates the tension.

I am trying to take responsibility for my part of the mess and I am making an effort to change. I am successful in my career and (only by luck) my drinking hasn't yet affected my life terribly. But I know it's only a matter of time before it does so I am really trying to understand it and stop it.  I have visited a counsellor, been to AA meetings and started up sports again. I am trying to work out what strategy is going to be best for me to overcome my problem. 

Recently my girlfriend and I have been arguing because she is blaming our (and her) problems on my drinking, even when I am not drinking. But she is doing nothing to work on herself. She has a massive amount of trauma around her up bringing but she is unprepared to work through it. AA helped me a little so I suggested she try Al Anon or therapy and I have even floated couples counciling to try and move forward but she just doesn't want to take any steps. Instead, she has started smoking weed every day. It really feels like she is almost trying to create even more chaos.

I have been genuinely toying with the notion that we need to be apart. I am not sure if we have a future together. I can't keep being blamed for all of her problems, I just feel that's not fair. I have explained to her how I feel and she tells me she is depressed and that she is in a rutt.  When I suggest she do something different she shuts down. 

I am wondering if it would be more constructive to end the relationship so I can focus on my health. I am starting to think about having a family and I know that ours is no home for a child with all the fighting and instability. I don't want to waste my time so I would like to know if anyone has ever been in a situation like this and can it ever be made better???

Always thought the root cause was depression/isolation ect. I've recently realized that alcoholism is a separate thing of it's own. I cannot have one drink EVER again. I learned this because I managed to quit for 5 months (took about 15 attempts to quit) and one simple beer lead to a nasty 2 month relapse... It literally felt out of my control. That one beer lit a spark in me that drove me back into the depths of the addiction. That's when I learned that once you're an alcoholic you will always be one... I guess it's a DNA thing or something. 

Crazy how the brain works and how addiction influences our actions... I even get how this can make people homeless and kill. It takes SERIOUS self reflection to escape the grasp of addiction. I'd argue most people lack this ability. I commend any sober alcoholic for the work it takes. 

I hope to believe that recognizing this will keep me sober for the rest of my life...

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

""When you quit drinking you stop waiting."" This quote from Caroline Knapp's memoir entitled *Drinking: A Love Story* kept popping up when I searched for lists of inspirational quotes about sobriety. Although I thought it sounded interesting, the phrase never exactly struck me as inspiring in a conventional sense. Quotes that tend to encourage us are typically blunt and to the point, a pithy slogan that is easily digestible enough to become a mantra. Stop waiting for what, I thought? Nevertheless, I found the quote intriguing enough to buy the book to contextualize her words of wisdom. I'm glad I did!

According to Knapp, alcohol has a way of shielding us from life's pressing concerns, providing a momentary reprieve from actually having to confront the difficulties of being an adult. Excessive drinking serves as a source of comfort akin to a favorite childhood possession. While many of us are painfully aware that alcohol is a crutch, the analogy is crucial to understanding how our reliance on booze keeps us in a constant state of waiting, suspended somewhere (or nowhere) between childhood and adulthood. As she puts it, ""alcohol is what protected me from growing up."" Knapp used drink to numb and repress feelings she preferred not to have to manage, ""to medicate these very feelings."" Drink prevented her from having to live intentionally and with the kind of deliberateness that is expected of adults. For me, one of her keenest insights is that, when deep in the throes of alcoholism, we willingly adopt the role of victim. Things happen *to* us. Circumstances are supposedly always beyond our control. We lose faith in ourselves as agents with the ability to guide the trajectory of our lives, and instead ""get so used to being a passive participant in your own life, so used to being entrenched in the same gray rituals and patterns"" that the very idea of making choices or, god forbid, taking risks and exposing ourselves to the possibility of failure, overwhelms us. ""Passivity is corrosive to the soul,"" Knapp writes, ""it feeds on feelings of integrity and pride."" And once you lose self-confidence and -respect, you're stuck waiting for others to do things for you, to handle the very stuff of adulthood.

Given my focus on personal growth in yesterday's post, you can see why I found Knapp's reflections compelling. I emphatically nodded along to her ruminations on passivity, feeling at times that I was reading about the last decade or so of my own life. I had perfected the art of doing just enough to get by; in relationships, in school, in my field. I was never fully invested or engaged because I had a perception of myself as a mere spectator, a victim perpetually vulnerable to the whims of what I understood to be a cruel, cold world. In sum, I got by. But how much richer, how much more passionate would my life had been had I not succumb to the false belief fostered and amplified by alcohol that I was deficient and inferior, a remarkably malignant belief that kept me on the sidelines of life, waiting?

That's what I'm finding out as I move further away from those alcohol sodden days. Next to Knapp's quote above my desk is a page torn out of a magazine with a passage that reads in big block letters ""OK, BUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?"" When I was drinking I would've laughed. ""Me? *Do* something to address a problem??"" It's hard but I'm trying to take more risks these days. I'm working through some really dark, difficult emotions rather than burying them. I'm no longer hiding from life's inevitable problems but instead confronting them as rationally as I can. I'm no longer waiting.

So everyone, what did you stop waiting on?

Have a fantastic Monday!

 IT IS NEVER A COUPLE OF BEERS! Why would things be different next time? Its in my genes to have a weakness for booze. Dad will never be free, Granddad climbed out of the hole. Who knows how much further it goes back.

Once that first bottle is opened all sense goes out of the window, the off switch isn't reliable.

I've judged many other people in my family and been repelled by watching their slow self destruction when it's so obviously down to drinking so much. I judged people for their stupidity then went home and did the exact same thing. This is a progressive problem, it's just that they were further along. 

I can't do this anymore without carrying the shame around with me, I don't want to feel shame. There's no reason to carry on with drinking. Its obvious that it's only rewarding in the moment. I'm stuck, I'm fucking miserable and there's no doubt that I'm dragging myself down, I'm half dead already. There's no life my eyes. I'm a quitter in everything except boozing.

I have stopped many times before, but at one point I always start again. I tell myself I‚Äôll just have one drink every now and that I‚Äôll be able to drink moderately.

I had maybe one drink per year, on a special occasion. At the end of 2019, I tried medical cannabis under the supervision of my psychiatrist and a doctor specializing in medical cannabis. It lasted for three months but we ultimately decided it was too expensive and took away my ability to drive so we discontinued the trial.   
After (briefly) experiencing the benefits of mental peace, I turned to alcohol. I quickly went from one-two drinks to an entire bottle in a sitting, until I was downing an entire bottle of vodka 3-5 times a week. Incredibly enough I managed to avoid hangovers, but I did do significant damage to the relationships in my life. And, as it turns out, my body.

In August I attempted suicide and was hospitalized. I decided at that time I needed to get clean, and did reasonably well for several weeks. 10 days ago I had a major slip, and bought and consumed a whole bottle of vodka. When I woke up the next morning to realise that my ""just one drink"" had turned into a binge I decided I needed help. I found an AA meeting and attended, and was cautiously optimistic. Monday night I felt a little off, put it down to detoxing and took some panadol and went to bed. Tuesday afternoon my partner honestly thought I was having a stroke because I couldn't speak properly and my eyes wouldn't focus. He rushed me down to our local Emergency department, and cutting out all the drama, I was transferred to a major hospital and they spent 12 hours trying to get my blood sugar to stabilise. I spent three days on and off a glucose drip and eventually was discharged home with a strict new diet.

It turns out that for more than a year I haven't been eating properly, and when I started consuming so much alcohol my body took that as fuel and I was okay for a bit. Quitting achohol essentially starved my body of it's main source of fuel hence the hypoglycaemic episode. I will be physically fine as long as I pay more attention to making sure I get sufficient (decent!) fuel in each day. The doctor was pretty clear that while I will need a few months of eating well and resting well, I should be okay - no permanent damage thank goodness. The caveat here is that if I drink again, I run the risk of another severe hypoglycaemic episode which could prove fatal.

I tried AA, but after being told that ""God gave me the gift of misfortune so I could embrace the joys of sobriety"" I'm not completely certain that's the right way for me. I will continue to attend the meetings each Sunday night but I am looking for alternate ways. 

I have a social work agency that has referred me to a rehab program and  I start one-to-one counselling next week. 

Anybody who is further along in their journey who has suggestions, I'd be very grateful.  Thanks!",4,0

I must have had about 6 cups of tea but no urges. I didn't even get that high and mighty judgmental feeling I've felt previously when others have got (very) inebriated and I've abstained. I was very happy to whip out some special alcohol that has been in the cupboard and I was pretty happy that the bottle was emptied and finished by the guests.


Two moments in particular stuck with me, first when I was clearing empty bottles and i picked one up that was unexpectedly full- I got a bit of a jolt and quickly just put it down and left the room.
 Another was being asked to pour shots for the guests (it was not a wild party but rather the drinking culture here) I actually refused at first (it can feel like a power play when they ask the youngest person or a woman to pour) then I looked around at the guys drinking and thought fuck it, these guys are so drunk they are just going to make a mess anyway and poured them all one and left them to it. I have to socialise in a language that is not my first language and I'm not fluent in and I realise I can do these type of things sober (it is a bit tiring insisting you are not pregnant tho-:/)
I loved waking up fresh the next day, I got to do fun shit with my kids, I was patient and present and I didn't find it ridiculously hard to wake up with them!


Today is my grandmother's funeral, I can't be with my family as I could not fly home for the funeral due to rule changes regarding quarantine, even so, I will not drink today.

I drank a lot of tea/water and smoked a few cigars and stayed sober :)

Thankfully my friends didn't go over the top. Honestly they weren't very obnoxious even when they got to peak drunk, they just made fun of each other a lot for staying stupid drunk shit and were surprisingly funny and fun to be around even from my sober perspective.

Most of my friends are definitely heavy drinkers, but can still manage to do it responsibly because they save the heavy drinking for special occasions like concerts, and they don't get so hammered they lose awareness of themselves. They also throw some other substances into the mix- mainly weed, and occasionally some esctacy and/or lsd....I am by no means advocating for getting fucked up like this, but I must say whatever combinations they had going on did not turn them into self-centered assholes. We are/were essentially hippies just trying to spread good vibes and listen to some crunchy tunes xd

I had a lot of fun. They showed me lots of love for being the DD. Of course I felt tempted, but it never turned into a real craving.

What I learned is that I can be ok with feeling just ok. I don't need to feel euphoric to have a good time. The concert actually gave me tastes of that same ""superhigh"" I used to experience while on a combination of substances, but it didn't give me that anxious edge I used to experience at the same time. It was refreshing to be feeling pretty good the whole time rather than on the rollercoaster of highs and lows that would inevitably turn into mostly lows if I were to start drinking every day like I was. I am not like them- I may not get pants on head drunk everytime I drink, but I can't seem to stop drinking pretty much all day long during active addiction, having 2-3 beers every hour throughout the day to maintain a buzz after having a few swigs of liquor to get me going. Therefore, I don't get to experience those superhighs, and while I wish I could feel those again, I know I'm happier without it.

I was nervous as hell before going, but after over 4 months I ultimately felt like I was ready. When I showed up to the pregame they were all psyched to see me and told me how glad they were I was there all throughout the night, which took my nerves away and allowed me to relax and have fun just like old times, sans substances of course. This is not going to be a regular thing because that would be bad for me, but I'm psyched that I can still go have a good time with my old friends, and that they are real friends, not just drinking buddies.",66,0

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we check in about any AoK that we have participated in, received, witnessed, or heard about during the week which have touched us in some way. It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game.

My AoK this week was helping out a friend who is thinking about buying her first house. She's been really daunted by the whole process, and she's been discouraged about what she can afford. 

She texted me a link to a real estate listing this morning that she was excited about. It was on a busy road and next to some light use industrial facilities, so I could see right away both why it was cheap, and why it would always be difficult to sell down the road, and also probably not a pleasant place to live. But I wanted to be supportive of her efforts to explore the idea of buying a house, instead of being a kill-joy and shooting it down. And I could see that she just needed a little help with the whole thing. So I offered to spend the afternoon driving around with her, looking at the outside of some houses in a couple of different neighborhoods, so she could get a feel for what's out there in her price range.

Once she saw the first house in person she could see straight away what the problems were. But I could also see what she had liked about it, so we talked about the ups and downs of it, and I pointed out some things that she could check for herself from the sidewalk to get a sense of what shape the overall structure is in. 

After that we spent a couple of hours driving around, looking at houses, and talking about the whole process of looking at places and getting a mortgage. A lot of what I've learned has happened as a result of.... I don't know if they were outright mistakes, but I have definitely learned about things to look for by not seeing them or taking them into consideration *before* buying a property, and I've also learned quite a bit about how the various aspects of location can affect both the livability and the sellability of a property. So I shared some of those experiences with her.

By the end of the day she was more optimistic about it, and had a better idea of what she was looking for in a property. I know how stressful house hunting can be, and I'm pleased that I was able to put my own experience to use helping someone else. There were other things that I had planned on doing today, but this seemed more important, and I'm glad that I took the time to be there for my friend.

That's me for this week. How's everyone else doing, any AoK that you'd like to share?",24,0

I‚Äôve been struggling with alcohol and nicotine since my first drink at 16. I also recently found a new struggle with porn. So much so that I find it hard to get aroused around a female IRL now(I rarely get the chance) but that could also be related to low self esteem. 

Anyway, I am 28 now. I made it 4 months sober earlier this year(longest time since I started). From day one I was going to aa about 3 times a week but corona quickly shut that down. I also listen to recovery podcasts often.

Unfortunately I picked up again in June and have been drinking almost every night since then. I was lucky to quit cigarettes 4 years ago, but started smoking them again this time around. I remember how ashamed I was to buy another pack after 4 years. 

During those 4 months, life was starting to get so much better. I was working out every day(almost to the point of tormenting my body‚Äîanother addiction). I was in the best shape of my life. Lost all the beer weight and really started to see some positive changes. 

I moved into a new house and figured I could have a few to celebrate.  Even before that relapse occurred, I was always looking for a reason to drink. Hitting up old buddies, just looking for any excuse to start again. I feel so crazy because life was so much better than before. I would be at 8 months in a couple days had I not started again. 
I have gained most of the weight back and lost any mental progression from then.
I guess 4 months was not long enough for my brain to retrain itself. I WANT TO BE BETTER AND NOT DESTROY MYSELF. 

I am starting over today. I will not drink with any of you today, and I will wake up feeling like crap for a week or so. But after that it gets easier. I know I can do at least 4 months! I‚Äôm so glad I decided to post for some accountability. Now hold me accountable ü§ï",14,1

My fiance invited me to hang a deer stand with him in the woods today. I wasn't thrilled. I was looking forward to watching Mad Men, and to say I'm not outdoorsy would be a huge understatement. But I wanted to spend time with him, so I agreed. As we were getting ready to leave, I totally got triggered by an opened bottle of champagne in the fridge. I could had easily drank it without fiance knowing. It would make our little walk in the woods so much more enjoyable to be slightly buzzed. I was so close to chugging the bottle... when I decided not to. I knew it wouldn't make the walk more enjoyable. It would just make me a bumbling, numb idiot.

Flash forward an hour later, we're in the woods and I need to walk back to the car. I somehow missed a turn, and guys, I totally got lost in the woods. No phone, no map. Just 77 acres of endless trees. I started panicking. At one point, I was just yelling my fiance's name, but he was so far away he couldn't hear me. I nearly twisted my ankle, because I stepped on what I thought was solid ground, but it was actually a hole covered with leaves. The whole walk was treacherous and I almost fell more than once. It was horrible. Finally I took a few deep breaths, somehow reoriented myself, and started walking south. After 30 minutes, I finally found our car (yay!)

If I had been buzzed (or drunk) I honestly don't know what would have happened. There's no way I would have found the car. There's no way I would have stayed calm (which I barely did soberly.) There's no way I wouldn't have just sat down and cried. There's no way I could have soberly navigated the ground. I can't stop thinking about it. If I had drank that champs, I either would still be out there waiting for my fiance to hopefully eventually find me, or more realistically, I probably would have fell. I could have hit my head or twisted an ankle.. or God knows what else.

Friday I decided early in the day (not my usual craving time) that I would buy a nice bottle of wine and see what happens. Even walking the wine aisles, I was thinking: WTF are you doing? You don't even want this! 

I bought it. I drank it. It wasn't fun. I had a bit of a hangover and was fuzzy headed most of Saturday morning. A terrible feeling I hadn't had in over a week. Because I tested as pre-diabetic during my last doctor's visit, I've been doing a glucose test each morning to monitor my numbers, especially post-drinking. After a bottle of wine Friday night, Saturday morning I tested 144 (diabetes). This morning 91 (normal). It is amazing how much of a poison alcohol is and the amount of damage it does to our body.  If it did that to my glucose level, what about my liver, pancreas, etc.?

A little background: I'm 23. I quit drinking on August 2nd of this year and moved back in with my folks at the end of August. I was already planning on moving back in with them before quitting.  Right away after quitting I had a big conversation with four of my closest friends. I told them I have a drinking problem and I'm quitting alcohol. To the rest of the world, if asked, I just say ""I'm not drinking."" My parents - who I now live with - fall into the category of the rest of the world.

At first, this felt okay. My sobriety is in its infancy. I feel raw, fragile, and delicate 95% of the time. And I'm okay with that. It certainly doesn't feel great. However, I think it's the way I was supposed to be feeling for a long time but would cover it up with my drinking. Especially in the first moments of my sobriety, I felt really shakey with it. Telling people I quit drinking felt a bit like telling someone your pregnant when you're still in the first few weeks of pregnancy and there's a higher chance of a miscarriage. I didn't want to go back on my word.

Now, however, it's beginning to feel weird for me not having had this conversation with them. I feel like I'm lying to them and it doesn't feel okay (which is kinda crazy because when drinking all I did was lie to them). I think I want to tell them. I'm scared though. Because my folks have seen me when my drinking was at its worst and I just told them life was okay. I've never had the courage to tell them when I am not doing okay. I also am afraid that this conversation may change the way they feel or see me. That they will see that I don't have my shit together. That I am very far from that. They will see the truth. 

I'm just getting tired of saying that I'm not drinking as if it's this casual decision I've made. Like I'm taking a break. I don't want to take a break. I want to not drink today/ And I hope to feel that way tomorrow. This is huge for me. It feels life-changing and utterly strange to keep that from the people I'm close with. Last weekend, I told my step-mom about it in a little more detail. It got a little awkward - maybe because I was bringing it up too casually.

 My parents like to drink a fair amount on the weekends and when they have guests over. When I was drinking, I used to love visiting them because I had these automatic drinking buddies. Especially my stepmom. I think it was the glue for us in many ways.  I try not to look too much into their drinking but I do understand that when someone around you quits there can be an automatic defense mechanism. I don't know. I'm just feeling a bit lost. 

How do I have this conversation with them? How do I explain that this is the thing that I need to focus on? Does anyone have any tips? I'm open to suggestions.

Also, it's Thanksgiving here in Canada. It's my first holiday sober in 6 years. I'm one night down. One more to go. Wish me luck.

All things I would‚Äôve been able to do in Rehab. We are not going to talk about my chores. The dishwasher is all I have been able to maintain.

But I have gotten to step of the crazy roller coaster of life. Well at least one foot anyway. My son has stayed at his dad‚Äôs for health reasons and he is symptom free and past his 14 days. But I have not had to worry about anyone else in the last 16 days. Well, maybe a little bit. But I am the only person I have had to keep alive.

There‚Äôs a reason I buy Froot Loops. Yes, I am that mom.

I am brought back to a post I had a few weeks ago where I was crumbling and this was 1 day before my Positive test and three days before I found out. Kinda like PMS when you‚Äôre bawling and then two day later, huh, imagine that? Sure enough, there is my period. So, maybe this was the answer the intention I put out in the Universe that night that I needed to step off the crazy wheel. Overall, it has been pretty mild, but lingering. It will not go away. I am back to day one with congestion this morning and sleep is back to being an issue. I still get tired easily when I do too much. I just unloaded and loaded the dishwasher and I am wiped.

I am finding my voice. I am still yelling to be heard, but baby steps. At least I am saying, ‚ÄúListen.‚Äù I am near tears as I am sitting here. This has been incredibly alone. I am so thankful meetings are on zoom. I don‚Äôt think I could have survived this isolation without my communities I have built in SheRecover, Sober Mom Squad, and The Luckiest Club. If you haven‚Äôt already noticed, I am not the biggest fan of AA, but I love my chips. I just ordered a years worth of chips and sent them to my daughter so she can give me my chips.

I need to limit myself to 2 and then move on to another self comforting skill.

Self Soothing. My counselor tells me to eat all the cookies after the hell I have been through. It is so weird to have another person here my story and feel bad for me and wonder how I survived, I am not sure what to do with his reaction. I have never really had anyone respond that way. I think about all the ways I have overcome my child hood and how I am not the mom I had. I have come so far, but when I sit there listening to his reactions to my story and reality, I am 7 years old and I just want someone to hold me and tell me my sister isn‚Äôt supposed to be hitting me as soon as mom and dad leave.

I'm not disappointed or something. With so much happening around the world these days, I kinda needed a break. I noticed that despite taking just 2 drinks at around 9pm, I was unable to sleep until 3-4 am. This is something I had noticed earlier, but it became a lot more clear after I read about it and observed it again with a clear mindset after abstaining for so long. Alcohol causes a small rise in **noradrenaline**‚Äîknown as the fight-or-flight hormone. Noradrenaline suppresses stress when you first take it, and increases it in withdrawal. Severe anxiety can be considered a surge of noradrenaline in the brain. That is why, after a session of boozing, you will find yourself waking up multiple times in the middle of the night and unable to sleep despite feeling drowsy.

To expand on this, the first two drinks lull you into a blissful Gaba-induced state of chill. When you get to the third or fourth drink, another brain-slackening effect kicks in: you start blocking glutamate, the main excitatory transmitter in the brain. More glutamate means more anxiety, When people get very drunk, they‚Äôre even less anxious than when they‚Äôre a bit drunk‚Äî not only does alcohol reduce the chatter in your brain by stimulating Gaba, but it further reduces your anxiety by blocking glutamate. In your blissed-out state, you will probably feel that this is all good, but its not. The body registers this new imbalance in brain chemicals and attempts to put things right. When you are drunk, your body goes on a mission to bring Gaba levels down to normal and turn glutamate back up. When you stop drinking, therefore, you end up with unnaturally low Gaba function and a spike in glutamate‚Äî a situation that leads to anxiety. It can take the brain a day or two to return to the status quo, which is why a hair of the dog is so enticing. If you drank an awful lot for a long time, it might take weeks for the brain to readapt. In alcoholics, changes in Gaba were found for years. Drunks go into a deeper sleep than normal. And finally, the norepinephrine kicks in‚Äî which is why they sometimes wet the bed or have night terrors. Then, after about four hours, the withdrawal kicks in‚Äî that‚Äôs when you wake up all shaky and jittery.

Hangovers from Hell 

Rushing through tasks so that I can drink after they‚Äôre done 

Midnight bathroom trips to pee

Waking up multiple times a night to drink water 

Making arrangements for how to get home 

Forgetting last night‚Äôs conversation 

Committing to things I don‚Äôt really want to do 

Smelling like booze in the morning/stinky sweat 

Dry skin 

Mystery bruises 

Heartburn 

Bleeding my wallet daily at the liquor store 

Picking fights with my partner 

Playing snack food CSI when I try to piece together what I ate while hammered the night before 

Discovering very unflattering selfies on my phone 

Wondering if I can sneak one more drink in without anyone noticing 

Panic when there‚Äôs no more booze 


Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking forward to: 

More meaningful conversation and connection with others 

Being a more present parent 

Weight loss 

Enjoying physical activity rather than struggling 
through it 

Getting back to hobbies that I have neglected

I think the thing that worked for me was setting smaller goals (i.e. I will not drink for the rest of today, rather than the rest of my life)","A year ago I would never have imagined I could have done this. I had tried to stop drinking several times before and something would always snap and pull me back in. 

I have to say, this community on Reddit has possibly saved my life. Over the past year I've had constant temptations and near-misses, opportunities to meet up with friends and get pished, bad circumstances, stress, family problems... There have been so many nights where all I wanted to do was walk to Lidl and buy a 2 litre bottle of vodka and get wasted on my own.

But coming on here and reading your encouraging messages and stories of your own struggles with drinking helped me realise I wasn't alone. Thank you so much for all your help.

The first few months without alcohol were miserable (you can see in my post history how much I liked to complain.) I felt like, what's the point? I am going to destroy myself anyway, life is too painful, I might as well have a drink to try to numb the rest of the day and make it through to next week.

But something kept me going. On this subreddit, everyone was talking about 'I will not drink with you today', and I thought as ridiculous as that seemed to me, I would give it a go. 

 Instead of committing to never drink *ever again,* like I had in the past, I kept my promises to myself small. Today, I won't drink. Today, I won't drink. Over and over and over. And it added up, before I knew it I was on my way. I stayed away from the pub and stopped having alcohol in sight. I asked my flatmate to hide his vodka from me. I stripped away all the reminders of alcohol from my life much as I could. And I was miserable and grumpy for a long time, which my friends kindly put up with.

This has been a really hard year for me in lots of ways, but being sober has made it so much more manageable. I'm still depressed and troubled (oh so many troubles!) but I'm getting on top of my finances, I'm waking up without feeling ashamed and disgusted and covered in vomit. I'm seeing someone in the mirror who looks less sad and a wee bit healthier. I can feel my self-respect growing!

Somehow I was able to forgive myself enough to give stopping drinking another go. And to take it day by day this time. I'm so glad I did. 

Thanks to everyone in this subreddit for your encouragement and advice, you have no idea how much you've helped me. If you're struggling too, please try to be kind to yourself (I might have rolled my eyes reading that sentence a year ago, but I mean it) and try to keep your goals small and let time do the rest.

I feel like a shell. I hardly know what interests, excites or brings me joy anymore and fuck, man. So much waste. 

I bought myself a camera and signed up for a photography course online, I'm trying to cook and read more again but it's so hard when you feel so empty. And there is still work, and the burdens of everyday life which can feel so heavy when you're so depressed.... Sometimes so depressed I just don't move out of bed. 

I'm sorry to plant this rant on everyone. I guess I just wanted to know if anyone can relate, and If anyone has tips on how they reclaimed their spark or what ever their spirit after all of this. Right now it feels hard not to let self loathing drag me back but I don't want to repeat this cycle anymore. I am drained.

I don't visit this subreddit much anymore simply because I don't need to. I very rarely have cravings for alcohol anymore, in fact it's hard for me to remember what it feels like to be drunk. I mean, I can describe the feeling but I can't remember how it feels. Not sure if that makes sense. It's strange because when I first quit drinking, all I could remember was how good it felt. Now I mostly only remember how much havoc it wreaked on my life (and it was hard to see the extent of that havoc when I was actively in it). I feel so incredibly grateful to have escaped that hell. 

When I was attending AA for the first few months after getting sober, I said that I felt like I was giving up so much by quitting alcohol and not sure if I was getting much in return. A man told me that it's impossible to see how much better life is without it until you've given it a while to work its magic. He said it truly is the gift that keeps on giving. I was frustrated by that answer at the time, but looking back I see how right he was. It's difficult to describe unless you've done it. 

There are two strategies that helped me most in getting sober. The first is this community, which I relied upon heavily...I mean it, you can go back and see how often I was posting. I was either writing or reading posts every single day for months. There were times I was afraid if I stood up I would suddenly make a mad dash for the liquor store, so I just sat there and scrolled through this subreddit for hours until my cravings subsided. I tried AA and it helped me when I was first getting started, but I found that my social anxiety made it difficult for me to speak up in meetings, so I didn't get too much out of it. This community was the alternative that I needed. 

The second thing that helped was a willingness to wait and see what happened, despite having very little faith that I could ever get sober. I thought, ""Look, who am I kidding? I'm never going to be able to be sober FOREVER, it's just impossible for me. But...I know that the way I'm living now feels pretty shitty so I'm going to stay sober for a year to see how that goes. If it sucks more than drinking, then I'll go back to drinking. But I need to know for sure."" So here I am now, alcohol fading into a distant nightmare, and ""forever"" seems so much less daunting. I would be blessed to have the rest of my life free from alcohol. 

Keep fighting the good fight! There is more to life than being a slave to your demons. IWNDWYT.",37,0

I was stumbling around Epcot hammered, not really remembering anything at all.  We came here this past week to celebrate my daughter's birthday, and it was great seeing Disney through sober eyes.  Sober living is best living, and I don't miss the drink (or the headaches) at all.  I will say though, you have to be careful at Disney!  Almost ordered a drink at Galaxy's Edge that had booze in it!  I was a little let down, not because I wanted alcohol, but because the drink sounded yum!  Oh well. Had Blue Milk instead!  

I could write paragraphs on how much better Sober living is, but I will not.  Instead....I will keep it simple.  To anyone struggling or just getting started with their sober journey, I can tell you that sobriety is the best thing you can do for yourself.  I am far happier than I was when I was trying to find hope in a bottle,  far richer ( in both money and relationships) than I was searching  for a place among the ""elite"", and far wiser now that I spend more time reading instead of drinking.

A day in the life of active addiction vs a day in the life of sobriety, plus some rambling...","A day in my life of active addiction: Wake up, go back to sleep two or three times (not that I‚Äôve completely stopped doing that...), wake up around 6 pm, usually extremely hungover, try and fix my hangover with greasy food, bong rips or more sleep. If was working, rush to get ready, pack and smoke a bowl or three before working, binge eat and watch TV before my shift. If I was out of pot or wine, obviously I had to go get some more, so I‚Äôd be late for work. Work, waiting for it to be over the entire time so I can go smoke and drink myself into a coma. Wake up, repeat, with odd trips to the grocery store where I had to get stoned before, feeling so anxious and stupid, reeking of weed, eyes glazed over, fucking everything up, constantly losing my keys, phone, purse. Very rarely hanging out with people but when I did, shitty people I didn‚Äôt even like who didnt have good intentions with me, but I kept them around because they could get me drugs, dab carts, etc. What else are friends for? Occasionally going out with my real friend, and making a jackass of myself every time, begging her to buy me wine as she‚Äôs 21 and I‚Äôm not, showing up drunk and high, trying to drag her into my addiction. Being late for everything because I have to get drunk and high. Oh that concert I really wanted to go to? Miss half of it because I had to smoke before, or was snorting shit in the bathroom. Remember none of it because I got wasted. Maybe leaving my house once or twice a week. Hobbies include crying over my life‚Äôs trauma, giving myself 24 hour hangovers, mindlessly scrolling through social media for 10 hours a day while binge watching Netflix shows I‚Äôve already seen 10 times. Never brushing my teeth properly let alone flossing, exercising (unless ‚Äúhiking‚Äù aka going into the woods to smoke pot counts as exercise!). 
 

A day in the life of recovery: Wake up, try not to fall back asleep again... Dunno if I‚Äôll ever kick that habit! Make a cup of hot lemon water with turmeric and cayenne pepper, light some incense, feed the cats, do a 10-20 minute mediation. Stretch and do yoga for around 30 minutes, listen to positive affirmations. Make a smoothie (I‚Äôve recently gotten into green juice, who am I!?) and have a bagel with hummus. Usually I shower, go run errands, I like to go to thrift stores, museums, the library, find new parks, hike, bike, take walks with my mom, take my parents dogs to the park, hang out with my family. Pre covid, I was traveling for really the first time. I went to multiple concerts every week, music is my life and going to shows brought me so much joy, as did traveling, so not being able to do either has really been a challenging adjustment. But I‚Äôm really trying to continue creating a life I don‚Äôt need to escape from, even in the age of covid and everything else going on in the world. After I‚Äôm done with my errands and sober adventures, I get ready for work, I‚Äôm lucky enough to work from home these days. Time goes by faster at work when you‚Äôre not stoned btw. After work, I eat dinner and watch a movie (still trying to kick the binge eating and binge watching, but I do watch new stuff! Discovered I‚Äôm a big Star Wars and Marvel fan, and also have watched a lot of the classics! Still have some catching up to do). I try and read, meditate, and journal before bed, drink some tea,listen to an audiobook, and play with my cats, but I‚Äôm not perfect. Sometimes I play anagrams on my phone or scroll on reddit till the sun comes up. Sometimes I binge watch a show till the sun comes up. And sleep entirely too late the next day. But I ALWAYS brush and floss! At least twice a day. 


I‚Äôll be 18 months sober on the 17th. When I was using, I was very hedonistic and had this idea in my head that being drunk and high makes everything better. It makes the boring grocery store better, it makes movies better, it makes life more vibrant and cool. Maybe thats true the first few times you drink and smoke as a teenager, you see the world from a different perspective. But after the 10,000th time.... You‚Äôre just numbing yourself and softening and blurring the world. It doesn‚Äôt improve anything, it takes away the details and intensity. And maybe it numbs the pain and suffering by default, but it‚Äôs not fucking worth it. Abusing drugs and alcohol to treat your deep seated trauma and fucked up life is like slapping bandaid after bandaid and some lidocaine on a deep festering oozing wound. Yeah you don‚Äôt have to directly look at it anymore, but you‚Äôre not treating it, you‚Äôre just numbing it and hiding it. Sobriety can be really fucking hard, especially at the beginning. But it‚Äôs no where near as hard as continuing to live as an addict and being a shell of yourself and living a half life that revolves around substances that make you act obnoxious or brain dead or both.  


My life has improved 100000x over since becoming sober. My life was drinking a bottle or two of wine and smoking 10+ bowls everyday. Now my life is just life. 


I went to see my sister and baby nephew recently, and listened to my brother in law talk about his various home improvement projects and the work he‚Äôs done on the house. 2 years ago, I would have showed up high to my baby nephew‚Äôs 1st birthday and thought the entire time ‚ÄúThis is so boring, I wish I could go smoke. This is lame, I want a drink, why is he so excited over power washing a deck when he could be smoking/drinking? I want to get high‚Äù Now, I thought it was so sweet, and thought about what a good dad he was, especially when he said that he wanted to make the bar a concession area and the basement a movie theater because he doesn‚Äôt want an entire part of the house to be alcohol centered for his son and his friends. 


Sure, power washing a deck might be boring to me, but holy fuck it‚Äôs definitely more exciting and productive than drinking poison and killing my brain cells 24/7. This is a giant rambling mess but I really just wanted to share it with someone.  Life is so so so much better on the other side. You deserve recovery and sobriety and to be happy and healthy. To everyone in early sobriety, you‚Äôre fucking amazing for having the courage to try sobriety during this clusterfuck of a year and to continue to stick with it.

I dunno I guess I'm just bored at work and feel like rambling.  Honestly this will probably end up a wall of text.  But I hope maybe someone can relate to something in there and help them in some way:

Drank and smoked weed with my friends in high school.  Still have great memories.  Partied pretty hard in college.  Got good grades, honestly was the best times of my life.  The start of me as an alcoholic was definitely in college, I drank most nights.  I graduated and got a decent job.  I drank a little bit every night, maybe like a 6 pack and smoked some weed.  I quit weed because I wanted to find a new job, but I ended up just drinking more to compensate.  I was up to 12 a night.  I was unhappy and quit that job, and kind of just lived off my savings for a year.  

My dad had a heart attack where I tried to resuscitate him, he died.  After that I was having panic attacks daily and started drinking more and more to ""stop them"".  I was basically withdrawaling every morning and soon drank from the time I woke up until I got loaded passed out mid day, then woke up and did it again at night.  I was jobless, obese, didn't shower most days, I honestly never thought I was depressed though.  

One day I was outside helping my mom and she said I looked yellow and begged me to go to the ER.  I honestly couldn't see it in the yellowish lights of my house, but once I got to the hospital with their whiter lights it was crazy.  I was lethally low on blood sodium, my forearms looked like a baseball bat was taken to them from them unable to get a needle in me for fluids.  I was put in the ICU.  They put me on Benzos as I told them my alcohol use.  Once I was stable for the dehydration they started testing my liver.  I was 30 years old and they said the Ultrasound saw advanced scarring/cirrhosis.  

The social worker told me due to the health issues if I were to go directly from the hospital to rehab insurance would cover most.  However if I didn't agree to go right then and there it was possible insurance wouldn't cover nearly as much.  I begrudgingly agreed to go.  First day was pretty fun I liked most of the people there.  I was meeting everyone and went to dinner with them.  Afterwards I was sitting there doing a crossword puzzle waiting to see this guest speaking thing we had.  Next thing I know I wake up with EMTs all over me telling me not to move.  They were asking if I knew where I was and I did, they told me to calm down that I had a seizure.  So I went to another hospital and they tested my brain and stuff I guess to see if damage.   

All was fine.  I returned to rehab and finished my 30 days.  I loved it, it reminded me of college without the getting fucked up part.  Definitely built great bonds with many people there.   I got REALLY into the whole sobriety thing there, and I did 90 AA meetings in 90 days after I was down.  I eventually got burnt out and stopped going to AA meetings, but I still posted on here a bunch, usually browsing new posts and replying if it involved panic attacks or liver problems.  I saw a gastro specialist to get blood work and evaluations done once a month due to the scarring.  At 6 months sober I was sent to get a CT scan for liver cancer since cirrhosis patients are more prone to it.  Well the CT scan saw no cancer, but it also saw no scarring.  So I got a bunch of other tests done to double check and I was showing ""no damage done to my liver from drinking, it was just mildly fatty more due to being a bit overweight.""  The gastro doctor said he had to discharge me as a patient since I now was good.

After then I sort of was smooth sailing for a while.  I started applying to jobs.  Got a temp job in a warehouse then started applying to entry level jobs for either IT or addiction related stuff.  I ended up getting a pretty crazy IT job.   I never worked a white collar job before, always just warehouse type jobs.  Lost 70 pounds in the past year and look the best I ever did. I love most of the people I work with.  I have a weird situation where my bosses are on the opposite side of the country and I'm the sole IT person for a building of about 500 works in a manufacturing environment.  They really did not too much to on board me and were insanely slow to reply when I desperately asked for help.  I grew frustrated.  I was talking to an old high school and college friend.  We talked about the days of smoking weed and when I went home I found my pipes and scraped out as much rez as I could.  I hadn't smoked in about 5 years, and honestly I felt instantly relaxed.  I ended up buying weed and smoking since.  Honestly for my first 2 years sober I would have considered myself smoking weed relapsing, and I sort of beat myself up for it for a little, but I dunno I figure I'm not physically addicted and that's my biggest danger.  

I still really struggle when I get emotional.  That's probably the only part of sober life I still cannot fully grasp.  I had a pretty low stress sober life for the most part, but some days when I'm super frustrated I just don't know how to process emotions I was so used to just erasing them with booze.

Nobody knew, not even my wife. My marriage was failing, my body hated me and am expecting a child in April. Yesterday I decided to do something about it. I told my wife. Everything. How I was an alcoholic. How I drank every evening starting at 6 shots a night now closer to 9 or 10. How I never really ""forgot"" things in my car. Where my hiding spots were and how taking out the trash revolved around my next drink. She cried, she really had no idea. A couple times over the last couple years I over did it and she had suspicion. I think what scared her the most was how well I hid it and lied my way through being an alcoholic. Thankfully she was understanding and supportive, which is what I need to be for her and our baby moving forward. I didn't drink yesterday. And I don't plan on doing it today.

I hit 60 days today! Been having slight cravings the last two days that last no more than a minute or two. I am able to redirect my thinking much better than I could during the first month of sobriety.

I previously did a 30 day stint and rewarded myself with a weekend of binging during camping. That binge turned into drinking 3 more times that week along with two blackouts and that was my wall. I had to be picked up by my partner at a bar and I promised myself I wouldn't put either of us in that situation again.

Since then I have used this forum as a reminder of what drinking can do an how fast. I also have a great support system with my partner, who is aware of my issues and is the driving factor to my sobriety. The last resource I use (not as much now, but it got me over the hump when I couldn't even do a week) was the alcohol mastery channel on youtube. If you are struggling, check it out.

My life is 100x better than it was when I was drinking and I keep reminding myself of that anytime I think I want one. I've taken up old hobbies, namely guitar and I've gotten so much better with all the free time I have to play it. Ive bagan keeping a journal (highly reccomend) to write my feelings on both good and bad days and I've made steady progress to the point where I've been able to go to a bar with my partner and her friends and not even have a slight craving.

There are more challenges to come, but I have defense mechanisms that I've developed to be able to deal with them. I don't believe this process gets easier but when you really want sobriety and practice it you get better at it. If you have made it this far thanks for reading. IWNDWYT!",4,0

On Friday night my husband and I had our ""date night"", where our daughter goes to her Grandma's house. My husband bought a bottle of tequila to celebrate some personal achievements. We ate and drank and had a nice time. The next morning, I saw there was still some tequila, and decided to have a couple of shots. What the hell, I thought. I could delay picking up my daughter a bit. My husband noticed I seemed a little drunk, got pissed at me (understandably so as I needed to get our daughter at some point) and fight ensued. Instead of admitting my mistakes, I continued the argument and escalated things. In the late afternoon, after being home with my kid the fighting continued. My daughter was sleeping at the time and did not witness any of it. I felt and continue to feel terrible about it. About 9pm, I went to the bathroom (sorry, TMI coming up) and had a hemorrhoid or something burst. I panicked, because it was definitely more blood than I have experienced in the past. I sat next to my daughter (who was snoring comfortably), and had the worst panic attack of my life. I was sure that I was dying, nauseated from being hungover and scared, and it hit me that I don't want to drink anymore.  

I've gone through phases of ""scaling back"" and even being sober during pregnancy, but I always get drawn back into drinking. In my late teens and 20's, it was what turned me from socially anxious to ""fun"". I always got invited to drinking events, like bachelorette parties, because I was so ""fun"". Back then, I would drink on weekends and keep my shit together during the week. Made a lot of mistakes but never got any DUI's or anything so I thought I was doing great. 

In my early thirties, I was married to my ex husband who almost never drank. He and I were not very compatible in a lot of ways, so to counter this, I would go out with my friends and get trashed. We ended up getting divorced because he was having an affair with one of his students (he was a law professor at the time). We lived in the same house for several months while I figured things out (very not fun) and I would go out almost nightly and drink to excess. I was such a mess that even my drinking friends mentioned it. After awhile, I got my own place and ended up meeting my now-husband. We are very compatible, and I include drinking in that. We literally drank every single time we were together. This went on for almost 2 years, until I found out I was pregnant. The pregnancy morning sickness was no joke, so I didn't even really think about drinking. I did pretty well, considering my hard partying ways. After my daughter was born, the drinking started again. Not much early on, having a newborn is terrifying so I reeled it in. Eventually, though, drinking became almost nightly. I have been drunk around my kid a number of times. Shes only 2, so I am hoping that if I stop now, she won't remember any of it. 

My mom doesn't drink at all, and at first I didn't understand why. How could she go through life without having a glass of wine to relax, getting a fancy cocktail, something of that sort. Now, I realize why. Her family is full of addiction. My grandma was a hard partying woman, drinking, smoking, lots of cocaine in her adulthood. My aunt, who committed suicide in 2003 was a drug addict. My other aunt, who died in 2017, was addicted to pain meds. I just found out that my older cousins (in their late 40s and 50s) do tons of cocaine in addition to drinking and weed. Unfortunately, I am wired this way too. I never admitted it to myself, especially because most of the embarrassing shit I have done has been within the confines of my home. How could I have an addiction? Surely not \*ME\*. But I am absolutely an addict. 

Now that I write this out, I realize that I am very worried. My daughter is going to grow up with the same problems that I have. I don't want that for her, but am unsure if I can stop it. She will have to realize for herself that drinking or drugs don't help anything. I hope that I can do better for her, and for myself. This pandemic has not helped things. I am working from home right now and it sucks. It feels like everything is awful and I have a hard time coping. I need to find a way to do better. I was thinking of AA, but the higher power stuff and listening to people's problems sounds like a nightmare. I don't know what my next step is, but today, I will not have a drink.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

&#x200B;

Hi Everyone. It's great to have the opportunity to host this week's check-in and contribute to this lovely community. It's nice to be here.

I'd like to start the week off by citing a passage from T. S. Eliot's poem *Little Gidding* that I've found inspirational as I experiment with this thing called sobriety. I love a good quote (my study is covered with them at the moment) but I must say this one is the most poignant for me, as it captures precisely how I'm experiencing this journey. Eliot wrote that

""We shall not cease from exploration

And the end of all our exploring

Will be to arrive where we started

And know the place for the first time""

What I find so moving about this bit is the boundless sense of possibility it conveys when relating the desire for seeking the meaning, significance, and purpose of our existence. Our insatiable yearning for exploration fosters personal growth by expanding our horizons of knowledge and yielding new ways to interpret the experiences comprising our identity. The frame through which we understand ourselves is always shifting, consequently investing the various encounters, exchanges, and interactions that constitute our sense of self with new meaning. We are always in process.

At least this is the way it should be. Always growing, evolving, changing, and so on. But this kind of personal development, it seems to me, requires a distinct kind of curiosity and even wonder about the world and one's place in it. For a little over a decade I stopped growing as a person because I lost these qualities to drink. I became fixated on alcohol to such an extent that I was left incapable of the type of serious introspection needed to evolve. I ceased exploring, in other words. I became stagnant and stale, stuck in a bewildering state of inertia where nothing about my life changed except for the label on my beer and wine bottles.

But with sobriety I have regained that curiosity and wonder. I began exploring again, moving far beyond the narrow confines of my booze-soaked days. I emerged from what I now refer to as my Great Regression with inquiring new eyes, a shiny new frame for taking in and making sense of this wondrous world. Throughout my sober journey I've rekindled old relationships that have greatly enriched my life by reestablishing a link to a past that I forgot existed. It's almost as if I'm learning about that person I used to be before the Great Regression for the first time, and enjoying what I'm finding. I'm finally, finally actually getting to know my son by exploring the world right alongside him, experiencing all its splendor that I once took for granted through the awestruck eyes of a four year old. In short, I'm growing! I'm actually evolving rather than languishing by establishing meaningful bonds with others, with the natural world around me, and even myself. I'm coming to know myself as if for the first time as I travel down the road of sobriety.

I dipped in and out of sobriety all summer with many relapses and binges turned to benders. But now, I am 53 days sober and doing better. 

Today, we had friends over and I was the only one not to drink. I had my iced coffees, my sprite, and some really good food. Before, I would have been embarrassed to turn down alcohol, but when friends asked if I was still not drinking, I said yes and they just said cool and moved on with their day. 

It was also interesting watching people drink and not wanting to partake. What felt so enjoyable when i was doing it no longer looked so great. People got loud and ridiculous, then got tired and quiet when the alcohol ran out. I felt great the whole day.

Today, it is getting easier to not drink and easier to not be tempted by the smell or the presence of alcohol. I am making steady progress and I'm proud of that. 53 days ago I would not have believed me if I read this post, but here I am.",33,1

I have been trying to get straight for years, and more so especially this year. This year has been horrid and I‚Äôve failed time after time. 
As of today I was 5 days sober - an amazing record for myself. I woke up feeling fantastic, I was extremely fuelled and productive all day. But being home with three kids and trying to be productive can be taxing. 

One of the jobs I tackled today was clearing out my martini shelf. God I love martinis. Today I wrapped up my martini glasses and shakers, made space in my cupboards and filled the new space with other stuff that was in need of a home. 
My house is clean, things are organized, I did what I set out to accomplish.. but something about clearing that shelf broke me. Somehow the finiteness of not ever having a martini again took over, and the ‚Äúone day at a time‚Äù mentality dissipated into nothing. 

It hurt, it broke my spirit, and at the end of the day I gave in and had a drink. 
I justified it with- 
It was a big day
You accomplished a ton
It‚Äôs just one

1997,2020-10-10 20:29:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/j8vmjz/why_i_quit/,Why i quit.,"This will probably out me but whatever, i think people need to know then story is a little credible.

I quit drinking for a multitude of reasons. I keep these reasons in the back of my mind. Each of them helps me whenever i am slipping, together they form a very strong defense against the temptation to drink. And I think you can easily find a your own reasons to from your own defence. I also know it helps when i share this with others struggling as it helps them identify their own reasons so here goes.

Health - my grandfather died of liver cirrhosis from heavy drinking. My family has a history of high blood pressure and diabetes. Those are enough to tell me i am generically predisposed to kill myself drinking if i ever start.

Nearly killed myself  - longer story. I began drinking heavily in the armed forces. But i had picked up the taste for it younger when i would steal sips from my parent's glasses to ""try"". They thought it was ""adorable"" its not. So when in uniform the beer flows freely (tax free)  and then i progressed to developing a liking for whiskey. Then came the big event. TL Dr, i was mess officer for a big exercise, each officer had 1.5 bottles of hard liquor assigned to them (rum/whiskey) and basically everyone had to finish it before the night was over. Got flat out drunk, and screwed up my duties that night, the Division Chief was not pleased. I passed out that night and awoke in my bunk. Cldnt remember what happened. What finally did it for me was when i realised that i had been taken back in a jeep full of other drunk soldiers driven by another drunk officer. Worst still this was in a desert training area with no lit or paved roads. Very cld have died that night. Didnt. Quit drinking the next day.

College - drinking in college was expected. But i realised that drinking in college wld have resulted in me being in the same situation as i did the army. My sobriety was helped by a group of friends who didnt mind me drinking water /tea/juice/coke with them. They never pressured me to drink. They chided anyone who joined who made fun of me. True friends don't pressure u to drink.

Religion - even on a wholesome subreddit like this, religion is a bit touchy but hey its my story.

I'm a Christian. And i must say this is the strongest reason. The bible doesnt forbid drinking. In fact Paul encourages Timothy to drink a bit to help with his dysentry. The bible forbids drunkeness. Enough bad stuff happens because of drunkeness which indicates that it is a sin (something that displeases God). But as most of us here know, the point at which u become drunk is impossible to pin point. One day a couple of pints is enough, another day u can binge a whole bunch and still be a ""functioning"" adult. What does it mean to be drunk? I figured that since it was impossible to determine, at least not for myself, and given my penchant to drink, i should just stay away from it all.

Another thing is that manu Christians use the bible to justify drinking. The marriage at Cana is a prime example, ""but jesus made wine! Good wine at that! Lots of it!"". My counterpoint is that, regardless of whether it was wine (or juice of the vine, aka grape juice) does any Christian really think Jesus would have produced wine just so that people at the wedding who were likely drunk or get more drunk? 

Of course this is all very academic. I teach kids in Church. I want to be able to stand behind everything i say without the shadow of alcohol adding to the list of my hypocrisies. I don't condemn anyone who drinks, but if anyone struggles in more than bapoy to support their decision with biblical text.

Okay that's all from me.

For I can do everything through Christ, who gives me strength. Philippians 4:13.

When I do think about it, my thoughts are either negative or neutral. On occasion, I do feel an urge to drink. It's usually when I am very stressed out or anxious, and I ask myself whether drinking today would increase or decrease my stress and anxiety in the long run. And so far, it's always been ""no.""

It is my sincere belief and hope that it will always be ""no,"" now. Once you are able to understand - way deep down - that alcohol does not do anything of the good things you've been told it does, it will no longer hold power over you. All of the reasons that you drink are just stories you tell yourself about drinking.

Alcohol is a Central Nervous System depressant, drink enough (as we all know all too well) and you'll pass out. That's what it does. As its concentration increases in your blood, you are moving closer and closer towards stupor. A CNS depressant does not and cannot take away your anxiety, make socializing more fun, make you funnier, give you confidence, or any of the other things we ascribe to it.

We give alcohol all the credit - and none of the blame. Alcohol doesn't help you do anything except get drunk. And we all know drunk - real drunk - isn't all that fun. The only thing that you are missing out on is a hangover. The only thing that I regret about quitting drinking is that I didn't do it sooner. I wasted so much time bargaining and setting rules and slipping up and all the rest before I finally was able to make it stick. What worked for me was listing to audiobooks about not drinking. Over and over and over again. This Naked Mind was a favourite, but I also did Alcohol Explained and Alcohol Lied to Me. They helped me to stop romanticize my drinking and view the plain truth of it.

If you're sober and miserable: better days are coming. It took about 4 solid months before I stopped checking my sober app multiple times a day. I still had to work really, really hard at avoiding temptations early on as well. I've sat outside my old bar listening to those audiobooks I mentioned more than once before deciding to drive away. It's hard to believe when you're in the thick of it, but eventually, you'll realize you haven't thought about a drink in a day, a week.

If you're not sober yet: everything that you're afraid you're going to lose when you quit drinking is really here on the other side. There's freedom over here. Not having to worry about what to drink and when to drink and how to get the next drink and do I have enough to drink and does anyone notice how much I've drank is so incredibly liberating.

Not one single day out of the last 333 have I woke up wishing that I had drunk the night before. Sober life isn't perfect - it's just your same old life - but now you're not making it more difficult for yourself and everyone around you.

I'm so extremely grateful to be not drinking with you fine folks today.",55,0

I've been struggling with moderate-heavy drinking for almost 20 years. My boyfriend of 3 years has seen me through some of my worst times - blacking out, pissing the bed during one of our vacations, treating him poorly when drunk. He stopped drinking entirely in order to encourage me to stop drinking. I've gone through phases of drinking less (I went 6 weeks without drinking a couple years ago), but nothing ever seems to stick. I always end up wanting a few drinks with friends, or some wine during Valentine's Day, etc. 

Last night I got ridiculously black out drunk with some friends. He came to pick me up, and apparently I was pretty rude to him in the car. I don't remember. I passed out immediately upon getting home. I obviously feel like garbage today, the hangover, the regret, the heartbreak that I put him through this shit again. 

We had a teary conversation this morning that he was reaching the end of his rope with me. He's sick of feeling anxious every time I go out, not knowing who or what I will be when I get home. He's sick of being mistreated by the person who loves him. And I 100% understand his frustrations. He feels like we've been through this process before - hard conversations, promises to change, and then back to drinking. I asked him to please give me/us one more chance. I'm terrified I've pushed him too far. But I truly believe I can do this and he has promised support. 

I love him, I love our life, and I don't want to lose him. I also am sick of feeling crappy, sick of the hangovers, sick of the shame. I want to change not just for him/us, but for ME. I'm almost 40 and this is not what I want.

This is Day 1, and I'm crying and scared and not really sure what to do next. But I know I want to make a serious change.

For 3 yrs I got my travel paid to work cool events all over the states. This job was the source of my problem. 2 yrs ago I left that scene & cut off everyone since alcohol was what my friendships revolved around. I still drank alone up until 6 months ago when I decided this had to end. Recently tho, I‚Äôve become depressed about having 0 friends.

So- last week someone posted on fb it was their 1st 30 days & how ppl at AA helped him thru it. I figured, maybe this is my chance to meet some cool ppl I can relate with. In short, I said congrats then asked about AA & he offered to go w/ me to my 1st meeting.

Today I messaged & basically said ‚Äòweekends are the hardest, no pressure but it‚Äôd be nice if you can join me today.‚Äô He said he‚Äôs on a retreat w/ his sponsor & AA friends, & is very sorry. (Gosh I hope he‚Äôs not on this lol.) It‚Äôs understandable but this has just made me really sad cuz I don‚Äôt know how to make friends anymore but would love to do those things one day.

I‚Äôm still going to my 1st meeting today & I‚Äôm just really hoping they accept me & maybe even become friends. Crying/laughing at that cuz it sounds so sad. Anyways, it starts in a couple hours, I have no idea what to expect. I‚Äôm both nervous & excited.

This community is something else...I am happy to repost it. For those reading it for the first time, let me know if it resonates with you. Incidentally, the ""Gratitude List"" is an excellent tool for recovery, and is utilized in many forms of therapy as well. Just write down the things you are grateful for.....  

**The Fuck Its**  

""It's really easy to say ""Fuck It"". Because ""it"" strips all the value off the thing it refers to. Whatever ""it"" is, it becomes devalued by being referred to as ""it"".  

So it behooves us, as alcoholics to be aware of this. What exactly are we devaluing by using the label ""it""?  

Would we say, ""Fuck the people who care about me, I'm drinking""?  
Would we say, ""Fuck my finances, I'm drinking""?  
Would we say, ""Fuck my self-esteem, I'm drinking""?  
Would we say, ""Fuck my body, my health, I'm drinking""?  
Would we say, ""Fuck my job, my home, I'm drinking"" ?  

Probably not. Because we value these things, and when we name them, we become less willing to damage them. But when we devalue them by calling them ""it"", they become disposable in the pursuit of the ""I"", and our selfish nature takes over. We can pick up a glass a lot easier if we fool ourselves, even subtly, into believing that we aren't hurting anything that has value. Or that our desire to serve our own desires should be paramount.  

So when I get a case of Fuckitis i try to remember what I'm fucking. It's all the stuff on my Gratitude List. All of it. And that's the best prescription for the disease. Take out the Gratitude List, and try saying ""Fuck (item)"". It's harder, isn't it? But that's exactly what we'll be fucking if we start drinking again. Line by line, item by item, we'll be fucking every good thing in our lives straight into the ground.  

And for what? A glass of poison? Booze is my ""it"". Booze has no value to me, at all. Booze deserves to be called ""it"" for all time to come, in revenge for what it has done to me, and to a lot of others.  

So when I say ""Fuck It"", that's what I'm talkin' about. Fuck booze. Fuck that stuff. Fuck it straight to hell on a one-way ticket.  

That's it. Get it?""",122,0

I haven't made it past that in 2 years.  My partner bought beer that night and it sat next to me the whole night and I didn't succumb.  I like not drinking because I can eat dinner without throwing up.  I can actually enjoy the food instead of taking a couple bites and going back to drinking right after.  I have more patience for my partner and less irritable with mundane inconveniences when I'm sober.  My anxiety is better because I'm not having panic attacks the next day when I'm hungover.  I'm honestly taking care of myself more.  I took a shower less than a week after the previous one -- sometimes I would go a month without showering.

I feel better about myself and less ashamed about what I might have done the night before.  I don't need to hide my cans or split them between trash and recycling.  No regrets about who or why I talked to someone -- nothing to apologize for.  In the morning, I don't have to piece together what I did and who I talked to and the promises I made the night before.  I'm not constantly running downstairs to throw up so I can drink more alcohol.  I'm not having diarrhea or just straight up liquid shits.  

Not drinking is easy for some people and I've always wished I was one of them.  But I can't be.  Once you've had a taste of alcoholism, you need the will to stay sober every day.

I need to take better care of myself.  Drinking is just rude to me.  Stretching by body's skin so it tears and reveals the angry red below.  Clouds my skin with oil.  Boats.  Drowns me.  Makes my mood fowl.  My body covered in filth.  I don't deserve this.  You don't deserve this.  

I drink to punish myself.  Depression is no joke.  And alcohol became my best friend.  Alcohol took precedence over everything; myself, my family, my passions.  That's just not fair.  I need to convince myself that doing that to myself and others is not fair.  I want to feel excited about ANYTHING again.  Drinking isn't going to help me accomplish that.  

I haven't made it as long as a lot of you, but I'm trying.  Cutting down from 2-6 drinks a day to 2-5 a week was a gigantic step for me.  I don't want my life to be controlled by alcohol anymore.  Genetics, you're a bitch.  But it's also on me.  I gotta own up to my own shortcomings.  I need to learn to love myself (or even just LIKE myself) again.

We all deserve it.

I‚Äôve obviously lurked a while. I quit drinking January 26th 2020. I‚Äôm a 31M, married, two kids. I was what you‚Äôd call a borderline high functioning alcoholic I guess. Meaning I never drank at work but I was able to maintain a heavy evenings consumption of whiskey . ultimately I was going thru career burn out at my startup while self medicating what I‚Äôve come to accept now is anxiety/depression with alcohol and nicotine. 

Recently thoughts of beginning to drink again crept up. Thoughts like ‚Äúok you‚Äôre all good now, you have it under control‚Äù. Thoughts like ‚Äúhow come everyone else gets to blow off some steam but I can‚Äôt‚Äù. 

Thankfully I took a step back to see why I was thinking that way and realized my anxiety was getting bad again, due to lack of exercise and healthy diet among other things. 

I guess my point here is the hardest part of my sober journey wasn‚Äôt a few weeks in. It was months.

2025,2020-10-10 13:32:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/j8okik/i_decided_to_quit_drinking_altogether_and_other/,I decided to quit drinking altogether (and other vices),"First of all, I'm not an alcoholic, never was. Not trying to look better than those who were / are alcoholics. Just trying to get that out of the way because when you say you're quitting drinking, it's safe to assume you were an alcoholic in the first place.

Anyway, the last time I drank was around september and before that was around july. So yeah, just an occasional drinker. But pre-2020 I used to drink about 3 times a month at least. Sure that ain't much, but the alcohol I consume during those drinking sessions are a lot. I drink til I'm puking my guts out during those drinking sessions and when I wake up, it's normal for me to have the worst hangover ever which usually lasts 2 days and I always end up saying ""I'm never drinking again"" which always ends up a lie. Until last september when I ultimately decided to quit drinking. 

Reasons? Health reasons ‚Äî acidity and sensitive teeth. I think I have GERD, I'm not sure, but it's extremely uncomfortable and painful whenever it happens, it's a close 2nd to toothaches for me (yes, i have low pain tolerance). Though alcohol isn't the main cause for my acidity, i think cutting down on it might help ‚Äî but i thought why not just quit it altogether. Sensitive teeth: my 2 front teeth are sensitive to cold drinks/food. My favorite alcoholic beverage is beer, out of the bottle, Heineken to be specific. Or San Miguel Pale Pilsen or Red Horse since it's more widely available than Heineken in the Philippines. Unless I wanna drink warm beer (ew) I'm gonna have to man up with my extremely sensitive front teeth. Why not just get them fixed? I am getting them fixed don't worry about it. But those 2 health concerns aren't the only reason why I've decided to quit drinking.

The ultimate reason why I quit drinking at a ripe age of 24 is because I don't enjoy it as much as I enjoy the conversations I have during those drinking sessions. I've come to realize that the only thing I enjoyed during those drinking sessions was the bond and time I had with the people I drank with but ever since I severed ties with those people due to personal issues (will not go into detail with this, but the gist is they screwed me over. I'm man enough to admit my faults but my ""friends"" aren't.). I Still drank after I severed ties with them but with my girlfriend's brothers and cousins but it was never really the same. 

Another reason I quit is because I don't see any benefit to it. I Just see it as a liability and an instant hangover giver. I could spend my money on something else that I actually want or need, same goes with my time. 

Another possible reason would be mental health probably. With everything that's happened to me (severed ties with ex friends) and with everything that's going on with me mentally (lack of self-confidence, lack of interest in hobbies and things I like) and with covid, I think all of that is affecting my mental health. This might sound like toxic masculinity, but I don't like talking about my mental health, my feelings and my personal problems. I Don't think I'm the same man I was before I severed ties with my former peers, this is the first time I admitted that or even acknowledged it I think. I Have other friends as well, but I don't have a main group/set of friends anymore which is ironic because I've always seen myself as a lone wolf and felt that I'm better off alone in the best way possible ‚Äî not because I'm a horrible person, which I don't think I am. Idk, maybe the people I know can contest that or agree with that, but because I think attachments to people affect me mentally. 

I'm getting off track sorry. Aside from those reasons / factors, I also decided to quit because frankly I just don't enjoy it anymore and I want to help myself get better (in all aspects). Because I think alcohol might make my mental state worse and because I think this will be good for me in the future.

Another reason but compared to all the other reasons, this is just a smidge of a reason. I Drive. I Don't want to end up in the hospital, the morgue, in prison or on the fucking morning news with the headline ""drunk driver injures/kills 20"".

What gave me the idea to completely stop drinking was Hannibal Buress's Miami Night's special. He didn't go into detail why he stopped drinking but he had a bit where he said he quit drinking and stopped giving out the ""I'm sorry I was drunk last night"" excuse whenever he said something horrible which I think hit a nerve with me. During those drinking sessions I usually say somethings or act a certain way that the next morning I feel like i might have offended someone or irritated someone and I feel really anxious about it that I end up apologizing for something that the receiving party doesn't even remember or they weren't even bothered at all. 

Aside from alcohol, I also stopped other vices. Weed to be specific. Again like with alcohol, I'm not a regular cannabis user. I just thought that it wouldn't be right if I quit drinking but still agreed to an occasional blunt. It's like becoming a vegetarian for health concerns but still smoke cigarettes. 

Speaking of cigarettes, I guess that's the only thing I haven't given up. I'm not a 1-pack-a-day person though. Maybe 3 to 5 sticks a day. I haven't given that up because I think it helps me stay sane. I'm not sure if I'm depressed or if I have any other mental health concerns but I'm sure I'm not at a 100% right now due to the stated reasons above. I am gonna quit though, just not right now. Maybe when I'm feeling like myself again. Yeah you can say I'm just making up excuses. I probably am, but I'm the one who gets to decide. 

The only challenge I face when it comes to drinking is my gf's family. Her brothers and cousins will not take no for an answer. I think this is a cultural thing here in the Philippines. It's somewhat disrespectful tbh. 

With regards to drinking my sorrows away, I don't resort to drinking when I have problems because I have cigarettes for that. 

I'm not looking for praise, I don't deserve it. Those who were formerly addicted to it and were dependent on alcohol and were man enough to admit that they have a drinking problem and are succesfully sober, they're the ones that deserve praise. What I seek is guidance, advice, maybe some support. 

Thanks.",5,1

The main issue I've been struggling with is coming to terms with an ex about past issues. I have been feeling an intense need to reach out.

We were together for about 3.5 years and lived together for most of it.  I drank through a lot of it, while he remained 4+years sober. My drinking did not bother him and he told me he didn't think I had a problem, when deep down I knew i did.  We had our ups and downs but then I completely broke when I unexpectedly lost my older brother due to uncontrolled diabetes resulting in a heart attack in 2019.  He was my best friend.  It has only been about a year and a half since his death and I am finally feeling ""normal"" without toxic coping mechanisms. 

I drank a lot to cope with his death and drank before he passed too for about 8 years (bingeing alone, playing online games, drinking to feel normal).  These are things I never opened up to my ex about due to shame.

I started to really lose myself all of 2019 and I was just very angry towards everything and everyone, especially my ex.  I was going to therapy and trying to take care of myself, but to be honest I didn't care much for my mental health and wellbeing.  I broke up with my ex because I felt it was easier to grieve and be in darkness alone than with someone who had a hard time understanding my struggle.  I understand now that not everyone has felt the same pain and he tried but could not help me, I had to help myself.  We have been broken up for about 9 months now and have had minimal contact.

I am not feeling the want to get together as a couple, to be honest I am not sure what I am looking for out of this.  

I guess my question is:  When is the appropriate time to reach out and attempt to make amends?  Is it selfish to reach out now because I was the one who ended things?

Our 24 hours are up so time to announce the winner.  I know I said there would be just one winner of a $25.00 gift card to Amazon but, after reading all of the wonderful comments yesterday, I decided to add a second winner for another $25.00 Amazon gift card.  So, without further ado, the two winners are** u/Liveforsummer **and** u/LadyJ92 **You have 24 hours to contact me and advise how you would like your gift cards.  Congratulations and thank you to everyone for playing.  I am sorry I couldn't give awards to everyone!  Good luck in your journeys, my friends!!!! \*\***

Hi Friends.  Life and recovery is always better for me when I am giving rather than receiving.  So I am going to give someone from this Sub a $25 Amazon Gift Card this weekend.  Here are the details:

* If you want in, simply respond to this post with ""I'm in"" or something similar AND a promise that some day, whenever you feel you can, you will pay this kindness forward.
* In 24 hours (8:00 am Central Time) I will take all the people who have registered on this thread and, assign them a # based on when they registered and ask my daughter to pick any number from the group.  That person will win the gift card and I will post it here to this thread under an EDIT at the top of the thread.
* The winner will have 24 hours to contact me and advise how he/she would like the gift card information delivered to them.  If I don't hear from them I will do it again.
* There is NO need to give me any personal or identifying information.  I don't want it and I can simply send you the gift card information anyway you prefer.
* In case you think I have ulterior motives, I don't.  I have done this many times on this sub in the past (usually for coffee or even sending people sobriety coins who have asked for one).  :)

One thing I have learned in a decade of recovery is that small acts of kindness like this can frequently go a long way in helping others.  And, when I am helping others my life is always better.

Thank you all and good luck to you on your journey!   \~Nika",57,0

At first the program work wonders for me, but eventually I grew to dislike it. I do not believe in a higher power and I hated that in AA everything is your fault. I also noticed a lot of hypocrisy in the program. I started questioning if I was really an alcoholic and ended up drinking. It was fine the first few times, but then I drank way too much one night.

I didn‚Äôt drink for 2 months, but one night I decided to try wine since I hadn‚Äôt drank wine since before I originally got sober. I drank too much again. I didn‚Äôt drink for a few weeks and then one day I had 1 drink.

I celebrate 11 years of marriage with SaintMarge today. We met when I was at the bottom, digging my way down. She saw me at my worst, and chose me anyway. It‚Äôs pretty incredible, and some would say more than a bit risky.

From the start, she refused to be my saviour. She did demand that I sobered up, and I kind of did. After some months of straightening up, I was a functioning alcoholic for years. Then I wasn‚Äôt.

Four years ago I fell head first into my second really destructive drinking period, and this time I realized moderation was not an option. I needed a fundamental change. I found SD, the community, and a whole crew of people just like me.

The reason I post this, is that I know life can suck. I know I‚Äôve been lucky. Not everyone has someone. Not all relations survive. The community is an invaluable vent for me. My wife and I have been through more struggles than I care to mention, and I‚Äôve lost other valuable relations for other reasons.

I know life can be pretty great too. That‚Äôs all due to relations. I could never ever have done this without relations. My wife, who showed me there was a better a life, one or two IRL equals/mentors, and you guys, who gave and keep giving me so much support and wisdom.

Not least, my relation to myself. I‚Äôve learned so much about myself. It‚Äôs still a work in progress, but I‚Äôm learning to love myself, to love my evil twin, to pour love and understanding into all that pain, failure and despair that used to crave alcohol for numbness.

It‚Äôs a common understanding among therapists that relation is the opposite of addiction. I think it is. Feeding the addiction is an introvert action. Drinking is essentially a lonely activity. It loosens inhibitions, but blunts other interactions, emotionally, intellectually, sensory.

I am someone now, someone real, someone worthy of a good life, someone sober and present, because of my relations. My relations opened doors to the life that I really want. However, as most of us discover, these relations do not come by themselves. They must be sought out, watered, nourished, weeded, even repaired, in order to grow.

For me, the challenge above all others was to open up and allow others to come in. Allow relations to come close, to become real. Be honest, vulnerable, invested. It‚Äôs scary, and sure, I‚Äôve been burned, and I‚Äôve lost, but that‚Äôs life, isn‚Äôt it, and I‚Äôve gotten so much better at handling life.

I‚Äôm eternally grateful I took the chance. I‚Äôm growing, also in my relation to my wife, my normie hero, who‚Äôs still here, making every day less of a pain to get up to. I see a future unfold, where there used to be nothing. It‚Äôs pretty amazing.

I've been growing chillis and after a harvest I underestimated how potent they would be. I made a lovely dish of pasta and it nearly blew my head off! So, so worth it but I ended up with acid indigestion afterwards as a reward for my bravery!  


I realised that it's the first time I've had acid indigestion for over a year, and it hit me as to how normalised I had become to it while drinking. The memory hit me of having to buy milk most nights along with the alcohol so I could keep the acid under control just enough to drink.

It feels like a memory from a different life and really hammered home how far I've come. It sounds totally crazy to explain that this was just normal and it shows what an altered state I was living in. If anyone is reading this and is suffering right now - just know that you can find a life without alcohol. 

The full time job of managing a life revolving around alcohol can be a distant memory for you too.

Just want to say yay, because six is my lucky number, and also I realized something.

I had spent two years drinking once every few months and although I value all I learned in that time about drinking culture and the deconstruction of it, and being able to see alcohol in a different light - I still operated in a lot of fear.  Not consciously, but looking back I can now sense how much fear seemed to surround me like a soft light.  And to maintain something out of fear - it doesn't feel sustainable for me because it isn't pleasant and doesn't seem to breed growth.

I'm trying to do this round more consciously and with pride.  And so even though six days isn't new to me, the path its on is, and I'm really hopeful for it.  And while fear can sometimes be great to notice something is amiss and can get us to realizing a different direction may be needed - I hope that direction eventually leads to something revelrous for us all.

Then I got home today, and when I started to turn into my driveway, they were pulling out in a uhaul with their dog and everything they owned. They were going to leave without saying goodbye. I stopped in the middle of the street and we rolled down our windows. I asked if I could say goodbye. They parked and our first kiss was a farewell. We held each other for what felt like forever on the side if the road and I promised to visit them while they promised they would move here after they locked down work for real, a second time. Their wife and they had been trying to live together but couldn't afford to and they wanted more than anything to make it work here, and didn't think they could handle any sort of emotional send off.

I was crying before I got both feet in the door. I was out of cigarettes. As soon as I was able, I walked to the corner store. I wanted to drink so. Damn. Bad. I bought a tall boy and opened it when I got home. I couldn't drink it though. I stared at it, brought it from room to room with me until it was warm and a few hours had gone by. I flipped a coin twice and ignored the results twice. I watched TV, then a movie with it next to me. Finally I poured it out.

My heart is broken, and I wanted to handle it the way I always had. But I couldn't. IWNDWYT",4,0

The morning after heavy drinking I wake up hungover and with some feelings of guilt. But I quickly rationalize it by thinking :

1. that wasn't so bad
2. I needed to do something crazy, and I'm fine now.
3. that could've gone really wrong, but I managed it so no big deal.

As the anxiety and hangover wears off I start to get a soothing feeling of relaxation. I no longer get the ""heavy"" or ""stressed"" feeling that I had the days prior to drinking. 

I can only compare it to getting a full night's sleep and waking up completely rested and care-free.

I'd like to find other ways to get the same relaxation effect. and I wonder if someone has an explanation of what is happening in my brain the day after drinking. Thanks!",8,0

I used to think something is horribly wrong with me that I cannot stop at a couple of drinks. This sub taught me its just a personal trait that I have to live with. Many others are doing it as well, and all of us are improving.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It's Sagacious Saturday folks!

Today I'm going to put on my favourite pair of undercrackers again and in true Winnie-the-Pooh style get busy doing nothing much. <*yes the undercrackers have been washed*>

One thing I would just like to clarify about yesterday's post. Some of those hobbies I mentioned are now ex hobbies! I am not now a 45 year old man going round planting explosives in cow shits and running off. That said I just thought maybe this could be a training technique for my running, kind of like the beep test but with exploding cow shits instead of beeps? <*wonders whether I missed my role in life as a Personal Trainer*>
Anyway, I'm not the only one here who did this so it just goes to show you can share you're crazier stuff here and somebody else will very likely relate! Isn't that right u/dandandanbrambram

Secondly, just as a tip to any future hosts that have not hosted before, you might want to sort out the notification settings for the reddit app on your phone before you submit the days DCI post. Standing in a primary school playground on a morning waiting to drop my daughter off at nursery with a constant vibrating and buzzing emanating from my trouser pocket region is not an easy look to pull off after having just hit 'post' shortly before! If you fancy hosting the DCI then please do let u/sainthomer know.

I would like to welcome any new posters, ex lurkers and current lurkers to this lovely corner of reddit. I see lots of new usernames appearing every day, Sober Octoberers etc. and it's great that you are here looking for some support and somewhere to open up a bit about the shitshow that is an alcohol problem. Also thanks to all the long time soberistas who still hang around here despite the fact that they may indeed not have the same kind of need to keep themselves off the sauce as those in the earlier days of sobriety. Helping others to help themselves by sharing our highs and our lows and our collective wisdoms is what makes this community so fandabidozi (for our Scottish friends!)

Since my Disney+ post I've watched two more movies with my daughter so here is what I've added to my list:

**Poppa** (The Good Dinosaur) ""You have to get through your fear to see the beauty on the other side.""
Yeah, or maybe just 'Try not to fall into Rivers'?

**Forrest Woodbush** (The Good Dinosaur) ""This is Dreamcrusher. He protects me from having unrealistic goals."" I am not 100% sure if this one is motivational.

**Forky** (Toy Story 4) ""I am not a toy. I'm a spork. I was made for soup, salad, maybe chilli, and then the trash. I'm litter. Freedom!""
My daughter loves Forky! I love Forky!

**Woody** (Toy Story 4) ""Being there for a child is the most noble thing a toy can do.""
Being there for a child is a great thing for a Dad to do too! In fact being there for anyone is a great thing to do. Let's all just be kind and compassionate to each other!

A little more wisdom from Winnie-the-Pooh:

‚ÄúHere is Winnie the Pooh, coming downstairs now, bump, bump, bump, on the back of his head, behind Christopher Robin. It is, as far as he knows, the only way of coming downstairs, but sometimes he feels that there really is another way, if only he could stop bumping for a moment and think of it.‚Äù

For years I've been coming down the stairs going bump, bump, bump with drinking (both metaphorically and literally!) and I think I have often felt that there really might be another way if only I could stop bumping for a moment and think of it. It turns out I didn't need to think of it myself, I just had to show up here and have the way pointed out to me by all you fantastic folks.

Have a great weekend everyone. Thanks for reading my ramblings this week and for all the comments.

I'm near 10 months without alcohol and I'm frustrated out of my goddamn mind. Everything is the same, every day and nothing happens. No ups or downs, just blah every day. I'm probably some level of depressed too because I'm really struggling to find enjoyment on anything. I'm seeing a therapist.

I thought things would get better after I hit my first ""wall"" around five months. I was THIS close giving up then. But I didn't. I forced myself and kept my ""eye on the prize"". Well, there's still no prize in sight. I crave, I play the tape forward and there's nothing. I'm starting to run out of reasons to stay sober. When is this supposed to get better? Yeah it should be great to wake up without hangover and go to a walk where the birds are singing and sun is shining blah blah. If I'm going to be miserable yet another day why should I care if I'm hung over or not? It seems pointless. At least I had SOME fun before. I had my downs but I had my ups too. Now it's just a grey day after another and it suffocates me.

I know it sounds that I'm just a brat with a shitty attitude. I'm ranting and whining and being a child here. I apologize for that. I'm just frustrated and tired. I'm tired of repeating to myself that ""this is better"" and I should be ""grateful"" or something when it doesn't feel that way at all. I'm tired of working through this and walk the walk because I don't see the end goal. I've lost sight of what motivates me. And I'm also scared. I'm scared that I cannot face life as raw and real as it is presenting itself to me right now so eventually I will choose to escape back to bottle.

Now I was a daily drinker in the past, about 6 drinks per night for years. Since I stopped, I posted a few times here about the positive changes I experienced, mostly just feeling better. However, not sure why, but I decided to get some of my old favorites one day a little over a month ago. Nothing really triggered me and I have declined drinks at parties during that time, not sure what happened there. 

The next day I woke up hung over, but I didn't think much of it at all - It wasn't that much fun so I knew I wouldn't drink again that night. I didn't drink until a few days later.

I just wanted to say first of all that I am so incredibly proud of each and every one of you that are fighting alcoholism and trying so hard to heal. Even if it means taking it one minute at a time, please don't give up.

I lost my mother last year. She drank heavily for a very long time. She had issues she never learned how to deal with in any healthy way whatsoever. 

She had end stage liver cirrhosis. Please understand that dying like she did is excruciatingly painful. Fluid buildup everywhere in her body, vomiting every single day, and toxins would build up in her body that caused her to forget who or where she was. Sometimes it would even make her violent. 

It's terrifying. I'm not sharing this story to gain sympathy or to scare anyone. I'm sharing this because I am truly so glad to read about all of you wanting to change your lives. 

My mother was not old. Alcohol tore her life to pieces and then took her life away. Keep supporting each other and please know that you are so worthy of a happy, healthy life. Thanks for reading.",127,0

When I don‚Äôt work, I‚Äôm bored so I drink. When I work I‚Äôm exhausted, so I drink. I‚Äôm starting a new gig and I‚Äôm really anxious about it because I can barely hold down my other jobs due to my constant absenteeism from being too drunk/hungover to make it to work. Who says this job will be any different? What‚Äôs the point in trying even? 

I know it‚Äôs all up to me but isn‚Äôt that easier said than done with an active addiction. Jesus. I feel like it‚Äôs all just destined to detonate and leave me holding the fuse.

Not a good situation for me. I‚Äôm mostly keeping up on my meds, so there‚Äôs that. I know cutting out drinking would help. But I can‚Äôt seem to help myself to save my life. A doubly pertinent statement. 

I‚Äôm about to go on a five day work week insanity extravaganza. Which will be my new normal every other week. I need to stay sober to function. I need good rest for once. I feel like I haven‚Äôt slept well in months, many months. Geez. Just reminds me of someone I‚Äôve lost which was somewhat due to my drinking. I‚Äôm mourning that pretty hard. I used to sleep at their place and it was a safe and warm and welcoming environment. Now I feel like I‚Äôm just out and cold and alone. Thank god for my two furry cat friends, I truly don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôd be without them. 

Anyways, I‚Äôm not going to drink today. Nope. No no no. No can. I know when I get off at 9p I‚Äôll really want to. Really. But I have work tomorrow at 8a. I can‚Äôt miss that. I‚Äôm on some thin ass ice. Plus, don‚Äôt I deserve good rest and a relatively happy morning? I need to convince myself that I do. Stop this self hate and harm shit. Again, easier said than done.

I had a dream, as the title suggests it went negative real fast. The basics where it was a party, someone handed me a beverage and I just slammed it. Then it proceeded with my former party approach, just kept the drinks rolling. Passed out in my dreams with a sense of panic and frustration at following off the wagon. I woke up (for real) with a pounding headache and a little nauseous and for a second was convinced my dream was real and I was dealing with a hangover. After a moment of panic and self reflection the nausea faded (I think it was psychosomatic caused from the dream) and the headache, I was able to recognize as sinus pain (forehead and around the cheeks). I had run out of my allergy meds, so the headache wasn‚Äôt unexpected in truth.

That moment of pure panic reaffirmed my desire to stay free of alcohol.",4,0

2143,2020-10-09 11:33:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/j814lz/my_story/,My Story,"Hello there all,

I used to drink when I was a kid my parents would give me a drink whilst having dinner on special occasions. Large family gatherings and mainly festive periods. At the time I thought it was a fun thing to do. Nothing overly urged me to drink as I was only 9 or 10. That being said the taste and sensation must have stayed with me. Just want to clarify my parents are not big drinkers and are good people

By the time I was turning 13-14 I was seeing a lot of my parents friends drinking heavily and I would sneak a Shandy or 2 but not get drunk just the giggle state. From that the big one was when me and my friends stole alcohol and manged to get a packet of cigarettes, there was 2 bottles of wine and 6 beers and we drank it all in the wilderness there was only 4 of us and we were shit faced. We got caught by the police so we just lied our way out of it on how we got the drink and smokes.

By that time I got my real taste of drinking and where my drinking really stepped up a notch. I moved again so I had a fresh start in another country. That really didn't help as this led me into taking drugs just for the social aspect. Still around the age of 15-16 I stupidly open my parents liquor cabinet which was kept lock and made an ungodly monstrosity of a cocktail that included every from whisky to cr√®me de menthe this was just after I finished school and a friend came over to mine. I poured the contents into a 75cl bottle and I proceeded to down it. Safe to or unsafe to say I was paralytic and vomiting everywhere. Alcohol poisoning and some substantial damage I went Jaundice for a few weeks and suffered DT's. This abuse would continue but the only difference was the weekends were the only times id drink myself into oblivion and not suffer as badly as the event described above.

Fast forward a few years I had moved once again and still being a delinquent much of the same abuse to my body as before but moved on to harder drugs until I went to work hungover and on a come down before then I would only get fucked up on the weekend but this time this bender overlapped into Monday morning that's when I lost it and used the last of my money to get wasted and my friends place. I lost my job lost my gf and my place to live within 2 weeks.

I moved back with my parents, this prompted me to abstain from drink and drugs for a year which I did successfully, I still wasn't working just playing games online with some friends that I met. Parents would go out for a dinner with their work colleagues and id look after our doggo and drink soft drinks until my teeth would rot. By this time anyone drinking in front of me was not an issue and never felt the urge to drink. BUT, you guessed it one wont hurt which led into another and another. After that 1 year I started drinking heavily everyday only stopping when I felt so badly hungover that I needed to stay sober to recover for a day or 2 then back at it.

In my early 20's I had a secure job met a girl, still drinking but a lot less than I did and only on the weekends. Everything seemed great but after a few months on went on holiday by myself and enjoyed myself a little too much and enjoyed a few lines and smoking weed hell! I'm on holiday right! well yes it was uneventful until after I came back I decided that I didn't want to be with the girl anymore after a few weeks of being back I got really drunk one night whilst I was with her and after I broke up with her she informs me that she is Prego. I was incredibly nervous about becoming a dad and I didn't want the kid to grow up without a father we proceeded to get married and she moved In with me. This is where shit takes a turn for the worse much worse.

I'll skip most of the details but we lost our child to cancer which just spun me into a drunken rage and distraught for many years. This put a tremendous toll on already a frail relationship at its tipping point. I drank and continued to drink for years after what happened, just trying to fill the void of which many of us know can not be filled. suffice to say we both could not handle what and we went our separate ways. Unfortunately the alcohol and misery followed me.

All through my mid 20's and now struggling 30's I have attempted to stop for mental health reasons and physical reasons I've continued to lose people around me some no fault of my own but people that I have really cared for are pushed away by the toxicity that is me drinking and the unravelled mess that i drag on my shoulders.",1,0

Last year I managed to commit to a month of sobriety, and many people here offered me encouragement and support, for which I was grateful. Unfortunately, I wasn't ready to fully commit to the community then. 

After that month, I began drinking again, which went from moderate to just-north-of-moderate within about 3 months, and then as COVID began to hit, I was in a constant state of anxiety made worse by the cycle of drinking, which became a downward spiral by the time lockdown was in effect. Away from the office, I was drinking a few beers to ""keep my cool"" throughout the day, and then when I went back to the office I switched to vodka to ""keep my cool"" under cover.

This past weekend, I dove headfirst into the craft beer, swam too deep, and on Monday morning bought a fifth of vodka on my way to work. I managed to keep to myself all day and finished half the bottle before I left. I hardly ate anything all day except maybe a 1000 calories of leftover fried fish and snacks. 

The next day, I had to call out from work because I was unable to keep even water down until 4 PM, and by that point I was already feeling the withdrawal sweats and mind-zaps. When my wife came back from work around 8 PM, I was working my way through the last four shots of the fifth, and needless to say, I was not at my most handsome.

I happened to have some prescriptions that would help with the withdrawal (happy to discuss further in comments) and I did an aggressive taper schedule with my last beer being last night.

It can be so brutally difficult to dig oneself out of a hole, and I'm writing all of this mostly to be able to look back and remember why I don't want to ever do that again.

If you have read this far, I'm sending you all the best energy I can muster, which is more today than it's been in a while.

TL;DR: Found the bottom again and am digging my way back up. IWNDWYT",3,2

On the bright side I have been sober for a week and the motivation to do shit is coming back strong so now all I have to do is not be a dumb ass. 

I honestly have zero expectations or confidence in anything long term because I always get bored and think I can drink a little.

Wanted to celebrate but celebrating without booze is such a unknown concept to me that I don't know where to begin.

I was anticipating this day. Because I felt like if I made it a month then I would most likely not go back. It's true that my cravings are pretty much gone. I'm healthier. I work out and have lost weight. I've been more focused on work although still procrastinating alot. Most of all I've been sober and had less moments feeling down. Although it's not all glam I've had some rough days don't get me wrong.

All in all I'm more balanced right now. Sober means I'm in control. My mood is leveled. No extremes. When I drank the highs were high and the low were low. Now it's just mostly centered and slight highs and slight lows.

I ghosted all my drinker friends a month ago. Changed my number. I've had a toxic friend circle for years and it was huge stepping away from them. 

For me I've learned. With the balanced sober living and a healthier life comes loneliness and isolation. With the suffocating drinking comes huge highs and huge lows. 

At this point I'm too far from that now to go back to it all. To the same friends and insane drinking episodes. As soon as the pen of sobriety hit the page I became commited to finishing the stroke. Where it goes. I have no idea and that terrifies me. Will I be doomed to be alone and sober? Will I make new friends, meet a SO? Who knows maybe this time next month I'll be right back where I started. You never know how life will turn out.

I can't help but question if I made the right choice. A friend who kept in touch with me throughout this said in passing that I made such a big thing out of this meaning quitting. And that really hurt. He knew how much it was affecting me and for him to downplay it like that. I don't know it seems shit of him. It was a huge thing to walk away from all my childhood friends that have hurt me more times than I can count and to walk away from the only lifestyle I've known for the past ten years. It is huge to me. 

At 29 years old. Most ppl are making me feel stupid for deciding to exclude myself from the drinking lifestyle. Friends I do have left don't seem to want me around sober. My parents I can tell think I'm stupid for it, they are heavy drinkers themselves. 

Maybe I made this into too much of a big deal? Would it have been so bad if I had just kept up the charade with everyone else. I can't help but feel like I'm going to miss out alot.

I'll tell you what guys life is hard af.

Anyways I'm starting to feel sorry for myself. When actually this is about 30 days sober. I fucking did it. I love you guys I have no one else but you all who support me. I will not drink today and don't plan to drink tomorrow. I'm going to celebrate by ordering my favourite takeaway, taking the day off work (I freelance so I can do that ü§£‚úåÔ∏è) ordering some electronic kit for my art sudio and watching Netflixs all day. 

Was it worth it? Even with all the confusions and other downsides. I have to say yes it bloody was. I feel amazing overall and things are looking up for a change. Sobriety is worth it. I've fallen back in love with living.

I would nearly crack every time I went grocery shopping. I would stop and stare at the alcohol and have to force myself not to get something. Now I am on my sixth week and I don't even walk down that isle. I barely even think about it while I am there. 

Sure, I could pat myself on the back on my six week achievement and have a drink, but it would actually be 6 or 12. 

Then the next time I went to the store I would be staring at the alcohol again. I would be drinking regularly, and it would be like these last weeks of clarity never happened. 

If (let's be honest, when) I wanted to stop again, I would have to go through the fits of uncontrollable sobbing. It would dominate my thoughts. It's just not worth it. It's much easier to not drink now than it would be after I gave in. Also, how long would it take for me to admit it is a problem again? Years?

Forever is a long time, so I am committed to 6 more weeks to see how I feel at the end of that much time. Never before have I ever before been so long without alcohol since I was 15. (41 now). It feels good.

*Hoping to connect with other people in a similar situation or hear some advice

Short story time. I have been experiencing (suspected) mini seizures and day long disassociation-type altered states for a few years. I have PTSD and have also had panic attacks and disassociation experiences - these day long things I am almost sure are related to seizure type activity are a very different experience as anxiety attacks. 

I'm generally very healthy (regular exercise, good eating habits, fine tuned self care routines) but I do like a glass or two of wine. I also do have a long history with alcohol, and have abused it on the past. Over the years I've figured out that the days after I drank are the days I'm more likely to experience these very scary, and potentially dangerous states of mind. 

End result? Either quit drinking and try to avoid seizure meds, or take seizure meds which you can't drink on. 

I've gone extended periods of time without drinking in the past and know I can do this. It just feels like a loss. What's better than a beer on the beach on a beautiful day off? Or a new friend made at the wine tasting? I've drank more years than not, and my go to for making friends involves a drink or two. 

Quarantine times has decreased my overall alcohol intake already, so I think I can thank the COVID era for giving me a head start.

My reptile brain wants to be ashamed, and this very good advice from my wonderful new neurologist (just moved to a new place and finally got seen) feels like petting a cat backwards.

Anybody else have to stop drinking for something like this? I've only told my mother, my brother, and a few best friends so far. Got the news yesterday from the brain doc.

&#x200B;

In March 2019, I stopped drinking alcohol completely. I didn't tell anyone about it. I didn't go to any meetings. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it, if I didn't have to. It was a commitment that I made to myself for the following reasons. Long story short; I had been a responsible and functional heavy drinker / alcoholic. I always made sure that my job, bills, food, and important stuff in life always came first. One day, I don't know why but something occurred to me and helped me realize with the way I was consistently abusing alcohol, it could take over my life, even if it was an unintentional accident. Fact is, it's happened to a lot of other people in this world, and I'm not special, it could happen to me. Everyone knows what happens next. You lose your job, end up homeless, burn bridges with everyone important in your life, maybe end up in the hospital, jail or even dead.  That realization scared the hell out of me and it was enough to motivate me to stop drinking. I was able to do it without going to the ER or going to rehab; I guess I got lucky in that respect.

Throughout this entire time; I haven't ever been tempted to drink. I've been around friends, family members, gatherings, etc ..where the booze was readily available and people offered me drinks. It didn't bother me at all; I just said no thanks and didn't think about it twice. No big deal.

Tonight I was driving home and I passed by the liquor store like I always do. The liquor store is on the way home and there's no way around it. It never really bothered me at all, until tonight. When I drove by it tonight, I remembered a time, ages ago, when I was drinking with a friend and had a fun night. And it really made me want to get a bottle of Rum. I drove into the liquor stores parking lot and sat there for about 5-10 minutes thinking about how much fun it would be to get drunk tonight. After about 10 minutes passed, I kind of ""sobered up"" so to speak, and realized that I didn't want to drink. I didn't want the hangover. I didn't want to waste the $20. I actually have important stuff for work to do tomorrow and I don't want to screw that up. So I left the parking lot and went straight home. And the past couple of hours I've been thinking about how stupid I am that I would want to drink again after all this progress I've made.

But the thing is, I didn't do it. But I'm also afraid that since it happened to me tonight, it'll happen again and next time I might not be so lucky.",7,0

I treated anxiety with SSRIs for a year when I was drinking, and even though they stopped the anxiety, they made me numb (and made me drink even more). Alcohol amplifies anxiety a hundred times, and a thousand times when you wake up the next day hangover and remembering all the embarrassing things you'd done the night before.

So that's it. I just realized that even in my most caffeine-fueled days, where I get grumpy by night, even in those days I don't have the same anxiety feeling that I had when I was drinking. And it's such a relief!

If you're having anxiety problems*, stopping drinking may help you! Don't lose hope!

Little backstory, I basically hit the bottle extremely hard and quick for about a year and I basically stopped the beginning of August and haven't had any alcohol since then.  Now I know my case isn't nearly as extreme as what some people have dealt with, but even quittting the first couple of weeks was really hard; and that's not even from me drinking all day everyday like a 'classical alcoholic'.  Nevertheless, I've been enjoying my sobriety a lot.  Some positives that have come from this so far is not feeling guilty about drinking habits. I basically eliminated the desire to drink for the most part.  I'm saving so much money.  I dont wake up with hangovers.  I'm generally in a far better mood then that year stretch.  I lost soo much weight.  In the middle of it I was up to 168 lbs (I'm a dude who's 5'5"" and I'm now down to 140 lbs from cutting alcohol out, along with fast food.  No doubt I'm probably healthier than drinking as much as I did.  I know everybody has their reasons to not drink or have the desire to quit drinking altogether.  

I guess all I'm trying to get at is trying to encourage anybody who is reading this and just letting them know its worth it.

I went to a meeting the other day and called myself an addict, but the truth is that I identify with SOME of the characteristics typically held by addicts, but not all of them. But I'm not sure if my brain is just trying to convince me that I'm not an addict, lol.

FYI today is 5+ days consecutively sober for me. Most I've done since starting this journey over the summer is 11 days.

I have some rather obvious addictive tendencies, but my life is good and even though I've hit some bumps on the road this year (the most obvious example being laid off due to COVID and having trouble finding secure employment...), My life is good. I have hobbies, I exercise regularly, eat good, I try to take good care of myself, solid skincare routine, lol. It's pretty far from careening into the gutter. The reason I'm pursuing sobriety is that I never WANT to get to that point. I'd like to be ahead of that curve, so to speak. This seems objectively like a smart strategy.

The problem with this strategy, of course, is that because my life is still good and I'm not close to rock bottom, it's harder to see clear, indisputable reasons to 100% abstain from substances. So, I'm in the awkward middle place where I think I might be an addict, but not fully sure, I want to stave off tragedy before it hits me, but want to keep substances in my life in the event that I'm NOT an addict and can keep everything under control and keep a healthy, balanced life.

Does this make sense? Not sure if I'm being clear. ü§∑

Anyway, I would love to hear stories from those of you who identify as addicts--about how you came to that realization and committed to the label.

This is my first time posting in a group but I wanted to share with you all my small/big success.

I have been wanting to stop drinking for years now but was unable to do so/couldn‚Äôt find the strength as there was always something that drove me to drink. Did I feel anxious? Drink. Did my soccer team win the match? Drink. Did I have a good day? Drink. Did I have a bad day? Drink more. You get the idea.

2 weeks ago my good friends sat me down intervention style and told me I needed to stop. I hesitated and doubted I could follow through.
Heck, I needed a drink just to cope w the idea of quitting! Somehow, I guess because I felt I was cared for, I took the opportunity and decided to go for it. I told myself that if I could only last 3 weeks, then I could reassess.

I am at week 2 and thinking about what I am going to do after the 3 weeks are over. I am not a good drunk and I appear to not have a limit once I start drinking so there are a lot of reasons I should quit altogether. I wonder if I have the ability to moderate myself and what that moderation looks like. Is it only drinking when there is an occasion? If so, how much? Will it take me back to my old habits and start drinking at noon? 

If there is anyone out here that can relate somehow I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts. Also would love to hear about how others deal with sudden cravings as those moments seem especially challenging for me.

Thank you all and hope everyone is staying safe!",19,0

I was able to function, maintain relationships, keep jobs, and all that, but I had to drink every day, and a lot. Because I know that I've badly damaged my body, I committed to quitting. Tried tapering, with moderate success, and then one Saturday at the end of last month, I just didn't drink. 
  

That part turned out to be easy. I had read up about the dangers of detox, but past experiences with inpatient care and the fact that I don't have ""massages and aromatherapy"" rehab money made checking myself in someplace a last resort for me. So I resolved to ride it out at home with my supportive and long-suffering SO ready to call the EMTs if things went really sideways. 
  

Over the past 11 days, my main detox symptoms have been directly related to how badly I fucked up my brain chemistry. I don't crave alcohol. I doubt I will ever even consider drinking again. But oh Lord does my lizard brain want it...
  

I've had dozens of 'episodes' as we have settled on calling them, which all start with shivering that progresses to uncontrollable shaking, terrifying shortness of breath, and most dangerously, sudden, skyrocketing body temperature. My SO has monitored my O2 sats, which stay in the low 90s even as I gasp for air, and my temperature has gotten as high as 107, though 105 is a more normal peak. The shaking and gasping lasts for just about an hour, on the dot, then it takes 3-4 hours to get my core temperature back down with ice packs on my neck and chest. I haven't hallucinated or lost cognition - if I had I would be in inpatient treatment now.
  
So I thought I was out of the woods a couple days ago - after all it had been more than a week since I quit, and I went 36+ hours without having an episode. So of course I had two in four hours, then another two about 12 hours later.
  
It looks like I am going to be an outlier in terms of how long physical detox takes, but I know that every day, every hour, every minute moves me closer to freedom.",5,0

He's a top guy in breathing world, he has a course on breathing that counts as a credit for the NSCA (strength and conditioning)

So I was starting work on a big project which is a big trigger to have a few, right at the start of it, all this energy, and I go out to my recycling bin and my neighbor has been drinking my brand, I'm spinning, I patted my pocket like I was looking for my wallet, I go inside, and I'm like man I'm going to do those exercises for 20 minutes and I'll have a conversation with you again after that, Satan. And I did them as hard I could, for as long as I could.

\-

Inhale for 6 seconds.

Hold your breath for 6 seconds.

Exhale for 12 seconds.

Pause for 6 seconds.

2 minutes.

&#x200B;

Begin quick inhales and exhales (2-second inhales followed by immediate 2-second exhales).

Continue quick inhales and exhales for 2 minutes.

Take one big deep breath and hold it for 30 seconds to reset your system.

&#x200B;

Start up again at 1 and repeat the entire 6 steps.

\-

The first part is box breathing with long exhale, you could just do that one, and with 6 not 12 exhale. I did 10 seconds and 20 out, a few rounds of that and something inside like popped, it was over I was totally free of agitation. I didn't want to drink again. You can just modify the lengths to what you can handle.

Navy seals and your local police officer use 4 count box breathing to keep it together. I think I can keep me sober. Destress, make a better decision.

 Anyway, if I can do that every time, maybe I can stay sober, it's worth a shot. It's there for free any time, and it was the tips in that video that made it actually work when I've tried breathing before, I didn't use those tips and I didn't try box breathing, and that's a super box breathing modification.

Anyway if it helps one person.",7,0

I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll also want to go somewhere fancy for dinner for my birthday (which is on a Saturday). 

My parents, more my dad than my mom, are pretty big drinkers. Growing up it was my dad instead of my peers that got it in my head that the more you could drink and still be cool/functioning/smart/drive, the more impressive of a person you were. 

I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôve noticed me drinking less when we lived closer and I would see them once a week for dinner, but they don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm *not drinking*. They would probably be confused about why since by all visible accounts I‚Äôm a very successful young adult. 

But I‚Äôm getting worried about them being confused when they‚Äôre here about why I can‚Äôt ‚Äúenjoy my weekend‚Äù at the brewery or ‚Äúcelebrate my birthday‚Äù with a nice wine. They‚Äôll feel like I‚Äôm depriving myself for no reason. We went to a brewery on a sailing trip over the summer and I got some very confused looks/side eye when I just got water. 

I don‚Äôt want to have a big serious talk with them laying out my struggles. Currently if they‚Äôve made any random comments about it I say I‚Äôm on a fitness kick (which is true), but that doesn‚Äôt stand up well to ‚Äúhave a fancy wine just this one day on your birthday‚Äù.

Or if they get me some fancy booze as a gift, which is not at all improbable, and want to try some right then (my normal strategy when this happens is to re-gift). 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just journaling or asking for advice. Currently the plan is to go with ‚Äúfitness kick‚Äù, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt feel like drinking right now‚Äù, and if I get asked directly if I‚Äôm not drinking anymore to say ‚Äúnot really, my body just feels better‚Äù which has been my go-to.

I am so tired of being this person. Somehow I don't feel like I have the strength right now. I did this in the spring, 27 days, and last August, 27 days as well oddly. 

I want the charmed feeling of waking up in the morning with a spring in my step, eager to run walk laugh jump through the day. It doesn't help my Anti depressants are not supposed to be taken alongside alcohol so the numbing dread of every hungover morning is twice as awful. 

I started painting in the spring. I read so much. I saved so much money, finally building up enough to move out of my place with my ex, I watched so many sunrises and sunsets - I never see the sun rise or set much when life is a revolving wheel of drinking and working to make money to drink. I cooked every meal and searched the grocery store eagerly for sales, coming up with creative ideas and treasuring the experience of every meal..sometimes these days, I don't even eat; I don't remember to when I am so full of liquor. 

I am breaking my heart and destroying my quality of life. I am sobbing even typing this. I truly am destroying myself and it needs to stop now while I still have good things to live for.. I work until 10 tonight. Instead of going to the liquor store before work I am ordering myself a mass of edibles and food to come home to. 

Just for one night this cycle will break. Just for today, I will not drink with you.",18,0

There's been periods in my life when I was a daily drunk, periods when I abstained, and periods when I maintained a healthy relationship with alcohol (meaning I would have one or two social drinks a few times a week). But often I have been a binger: drnking excessively for a night, days, sometimes weeks in a row. And I have struggled with depression and anxiety most of that time. Here and there, all of that was exacerbated by occasional drug use. Weed mostly. But when I was young, psychedelics and the occasional coke or speed (though it's been decades). I don't have to tell anyone here how many bad decisions I made in these various intoxicated states or the shame connected to them. 

But here I am, in middle age, being honest with myself about my alcohol use and why I use it to numb, habitually, negative feelings. I have a kid and an estranged wife (who might become an ex) and despite years of therapy I think I am just now truly facing my shit honestly.

I used to just get wasted and watch movies and play video games, things you can easily do while drunk. 

Instead, I made sure to have things I want to do that would basically be impossible while drunk to fill up the time when I would otherwise be drinking. These are basically things you need to be mentally and physically sharp in order to accomplish them. So for me, that's reading books, working on writing my own book, jogging/weight lifting and learning difficult yoyo tricks (check out r/throwers if curious!). Having a set schedule with tasks that are rewarding and need me to be focused has helped immensely with any sort of cravings I would normally have. As the weeks have gone by this has become my new normal and it feels wonderful.

I hope this little tidbit helps someone out there with their sober journey, best of luck to everyone. Now on to month three! :)",158,0

Needless to say I was not handling it well. Resisted the urge to hit the liquor store successfully until about 7pm. Idle hands got me, just laying in bed pitying myself was not the best thing to do. The first glass of whiskey did actually mask the pain. That lasted for about an hour, then the emotions came rushing back. I tried to mine that vein with zero success until I went to bed. Fell asleep sad and drunk. I wish I hadn't done it, feel a little cloudy headed today, but another part of me is glad I did. Something I  think a lot of us already knew going into addiction was made apparent, there's no escape

 It's like those coaches that give their players oxy so they can play through an injury. Yeah, they'll play, but they are going to do some serious damage to their bodies. If I mask it, it'll get worse. Of course today I still feel lonely, anxious, angry(I really *would* like my Dave n' Busters card back, it's got like 15,000 tickets on it), but I also feel optimistic. Drinking ain't gonna do the trick, I knew it wasn't going to, and now I have my proof. Maybe just the idea of a way out was what was making me so needlessly miserable. Yesterday was a 10 on the fuck my life scale, now I'm down to about a 7.5.

2241,2020-10-08 10:20:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/j7dvx3/do_i_have_a_problem/,Do I have a problem?,"So i know how most addicts work from personal experience I‚Äôve had friends who have struggled with Substance abuse and relapsed and continue to feed their need, the thing is I‚Äôve seen how they operate and I don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôm an addict.

The addicts I know are the ones that are functional, they hold steady jobs, pay bills take care of loved ones they get shit done.

This is what I assume are the tolerable addicts, the ones that don‚Äôt fiend Don‚Äôt disappear don‚Äôt ask for money...  but they have a chunk of their own money dedicated to getting high

Now I bring this up because I drink, sometimes I drink a lot.. (what‚Äôs a lot to me?) If I don‚Äôt eat I can get drunk off 1 beer, if I‚Äôm out in a bar drink up to 6 beers and 2 mixed drinks to get drunk.. if I‚Äôm home I drink 4 24oz tall cans equivalent to 5 1/2 beers to me and I‚Äôm drunk enough to start grinning for no reason

while I know it‚Äôs taking a toll on my body I know my limits for example I go for months without drinking, in my opinion I don‚Äôt have an addictive personality but I do binge.. by that I mean when I do something I do a lot then I just lose interest  and  then I resume again. 

Now majority of you guys/girls will probably say well you drink more than you supposed to and you know you drink a lot....so you obviously need help, but then again I take what I know first hand about substance abuse and try to compare it to my own actions but I never see any similarities 

Yeah I know a sick mind can‚Äôt fix itself.. a person will always protect there identity because that‚Äôs how people are... self preservation 

I only drink beer... liquor is a no go for me, It has a ‚Äúcreeping up‚Äù that I do not like.. because you can be fine and then out of nowhere it just hits you, and I‚Äôm not able to calibrate if I‚Äôm drunk or just buzzed and to me that‚Äôs a no bueno..

 That‚Äôs why I only drink beer I know how many I beers I can drink to get drunk and how many I can drink before i have to throw up. Basically I know my limitations and I don‚Äôt exceed them all the time 

Now this is of course why I begin to think That maybe I have an issue..  I overthink everything and I assume that I‚Äôve somewhat picked apart what I know about addictions and disillusioned myself into doing the opposite I‚Äôm order to maintain the idea that I‚Äôm fine..  so here‚Äôs why I need some feedback 

now When I drink...depending on the occasion I either laugh a lot or get quiet (being quiet is the main one) 

 I  think the reason do that is because In my mind I‚Äôm always thinking, I‚Äôm always controlling myself, in a sense that I‚Äôve never wanted to be that person who gets out of line, starts being annoying or belligerent. I just want to enjoy being drunk and laugh.. I‚Äôve drank with all the kinds of drinkers

The talkers, the criers, the planners, the dancers, the ones who don‚Äôt know their  limits, the ones who don‚Äôt care and the aggressive ones (these I hate the most)   


Don‚Äôt get me wrong I hate buzzkills, and I don‚Äôt think people see me this way... I mean I‚Äôm always invited everywhere lol even though I never go... but I just enjoy being drunk quietly lol, I‚Äôve done a lot of exciting stuff, yeah people get a lot looser when the drink and I‚Äôve seen that and studied the behavior in my head lol 

all the adventures, clubs, food, jokes, memories I‚Äôve had while drinking are cool. But all those things I‚Äôve also enjoyed while being sober.

I‚Äôm the responsible person in my circle sometimes, I‚Äôm the one who makes sure you go inside your house before I leave, I‚Äôm the one who deescalates things or sometimes has to be the parent lol, I‚Äôve had times where I need someone to be with me while I puked, and I‚Äôve been the one that needs  a ride home.

All this being said, When I drink at home, my family doesn‚Äôt like it... not because I get out of hand but because they don‚Äôt like to see me drink a lot. And I get it.. but I‚Äôm in my room and I drink and watch tv, i only get up to go to the bathroom and grab another beer and this goes on until I finish all the beer I bought.. then I lay down and go on my phone and eventually fall asleep and wake up later.. Im constantly drink water a lot too, so when I grab a beer I grab a water, beer (alcohol) has diuretic properties  so hence why I‚Äôm always using the bathroom

The reason I drink is because I just enjoy it...I enjoy being drunk and watching movies and painting, and just sitting down.. I‚Äôm able to hold conversations, grasp ideas when I‚Äôm reading books, explain random shit to people. I don‚Äôt black out, I don‚Äôt get loud, and I don‚Äôt need it to enjoy peace and quiet. Again I do a lot of my best work sober.

The thing is that my family probably feels that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm up too.. that I‚Äôm an alcoholic.. that I need to always be drunk.. and it‚Äôs not true.. they‚Äôve pulled me aside and asked me to stop drinking completely and I‚Äôve always said no... because again I don‚Äôt feel like I have a problem.. I only drink at night and I only drink in my room...I don‚Äôt drink and drive.. if I want another beer I‚Äôll walk to the liquor or get postmates... but with all admission there has been times where I‚Äôve driven intoxicated to get home or to get beer and come back home... and for that I‚Äôm stupid...don‚Äôt drink and drive that shit isn‚Äôt okay.. people die and it‚Äôs irresponsible 

But with all that I feel like I‚Äôm fine.. But again this might be self preservation working",2,0

To make a long story short, I was a binge drinker from the minute I started drinking to the day I quit, which worsened in university thanks to drinking culture and ease of access. I ruined friendships, felt horrible, lost and dependent. In 2018 I met my now boyfriend, and he helped me quit by showing me how horrible i was when drinking and promising to quit with me. 

It was hard and scary at first. I felt like it wasn't fair that I couldn't participate and like something was wrong with me. Eventually though the feeling of wanting alcohol went away most of the time. Now I woukd say its gone 95% of the time. 

The biggest difference has been my mood and mindset!  I was SO moody before I stopped drinking. I literally coukd not control my anger and irritation, and I woild be rude to people and then cry about it later because I felt so out of control. Additionally, I didn't believe in myself because I couldn't control my drinking. I kept telling myself I would only have a bit and then failing, which obviously didn't do very much for my self confidence.

Now I just feel so much better all the time. I feel at peace, I am angry or irritable so much less and its much more controllable. I honestly feel like a different person when it comes to mood and mindset. Additionally, not drinking has allowed me to spend my time more productively and ive been really excelling at my career thanks to that. Even during covid I've felt pretty good.

Well, she slips on loose ground and falls on her back.

Now a week into hospital her L5 vertebrae is wrecked right around it, bulging discs, nerves firing all over her body as a compensation for the damage In her spine and she was lucky not to be in a wheelchair for life. If she had been running, not walking, then she would have been done for and resident of two wheels, not two legs.. The three months rehab for her will be home based (and guess who is her main carer... Me!)

And top this off our two kids rely on me, I have to cut back work hours now to care for my wife, I'm in a country where it's just ""oh well you'll be fine"" and well.. I took a breath today, a deep one.. and went..

Well, fuck it, this year is worse enough, why don't I just blackout drink and forget about it all.

But then I said to myself nah, I'll be waking up sick, hating myself , my two kids relying on me for breakfast in the morning and I'd let myself and my family down

So, I had a few glasses of water and now I'm in bed.

Nothing was worth getting drunk over, even this clusterfuck of a year.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It's Thrilling Thursday everyone!

Down in the Hundred Acre Wood amidst the green trees, and long grass and dense furze of the Ashdown Forest, you might find a ‚Äòhunny pot‚Äô or two, or a little house made of sticks, or a Heffalump trap and if you listen carefully you might hear a hum and if you follow the hum then the hum might lead to a bear and that bear might just be Winnie the Pooh.

When I was little my mum used to read to me at bedtime. Two of our favourite books were A.A. Milne's 'Winnie the Pooh' and 'The House at Pooh Corner'. Following on from yestderday's wisdoms I thought we could have a Winnie the Pooh themed DCI day!

Despite being written almost 100 years ago the stories of Winnie the Pooh and his friends at Hundred Acre Wood never seem to age and somehow have a magical ability to warm the hearts of children and adults alike.

Here we have a few quotes and poohisms to contemplate today:

‚ÄúWhen you wake up in the morning, Pooh,‚Äù said Piglet at last, ""what's the first thing you say to yourself?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat's for breakfast?‚Äù said Pooh. ""What do you say, Piglet?‚Äù
‚ÄúI say, I wonder what's going to happen exciting today?‚Äù said Piglet.
Pooh nodded thoughtfully. ""It's the same thing,‚Äù he said.

""Piglet noticed that even though he had a Very Small Heart, it could hold a rather large amount of Gratitude.""

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt underestimate the value of doing nothing, of just going along, listening to all the things you can‚Äôt hear, and not bothering.‚Äù

""I'm not lost for I know where I am. But however, where I am may be lost.""

‚ÄúJust because an animal is large, it doesn‚Äôt mean he doesn‚Äôt want kindness; however big Tigger seems to be, remember that he wants as much kindness as Roo.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe things that make me different are the things that make me.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf the person you are talking to doesn‚Äôt appear to be listening, be patient. It may simply be that he has a small piece of fluff in his ear.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can't stay in your corner of the Forest waiting for others to come to you. You have to go to them sometimes.‚Äù

In the early 80s a chap called Benjamin Hoff wrote a book called the Tao of Pooh which explains allegorically the Chinese philosophy of Taoism through the characters created by A.A. Milne. I remember reading this probably in my late teens or early 20's and it re-kindled all the joy and love I got from listening to the bedtime stories of my younger years and maybe taught me a thing or two about trying not to overthink things and to live life simply.

While Eeyore frets ... ... and Piglet hesitates ... and Rabbit calculates ... and Owl pontificates ...Pooh just is.

A few quotes from Hoff:

‚ÄúThe surest way to become Tense, Awkward, and Confused is to develop a mind that tries too hard - one that thinks too much.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere are things about ourselves that we need to get rid of; there are things we need to change. But at the same time, we do not need to be too desperate, too ruthless, too combative. Along the way to usefulness and happiness, many of those things will change themselves, and the others can be worked on as we go. The first thing we need to do is recognize and trust our own Inner Nature, and not lose sight of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can't save time. You can only spend it, but you can spend it wisely or foolishly.‚Äù

‚ÄúA way of life that keeps saying 'Around the next corner, above the next step,' works against the natural order of things and makes it so difficult to be happy and good.‚Äù

For a bear of 'very little brain' Winnie the Pooh had an amazingly balanced attitude to life!

I‚Äôve been having this sharp pain when I inhale and I‚Äôm more tired than usual - which I‚Äôve been associating with awful air quality, but I ended up getting a Covid test just in case. Got a flu shot while I was at it. If that ends up coming back positive, at least I haven‚Äôt drank! Can‚Äôt imagine covid paired with a hangover or withdrawals.

It‚Äôs my second time quitting since realizing alcohol had become a problem in my life. The first time began in August for a month. 

I‚Äôm feeling good and realizing I‚Äôm not actually having nearly as many cravings this time around. I really feel like I‚Äôve properly jumped back into the routine that I had going for me the first time around.

I did have cravings for the first three days and then it sort of went and hasn‚Äôt returned. It definitely hadn‚Äôt been this ‚Äúeasy‚Äù my first week in August. Hell, even the month.

I already pushed through a social setting where I was the only one not drinking on day three. I can keep powering through weekends, even with get togethers like that. I just... I really don‚Äôt want to drink. I don‚Äôt feel that itch for a buzz anymore. 

I‚Äôm trying not to let that get to my head too much, though. I know weekends may very well bring that urge for me and I know that I may randomly find myself in circumstances where I WANT to say yes to a drink.

But I‚Äôm really going to work on pushing through even harder this time - as far and long as I can go. Just one day at a time. Nothing like a deadline looming nearer to sway me.

Well, thanks for reading my thoughts. I think it helps me to write it out sometimes.

I hope you‚Äôre all staying strong and doing well! Keep it up.

To be honest,  every day passed 24 hours is a day I didn‚Äôt think I could be sober.  I‚Äôm super proud I‚Äôve endured this pandemic sober.  I was sad when I was near the 1 year mark.  I kept looking at my story and I didn‚Äôt have the things that people talk about in meetings within the year.  I didn‚Äôt have a 6 figure job, I didn‚Äôt have my credit cards paid off, we are still renting our home.  I was really feeling sad.  And I took the day to clean out my otherwise filthy mini van and try and collect my thoughts.   That night I was lying in bed reading the news and I started getting new breaks that there was a shooting in on the Strip.   I immediately got out of bed.  I was simultaneously getting dressed, going pee, and connecting with strangers on the internet.  My husband said ‚Äúwhat are you doing?‚Äù  Me:  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know but I‚Äôve got to help.‚Äù  A woman posted on Facebook that she had 6 friends stuck near the airport who were at the concert and there were no cabs or a way for them to safely get out of there.  I had the space for them and I had listened to my intuition and cleaned my car.  I‚Äôve lived here my whole life and I don‚Äôt live far from the airport.  I was able to navigate surface streets (sometimes going the wrong way) to get to where they were at.   The day 1 took my 1 year token I had taken donations and food to a hospital where the victims families where at.  None of those things I could have done if I were drinking.  I was able to be of service because I was sober.   Today,  I did my grandma‚Äôs grocery shopping since she is in an assisted living home and can‚Äôt leave because of Covid.  My blessing of sobriety may not be monetary.  But I‚Äôm here and I‚Äôm doing what I can for other people.  I‚Äôm here for my family and my kids.

I thought I was a ""light"" drinker, but 5 beers every Friday and Saturday and one or two every other night turns out to be not that light, especially as a pretty short lady. My doctor said quitting cold turkey likely won't introduce any physical risks because the amount is so low during the week but I underestimated how much I would want a beer right now. I thought this would be easy. 

 I'm sitting in a bath with a wine glass full of peach juice realizing how much I want a beer right now. I would only be having one tonight on a normal day, and even not having that is SO HARD.

After a month or so on the medicine I will know if I can reintroduce alcohol again. I can't go back. I can't become a daily drinker again. I never thought I had a problem... But I can't stop thinking about the beers in the fridge, the rum in the freezer, and the wine on the shelf. 

I don't have to deal with the physical addiction, I dont have to worry about withdrawal, but it's still so hard. I want to make a lasting change, I know I will be happer, I never want to be in this position again. So I'm here! Hello everyone, I will not drink with you tonight.",13,0

Intermittent lurker here. I'm on Day 9. Over a week! I hope this is OK but I just wanted to type out of a list of the wins and the challenges I'm experiencing today.

Wins:

I'm on-call at work and I'm not worried I will be called for an emergency while intoxicated.

I took my wife out, was present, and even drove us home without fear.

No black outs. No guilt. No saying hurtful things to the people I care about.

I'm not damaging my health tonight. My body is probably repairing some of the damage I have caused it with my abuse.

I'm coherent. I've had a lot of time to really think about myself, my life, and the people I share it with. The self-examination can be painful. I'm not sure I like what I see but at least I'm looking. At least I'm here and I'm in control again.

Challenges:

Cravings daily around 4-8 PM. I try to eat dinner and distract myself. If it gets bad, I will go for a walk, drive to grab some soft drinks, or take a shower.

Constant anxiety. Waves of depression. Old obsessive thoughts about food, body issues, intrapersonal relationships are showing up. I feel tempted to fall back on other unhealthy compulsions sometimes.

Unproductive at work. I'm trying and the brain-fog is better than last week. I still feel very lethargic and apathetic since day 1. Trying to give myself small goals to achieve but also to be kind to myself. Overall, not drinking will make me a better employee. Even if I have some slow days I'm the beginning.

I worry that my marriage won't be the same since we went out so often together. She still drinks moderately and keeps it in the house. There is a drinking culture in the family. I made my goals clear and she is being very supportive.",8,0

After only a week I feel more engaged with the world around me, and im excited to keep going! I thought the cravings might be difficult but the newfound happiness ive gained makes it a non issue.

 I'm thinking of not drinking until Christmas now, maybe even be teetotal? I'm not sure yet, I enjoy drinking when its few and far between so maybe only a couple drinks a month. Still something I'm in the process of working out. Regardless, im thankful for this supportive, positive community.

I steal glances, settle for a quick once overs. I‚Äôve never had a clear sense of self, always struggled with my self-esteem. My emotional ebbs and flows are out of my control and my mood fluctuates by the hour. I live minute to minute and have long abandoned the idea of permanent. Below the surface I‚Äôm braving moment to moment seismic shifts. I have no clear source, no point of origin, no tracible epicenter. My reflection is a game of Russian roulette that I‚Äôm not drunk enough to play. 

I‚Äôm the Bermuda triangle, a place with no clear boundaries and an even vaguer history. Who I am, is an unsolved mystery, my identity a myth. Sometimes ill convince myself It‚Äôs a mistake, a mutation that shouldn‚Äôt exist. I can‚Äôt trust my own judgement because idont know whats real. Mirror mirror on the wall who is the shittest of them all?  Ships swallowed by the sea cant be a real thing. It sounds like fiction, an out of this world phenomena that isn't based in science. The legend of the Bermuda triangle wasn‚Äôt the product of observable, reliable, and valid scientific study. I can‚Äôt point to it on a map because it isn‚Äôt place. Nothing separates from its surroundings. It belongs to no nation; claimed by no culture. Its an idea, a vague groundless rumor that has run away with truth. It has no pattern or distinguishable pieces.  The directions to it change depending on who you‚Äôre asking, their interpretation of the best way home. Ever reiteration a shadow cast by reality. Its whatever you want it to be, it‚Äôs a dangerous place you don‚Äôt dare venture, or its just water. It is what you think it is, as real as you want it to be. 

For a long time I was whatever the world said I was. I was a mirror, a life-sized mood ring responding to changes in temperature. Younger me was a chameleon who clung to the most interesting people in the room. She was desperate for someone to deem her good enough, pretty enough, or just enough. I always felt like a foreigner. That I somehow didn‚Äôt belong. That I had to earn the right to call myself a person. I cant help but feel like a liar, an imposter in my own skin. I‚Äôve never truly belonged to anyone or anything because im a fake. I‚Äôm the bootlegger pedaling poor imitations, with a knock off notion of the person I pretend to be. Now sober, a former con artist with nine lives, a masked trickster in a world that trusts me. At my worst, I needed people to need me, and wanted them to want me. My body was my number one enemy, and my mind the weapon of mass destruction. Alcohol was the poison, the thing that let me forget. The thing stopped the feeling. There is nothing you could say to me I haven‚Äôt heard a million times before, no one who could hate me like I‚Äôve hated myself. My thoughts are hostile and merciless. They are loud and vicious, terrorists that held my hostage.

 My maladaptive coping mechanisms were tactical decisions, my poor choices the maneuvers I used to gain the advantage. I was a general addressing his troops, a drill sergeant training the person out of the solider. What I had become was the target, a threat to be neutralized. The disappointment in myself, dreams of the life that could have been, the people I barreled through in the blind desire to get drunk, and the person I knew I was, was too much to bare. A nightmare I couldn‚Äôt wake up from. Ive been fighting with my appearance my entire life. AT war with myself as far back as I can remember. The way I looked has brought me great power, and it robbed me blind. It has been a form of currency or the current dragging me under. The hate I have for my body has always been standing between me and happiness.  It was a frontier to be conquered, a wild that wouldn‚Äôt listen. 

The disconnect between my physical form and my inner world is my mental illness. The separation of the self from what I see, my means of survival. My rock bottoms are moments I looked in the mirror. The ones where I would stare down my reflection. The unflinching unadulterated, no filter, reality. My eating disorder left me utterly devastated, as I pinched and puled all the places I was unlovable.  I would spend hours, picking myself apart, auditing my flaws. I would study every angle, make sure I was putting my prettiest foot forward. I would be pure. Cleanse myself of my wickedness, pay for the sin of being human. I was powerful when I was perfect, wanted when men wanted me, at peace when women wanted to be me. Drinking mad me fat which in my fucked up language translated to nothing.  The hangovers that left marks had me shackled to the toilet and bed ridden. I clutch the sink, eyes filled with hate and disappointment. Let the shame wash over me in the harshness of the light. Stand still and let the truth bleed me dry. What I saw looking back; death by a thousand cuts. I was the bloated toad with hooded eyes and greasy green skin. The thing that had crawled out of hiding, hadn‚Äôt showered in days, surrounded by bottles, cans, McDonalds, and boxes of pizza.

Five years sober and I don‚Äôt recognize myself in photos. That person wasn‚Äôt me. The decision to quit the first step on shore, after years lost at sea. I wouldn‚Äôt change a day of it. Alcoholism made me who I am. It‚Äôs the feeling of pealing down the driveway, stretching your legs at the old stomping ground. Its coming home. Your eyes well but your smile stays. Happy and sad all at once. A reunion, A welcome sight, a piece of your past exactly as you left it.  You didn‚Äôt consent to growing up, life had you moved out and moved on before you could appreciate it. Im not ashamed of my past because I know It wasn‚Äôt my fault. Nothing is beyond repair. No such thing as born broken. Drinking was the only way I knew how stop the hurt, and it made sense then. Life is gut punches, getting up, and going again.

Up until about six months ago (when lockdown began in my country), my drinking was not out of control. I only drank socially, and never (since my teens 7 years ago) drank more than I had originally planned. I never, ever drank alone (except for literally a beer once or twice, and even then,) and there were never warning signs. 
Since lockdown began, I've been having serious issues sleeping. For the last ~5 months, I've been drinking myself to sleep every night. I want to quit, and I've already promised my wife that from next week I'm not buying any more booze, but I'm honestly fucking terrified that I'll be lying awake for hours.

I have for a long ass time had this feeling that this love for alcohol is a dangerous game. A part of me doesn't care because everything is going great and has been for many (10+) years. Another part of me acknowledges that I love alcohol too much to imagine a few months without it. Who am I really without it? I  **like** myself so much more drunk. I'm enjoying everything **SO MUCH MORE.** Is this an illusion as it is to many? No, all the external sources I can think of would agree with this, so why even change?  Can I deal with a sober weekend without feeling like I have completely wasted a good buzzed weekend to prove something to myself? Deep down inside, I know I don't want to have to rely on alcohol for anything. A sober weekend should not be worse than a drunk one. But I haven't had a sober weekend for, maybe 5 years.

Look, I know the majority of you out there deal with bigger alcohol related issues than me. I bet its more interesting to read the juicy posts of people where their problems are more dramatic. But I need your comments and insight.

I mean government organisations. 

I have a long history of rehab and relapse etc. I have been trying to engage with my local alcohol support centre to arrange a home detox. Would love an in patient one but their budget is at a level where you literally have to be dying to be considered. That's shit but I understand. 

Where I am frustrated is I contacted them a month ago and have had one conversation just to register me. Since then I have been chasing and had nothing back but a text 2 days ago which essentially said we see no point in detoxing you because you have a long case history and will probably just relapse. I asked what they suggest, was told I would get a call, no call. Was promised a call today, get a text at 5.20 saying sorry we were busy but will call you tomorrow... I dont want to be cynical but the call is inevitably going to be a  5 minute well you are beyond our help spend the money you dont have on counselling. We can offer a weekly zoom meeting like that will help at all. 

It's just frustrating when I want to change, am doing my best on my own but the supposed support out there treats me as waste of time. It's more annoying that I know people who are 'struggling with lockdown' and drinking a couple of glasses of wine a night who are getting support and think I will get the same helpful attitude, but me fucking waking up every 4 hours shaking for a drink am apparently not worth the effort.

I've been thinking about this milestone for a while and what insights I wanted to share. None of them are very good, more of a stream of consciousness, and my immediate instinct is to delete each paragraph as soon as it's written and remove the whole draft. But you never know who you can help with the small gestures, so here's mine.  

I never perceived myself as a problem drinker (I know, I know). I had never gotten into trouble with my alcohol consumption beyond normal college shenanigans. No DUIs, no lost jobs, no relationship troubles. A couple drinks during the week, a couple too many drinks on the weekend, rinse, repeat. What most people would probably consider being a normal consumer. 

Late last year, I decided to quit drinking in preparation for an ultrarace. At the time of my decision to climb on the wagon, I was about two months away from race day. No biggie! I timed it so I was coming back from vacation the day I would start drying out. So the journey started. I had always taken the cold turkey approach regarding habit breaking and this was no different. 

The race came and went, but a funny thing happened - I didn't immediately go find my complimentary beer at the finish line. I told myself I was too tired, or I can have a few with the family once I'm home (it was a long drive). But I didn't do that either, I went straight to bed. I think Race Day +1 was revelatory for me in the sense of 'If I quit drinking so I could be my best, why would I pick it up again?' 

That's when I made my decision to ride this out. I knew Reddit would have some answers so I immediately started poking around and found this community. I subscribed to some podcasts and checked out recovery literature (Annie Grace from my local library). I bought into the IWNDWYT culture and lurked on here for inspiration and community. As I haven't contributed much since joining, here's a few thoughts from the experience: 

1) Title - Don't Wait for Rock Bottom  
First and foremost, the title. /r/stopdrinking is a fantastic, diverse, and supportive community, and I have read and empathized deeply into the love and exchange of ideas of support here. I am a lurker by nature and, apart from the random 'Good job!' I don't post much, if anything. I feel that part of this is a bit of impostor syndrome. Many of the top posts and recovery stories are from people who have reached a breaking point after finally losing their last dollar/relationship/job/et al. These are harrowing and humbling to read, but they weren't me. I felt like a tourist. I didn't really relate to much of the posters, so should I even be here? 
  
The truth is, if you spend five minutes browsing here, this community welcomes everyone committed to its mission with open arms. You don't need a headline story to quit drinking. Janey Lee Grace explores this idea on her Alcohol Free Life podcast in that alcoholism is not black and white. You can be sober or you can be pissing on yourself laying in a gutter, but there is also everything in between. Abuse and problematic behavior is a complete spectrum, and so many people tell themselves that if they are not A then they are B, disregarding all 24 other letters (or other measurement depending on your preferred analogy). 

The point is this: You can change your behavior before the warning signs. If the check engine light comes on, it's time to see the mechanic. If you never see your check engine light come on, you're probably pretty good about regular upkeep and service. You don't have to wait for the light. I am very lucky I didn't wait for a headline. For those of you lurking or sober-curious, I'm right there with you. Give it a try and see how it goes. 

2) Not Drinking is a Super Power  
I'm serious. I was pretty aware of how much American culture revolves around drinking, but going sober is like putting the glasses on in They Live! Holy crap, everything is about drinking or preparing to drink or recovering from drinking or getting in the mood to drink. Going sober gives you Spidey-senses of how focused every stimulus around you is centered on your consumption. Swimming against this grain is no small feat, and yes, that gives you superpowers in a couple ways. 

a) Spidey-Senses. As mentioned above, when you go sober you become hyperaware of the drinking and consuming around you. Every happy hour, every brunch, every virtual gathering, it's all done with the promise of alcohol consumption. For those who can handle being in the presence of this and remaining sober, it's incredible to behold. But it's also strengthing. As any sober person can attest, nothing will make you want to give up alcohol more than being the sober one around drunk people. They're ridiculous. No self-awareness, completely shameless, and a constant danger to themselves and others. They've given up most of their night and a good portion of their morning in service of alcohol and to worship at the altar of porcelain. But not you. You've got superpowers. On that note...

b) Time Manipulation. I'm serious, you are now Dr. Strange: Time Bandit. You now experience every second of every minute of every hour of every day. People who drink around you are time travelers. Most of us have experienced going from 10pm to 11am (plus a headache) in the blink of an eye. Not you, not anymore. You are in the moment. What's more, you have your senses. Want to drive? Go ahead. Read? Lines aren't blurred! Watch a movie? Yes Netflix, I'm still here, not drooling on my couch. When you stop drinking you slow down time and you are conscious of everything around you. The next time you're at a bar you'll be surrounded by people traveling through their evening at warp speed with the future hangover to prove it, but not you. You are Neo. Amazing. 

3) It Gets Easier But It's Never Easy  
I'll be honest, the difference between Day 9 and Day 209, for me, was minuscule. Just another day with one less thing to think/worry about. But holy crap, at 4:45 pm on a random Friday in September, I found myself craving a beer. I couldn't think about anything else. Same as 11am on a Sunday in February. Or 7pm on a Tuesday in May. In the macro, it's a coast. Days and weeks go by and my counter keeps going up. But in the micro, every now and again, I just want a drink, man.

I think there are a couple of ways to approach this. First and foremost, this is not a seminary and we are not divinity students where sanctity and purity are required for membership. We are all on a journey together with a common goal of healthier lifestyles, and I think we agree that an alcohol-free approach is a priority to achieving this. But we are fallible humans and we make mistakes. I don't think having a drink or a relapse makes you a failure or is some moral repudiation. I have seen a lot of posts (more in recent weeks) about people drinking on vacation and immediately regretting it, but also posts about having a drink and it not being the end of the world. I think these need to be elevated as snapshots and timestamps along each of our journeys. I have yet to see a post where someone drank and was happier for it.

My point is having a drink is not the end of the world, if only because it may help you recognize how glad you are that you left or are leaving that behind. The guilt people feel over breaking the alcohol-celibacy is heartbreaking, but I implore everyone to not view a lapse as a sign of weakness, failure, or anything other than the next step. And if your journey includes a drink here and there, that is perfectly fine too. This is a community for controlling our habits, not issuing scarlet letters to others. I think everyone has a valuable and diverse experience to share, do not feel anything you've done (or will do) invalidates that. 

Conclusion  
These are the unorganized ramblings of a quarantined lunatic, but if they encourage at least one person to get on the wagon for a little while who wouldn't have otherwise, I'll count it as a net positive. It is amazing how much I don't miss drinking. 

But I'm also a hypocrite. Will I ever drink again? Probably. Will I drink at the level I did before this past year? Absolutely not. As 'unproblematic' as my drinking was before, anything I partake in moving forward will be a fraction of what it was, and for that I'm eternally grateful to this community and those much braver than I.  
  
Anyways, that's my journey, which I'm still on. I'd invite any other lurkers or sober-curious people to start their own. There's no right or wrong way to begin or continue, just be kind to that face in the mirror and remember that every minute of every day is another chance for future-you to write present-you a Thank You letter. This post is my Thank You letter to myself a year ago for making a change. Commit to yourself and take the first step.

Mainly, I guess I've been thinking a lot about how 1) For the first time ever, in over 20 years of drinking, I am going to hit 1 year sober (I'm at almost 300 Days so far, but my old record was a month. I've made it through my first vacation sober, a move to a state that I'd never been to before sober, several months not working due to the pandemic sober. I'm home alone all day right now not working and am sober! I'm serious - I am going to get to 1 year : ) Anyway, it weighs on my mind sometimes, though, because I'm wondering...is it going to be harder to stay motivated after I hit a year sober? I feel like it will be for me... I wonder too like, I see so many great posts that are like ""Hey I made it through Day 1"" ""I made it 30 Days"" And then 60 Days, 90 Days, some posts about 6 months, then a year, but then after that...I don't see posts like ""Hey I'm 1 year and 30 Days Sober""!!!!!! I just feel like there is way less celebrating involved after a year, I guess. No matter what, I know this is the most supportive place online ever, milestones or no milestones, and I am so grateful for this sub because it is truly what has helped me get to this point - I read the posts here everyday - but I just genuinely wonder if people do find sobriety harder after a year, without all the fanfare and milestones? I feel like, even though we're all doing this for ourselves, I feel like you probably just have to kinda tap into that as a reminder a little more? And not focus on the days so much?

Yesterday I got to celebrate my first sobriety birthday! It was really simple, but I got to spend time with my partner painting pottery and eating cake. 

A year ago, I assumed I would never be genuinely happy. I was trying so hard to keep up the lie that I had everything together. When in reality, I was just drinking to curb my anxiety so that I could live up to what I thought the people in my life expected of me. My health was terrible and while I would have what I assumed to be deep and meaningful conversations, they never were (when you're the drunk chick at a party, no one really remembers what you said). 

Within a month of becoming sober, I had to deal with a breakup, an intervention from family where they were all drinking, moving in the middle of winter, and attending a secular AA meeting for the first time (which is terrifying, but worth it). I'm really glad I made it through those situations without drinking, even though they were really scary. 

For day 366, I'm remembering what it was like before I became sober so I don't get stagnant, being thankful for the progress I've made so far (especially my improving health and relationships), and hopeful that my Zoom AA meetings become physical meetings again in the future. I truly miss my sober family and am forever thankful for a space where I feel safe to talk about when I'm just not okay ‚ù§Ô∏è",22,0

I want to thank everyone in this group, the long time sober people, those just getting started and those who have shared their struggles. It helps so much to have a place to turn to where everyone is fighting the same thing as me. Long timers give me hope of where I can be, newcomers help me never forget where I was and relapses help me remember where I don‚Äôt want to be again. 

That all being said, I made it to a year! Me! The guy who used to get really drunk and do stupid things! 

One of the best things about it  is that my journey is far from over. I‚Äôm never not going to be an alcoholic. I have to stay on guard and keep working on myself. It‚Äôs not always easy but the rewards are more bountiful than I can describe. 

Today is just as special to me as yesterday was. I‚Äôm living the way I want to and should. I am a better father/husband/son/person and I owe it all to my sobriety. AA helped me immensely see how it was my thinking, not just my drinking that was putting me back in an unending cyclone of pain and misery. It gave me a legion of local support and more friends than I have probably ever had. A guy who was at my first meeting reminded me of the fear I had when I started (I made my friend open the door I was too scared!) and I now know it was the gift of desperation that led to my transformation. 

I don‚Äôt miss anything about drinking lately. Everything I thought it did for me that I used to justify my drinking (relax me, make me better socially, help me have fun, fit in, help me sleep, etc etc) well all of that is better now without it. 

If they had told me I could take a pill that would make me happier, lose weight, not die of liver failure, save money and make my family happier with me, I would‚Äôve taken ten. But alas, we have to do the work, change the things we can and accept and let go the things we can‚Äôt. 

If you‚Äôre new to sobriety, just keep going and ask for help, be open and the rewards will come! I thought I could stop with work, but I never thought I would be so happy.

On March 21, I decided to quit drinking after a particularly nasty bender. I didn‚Äôt quit the right way, however, and ended up taking myself to the ER to get checked when I started hallucinating. Doctor said I was beginning to experience mild alcohol withdrawal, so he admitted me. That began a three-day stretch of DT hell.

It was like I was in another dimension that was overtaking reality. It was hell. 

I had an ultrasound and blood tests done. I had elevated liver enzymes and the beginnings of a fatty liver. My PCP told me to cut the booze to give my liver a chance to recover. I told myself I didn‚Äôt want to experience the hell that I did in the hospital.

Lots of day ones, false starts, worries, fear, self-loathing, loss, and on and on it goes, just like so many other stories on here. 

About a year and one week ago, I was telling a friend how unhappy I was. When she asked me why I wanted to be happy, I said, ""Because I care about myself."" She put her hand on my shoulder and said, ""Please don't take this the wrong way, but do you have any evidence of that? So many people care about you, but I'm not sure you're one of them. You should be, but are you? Do you really believe that?"" 

I hesitated, and the hesitation made it painfully clear that the answer was no. Talk was cheap. It was a small thing, but it was enough for me to try again. I didn't set out to be sober, I set out to build one day without alcohol, and to find out whether I actually cared about myself. It was enough to start. 

She helped me more than she knew. And over the year, 
I've done my part, but you have also been a huge part of it. Maybe I could have done it without this group, but I have no reason to think I would have. 

If you're struggling, please know that sobriety is worth it, and so are you. When it's hard, it doesn't mean you're doing it wrong, it just means that life can be a brutal business and alcohol amplifies and distorts it. If you're here, listening, reading, and telling your stories, you're helping people like me. And you may never hear from the people you help the most. It doesn't mean that they're not there. 

You deserve all the love in the world. Most importantly, from yourself. Please start today if you're wondering. Please keep going if you're already on a roll. Treat yourself as if you care. And if you feel like no one does, I care about you, and so do other people here. The people in this group have given me the best shot at the only thing I've ever wanted: a chance at a normal life with no alcohol.

For the last few years I've never missed drinking once or twice every week. Sometimes more then 10 big cans of beers at a time, I'm a fast drinker too. And spending time with friends and not drinking just isn't a thing anymore.

This spring something happened. A parent of mine got diagnosed with cancer, the kind that you just can't fix. I was devastated, angry and most of all worried for how stressed and how scared my parent experiencing this awful thing must feel. Everything I had postponed out of fear through the years feels wasted, suddenly things can't be brushed under my rug and handled at a later date.

In all of this mess, I woke up one day feeling dizzy after drinking, but it was different, my legs buckled, I had balance problems and could hardly walk. This lasted for weeks until I got an MRI that was fine so I was diagnosed with stress related nausea and balance issues. 

I had apparently spent years not dealing with my real problems and my parents cancer diagnosis was the last straw, I couldn't even see it coming since I was used to ""cope"" with stuff, but my body and mind just said that's enough, this can't go on and I kind of just broke.

Since then I've been relearning my balance, thinking about what matters in life and facing the fact that I'm tired, and I want to live now. Not later. Things backfired. I went out and did stupid shit I can't remember, spent money I don't have, and hurt people close to me in my anger and mostly lack of caring about myself and my consequences. 

This weekend I drank and I felt like I was dying the day after, all my nausea and balance problems got worse, I had bad blood flow in my hands and legs, shaking. I just can't drink anymore. It feels like poison to my body and soul, and I want it to stop.

I appreciate anyone reading through all of this, I want to be sober this weekend and spend time with family and friends not feeling like I'm sick. It's hard and I feel the cravings already, to just give in and drink to not feel sad and scared for a while. I want to get better, saying it out loud might help so I decided to post here finally. I appreciate any advice or suggestions, the sun is always out, right now the sky is just filled with clouds..

Thanks for a great community. I wish everyone here all the best.",14,0

So I'm confident I don't have a problem at the moment- I drink less than once a month and it is generally either while on vacation or one or two drinks for a special occasion. I'm completely in control of how much I drink, have never needed anything the next day or even had a noticeable hangover, and can drop it indefinitely. I'm a happy drunk and aside from one time riding my bike home when mildly buzzed because I had no other option I've never done anything worse than mild embarrassment. I'm the same way as far as control with caffeine and going off prescriptions, low-dose opioids included. 

However, there are a few warning signs. First, I am 17. Second, when I do have more than one drink it's a conscious decision in order to get my mind off of the things it sticks to with mental illness. Third (which is what spurred this), I took the audit test and got an 8 because when I do have more than one thing I tend not to choose moderation. I've never blacked out, but I have gotten to the point where my gross motor control is noticeably impaired. 4 of those points were due to a friend who believes any alcohol use is bad and my family thinking I had too much one night on vacation. 

I'm aware I sound ridiculous, but as a principle these sorts of things probably aren't good to brush off if I'm thinking about them. What should I look out for in terms of signs that I'm developing an actual problem?",2,0

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!



**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It's Whimsical Wednesday again SD folks!

Guess who's back, back again,
Badgebot's back, tell a friend...

A little while back I subscribed to Disney+ so I could watch Hamilton, my intention being I would cancel the subscription after a month was up. It appears my three year old daughter, my thirteen year old daughter and now my wife have other ideas!

Currently, when I return home from work, my youngest daughter comes to find me, tells me she's missed me today and then gets me to sit down with her on the sofa so we can watch another Disney movie together! It started off with Frozen II where I learnt where ""The next right thing"" comes from. Since then I've been paying close attention to the wisdoms offered up to us through the various characters in these movies. As I quite like making lists and I know how much us SD folk like a good inspirational quote I thought I would share a few with you all:


**Merida** (Brave) ""Our fate lives in us. You only have to be brave enough to see it.""


**Gusteau** (Ratatouille) ""If you focus on what you left behind, you will never be able to see what lies ahead.""


**The Emperor of China** (Mulan) ""The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all.""


**Master Shifu** (Kung Fu Panda) ""Anything is possible when you have inner peace.""


**Rapunzel** (Tangled) ""Venture outside your comfort zone, the rewards are worth it.""


**Edna Mode** (The Incredibles) ""I never look back darling. It distracts from the now.""


**Alice** (Alice in wonderland) ""I can't go back to yesterday because I was a different person then.""


**Rafiki** (The Lion King) ""The past can hurt. But, the way I see it, you can either run from it... or learn from it.""


**Quasimodo** (The Hunchback of Notre Dame) ""Today is a good day to try.""


**Joy** (Inside Out) ""All right everyone, fresh start! We're gonna have a good day, which will turn into a good week, which will turn into a good year, which will turn into a good life!""


**Rapunzel** (Tangled) ‚ÄúFor like the first time ever, I'm completely free!, I could go running, And racing, And dancing, And chasing, And leaping, And bounding, Hair flying, Heart pounding, And splashing, And reeling, And finally feeling, Now‚Äôs when my life begins!‚Äù


**Dory** ‚ÄúWhen life gets you down, do you wanna know what you‚Äôve gotta do? Just keep swimming.‚Äù (This is my favourite, I love Dory!)


Have a fab day everyone. I will not drink with you today.

the morning of my relapse started very frustrating, i just arrived at the gym and got a call from my girlfriend that i needed to come home because the toilet was leaking water through the ceilining of the neighbours below me. i got super mad because i had just had a completely new bathroom installed for 30k last year because of the same excact problem. so i rushed home and didnt get to do my workout, wich is pretty much te only thing keeping me sane and keeping me from drinking. turns out it wasnt really that bad and the problem got fixed in like 2 hours, but i already f'ed up my morning so i decided that this would be the day i would relapse, even though it was a minor setback and got fixed pretty quick i still wanted to use it as an excuse to drink. 

so i went to a friend, who lives in another city here in the netherlands, traveled by train, i already got drunk in the train and by the time that i arrived at his place i felt like complete shit, he was sober and didnt drink the whole time i was there, and i couldnt even realy connect or chill with him because i was drunk and feeling shitty because of the relapse. after a few hours i went back home and the next morning (today) i felt super guilty and hungover when i woke up. 
i sent the friend my apologies right away and told him i would come over sober the next time.
i realise now that i didnt enjoy one second of the relapse and thats a good motivation to stay sober forever now but i am very nervous to start at day 1 again and having to tell that at my next AA meeting :(  i guess the lesson i should learn from this is relapsing is only gonna make things worse and i wont enjoy any of it. my next goal is to stay sober for at least a year and i will make sure i wont relapse again.

I decided to go for 30 and that journey was so good I kept on going. When I committed to 30 it scared the shit out of me. And day after day things got better, way better than I ever could have imagined. 

I used to dread mornings and now I relish rising early, enjoying my coffee and a clear head.

My guts are so, so much happier. 

My emotions used to manage me, now I manage them. I feel all the feels, and I'm good with that.

I have embraced passions that are healthy for me: cooking new things, reading, writing, wood working projects, drawing and of course spending quality time with the dogs.

My partner drastically cut down his drinking, and now helps me hunt down tasty NA beers and fun tasty seltzer waters which he enjoys with me. Our relationship is stronger for it. 

My energy level is astounding. I'm 41 and have more motivation than I ever did in all of my 30s. Sometimes I have to remind myself that I don't have to do all the things all at once, that relaxing is valid and in fact necessary for me. 

I had been lurking here for a bit before the morning that I made my decision. I was and still am floored by the kindness, compassion and love this community is filled with. I took someones recommendation and picked up This Naked Mind, by far the best $14 bucks I've ever spent. I was completely skeptical when I began reading it and I still marvel at what a huge impact it has had on me. I am quite thankful for that.

The day I decided I'd had enough seems so far away, and just yesterday all in one. Sometimes I still want to escape, but now I have enough perspective to recognize that for what it is. To ask myself, ""what the hell are you escaping from? Is it worth feeling like a bag of ass when you eventually have to face reality for a bit?"" Because when I drank I didn't want just one or two, if I drink I'm going to drink them all, so I choose none. None is the perfect amount for me. 

So today I celebrate sixty, grateful for the space to share that celebration here with you awesome people!!

I was running on about 4 hours of sleep over 3 days, and on a bit of a bender. That kickstarted some coocoo in my cocoa puffs. 

Then the next 4 days after that I didn‚Äôt sleep at all, but luckily I didn‚Äôt drink. My folks drove me to the ER. I was hearing things by then and everything looked like a setup. I was also convinced that people were outside my house and on my roof, watching my family. I thought I had to compromise by going to the ER to die so they could live. I thought at the ER they were going to inject me with COVID and throw my body somewhere. 

I ended up getting 5250‚Äôd, released after 4 days for good behavior because luckily I got my brain back. I‚Äôm on a pretty good med regimen, not drinking, going to therapy, and attending some online meetings. 

Been having some annoying cravings but I‚Äôve just been eating a lot and meditating instead. Never had cravings like this (I‚Äôm more of an occasional binger) and it‚Äôs odd they‚Äôre happening after I just experienced THAT lol.

Both his parents were bad alcoholics. Seizures, not working, diabetes (alcohol kind not sugar kind), spending all money on booze, no food, lost their house, homeless, etc. He doesn't think he has a problem because his life doesn't look like that. But he also knows it's a problem because he wanted to take a break, scared he'd detox, etc.

And it's so hard. I try and gently as possible point out the flawed logic or things that aren't right. Worried about detoxing but definitely not a problem? Fourth whiskey on a Tuesday after a week or two of solid drinking. Stress=drink. Sad=drink. Worried=drink. Happy=drink. Grieving=drink.

I started having problems with alcohol since I started, at 18. The only sober moments were when I restricted food. 

I relapsed into anorexia around 2 years ago. I managed to bring myself back up fairly quickly, but have been drinking increasingly more... I have made it through alcohol free days, but not recently. I drink 7 bottles or 5% alcohol beers now... Was used to 3-4 for a while... It stabilized at 6 for a couple months... 

Now I drink 7. I wake up early, at 7am max, not hangover at all... But this morning, I was very very anxious about going to work, suicidal on my way there. 

I have trouble eating in the morning... That is one of the thing I try to work on. I think that the alcohol abuse and restricting or purging are ways for me to manage my pain, make me numb, distract me from the stressors of life... 

I don't know what my question is, really. But I was wondering how to manage it all. And maybe give me another reason to stop. I am so tired of drinking. 

My beers occupy an unreasonably large amount of my time... That isn't life... 

It worries me that I increased like that. I am a small 5'2 woman... I used to be ""proud"" about the fact that I could drink a whole pitcher of beer when I was really underweight... What the hell.... 

I think I am desperate. I am followed by a psychologist and a social worker, as well as a family doctor... So I am very fortunate and equipped. But I feel so lonely. 

Edit : Do you think I am physically addicted to alcohol ? Meaning at risk for intense symptoms ? If I have symptoms like that the morning after (less then 12 hours since my last drink)... I am afraid of what can come next when I will be able to stop...

Let‚Äôs make no mistake ‚Äì I *had* to get sober. But the way I stay sober is by making it a choice I make each day.  

I don‚Äôt post often, so if you‚Äôll indulge me today as I‚Äôm feeling wistful, let‚Äôs review. Back when I was drinkin‚Äô I would eventually, inevitably, take huge potshots the foundational stability in my life. My health, relationships, and financial situation were all frequently under attack. I would get so blasted and disoriented I‚Äôd try to walk home from wherever I was, spending 2-3 hours in a stupor before I came to a bit and came up with a better plan, hopefully having not pissed or shit myself and with a working cell-phone, and my wallet mostly intact. I was lucky, only once did one of these many situations end up in near-tragedy, when I was abducted and forced to max withdraw from the atm, getting a cig put out on my wrist in the process, to drive home how serious my assailants were.     

I *had* to get sober because it was damaging my most important relationships. My wife put up with so much and deserved much better. The worry of not knowing when or if I‚Äôd come home.  Or not knowing who would be at the party with her a few hours from now, the charming, funny, friend-of-everyone or the wrecked, zombie-eyed embarrassment everyone was avoiding.  

It's painful writing some of this out, but time has a way of white washing the extremely valid reasons for making the choice to forgo drinking. And addiction keeps looking for ways to wedge itself back into your life. I quit for 7 months from February 2018 to September 2018, figured I had things squared away and would be able to drink ‚Äúnormally‚Äù from now on. It was only a matter of weeks before I was back to the same old tricks and took another year to get back on track. To stop taking a sledge-hammer to my life every couple of weeks.  

It hasn‚Äôt been a cure-all but it has allowed me to start repairing what was broken, what was continually under-attack, and to start building. There‚Äôs the idea that you are the star, writer, and director of your own movie. Well, I went from being the star on a trashy reality TV show, to being the star in something I actually want to watch. In many ways, that was why I drank, because I wanted to change the channel to something else and would settle for trash. 

Even if I still want to change the channel sometimes, it has been the greatest gift, to have my life back, to be free from the cycle of destruction. To choose myself, and (nod to Trainspotting) to choose life. I‚Äôm so grateful and so thankful to have made it here and will enthusiastically and with reverence continue to make that choice for the year (and beyond) to come.

If I hadn't stopped when I did I know I wouldn't have made it through this fucking year. I came so close so many times to not being alive. I still struggle. But for the first time in my entire life this year, I had a couple of days when I was actually really honestly happy to be alive. That has never happened to me. Those days make it worth it. Today sucks. This past week sucked. This year as a whole has been shit. But hey. I'm sober and it would have been so much worse if I wasn't. And those days made it worth it. As a student of science, it's only a numbers game until I have another great day. 

&#x200B;

It doesn't help anything. There is nothing logical about it. It's an addiction and a good way to brainwash people. We are smarter than what the billboards say, or the movies, or the uninteresting friends, or the ""culture"", or any of the other bullshit. In the end none of those things have your best interest in mind. Only you do Comrades. 

&#x200B;

Standing in a kitchen 366 days ago, and realizing that if I gave up the bottle for good I would never have to argue with myself about it again, was a fuck of an ah-ha moment. That's what did it. Telling my mom 5 minutes after that made it permanent. It also helped an incredible amount to tie not boozing to how I view and define myself.  I made it a part of my identity from the day I decided.  I reveled in the fact that it was weird to some, and that it made me stand out. Fuck yeah it makes you weird and stand out. That rules. It's an extremely healthy way to make yourself some kind of unique. Its a characteristic that people find interesting. Own that shit.

It's only part time but it offers benefits, PTO, and vacation time. This is something I've never had before so I'm very very excited for it. I'll still be working in a restaurant to make it up to full time hours. 

I don't think I could have done this if I was still a drunk. I wouldn't have had the motivation. I would have been hungover for my phone interview and maybe even slurred my words. I wouldn't be able to wake up early every day and pull a 12 hour day. 

I probably wouldn't have passed my drug test to get the job because we all know how impulse control goes out the window with that first drink. 

But mostly, I would have been just so complacent to stay where I am. Stuck in a pit of depression, self-loathing, and that oh so sweet booze.

I'm still depressed and sometimes unhappy with my life. But I'm building myself up. Taking time to do things I enjoy which is primarily sitting in my living room playing guitar for I no longer have to worry if I've drunk too much for my fingers to work.

Sobriety is good. If you've been thinking about giving it up and haven't yet, I hugely encourage you to do so. If you haven't been thinking about it then it probably isn't a problem for you but I urge you to practice caution around alcohol or you may never be able to touch it again.

I have 31 days today.  Last time I had anything close to this it was 46 days...and I made the mistake of thinking it was OK to take a little vacation from being sober.  That was in August, not long ago.  I was visiting parents and there was some unexpected cancer surgery (them, not me) and I ended up visiting for a lot longer than I expected to.  It was stressful.  Those 46 days were partially due to the fact that there was no way I could possibly drink.  For the 3 days prior to returning to my home city, I was already planning to drink.  Not even a question about it.  By the time I rolled into my home city that Saturday I was more than ready.  Just take a day off, then go back to being sober.  That didn't work.  I went right back to daily drinking.

At some point about five weeks ago I remember I woke up thinking ""I deserve to be happy and I deserve to be free.""  Had a change of heart.  Started being honest with people.  Realized that I hated my job - and also, lets just be honest and own it...I had sabotaged a lot of my job by drinking and just phoning it in a lot.  Lackluster performance.  Mediocrity ruled the day.  Suddenly realizing that I had the power of choice to make changes.

So I buckled down and got serious.  Got serious in therapy.  Joined a 12 step program, got a sponsor.  Started meditating and paying attention to my cravings and urges.  Started sleeping again.  Stomach aches went away.  Anxiety died way down.

So today I'm back in my parents' town after another minor surgery that one of them had to do.  Been here a few weeks and I feel crazy - I need to get out of here.  I think I'm just done with family for a while...I'm tired of old people food and old people questions and old people habits.  They're not wrong - they're just not where I'm at and it's distracting.  So I'm headed back to my home on Saturday.  I don't intend to drink, at all.  There are no plans.  Instead I'm just excited to move on.  I've got a few interviews lined up next week because I realized that my high stress, high paying super important job really sucks and I don't want it.  I'm lowering my salary target and looking for a more comfortable job.  I've got hellish debt from bad decisions but I'll make it work.  I'm excited about it.

Meanwhile, I'm sitting here on Day 31 and I'm freaking exhausted by 2pm.  I could care less about my current job, and while I'm not bending over backwards to do things I'm also not completely checked out either.  Feels kinda like I'm in limbo, and it's super uncomfortable.  I keep checking my email and part of me is waiting for my boss to fire me.  I'm sleepy and I want to move on.  But I'm not hung over.  This whole patience and letting the world move at its own pace thing is really tough sometimes.  And yeah this whole pandemic COVID crap really sucks.  But, what am I gonna do?

I'm happy to be at Day 31 and I'm looking forward to some changes.  Love reading your stories so please keep posting.  I'm gonna eat this Reeses and drink this bubbly water and stare at my screen for a few more hours. üôÉ",7,2

I‚Äôll be completely honest and it sounds silly but seeing football back on TV triggered me to drink again and also of course- feeling good. I‚Äôve drank myself into a blackout almost every football Saturday for the past 10 years or so. It‚Äôs so dumb because I just use football as an excuse to get drunk.

(Disclaimer: I‚Äôm not exactly nice to my past self in this post. That‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs for effect. It is also not my intention to insult anyone who is trying to moderate right now. I‚Äôm only insulting myself.)

I‚Äôve had several friends tell me that that my sobriety and my commitment to sobriety seems awfully sudden, along with helpful comments such as ‚ÄúYou could probably drink again after a little break.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt really an alcoholic! Don‚Äôt put that stigma on yourself!‚Äù ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt seem like you had a problem?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou can drink just take it easy! Only drink on the weekends.‚Äù Etc. Ad nauseum. (Btw these comments pale in comparison to the amount of support I‚Äôve gotten, so they don‚Äôt bug me too much)

What they don‚Äôt know is that I did try to moderate. Here‚Äôs how that went:

Attempt 1: got a personal trainer, he told me to stop drinking as it would improve my results. I was able to go one night without a drink. Decided this meant I didn‚Äôt have a problem and continued drinking 1-3 beers per night. 

Attempt 2 (6 months later): decided that tapering was the way to go, ‚Äútapered‚Äù down from a 6 pack per night by cutting down by .5 beers a night over two weeks, finally got to one beer per night for one night, decided this meant I didn‚Äôt have a problem, went straight back to my 6 pack. ü§°ü§°ü§°

Attempt 3 (one year after attempt 2): ‚Äúno more than 6 drinks per night and no hard liquor‚Äù says me, the clown, while planning a vacation to the Oregon coast back when vacations were a thing. Come to find out that going down to sea level from Colorado made it so that it took me half a pint of vodka along with a six pack to even catch a buzz, so that‚Äôs how much I drank every day of my trip. In retrospect his was probably a springboard into the worst of my drinking which was to come right after this.

Attempt 4 (six months after attempt 3): ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna taper down, I have to, I‚Äôll have withdrawal‚Äù says me, the fucking clown, shaking at 10 am because I haven‚Äôt had a drink yet. This ‚ÄúI‚Äôm cutting back, it‚Äôs okay‚Äù clownery lasted 6 months, during this six months 8 drinks a day was a win for me. I rarely achieved it. Even when I was laid out flat from the flu with a fever of 102 i STILL drank 8 beers a day. I was done for. 

Attempt 5 (or maybe this is my first real attempt, it‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs sticking so far): cold turkey. I did indeed have withdrawal, luckily not severe but it certainly wasn‚Äôt fun. 

Aside from learning that moderation is not a thing I can do, at all, I also realized that every attempt at moderation made my drinking worse. A clown ass combination of patting myself on the back for being able to cut back, feeling reassured that I could stop if I wanted to so I drank as much as I wanted whenever I felt like it (which was as much alcohol as my body could handle, all the fucking time), and toward the end feeling so crippled by anxiety and shame about my obvious inability to moderate that I drank to make those feelings go away. Additionally, when I was in an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm moderating‚Äù mindset alcohol was ALL I thought about, when can I have my next drink etc, and it was SO hard. It was like mentally running a marathon every day.

Moderation is a scam alcohol tries to dupe you with so you won‚Äôt let it go. Don‚Äôt fall for it.",15,0

I brought three 20oz beers to my friend's house to watch football. I ran out and had another beer from his fridge. Drove home. Snagged a swig of whiskey before mowing the lawn. Had four more swigs from the bottle in the house it took me to mow. Took a shower and poured myself a glass of whiskey and water (mostly whiskey). After that I vaguely remember snippets of the night. My girlfriend's kids asking what was wrong with me. Some people stopping by and me being a sloppy mess. Blasting music. Being a general nuisance to everyone around me. You know, all the stuff I was avoiding because I was moderating!

The next day I was in a world of hurt, as usual. Called off work. Lay in bed all day wishing I could just disappear. My mind kept circling back to ""This is so stupid. You don't enjoy drinking. You don't enjoy moderating. You don't really enjoy anything anymore.""

So I decided I was done, just like I had many times in the past whole in bed with a hangover from hell. But this time it was different. I talked to my girlfriend. I took time off work because I was ""sick"". I basically just self isolated and avoided everyone and everything for a long time. We hosted a party and I just stayed in my room with headphones on. Didn't hang out with friends. I stayed in on Halloween. We hosted Thanksgiving and I made the rounds, ate, then disappeared for the rest of the day. I would go to work, come home, and just isolate myself, trying to avoid all possible triggers. I felt like I was going crazy for the first few weeks, and it took almost two months before my mind calmed down. By then I was too far into it to turn back and erase the progress.

It got easier every day. Drinking wasn't an option. The daily option was between wallowing in self pity or to start rebuilding my life. Slowly but surely I began to rebuild. Then the pandemic hit and I was laid off. Honestly it was the most serene and peaceful time I've ever had in my life. I had so much TIME! Got tons of things done and was so satisfied with life that I didn't even think about drinking.

It's back to being stressful now. Still laid off. Teaching two kids school from home. Being a supportive partner to my girlfriend while she works nursing. Keeping up with the house chores. The list goes on and on.

There is no way in hell that I would have been able to do this a year ago. I'm so happy that I quit when I did. Life is still here, and now I'm here too.

When I broke my four week streak I struggled to start back up because I wasn‚Äôt feeling the motivation and the willpower I had before - or I guess just the overall wonderful feeling of the pink cloud. It was a real bishhh trying to quit again without that feeling to help carry me through. 

I guess I kinda want to let those of you who aren‚Äôt feeling all light and wonderful each day know that, you are also impressive for pushing through this without any wonderful feeling to assist your motivation.

I've been toying with complete sobriety for a long time, but seem to always be around heavy drinkers. It's been the norm for me for a long time. Getting drunk just seems to be a big part of my family and social life. 

However, my blackout style drinking seems to be getting worse. I barely drank for two weeks and then got invited out. Basically don't remember the majority of the night and found myself waking up on a sidewalk with my bike battery dead. Absolutely no idea why. Literally sleeping casually on the road and then getting woke up by a nice guy who encouraged me back into normality. 

It never used to be like this. I could simply drink the night away and remember everything and not wake up feeling like garbage. But now it seems that the blackouts a more frequent. And I'm not sure that I'm doing this as some sort of coping mechanism, or whether trying to be not be a party pooper has finally come to an end.

I really like being sober and really don't like the damaging consequences that heavy drinking has. I'm wasting money, not concentrating on work, and generally just self destructing. Doesn't help that these blackouts usually require a few days until I get back to normality.

Maybe having support on Reddit may be the answer. Not sure! But it seems I'm not the only one, so it's great to read through some of your posts and see that others seem to be trapped in a similar routine.",26,0

I was a week sober when I walked into my first AA meeting. I was terrified, not gonna lie. Then I saw the man who was running the meeting. He was a neighbor of mine that I'd met once just a couple months earlier. He remembered me, told me he and his husband had been sober for years, and gave me his phone number and an invitation to another meeting with both of them. Every bit of fear left me in that moment. Later on, I texted my brother that it felt like a sign that I was in the right place.


(Exhibit B) 

I was two or three weeks sober. I was out at trivia with some new-ish friends. Feeling kind of uncomfortable and awkward. 'Oh no, what if someone asks me why I'm not drinking?' Then I overheard a friend (who I had just recently met and barely knew) say, ""...No, I don't drink, I haven't for years."" I lit up inside. I texted him later that night, told him what was going on. What a huge support and great friend he ended up becoming, and the universe had just happened to bring us together, at the exact right time, in the exact right circumstances. 

(Exhibit C)

""All good things come to an end


To make room for new beginnings

All good things come to an end, an end, an end, 

but it's not the end""


A year ago, I listened to this song every. single. day. for probably two months. In all honesty, it's a song about a breakup... but really, I felt like I had just broken up with alcohol. (Or alcohol had broken up with me? Whatever.) This particular line from the song had become my personal mantra. When I went to a Misterwives concert in December (remember concerts btw? lol), I told my husband I hoped they'd play ""the end"" at some point, but they probably wouldn't because it was off their mini-album and I didn't think it was one of their bigger hits. ...It was the first song they played that night. I teared up. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now... I'm a very reasonable and rational person. I don't believe in ""signs"", or ""the universe"" or ""big fancy coincidences that make you feel all warm and gooey, and like everything you've been doing lately is exactly correct, you dumbass"". It would be stupid for me to think there's some outside force that's manipulating me like this. Obviously I don't believe that. No way. 

But... Come on. Those are some damn good signs. 

I am one year sober today. ‚òùÔ∏è

I don‚Äôt know why but today I feel so alone and empty. Like my life has no point. I can‚Äôt even focus 10 minutes to study for my exam which is in two weeks. I keep having negative thoughts about myself. I try to do all these challenges but I only end up feeling depressed and empty after a while. 

I think I also realised that I am not addicted to drinking. I am just alone. If I had  friends and we hang out etc I wouldn‚Äôt  feel the need to drink or smoke . But when I‚Äôm alone , I feel like it‚Äôs perfect and it makes my day more entertaining because otherwise I feel empty and useless and ashamed of being 23 with no girl or friends. 

Why am I like this? Why do I want to relapse even though I don‚Äôt feel the need to ? 23 year old man throwing his youth away by being alone in his university room.

I thought to myself, why am I taking so many freakin baths?  And then I realized what had happened. When I first got sober I struggled with HALT triggers (hungry, angry, lonely, tired). They all made me want to drink, but especially anger. I was convinced I could poison other people by drinking it myself. The only thing that seemed to work was submerging myself in hot water until I calmed down. I got such joy realizing that I had finally, unconsciously reached for that coping mechanism instead of drinking. I DIDN‚ÄôT EVEN HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT.

I will never forget where I was when the thought dominated my mind that the people who loved me and relied upon me as a husband and father would be better off I just died right then and there.  I won't bore you with the self analysis but decades of abusing alcohol was certainly at the top of the list of reasons why I had gotten to that point. But, 10 years since my last drink, my world and life couldn't be any better and I am truly a lucky man.

This post isn't about celebrating me; it is about celebrating all of you (and so many others).  I say with all of the grace and humility possible that none of this would be possible without the love, support, friendship, wisdom, advice, and so many other things I have received from literally thousands of people over the last decade. Every good thing I have done for another in the last 10 years has been because of what I have learned from you.

I have learned that there is no shame in accepting that I have a problem; that the strongest thing I can do is ask for help; that it is possible to both seek and give forgiveness; that there is a higher power out there and I can let him/her/it deal with my anxieties and fears; that humility and teachability are keys to true growth.  I have even learned that someone like me can truly love not only myself but another.  And I have learned that I will continue to make mistakes in my life but if I deal with them openly and honestly, they cannot control me.

In the last few years and months I have even been challenged by real losses in my life.  And, with the help of you, I know that no matter how much a loss hurts I can learn and grow from it.  Most importantly, I never have to drink over a loss or pain or any other excuse I used to have to drink.  

I know so many of you on this sub are just starting your journey and even the thought of one day can be overwhelming, let alone 10 years.  It certainly was for me.  That is why I did two things every day in my early sobriety:  1) I focused on one day at a time and lived in the present; and 2) I reached out my hand to someone who could help me with my goals of happiness and sobriety.

As I recognize my anniversary date today my thoughts and prayers are not on me but with you.  I want you to know that you are not alone; that you are loved and supported; and that life can be better if you give it a chance.  Trust me, if someone as broken as me can do this, I know all of you can too!  :)

This time last year, I was on day one of what turned into a four day hangover and months of regret.  I‚Äôm a binge drinker, and at the time I quit drinking, it had turned into a weekly event with blackout nights.  

This is a big day for me and since most people in my life are uncomfortable with my sobriety (with the exception of my therapist), I‚Äôm going to word vomit all over this post. Because honestly, I never thought I‚Äôd get here. 

It‚Äôs been a year of change with no more mornings hungover or days spent in bed recovering.  I‚Äôve done a lot in therapy, which required sobriety.  I can sit with my emotions, rather than numb them, and I can process them.  It‚Äôs hard and it hurts, but it‚Äôs progress. My drunk dreams are less intense. I‚Äôve lost weight. I‚Äôm healthier physically and mentally.  A few weeks ago, I celebrated my 30th birthday - my first one sober since I was about 19.   It was honestly one of the best birthdays I can remember (bonus because I CAN remember it!). 

I wouldn‚Äôt have made it to this day without this community.  So many days that my brain tried to tell me I don‚Äôt have a problem or I‚Äôm blowing this out of proportion.  Days when I wanted to numb everything with booze. Days when family members - whether they were aware of it or not - wanted to pull me back into drinking.  Days when I had cravings or the urge to just have one - which isn‚Äôt a thing where my drinking is concerned. 

On these days, I come to this sub and read people‚Äôs stories.  The encouragement and support of the members here is astounding, and just the knowledge that there is a place to turn when things feel out of my hands is such a relief.

Now, here it is two years later and I‚Äôm still going. 

I‚Äôm a completely different person now. I swim pretty much every day. I eat well. I‚Äôve lost 60 lb.

When I think about who I was, it makes me sad and relieved at the same time. I had a fat red face. Every morning was hell. I was always depressed or anxious or both if I drank gin. 

I was putting away thousands of calories every night in beer and whisky and bad food decisions.

My relationship with my kids was strained. I couldn‚Äôt remember big moments through the fog. I forgot my promises. I always argued with my wife. I lived my life around legal limits, unusual aches and pains, fear of dying and disease, and scheduling around hangovers before they happened.

It was so stressful and exhausting looking back on it. Managing my drinking was a full-time job. Trying to moderate was worse. So much bandwidth. So much planning. So not worth it.

So, after a year, everyone expected me to start drinking again. It‚Äôs what I did before (and regretted). It‚Äôs my handle after all. But nah! I didn‚Äôt want to go back there. 

So I gave it another year.

Here I am after two years. I can run 10k faster now than when I was in high school. I swim 1k a day. I‚Äôm in the best shape of my life. I‚Äôd be crazy to go back.

I made a promise to myself. If I do start again, I have to make that decision at the 5k mark of a 10k run. Nothing impulsive at the bar.

I have never, ever, had the slightest urge to drink while covered in sweat, panting like an animal, and feeling more alive and on top of the world than booze has ever got me.

I've finally been able to recognise and admit to myself that I do have a problem (I don't know how I couldn't before! Very embarrassing.), and I'm now fully committed to stopping after I really took a dive and was getting through 1L bottles every 1-3 days since August when mum died.

I've also stopped smoking at the same time as if I smoke I REALLY want a drink and vice versa.

I'm now really tired from waking up 4-5 times a night, always feel dehydrated, and feeling generally ill and wanting to drink.  But when I look back to what I've done to myself and how I've acted towards others while drunk, this is preferable to me right now lol. My guilt and memories are where I'm drawing strength to stop, does that make sense?

I'm now only doing online shopping so I don't get tempted when I go down to the local supermarket. I've stopped eating fast food and eating fresh veg and meat (turns out I really enjoy cooking!), apart from a coffee in the morning I'm only drinking water (sparkling if I feel fancy) and I've even signed up to a gym for the first time ever and meeting a PT later on today (nervous about that haha).

Any tips would be appreciated! The weekend was the hardest so far!",6,0

Its only very recently that I've realised that I'm an alcoholic, it sounds stupid but I thought an alcoholic was someone that has lost their job, sleeps with a bottle vodka under the bed for  breakfast etc etc. It's taken me a long time to realise that there's multitudes to alcoholism, maybe it's a case of ""Yeah, I've got a drinking problem, but I'm not like THAT guy,"" maybe.

I'm just curious when some of you guys came to the conclusion that you've got a problem with it. Life isn't a movie, there isn't a big climax of realisation or rock bottom, alcoholism is long, drawn out over years, and it can be tricky to actually spot.

I couldn‚Äôt believe how supportive people were.,"Ok I‚Äôm gonna write down all the bad things drinking has caused for me to help me stop too. These as some of the worst/ most embarrassing ones. There are more minor ones I left out. 

For Americans ‚ÄúSocieties‚Äù are a bit like frats except they are mixed gender and generally linked to the course you study. Some are sports themed too. 

2nd year University (2 years ago) 

Got blackout drunk for the first time, made an arse of myself in front of everyone. Won my societies village idiot award, was elected president afterwards (the 2 are not linked)

Got blackout drunk again, almost got in a fight for making out with a girl I didn‚Äôt know had a boyfriend. 

Got kicked out of a nightclub for falling off my barstool 

3rd year of university (last year)

Blacked out on a field trip, had a massive hangover during test, paid a friend $100 to do it for me. I would have for a higher mark it I did it myself sober

Black out with American friends in DC they were amazed at how much I could drink (I noticed going to a nightclub and not drinking is more normal over there). Convinced a friend to do shots with me (she is a girl and has a petite build) so more dangerous for her. We both blacked out and got kicked out for puking in a urinal. We then argued with a cop about it. He was nice and drove us to our hotel (wrong Hilton). I‚Äôm lucky we didn‚Äôt get thrown in the drunk tank. So I slurred to the lady behind the desk what happened and my name so I could find the right hotel. Got back to hotel, we spent all day curled up together feeling sick and sorry. (How romantic üòÇ)

I did a geography field unit. Most of the people in the class were ‚Äúhippies‚Äù per say. I had a few friends who did the unit too (all worse drinkers than me). So picture this, for a second here is this class full of vegans, hairy girls and people who wear rainbow coloured wool sweaters. Then there is my friends and I, the most stereotypical straight guys you can imagine. We were drunk the whole time we were there, you can imagine the jokes me made we a bit close to home, we rubbed our meat eating in people‚Äôs faces and were a bunch of dickheads. We were only doing this unit because it‚Äôs really easy. At the end one girl came up to me and said ‚Äúgod you and your friends are dickheads, why do you hangout with them?‚Äù At the time I just laughed but she was right. 

Got smashed and sang a song in front of class. It was terrible. 

Almost missed my grandfathers birthday because I was in hospital the night before. I did a centurion (100 shots of beer in 100 minutes) and then went out drinking to celebrate. I was playing pool and some druggie punched me. I didn‚Äôt do anything to him to provoke but if I was sober I could have dodged to punch. Instead I fell and had to get stitches in my cheek (thankfully I don‚Äôt have a scar). I went to hospital had them put them in. Was discharged, didn‚Äôt sleep, got a Powerade and then drove 4 hours to the family dinner. Obviously I had to tell everyone I got punched, I left out the part about the centurion. I then had 2 drinks with the dinner for my hangover. Next morning I couldn‚Äôt stop vomiting, I had a delayed concussion, spent another day on an IV. My best friend begged for me to stop drinking, which I actually did for a few months. 

4th year of university (this year)

Blackouts have become less frequent. (Only 3 in the last 8 months) With COVID lockdown I had no reason to drink as getting drunk was always a social thing for me. 

Blacked out at a friends party and vomited in his sink, kissed/slobbered on a girl who everyone knew had a boyfriend (except me). Her friend (who happened to be gay) and a friend on mine picked me up and dragged me to the door. I called the gay guy a faggot (he was very upset). My friends stepped in to prevent me getting my arse kicked. Uber refused to take me. A friend who doesn‚Äôt drink drove me home, I puked in his car. I paid for the cleaning. 

A Friend and I got ‚Äúretarded‚Äù drunk and kicked out of our local. We drank 6 80% ABV rum and cokes in an hour. I don‚Äôt remember anything so this one is short. I woke up covered in vomit. 

Last one was 2 nights ago. I had 10 pints of 8% beer. It made me quit drinking.",12,2

Had a long chat with the psychologist, it‚Äôs probably the 6th time I‚Äôve seen her this year for the same thing. Also picked up some Champix and had a long chat with a Pulmonologist just to make me feel even worse to stop smoking. Diagnosed with mild emphysema earlier this year and still smoking today ffs.

I feel pretty good already an hour after taking the first pill. I actually feel hungry and want to eat a meal for the first time in a week. The withdrawals were stopped dead in their tracks. If you ever feel bad enough that you think you need a doctor then please do. It can save your life.

Going to spend the afternoon cleaning my apartment and doing all the stuff I‚Äôve neglected for the last week. That‚Äôs how good the pills are, went from thinking I was to die to actually being useful.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hello SDers, I hope you are all doing ok! I've had a pretty rubbish nights sleep myself! After I finally took control of the TV I spent yesterday evening watching stage 3 highlights of the Giro d'Italia (which ended up being the lowlights for us Brits!). After it finished the 10pm news came on and I got drawn into watching the days craziness. Honestly, you couldn't write it could you! Anyway I just could not sleep, my mind would not shut down. I even went and raided the fridge twice for some snacks. The last number I remember seeing was 4.44am which I remember because all the 4s looked pretty cool. My daughter came in not long after and climbed into bed and then shuffled herself back to sleep. Maybe I've had 2 hours at best. Today I will not drink any alcohol with you all but I will drink some coffee! Have a fab day folks. Much love to you all.

There was still some kind of ""grief"" and the feeling of missing something out... Idk. And, to be honest, the thought of never drinking again for the rest of my life scared the hell out of me and still does. I've learnt that yesterday when I had to make a longtime plan for a project (18 months) and my mind came up with the question whether I'll make or not to stay sober without relapse for such a long time... therefore I decided, that I'll forever be not drinking for just today, no matter what kind of longtime plan I'll have to submit.

2455,2020-10-06 03:12:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/j60nqp/i_really_dont_know/,I really don't know,"Hi, I'm an 18 year old male attending college. Recently I fucked up really badly.

 Of course it started the same way as it always does: the first drunk is a state of unfiltered, unabashed, kaleidoscope of euphoria, where I felt as though, through a false perception of wishful thinking, that I could do anything and be anything. Of course it lost the euphoria.

My friends and I were adamantly opposed to drugs of any kind, but we decided to try alcohol one time because it ""would be fun to see and not do all the time. Of course it's all we do now.

I wouldn't use it to numb my depression. Of course me drinking alone on a Tuesday night and bullshitting my dad into believing that I'm not drunk and puking four times before going to school the next day was not to numb my depression. 

I didn't drink at all during quarantine (reasons I don't need to go into), due to the above experience, one that I am proud of, and as a result made me kind of like quarantine. But of course I started drinking once I got out.

So that brings us to the present. I've been indulging in the college lifestyle, you know, getting schlonked on the regular, enjoying my time as a college student ""ought"" too. This was fun. But of course it's not fun anymore.

We had been drinking Everclear for a couple weekends(I know NOT GOOD), and I had a good handle on it. But of course, I eventually didn't. I had way too much, and I blacked out for most of the night. As I'm told, I made it to the bathroom late at night, puked, and passed out in the stall. Someone who lives in the dorms reported my body and the RAs came to investigate. They called the University police and I was escorted out of the hall with handcuffs, and I few people saw too :)

They took me to detox and administered a drug called ondensteron (helps with vomiting and nausea). Thank GOD I didn't need anything else. Then, the hospital told me to fuck off at 6:00am, and I was sent on my Mary way back to the dorm. I didn't have my phone or wallet on me so I was unable to get into the building or call anyone to let me in. I got to the dorm and slept outside it for about an hour and a half. Then I saw a dude who let me in after I convinced him. Then I crawled into my goddamn bed at 7:40am and slept till noon.

At the time, I was pretty embarrassed that I was fucking handcuffed and taken away like a goddamn criminal, but I'm blas√© about it now, I guess. The only consequence I'll be receiving is a non-criminal citation where I have to pay a fine and whatever the university housing decides to do with me (hopefully a warning cause it was my first and only time). Oh yeah, and my phone and wallet were safe in my dorm when I thought I had lost them. Once again, I face zero actions for my consequences, and I can't help but feel I don't deserve this luck. Not only did I survive, but I didn't suffer any of the other minor infractions that could have happened. It feels wrong because I want to learn my goddamn lesson. I'm a stupid person who made a terrible mistake and I don't feel anything towards. Am I sad about it? Of course! But I'm not sad enough. People have been asking me questions about it. I reply pretty casually, make a few jokes about it, some standard phony nonsense. But I don't learn anything.

Hell, look at my past. It always turns into being the most fucked up in the room. I am always the most fucked up in the room. My word doesn't mean anything. I depressed and scared. I was so happy when I didn't drink at all, but I couldn't keep that promise. Now I'm in an environment where everyone drinks and I like hanging out with them and I don't want to face the scenario where I have to keep explaining to them why I don't wish to drink. I can't drink. I can't do it anymore. I can't do this cycle. I'm scared of what my close friends will think when I never want to drink again. Don't worry, these guys will love me no matter what, but they will still be apprehensive, and I can't stand that.

You know what it's like, to know that you have so many great qualities and there is so much about yourself to be proud of, yet you feel like complete shit about yourself and you are really depressed and those good things don't matter because you are self destructive? I think about killing myself, I really do, but I won't do anything. I'm too scared. I live in this existential nightmare and I am so confused and I have no idea what to say. I know that I don't want to drink anymore, but my word doesn't mean shit and that is what I am so afraid of.

tl;dr: Alcohol is nothing but a vicious cycle of empty promises to satiate your brain's desire to consume more alcohol. I want nothing to do with it, but fear the judgment of others, especially my friends. Sorry for the long post.",6,2

You were such a pro drinker...""","Haven't posted in long time, I still hang here for motivation. But a recent conversation with a friend from years ago really hurt for some reason.

Yes, I was a pro drinker, because I was trying to keep up in the social scene. At that point I didn't think about the blackouts. They're normal, right? I'm so young and crazy, right?

And then it got worse. And bad things happened, things I didn't want to happen. But that's just normal right? You drink and make mistakes. Ha, ha.

No. I chose to stop walking down that path. It took a really bad blackout which I will regret for the rest of my life. I'm still sorting through the shame of it, two years later. I was suicidal over it. I wanted everything to end, just to stop the shame.

And yet this friend thinks it's funny and that I should just get back to social drinking by counting drinks... Well I shouldn't be mad at them, it's me that has the problem. They didn't have my experiences.

But it hurts that they wouldn't shut up and kept offering advice on how to count drinks, have a different one each time, stick to light beers, time your drinking. The only thing that dissuaded them was saying ""I never liked it anyways."" Which isn't true, but it's the only explanation they would accept, given my former drinking they witnessed. Can't I change? Why do I have to explain myself? I don't think I'll be explaining that thoroughly again. It's exhausting.

I wanted to drink so badly from the shame, that even after all the work I've done I can be brought down by a piece of shit like him. He was refusing to believe that I wasn't drinking, despite most of my co-workers knowing by now I'm sober.

I have been having a hard time managing my hypochondria and my addiction. They have always gone hand in hand. I was a heavy drinker (20-30 drinks a day) and abusing benzos. It was the only way I knew how to manage my health anxiety. It got to the point where I was dangerously close to death, so I decided to get help.

I'm sure many of you can relate to the nightmare a deadly, airborne virus can play on the mind.

It really hurts to see my friends and family continue with their lives as if the pandemic doesn't exist.

Last week I was mulling over triggers after a week of feeling relatively irritated with all the endless glamorizing and romanticizing of booze in popular culture. Well, imagine my delight when both in the book I'm reading and in the show I'm currently watching I encountered instances of booze's ugly and dark sides being shown. 

Here's a passage from the Kingsley Amis novel I'm reading, *Lucky Jim*:

""Dixon was alive again. Consciousness was upon him before he could get out of the way; not for him the slow, gracious wandering from the halls of sleep, but a summary, forcible ejection. He lay sprawled, too wicked to move, spewed up like a broken spider-crab on the tarry shingle of the morning. The light did him harm, but not as much as looking at things did; he resolved, having done it once, never to move his eyeballs again. A dusty thudding in his head made the scene before him beat like a pulse. His mouth had been used as a latrine by some small creature of the night, and then as its mausoleum. During the night, too, he'd somehow been on a cross-country run and then been expertly beaten up by secret police."" 

I think we've all had some version of that wake-up.

The show I've been watching is *Community* (finally, I know). There is always a lot of casual drinking on that show and sometimes (to my perhaps now prudish annoyance), drunkenness is used as a plot device. Usually, like most everywhere, alcohol is seen as a good thing. But I saw the one where Troy turns 21 the other day. He had a religious upbringing so had not been exposed to much alcohol. Of course, the crowd of friends insists he has to go to a bar. He can't drink until he turns 21 officially at midnight (which I think IRL is not a thing a bar allows but not sure) so he just watches for most of the evening as his friends and the people all around him get progressively sloppier, stupider, and even sadder. At midnight, he walks away from the drink he's been poured. What I especially loved here was that it didn't hit you over the head with a heavy after-school special, Southpark style ""I learned something today"" vibe. He just kind of quietly nopes out and then is able to drive everyone home. 

Anybody else got a favorite example of alcohol looking not so glam in pop culture?

I passed the drug test due to my sobriety and I passed the background check by being upfront about my criminal history and my problems with alcohol. They were willing to give me a chance, the catch being if I allow alcohol to get me into any more trouble, I will be let go. I spent my birthday doing some very basic onboarding and hanging out with my kids on their fall break, and then spending the evening with them and my girlfriend.

why it is that I stopped drinking.   


Since then, alcohol has been on my mind a lot. It's coming up on 4 years for me. I should be happy.   


But often, I find it pre-occupies my thoughts. I have the money, it wouldn't be hard to buy a bunch of alcohol and drink it whenever the fuck I please. It wouldn't. No one would judge me. But I'd keep it in my room and I just know that it would devolve into drinking at any hour, any day, and maybe every day.   


I know, despite little prior evidence, that I would lose all control. I'd drink myself awake in the morning and to sleep at night. I'm already often isolated from my family in my house and I know that I'd lock myself in my room to get wasted all the time. 

The burn in my throat, the bubble in my gut. The relief from stress and the mood boost I desperately need. Just letting go and not giving a fuck.   
I want it. I feel like I need it.   


But I'm terrified. If I give in now, it's all over. I don't know if I'll ever be able to claw back the control that I've spent four years trying to keep in my grip.   


I don't have anyone else in my life to talk to about it. My mum would just tell me that I don't have a problem, I just think I have a problem, and then if I told her what it is I know that I'd do, she'd just say 'you won't do that, you're not like your grandfather. You're not like your dad's family'. (There's a lot of heavy drinkers and alcoholics).   


I guess I just want to talk to people who understand.

I've been sober about two months now and things are going okay. I have a new routine, I sleep better and most importantly I don't drink. I moved back home recently to my small town and am back in the workforce (thank goodness) but I've noticed some behaviour recently that's freaking me out. I work at a bakery, serving coffee and treats and pretty quickly into my start I developed a little work crush. Now, this is not out of the ordinary for me, I'm a flirty gal and I love a little banter with customers. However, in the last week or two, I have been going out of my way to see this guy around. Like obsessively. To the point where I feel really anxious if he doesn't come in. Or I beat myself up if I'm awkward around him (which is often). It's become a real focus of mine and can determine whether I have a ""good"" day or a ""bad"" day. I've been so confused because I haven't felt this way since I was a hormonal teenager and even then I was like ""Girl, chill."". Haha. 

Anyways, I had another day of anxiously staring at the door waiting for this guy to come in (he didn't). I was thinking about it afterwards and I started making the connection between this behaviour and my behaviour around drinking. I used to rock up into work or any day hungover pretty regularly. I would start with my morning epiphany of ""I'll never drink again!"" or ""I will eat healthier and that will stop me drinking!"" or ""I'll go to therapy"" etc and then by noon the obsession of whether the day was going to be a drinking day or a non-drinking day would begin. My imagination would run wild. And my mind would flip flop over and over and over again until finally I'd walk into the liquor store and buy myself booze. Because it felt easier just to get it over with. 

That's a lot like how my mind has been approaching this guy. Now that my mind is free of the choice of whether it will be a drinking day or a non-drinking day, it's like I can't help but find something else to occupy it with. This poor boy hahaha. He has no idea the fire he's ignited! This has been bugging me for weeks and finally, I'm getting a little peace with this realization.

AA has taught me a lot. The most important thing is the sentence one person said in a meeting. ,,although I am struggling, getting a divorce, loosing someone, having a fight or have anxiety, it does not mean that I have to drink, It means I am alive, because live has it¬¥s ups and downs,,

may you all have a sober and a wonderful week :)",17,0

This past year has been one of the greatest, and most painful learning experiences of my life.  I spent well over a decade at the bottom of one bottle after another.  I ruined friendships, a marriage and my health.  Staying sober has allowed the fog to lift and given me a chance to find out who I am all over again.  I also have the chance to rebuild, and to get it right this time.

One of the hardest parts is looking back at the choices I made and feeling so ashamed of what I've done.  It was even harder admitting the truth of who I was to myself.

Just because it worked for me doesn't mean it will work for you and I'd feel terrible if someone went off the rails trying my approach. Talk to a professional or someone you trust, not some weirdo on the internet. tl;dr at the end.**

&#x200B;

First, I need to give you a little backstory. I'll keep it as short as I can. About three years ago, I hit bottom. I was in the middle of a divorce, on the verge of bankruptcy, technically homeless though I wasn't on the street thanks to great friends and family. I was over $150,000 in debt with zero income, fifty pounds overweight, I was spiraling in my depression and addiction(s) with no end in sight. Ten years of untreated PTSD from my time in the Army were bubbling to the surface again, and I was seriously considering ending it all.  


The biggest problem for me, the thing I used to distract myself from all my other problems, was alcohol. I simply couldn't imagine how I'd ever be able to quit. I mean, I'd been a six-pack-a-day-or-more-guy for fifteen years now. Every night, the same thing. Sometimes more but never any less. I didn't want to face whatever I was covering up with the drinking. How could I ever overcome all the obstacles I was facing? I mean, this was the perfect storm. People don't recover from this kind of thing, better to just crawl in a hole and die, I told myself.  


One morning, a particularly rough one, I sat on the edge of my bed having a familiar conversation with myself: *You need to quit drinking, you piece of shit. Look at what this is doing to you! You're wasting your life! You're killing yourself. What a loser! You can't go one day without drinking yourself into a coma. What is wrong with you!?*  


The voice kept on throughout the day: *I bet you'll drink tonight. You can't drink tonight. You better not. You will though! You know why? No discipline. You're a loser. You're broken. Today has to be the day you finally quit. Maybe if you switch to whiskey. Maybe if you only drink wine. How many days in a row is it? Or are we counting in years now? Piece of shit. No discipline. Look at what you've become. Oh, yeah, screw it why don't you have that beer with lunch? You've had suuuuch a hard day. Yeah, you deserve it, loser!*  


Then, it hit me like a ton of bricks. A voice popped up from somewhere inside of me and said: *You know why I drink!? I'm tired of listening to you all damn day! All you ever do is shit on me! You. Are. Not. Helping! My god, what if that's the problem? What if the thing that's driving me to drink is this asshole in my head all day long telling me I can't drink or I shouldn't drink and then giving me all kinds of shit when I do? I mean, of course, I want to drink! That's the only thing that shuts off this nagging voice in my head! It the only thing that shuts you up!*  


Right then, I committed to making this simple shift, one simple rule: You can drink whatever you want, whenever you want but what you're NOT allowed to do anymore is beat yourself up for whatever choice you make. Six-pack starting at 8 AM? Sure! Straight to whiskey at lunch? Why not!? And when I did, something shifted. I saw a light at the end of the tunnel.

&#x200B;

You see, it wasn't the alcohol that was the problem for me, it was that voice in my head. *That voice* was the problem. So, I just committed to working on that. You might say, I was cultivating an awareness of my inner critic. I was practicing noticing my inner critic. I started catching it mid-sentence. It would start in on me early in the morning. I'd talk back to it like, ""Uh-uh, mother f'er, not today,"" or ""Ah, caught you again, you slippery SOB."" I started standing up for myself...and you know what...

&#x200B;

I didn't want to drink anymore. It just evaporated. I drank a few more times. Each time, I tried to just stay present while I was doing it. I asked myself questions like, ""What do you like about this,"" or ""How do you feel right now,"" or ""What is this doing for you?"" I realized I didn't like it as much as I always thought I did. It didn't taste particularly good. I didn't like the feeling of being drunk. It ruined my sleep. It made me anxious. I didn't like the interactions I was having with people while I was drinking. I hated being in bars. I hated being around other drunk people. I wasn't particularly fond of any of it. You know what else? I discovered I was worthy of my own care and respect whether I was drinking or not.

&#x200B;

I thought I was physically incapable of quitting on my own (and I respect and honor people who see it that way, I am not trying to change anyone's definition of what an alcoholic is AT ALL, just offering my story). I kept telling my therapist about my drinking, thinking he'd demand I go to an inpatient facility or something. You know what he said? He'd just shrug his shoulders and say something like, ""Addictions tend to resolve themselves when the underlying problem is addressed.""  


Well, my problem was that voice. I took it head-on, and it worked like a charm. It wasn't easy. It didn't happen overnight. Sometimes I forget and that voice runs away with me a bit. But that's happening less and less the more I practice. I've applied it in other areas of my life and the results are, well, nothing short of miraculous. I never could have imagined how good my life could get.  


Today, I am sober. I am debt-free. I earn a good living. I have a safe, stable, comfortable place to live. I have meaningful relationships with people. I am in the best shape of my life. I am healthier and more productive than I have ever been, more clear, more focused and I‚Äôve begun the long process of healing from my past. I take excellent care of myself. I have forgiven myself. I am alive. I am engaged in my life. And I am happy.

I've cut out 1,200 calories of alcohol a day and haven't really changed my eating habits at all, so it would stand to reason I'd be losing a few pounds a week. But, NOTHING.

I've been counting calories for the past 4 weeks and I've been on target according to the LoseIt app goals to lose 1.5 lbs./week, but it just isn't happening for me. 

Anyone else go through this? Any ideas on what I should expect? Or should I start reducing calories even further than the app suggests and add more exercise? (45M for reference).",12,0

This morning, I get to play that really fun game: ""What the HELL did I do last night?""

What I've pieced together thus far...

I made dinner, and it sounds pretty good! I made steak with saut√©ed onion and mashed potatoes (missing ingredients and potato masher on drying rack), and asparagus (pee smelled funny this morning). BTW, I'm a functional drunk. I actually do things. This was part of the problem that I didn't stop sooner. I wasn't getting into fights, breaking things, etc - so CLEARLY I didn't have a problem!  Sure, I can't remember anything from 4PM on, but that's OK - I'm not HURTING ANYTHING! Yeah...

And then a head scratcher. I cleaned a couple rugs. I don't do stuff without reason, and this begs the question - WHY did those rugs need cleaning?!? No clue, I cannot find any evidence at all.  But I have 2 clean rugs, so that's nice.  I'm missing a sock. Found a sock at the base of the bed, its mate is nowhere to be found. It was apparently abducted by aliens. I've no clue what happened there.

So, here I am. Day 1. Again. Gotta be back in meetings and staying focused on living a good life and not in the bottom of a bottle. Good on everyone here who's hanging in there! Reading these posts helps inspire me to stay sober myself! Best to everyone who's in this boat with me!",12,0

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens‚Äîgood or bad‚Äîand invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let‚Äôs not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn‚Äôt:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I have suffered from depression as long as I can remember. When I was young (like 13) they gave me all sorts of brain scans and blood tests to try and find out what was wrong with me. Personally I think that some meditation and direction could've cured me before the mental pathways were hard wired but it's too late for that now.

I'm now 34. I thought I was happy for years because I was doing what I wanted in life. I played gigs with my band most weekends, partied hard. Kept a reasonable job and had somewhat of a career. Unfortunately most musicians could never make it a profession after Napster, that came about while I was at college, so when I started with all the skills I learned it was completely viable for me to be a professional musician. However it certainly wasn't by the time I was in my band and we gigged all the time. But it didn't bother me. I had a good job to pay the bills and played lots of gigs for about 10 years and that's all I wanted.

Then the singer left and we split up. I realised I didn't know who I was. I had just been playing the part of a well adjusted individual. Covering up my insecurities with drink and drugs. I lost my identity. I was needy and had a stream of short term gfs that were more fucked up than I was. But I still held down a job.  A job I thought would be my life. I even joined a fairly popular band. But never felt like it was MY band. But still it gave me something to do. A way to be with people.

Fast forward a few years of partying like a college student at the weekends. Feeling like shit all week. Covering my depression and insecurities during the week by being stoned all the time and by being drink and sniffing things at the weekends. My behaviour wasn't great.  I lost friends. I eventually collapsed in the middle of my city and had to be taken to hospital.The girl I was seeing (boy did she mess me about) decided that was it for me. I was upset but should've been thankful, however it still hurt. I still didn't stop, but I had lost my job. This happened just before the lockdown.

I moved in with a friend. On his sofa. We took drugs everyday. throusands of ¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£s over 2 months. And drank when we could afford it. I could feel my insides melting. I was in horrible pain and couldn't think. One of my few remaining friends convinced me to go back to my parents. Thankfully they agreed.

I'm completely clean and sober now. I feel good most days. I go to the gym when I'm not recovering. I do yoga classes when they are on. I meditate most days (I need to get better at this). I read and I try to learn something new everyday. But I have a problem now I don't think can be solved.

I have never had so much free money, even though I am not working. I used to spend it all on substances/alcohol/ cigarettes. I don't even smoke anymore. It's not that I don't value money, it's that I have realised that what I got out of music was making people happy. That's why I used to like my job. I was providing a service that was essential.

The tech industry has changed on the level I was at. It became about hitting targets and sales and customers became rude. I don't need a job to keep my habit anymore. I would like a job for fulfilment though. And I would like some connection to people.

So my problem that I am seeking advice on is this; how do I connect with people on a proper level. Not the pseudo connections that facebook fakes when everyone in the world is attached to there phones like the notifications are crack and the phone their pipe?

I also want a job that makes a difference. I've tried to find advice for something like tree planting, wildforest fire trench digging, something like that. I would take suggestions for anything that helps people or the planet. No matter what the wage and I would consider relocation, even prefer it.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Want advice with job opportunities that benefit mankind or the world and need real connections with people. Thanks",6,1

I quit smoking by myself, and have gotten into and out of other addictions with much distance from anyone else.  I never needed anyone's help because my early life taught me to never rely on that and I somehow seemed to always succeed with that MO.

But I find myself finally warming up to the potential of positive things in life and from people and so here I am.  And things aren't really succeeding.  After two years of drinking once every three months, my frequency has slid up.  Still not every day, but at least weekly.  I hate it because I LOVED not drinking, and it made so much sense, and so I don't understand why I keep giving into the cravings so readily these days.  I think I just needed some time to not be so good at being disciplined.  But maybe that's what the power of this community is - transforms the discipline into celebration :)

I didn't keep track of the days when I first quit smoking because it would add pressure and I felt that would make me slip.  But I'm making a badge now and here because I think I'm ready to feel proud of myself for something.

I‚Äôve been in an on-again off-again relationship with alcohol for a few years now. Recently I took a nice, long road trip to break out of my normal routine and (again) leave alcohol behind. For a while, that worked really well - being on the road gave me something to occupy my mind and the unfamiliar territory helped to break out of old habits.  However, I love trying new things. When I landed in a city known for its breweries, I was tempted to try out local beers.  Before too long I fell back into my old habits.

Part of what helped me to avoid drinking was realizing that I already knew what ‚Äòdrunk‚Äô felt like and accepting that I didn‚Äôt need to feel like that again.  That was quickly overpowered by the desire to taste something new.  What I‚Äôm grappling with is: how do I avoid that desire? Do you accept that the consequences are just not worth the experience?  Do you ever feel like you missed out?

I'm going to flash back to a year-ish ago to last fall.

I was a 22 year old 4th year college student at a California college with a reputation for partying. To add to that I was also in greek life, so I was partying often and aggressively. \*\* The thing was that 3 years of partying had begun to catch up to and consume me. I was no longer drinking to go socialize, I was drinking for three days straight each time I picked up any alcohol and doing a lot of cocaine in that time. This meant my grades were slipping, my mental health was absolutely in the toilet, I was pushing away people who cared about me, and I had pretty much all the tell tale signs of developing (or full blown) alcoholism. I'd wake up with hangovers so bad I couldn't move for 36 hours, partly because my post drinking anxiety would pin me in bed and partly because I couldn't stop physically shaking from the hangover. It had gotten to a point where I was drinking for however many days I could and then would be hungover in bed until I could begin the next bender.

\*\* I'd also like to note that I'm a engineering major and a computer nerd so don't think you have to be a ""Chad"" to relate to me because that is not how I am.

Come February 2020 I pretty much had the option to get my life together or drop out of school and inevitably become a full time alcoholic. Well the path I chose was to stop drinking and god almighty am I glad I did. 

The path wasn't without a few hiccups though. Although I began my quest in February, around march (and the beginning of COVID) I had a bit of a relapse for a month. I had convinced myself I could casually drink since I had taken a bunch of time off (lol) and had also met a girl who turned out to be a massive enabler. Well I started off actually being able to casually drink, but three weeks later I was back in bender mode doing cocaine and drinking for consecutive days. In addition to my own behavior the girl I was with was more than willing to join me on my mission to blackout. Well early May I dropped the girl and took my last sip of alcohol. 

Since then my life has only improved. I had a legitimate job this summer, I'm doing better in school, and most importantly I'm generally happy again. Even with COVID and how much everything seems to suck some days, I still wake up knowing that at least I'm in control of parts of my life that I can be. Because I'm not too drunk or hungover to take care of simple responsibilities, I've been able to regain that sense of pride and purpose that comes with being a productive member of society. Now my anxiety has faded and my general outlook in life has gone up an insane amount. 

I still smoke weed because I'm ""California sober"" and I'm able to manage cannabis unlike alcohol. I'm not suggesting anyone should try this as it worked specifically for me and I can't speak to others ability to manage other substances. 

But what I really want to say here is for all the other frat star idiots out there who might feel like they're losing control over their lives to alcohol  exactly like I was:

You don't need that culture or those people. Your real friends stay with you even after you stop drinking and I've found the people who I only used to drink with are people I don't really like unless they're tossing me another beer. Being in control of your life and not being alcohol's little b\*\*\*\* is much more rewarding than being heavily involved in a glorified drinking club. It may seem hard to stop drinking, because it is, but it's possible. If I can do it, so can you.

 I spent over a year battling with the idea of quitting drinking and my journey is a lot more convoluted than I make it out to be in this quick summary. 

I'm happy to answer questions and reply to comments, I'll just be hanging out waiting for my drive to finish de-fragmenting.

&#x200B;

On Friday I hit my two months of sobriety. It's a bit surreal to think. The day itself was a bit chaotic but I didn't drink; so it was perfect. Today is a quiet one and I'm feeling a bit more reflective. I'm 23 and have moved back in with my folks after 60 days of sobriety. The day I decided to stop drinking I woke up forty minutes late for my opening shift at the cafe I worked at. I got drunk by myself the night before and smoked spliff till I passed out. When my alarm had gone off that morning, I rolled over and hit stop instead of snooze. It wasn't the most dramatic moment of my life, however the feeling of dread deep in my gut as I pedaled my bike towards town was sickening. I thought I was better. I thought my drinking wouldn't sneak into the public parts of my life yet here I was; sweaty, unshowered, smelling of beer and full shame. I loved my work and it had been such a sense of community for me. I couldn't bring myself to tell my sweet, older boss that I'd drank myself to sleep the night before. I was shakey and full of adrenaline the rest of the day. On my break, in the back room I ate my lunch and put ""When do you know you should stop drinking?"" into the google search bar. I'm sure you can all imagine the response I received. 

The first few weeks of sobriety I spent a lot of time listening to podcasts and sitting by the water. Life felt still. It continues to feel quiet. I am delicate and I feel raw but my days are getting a little easier. So, I'm grateful. I didn't drink today. I love you guys. Hope you are well.",45,0

Since then, they've been joking about how loyal I am and how I can beat up anyone when I'm 5+ drinks in (I'm a smallish woman).

I'm so embarrassed. I didn't hear about this until today because I blacked out and can't remember that night. I'm so glad I'm quitting drinking. I don't want that to ever happen again. I can't control my anger when I'm like that and it's pretty dangerous.

I'm a man, and I only  get *serious* cravings to drink when it comes to female related issues (or major life events). One of my best friends in the world and I have been hanging out a lot, and 2 years ago I had expressed my feelings (while she had a bf), and we agreed that being friends was best for obvious reasons (lol). Fast forward to now, she's single, we're hanging out a lot, but the possibility of me digging myself into a love-trap again is really eating away at me and I'm struggling hardcore to not pour myself a drink right now. Over the past 3 years I've developed this  reaction of wanting alcohol when feeling these sorts of stresses, and every minute it's becoming harder and harder to avoid having 1 or 2 drinks. I'm really proud of my counter right now, and I would hate to reset it. But I feel that I would possibly feel better with a drink or two. Has anyone else experienced this?

I'm feeling super low, I know the other side and I truly think my mind has changed towards drinking.  Im done.  Maybe this is a good thing, that I really can see that this isn't what I want out of life.  

I drank until I was drunk, and than i got back home and my sister and my girlfriend where drinking and they had cocaine.  I did that to.  

Something just feels different this time.  I know its not the answer but I dont even want to see anyone, atleast in nights that the booze is flying around.  I easily could have gone not drank felt good this morning and been productive. 

It feels like a waste.  I dont think I subconsciously want the booze anymore either  which is good.  I consciously made a decision to drink and it felt forced.  But I went ahead and did it even though I didn't like the effects, taste, any of it anymore.  I forced my self to do it So I could fit in.  That just kills me.

Some positive and negative results.,"Decided to stop in the beginning of September. Did the day by day routine. I found it was the first couple of days that were the worst craving wise, thinking that I could maybe just ""have a few"" which we all know what that turns into. But I didn't give in. 

You can usually tell when you are a person who relies too much on the dopamine reward in the brain. I'm one of those people. I'm extremely happy to have not drank for a month, however I do notice that I've been eating food quite a bit more. Weight loss hasn't been as optimal as I'd like. I do prefer the eating my calories versus drinking them, however. I feel like stopping drinking is just one step in the right direction. Been drinking lots and lots of tea and diet soda. Eating healthier and getting more exercise will hopefully come next. 

One of the most positive results is how clear and concise I can think and speak. It's been much easier to put words together and have a normal conversation without stuttering or forgetting specific words. I've found that I'm much more witty and I'm not as forgetful as I usually am. I've been reading up on the cognitive consequences of alcohol and I'm grateful to be giving my brain some time to heal. I feel like some of my hobbies that take some brain power & memory (piano, learning new languages) are becoming easier for me again. My hobbies and overall leisurely activities are becoming enjoyable, where I would normally need alcohol to enjoy them, especially PC gaming. (WoW, Starcraft, Planetside 2 for those interested)

A few more common positive results; my skin is damn clear, and no longer red or bloated. I have pictures of a day I was hungover in August, to a picture I took recently. Wow. Night and day difference. You can just see the warm and youthful skin coming back to life. Heart rate is no longer racing and my blood pressure is now normal, even low now that my medications are actually making me dizzy! Might have to actually go off of them eventually. The shakes are gone!

I could continue but I'll leave it at that. I know when I would lurk this subreddit I would mainly search/lookup the positive results that other people were experiencing for encouragement. Hope you have enjoyed reading my results.",5,0

But there's a part of me that is still so addicted to ""improving"", so ready to find a problem to attack, so desperately seeking another strong wind at my back, something big to change, that I've been losing myself completely to stupid frustrations, in the face of otherwise lovely little moments doing basic, normal, not-perfect things.

Somewhere in all this, I completely forgot about being patient, and have been trying to call things complete that are really only just beginning, and even then, at a pace I do not ultimately control.

I didn't get here in a day, or a year, and I don't have to run in top gear to survive, or have everything all cleaned up to enjoy what's enjoyable now. Good enough can actually be good enough for me. What an amazing concept.

This obvious yet novel serenity only comes in fleeting waves, but it's the new pink cloud, one I think I can get used to, if I can get out of my own way and just let it happen. The patience will get here when I let it. Wow.

By 10am when the family started stirring, I had a couple casseroles ready for the freezer, pork in the slow cooker for pulled pork sandwiches, and bacon on warm in the oven, just waiting for everyone's breakfast orders.

I've always enjoyed cooking, but the last few years during the worst of my drinking, I just stopped doing it. I rediscovered my love of cooking this morning. And am looking forward to getting back to it now.

Feeling a lot of shame this past week,"Last Saturday I drank. I have no real excuse for why I did I think just things have started to get to me and instead of contemplating and sorting them out in a healthy way I reverted back to my old ways and threw my sobriety out the window. I had to go to work at noon that day and decided to stop at a liquor store on my way in and bought a half pint of Jim beam. I drank half of it before I got to work and continued to drink the rest through my shift. I know I had my keys when I left work because I locked up the office when I left. I bought a 1/4 pint of Jim beam on my way home and drank that as well. 
My work keys have a clip and I (almost) always have them clipped to whatever pants I‚Äôm wearing that day and when I‚Äôm done with work they go in a specific pocket of my bag for safe keeping. Well sun and mon I wasn‚Äôt at work and then Tuesday morning came and I went to check to make sure I had my work keys before leaving the house. THEY WEREN‚ÄôT THERE. Idk what happened but I‚Äôve looked everywhere. I mean everywhere but they‚Äôre gone and I have no idea what I did with them. I feel so much guilt and shame. I deserve to. I drank before and at and after work which resulted in me loosing my keys and compromising the security of my job. I just feel like an immature chump. 
I‚Äôve drank more over the week. You‚Äôd think the above event would be sobering enough to make me not want to drink again but instead my shame keeps pushing me to want to drink more. 
So here I am at day one. It‚Äôs a beautiful fall Sunday but I‚Äôm not enjoying it. I just feel really down on myself. I know mistakes happen and everyone has lost something important but it‚Äôs how/why I lost my keys that‚Äôs eating away at me. Also I had almost 6 months of sobriety going for me and that‚Äôs gone too. I‚Äôm not giving up on my sobriety and I‚Äôve accepted that my keys are not going to magically appear and that they now live somewhere else in the universe.

Once I quit I didn't really have much in the way of cravings. Stopping was never really hard.  I was never physically addicted.  I did crave wine when I was drinking.  For me the issue was  when having a glass of wine or a cocktail, another glass always sounded good. What happened is that with my tolerance built up drinking quit working to chill out, so the reason for doing it was gone. Craving getting numb and not taking care of rudimentary things like keeping the house clean is a terrible state to live in.  It was ruining my sleep and making me fat and killing my wallet.

But I didn't want to drink. I was doing everything in my power to beat the cravings. I went to a meeting first thing in the morning. I had a plan. I bought a bunch of fun non-alcoholic juices and seltzers and sodas for me. I prayed a lot. But I was also pretty convinced that I would end up drinking.

The moment I was getting ready to leave, the host texted me to let me know that there was a problem on the bridge I'd have to cross to get to her place. It was shut down completely. It stayed shut down for hours and hours. By the time it opened up, it was too late for me to go. I think the gods decided to have mercy on me and heard my prayers.

I stayed home and got a good night's sleep. I woke up at 5:00 a.m. and went and bought breakfast for the people who had stayed over. The moment I saw their exhausted, hungover faces, I was so filled with gratitude I could have cried. I know now that socializing with drinkers at this point is dangerous for me.

What am I chasing at the bottom of the bottle?
Whatever it was by now I've surely swallowed.
 
Now my body is heavy upon waking as I just crave relief
My wallet is light from chasing my high by any means
 
More moral compass changes as I run low on funds
Now I'm contemplating doing things I never would have done.
 
I hear a voice in the back of my head saying ""Stop this isn't you!""
But I've already gone so far I respond ""What else do I have to lose?""
 
I'm just another addict who resorts to the bottle when I'm in pain
but how much longer before I'm dead or decide to change?
 
Through wasted times I've lost all my purpose
Now even the thought of life, well, it makes me nervous.
 
The bottle was a thief robbing me of peace
attempting and failing to use any substance as a release.
 
I've been filling a void for so long the old me is lost
but each day becomes clearing and I'm no longer engulfed in a fog.
 
With help I don't need the bottle to satisfy although at times I still think I do.
I'm being taught that once I get it and the high passes I'll just be back to craving something new.
 
I lived for so long as an extension of the bottle but am finding a new identity
Knowing now beyond any doubt if I start using again my using will embody me
 
The success I am aspiring to is now within reach, but I'm still hungry for more
so I keep going to every meeting letting fellow addicts move me forward.
 
I tell myself that I've got to stay sober and I know I can ""one day at a time""

Then also on weekends in the morning and again at night. But it eventually became problematic. In the past I have quit for a week or two at a time but that seems to be my wall. I think it's largely because I mostly maintain my work sleep schedule on the weekends i dont have my son so I'm up all night with nothing to do and very little to distract me or keep me occupied. This just leads me right back to drinking which just keeps going until next time I do something stupid and bring myself to trying to quit again,1,0

Every Friday and Saturday getting smashed. As a young shy guy I felt like I‚Äôd found my calling. With inhibitions lowered when I drank I was no longer the shy guy who was worried about talking in front of others. Instead I was completely the opposite and I loved it! However once the weekend was over I was back to my old self but even more shy, quiet and generally not liking who I was. Couldn‚Äôt wait for the next weekend to begin. When i‚Äôd gotten a little older the drinking really took off. The weekend suddenly stretched into Tuesday night, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and all day Sunday. Without realising alcohol had completely gotten the best of me and I continued down this road for maybe the next 5-6 years. Hating myself in the process as when I wasn‚Äôt drinking, I didn‚Äôt like myself. 

I‚Äôve always drank at home too since I‚Äôve stopped going out as much. And I drank far to much at home. I think everyone around me knew I had a drink problem (especially work colleagues), but never really addressed it with me. 

My drinking has held me back in so many areas of my life. Relationships have suffered, both professionally and privately. 

Fast forward to 3 years ago, and after being convinced by my partner to go to a charity-fundraising night (even though I‚Äôd told her I really don‚Äôt want to as I knew I‚Äôd end up drunk as a skunk), off we went and yep, I ended up smashed. Woke up the next day realising I‚Äôd missed most of the night due to blacking out (as usual) and felt SO ashamed. This was a place where people had come to raise cash for kids with health problems and I was off my head and probably talking shit to anyone who‚Äôd listen. Enough was enough. With my shame of the night I was determined never to drink again. I started reading about quitting alcohol and it was at this time, that I first realised I actually had a real problem with alcohol. It dawned on me how much I‚Äôd relied upon it and how I‚Äôd wasted most of my years due to the brew.  That‚Äôs how far I was in it. So consumed with booze constantly that I never knew it was a problem. 

The mission was on to become a better father, son, friend and partner. I managed to change my way of thinking about alcohol and it disgusted me. I went a full three months without drinking. The most I‚Äôd ever done since a started when I was 15ish. Pretty sad eh?  I felt so liberated to be waking up each morning without the fog of shittyness that the evil brew gives you. I was taking pleasure in everything I was doing. Everything felt like a new experience. I had more time and energy for my kids and my relationships. I felt like I‚Äôd cracked the demon. I was filled with so much more confidence in every situation. I was just generally 100% happier and healthier. My partner had a couple of nights out in this time and had come home rolling drunk. I remember looking at her thinking why are you doing this to yourself? I was actually really disappointed in her, but at the same time proud of myself as I knew she‚Äôd be feeling shit The next morning, but I felt great. I knew I was on the right road. 

For whatever reason I justified to myself (after getting asked to go out to the pub with an old friend) that I could maybe have the one beer as I felt in control. That was something I now realise I shouldn‚Äôt have done. After 3 months off the brew, the first pint tasted like absolute shit. I thought - how the fuck did I manage to pour this shit down my neck for all those years?! Anyway I maybe had 4 or 5 pints of beer that afternoon and so it once again started. In the first few months though I was aware that I‚Äôd changed my relationship with the brew, so when I drank I no longer felt the need to drink myself into oblivion which I suppose is a good thing. However since then, it has crept back up to were in once again drinking at levels I‚Äôm not happy with. 

I know deep down I have a problem with booze and really want to quit. But the evening comes and my attitude completely changes and I justify it to myself and run to the shop to get myself a four pack of beers. I completely forget how shit and ashamed I feel in the morning. That thought doesn‚Äôt even enter my head. The kids are in bed and fuck it - I‚Äôm having a few beers. 

I‚Äôll be honest lockdown did not help one single bit and feel it‚Äôs really got under my skin again. I did it last night and I‚Äôm sat here writing this feeling shit and as usual can‚Äôt be bothered to do a thing. 

I want to stop SO badly as I know how good I felt during my abstinence. But I can‚Äôt seem to stop. I need to get back into my old ways of thinking about the brew, where I look at it as poison. I find it really difficult as everyone around me (friends & family) drinks to excess so I think that holds me back. I don‚Äôt want to loose any family or friends. It‚Äôs not their fault. It‚Äôs me who tips the shit down my neck each night. Nobody is forcing me. I just feel like I‚Äôm at a crossroads. I‚Äôm 40 in January and would love to start my middle age years booze free. Be a better role model for my two young boys. And generally be a more awesome version and the best version of myself. I no longer have the self loathing if I‚Äôm not drinking (I work on a ship for 14/14 day rotation) so I‚Äôm happy in my skin when I‚Äôm at work. It‚Äôs a dry ship also so for half the year I don‚Äôt touch the stuff. So really I‚Äôve got an advantage over most in that I CANT drink for that time. I‚Äôm just drawn back to it. 

Suppose I‚Äôm writing this as I want to get control of my life...",5,1

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

&#x200B;

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hey all! Welcome to the check-in! Thanks to the mods for having me, and thanks to you lovely folks for being here!

&#x200B;

Since it's Sunday, I thought we could do a simple reflection thread.

&#x200B;

What went well for you this week? What was challenging? Did you kick some butt? Maybe you got your butt kicked a little bit; that's OK too. 

&#x200B;

We'd love to hear about it!

&#x200B;

For my part, I spent a lot of my free time this week reading. I'd like to share some quotes on motivation and goals from Bruce Lee's \*Striking thoughts\*.

&#x200B;

""I don't really worry about the reward, but to set in motion the machinery to achieve it. My contribution will be the measure of my reward and success. When you drop a pebble into a pool of water, the pebble starts a series of ripples that expand until they encompass the whole pool. This is exactly what will happen when I give my ideas a definite plan of action.""

&#x200B;

""One rarely reaches the goal in one step. The control of our being is not unlike the combination of a safe. One turn of the knob rarely unlocks the safe. Each advance and retreat is a step toward one's goal.""

&#x200B;

""Are you going to make your obstacles stepping stones to your dreams, or stumbling blocks because you unknowingly let negativity, worries, fear, etc., take over you?""

&#x200B;

""I begin to appreciate now the old saying 'he can because he thinks he can.' I believe that anybody can think himself into his goal if he mixes thought with a definiteness of purpose, persistence, and a burning desire for its translation into reality.""

&#x200B;

These really get me fired up, and I hope they resonate with you all like they do with me. 

&#x200B;

With that, let's hear some thoughts from your week! I'm sure we've all got some wisdom to share.

We ordered 2 pints of alcohol free lager. I knew as soon as I took the first sip that they‚Äôd served us 2 normal pints instead. I didn‚Äôt tell my friend. 

My addiction kicked in immediately, flashing up thoughts and excitement of carrying on drinking rather than being honest and returning the drinks. 

I ordered the next 2 rounds from my phone and intentionally ordered normal lager. My friend (who is not an addict and drinks moderately) didn‚Äôt even notice. 

We left the pub. I headed home, stopping to buy more beer and cigarettes (I hadn‚Äôt smoked for 645 days either). I got home, got really drunk, went out and bought vodka. Went home, drunk all the vodka, passed out, blacked out, peed myself, woke up next day, vomited for hours, called in sick to work. I felt ashamed, ill and suicidal. 

I haven‚Äôt told anyone any of this until now. I‚Äôve not drank since. I‚Äôve just reset my sobriety counter, which was really heartbreaking but I think the right thing to do?

I‚Äôm tortured about whether to tell my partner. She may understand or she may leave me. Feel so blue and confused. It‚Äôs a warning that you can never be complacent about your sobriety.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Update - wow, thanks for all the replies. I‚Äôm blown away. Feeling so glad to be sober and to have been honest to my amazing partner. 

Badge reset but that‚Äôs ok. I‚Äôm going to use this experience as a scary reminder of how easily booze can creep back in and takeover. 

I really love being sober and authentic and in control. onwards. I hope this thread helps others. 

Thanks.",1672,0

After a DUI at 15, plenty of strained relationships, and embarassing memories that only my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù remember, I have finally done it. Here are some highlights so far- (apologies for any format errors, typing on phone)

-Mental Clarity: I can finally think clearly and can stay focused 100% better than before

Sleep- I haven‚Äôt slept longer than 7 hours straight in so long, and now my sleep is never interrupted. 

Anxiety- I self-diagnosed myself in the past, but didn‚Äôt realize how much alcohol contributes to it.

Blood Pressure- I was Stage 2 Hypertensive with an average BP of 155/95. As of today, my BP was 128/78. (Liver enzymes went down too!)

*TMI* Normal Bowel Movements- This one is self explanatory lol. 

Hapiness- I feel happier and healthier than I ever have.

I apologize for the long text, but I have solely this subreddit to thank for this progress. I don‚Äôt post often, but any time an urge comes around, you can bet your ass I‚Äôll be lurking. To anyone starting, my best advice is to fill your time and keep busy, and remember how shitty it felt that day you quit. It might help persuade you.

Now that I am sober, there is nowhere to hide anymore- my life is right in front of me without filter and I can't help but feel lost, sad, and scared. 

In theory, I should be excited that I am now in an ideal position to change my life for the better, while I still can. Actually, that's exactly why I am choosing sobriety now, I have not even been close to hitting any sort of ""rock bottom"", and change is not forced upon me in any way. This is MY wish, to change my life. But it's still easier said than done of course. I drank a bottle of wine a night for around 6 years, I am obviously not good at ""dealing with stuff"". 

I read here all the time how life gets better in sobriety, but I am done waiting around for good to come to me. 

Did anyone MAKE major changes in their lives after getting sober? New job? Divorce? Move to a new place? Start over? Do you want to share your story of how you actually went about changing your life, and how it happened? Or how it's going if you still feel like in the midst of it? I love details!

Not drinking isn't actually difficult at all for me this time around. My view on alcohol has finally changed and I see it as nothing but liquid cancer and a roadblock to health, happiness, freedom and opportunity. It's doing the work that's required of me to stay sober and move towards my ideal life that seems like an unconquerable mountain right now. I am scared and honestly, still quite unmotivated.

I know I am still in the early days but, does it get easier? I wonder if I'm just not seeing light at the end of the tunnel yet, but it's just a bend and I'm not as far away as it seems. Or am I holding sobriety too high, will it not give me the superpowers I hope for?

Thanks everyone. I love being here with you all! Tomorrow marks 2 weeks for me and that's about as long as I've ever gone sober in the last decade so

Well to start off, I am an 18 year old male Alcoholism runs in my family. I have drank since I was 13, casually. At party‚Äôs, with friends, it was all fun and games. Key word there, it was for fun.

I am 18 now and I have had a very bad alcoholic time in my life. It started back around 4 months ago. I have a wonderful girlfriend for almost 1.5 years. She is very supportive. I come from a very toxic and abusive home so I was living with her. I suffer with bipolar actions and very very very bad depression. , and one day I was expressing how I don‚Äôt feel right with her and how I was leaving for a few days. We were talking and it got a little out of hand and long story short, her dad kicked me out of the house. So with no where to go I called my cousin to pick me up and take me to a hotel. He is an alcoholic, and I wasn‚Äôt at the time. My girlfriend went to the hospital that night due to mental issues, and the whole situation was a huge nightmare. At the hotel my cousin has brought some drinks. I won‚Äôt say names to not cause any triggers for anyone <3 . But i was feeling very low and that was the first time I drank out of sadness and drowning out the pain. And that night changed my life forever. I stayed at that hotel for 2 days and got completely plastered both nights. I got invited back into her house and I of course went back. But the alcohol didn‚Äôt stop. I was drinking light every day. Coolers, etc. It wasn‚Äôt a problem imo. But slowly it got into hard liquor. Fast forward it got very bad and I chose to left her house because it felt disrespectful to drink in her house, so I returned home. Everything went down hill. I started drinking around half a Mickey a night. And then a Mickey a night. Than it wasn‚Äôt enough. Started buying bigger and bigger bottles. I have treated like this girl like crap this whole relationship and the amount of guilt and shame I feel is unreal. 

And I didn‚Äôt want to feel it anymore. I started to black out every night at the toxic home, and was nice enough to stay with me and support me every night there.   I started spending hundreds of dollars or hard alcohol every week. That was month two. It still wasn‚Äôt the bottom, I still had myself. But month 3 was probably the worst period of my life. 

I started picking up 1.14L bottles and finished it in days. Drinking at nights turned into drinking all day. Than near the end of the month the weekend came along. I went into an insane bender and drank more than the human can handle. The weekend started and I drank probably half of the bottle. I don‚Äôt remember that whole day, and than Saturday came around. Same thing finished that bottle, it‚Äôs all a blur. Sunday I ordered another one without memory that I did and finished that bottle in 1 day. Again all a blur. 

But MONDAY. It was the worst. I was out of control. Let me just say I‚Äôm around 100 pounds, 5‚Äô4. I drank FIVE mickeys that day. It‚Äôs all a blur. I woke up Monday with some of the worst stomach pains I‚Äôve ever felt. Obviously. I‚Äôm surprised I woke up and honestly I didn‚Äôt want too. But after I woke up it was my rock bottom. I don‚Äôt remember that whole weekend. I woke up with self harm scars all over my body, I havnt eaten in days. I ended up reconnecting with my toxic mother which when I‚Äôm sober I know it‚Äôs the worst idea ever. She‚Äôs evil. That day I woke up, and threw away all my bottles. Me talking to my mother was my breaking point. 

That was the end. I got up and threw my bottle away. That day was just hearing about all these crazy stories I have no idea about. Trying to fight my neighbour, laying in my parking lot, banging my head into my hall hundreds of times, calling her hundreds of names. I‚Äôm surprised she is still with me. She doesn‚Äôt deserve this. That day was the end for me. I went cold turkey after a 3-4 month bender and I was fine with it. That was last Monday. Day 1 was very hard, increased anxiety, shaking, sweating, and I didn‚Äôt sleep that whole night. Day 2 exact same thing. Very bad anxiety and guilt, shakes, and again I didn‚Äôt sleep. Wednesday I got sent to the hospital. Because of the withdrawals, I didn‚Äôt eat for 4 days straight, I was awake for 52 hours, I peed once or twice in 2 days. I was a mess. I got treatment sort of. A dose of vallium and sent home. Barely slept that night. That was day 3. 

Yesterday was day 4. I barely got sleep again, started to slowly eat. 

Day 5, which is today something incredible happened. 
My girlfriends dad offered me there old car. I don‚Äôt even have my learners license. But that one deed changed my life it feels like. I was through the roof of excitement and possibility. This whole day I applied for dozens of jobs, and studied my ass off the whole day for that driving test. I worked out a little bit. I shaved my head, and decided to start a change. And honestly I feel GREAT. I did something for once. The little things such as working out, studying, looking for work it felt amazing honestly. It‚Äôs around 1:30am now and the craving is still there but I‚Äôm trying to look forward for the better things in life. As I once heard it‚Äôs either you choose alcohol, or everything else in life. And I want everything else in life. I‚Äôm back living with my girlfriend, and I‚Äôm hoping things fall into place in my life. I‚Äôm trying to stay away from the poison we call alcohol it‚Äôs a disease. I pray for everyone who is going and fighting demons out there. 

TO EVERYONE OUT THERE READING THIS. You can do it. If you‚Äôve quit you had the strength to put it down, and if you havnt quit and want too. It‚Äôs the first step. I promise you can do it. If I can, you can too! Sobriety is possible. Things will always go uphill if you put in the effort. Everyone you all are great people and Even though I don‚Äôt know you guys personally I have love for you. I‚Äôm just a stranger on the internet but please IF you need anything please just ask. Advice, an ear to talk too, purpose to get sober. I will do my very best to provide what I can. Happiness is out there waiting for you. There‚Äôs hundreds of recovery stories and those people are the same as us. It‚Äôs possible, and I and we all can do it! 

Thank you all for reading. I just wanted to say that putting down the alcohol is rough at the start. But there is no rainbow without a little bit of rain. It will get better. Sometimes motivation is lost but deep down you guys are all wonderful good people and know the right thing to do. Thank you :)",7,0

If anyone here is considering quitting id recommend replacing the oral fixation with seltzer water. If you feel boredom or discontent fill the time with things you used to do before you used alcohol. 

I have a question however. Is it possible to ever drink again once in a while? Or does it just restart the entire process? It seems like a stupid question but assuming I don‚Äôt go dry for the remainder of my life I want to be prepared to not fall completely off the wagon if I drink again.",12,0

Have no desire to continue how I was because it disgusts me and I know it‚Äôs not sustainable / I have too much going for me to not take notice and in turn action.

To me - I feel a lot of this whole thing is mental. You associate this and that in your life with alcohol. Then you see it in life. And you fall victim. You end up in a zombie like state of continuing habit. To me - screw that. There‚Äôs one thing in my mind and that‚Äôs being uninhibited. I‚Äôm young so I don‚Äôt feel the pains of very long term abuse but I can see the road. And I don‚Äôt want to continue on it.

I guess what I‚Äôm saying is - you can make this whole thing complicated in your mind. Or you can just do it. It‚Äôs never a perfect road. But it‚Äôs worth it. Be you. Fuck up a few times, it‚Äôs okay. Not justified. But it‚Äôs a part of the road for some people. Find whatever the hell makes you you. And do it. And you won‚Äôt even think to drink. Drinking in excess is procrastination. Be yourself. Don‚Äôt procrastinate the one thing that can make a thousand things better.

I feel amazing. I've achieved more with my hobbies in the time I've been sober than I have in probably 10 years.

I feel kind of weird though. In these last 40 days I haven't struggled at all. Like *at all*. Even after my best friend passed away. Normally something like that would have sent me on a month-long bender. But nope. Im dealing with my emotions like a normal human being. Very bizarre but refreshing.

Today I can hold my head up high. Today I don't suffer from anxiety. Today I'm proud.

I'm never going back.

It‚Äôs one day a month and it‚Äôs all couples and we know every single person in the league. I was reluctant when first asked. Both the bowling and dart leagues I have been in we‚Äôre the start of my binge drinking and alcoholism. These last two days with her celebrating her birthday were great and I wanted to keep the tide going. So we met up at a local pizza joint with all other 18 people in the league. So we were getting our drink orders I usually would have a Craft beer with the highest apv and tell everyone how much stronger it is than bud light and a shot of bourbon.  I had an Arnold Palmer. (I‚Äôve started ordering lemonade when we go out. Every place is different and it scratched that itch I had from when I would try new drinks.) so I ordered a dozen wings and so did my wife I was so excited to try new wings and lemonade I ate way way too many and drinking never crossed my mind. After I pigged out we went to the bowling alley and we played our games. My friend and his girlfriend who asked us are in our team. They are both sober and we ordered nachos cause bowling and I had a soda.  We cracked jokes laughed had a good time visited with all our friends who all were having a blast. Tonight was a night I didn‚Äôt want to end. I was so worried about the temptation and it just wasn‚Äôt there. These last two days being on my feet so much has been hell on my knees and usually the pain at night before bed. would make me turn to the bottle. I have a knee injury from falling down the stairs that time I was sober. I broke my kneecap in half and had to have surgery. Then 3 months later leaving a wedding that I was hammered I fell and re broke my knee. Should have quit then. However I took some Tylenol and an ice pack and it‚Äôs working. It was such a good weekend and I have to work in the morning and I just am so happy that I haven‚Äôt drank. Posting here every night telling people my success and how happy I am has been the main force to keep me sober and thank god I can brag about my little victories that are building into huge victories to you guys!

She doesn't have a problem with alcohol like I do. I just don't think she understands how this effects me. I'm not really sure what the purpose of this post is. Part of it is to organize my thoughts.

I was worried I wouldn‚Äôt have fun anymore without alcohol. The truth is, the things I was doing while drunk were only fun because I was drunk. After a couple weeks those things didn‚Äôt really hold any interest for me anymore. We have inhibitions for a reason!

I'm sure I've read a post or comment of your own in the past year and you're an inspiration to me. 

After years of delinquent drinking, I had an honest moment with myself a little over a year ago that I was depressed and medicating my depression with alcohol. It was a hard truth to face and something I was honest about within my close circle. 

I decided to make some major changes in my life. I threw myself into my new corporate job and ended a relationship with the man I was convinced I'd marry. I packed up the home we shared almost a year ago today, convinced I was embarking on a new, bright path. Somehow, I've arrived at alcoholism instead. 

About two weeks after moving into my new apartment, my roommate confronted me about my drinking. He was worried - his brother is an addict so he recognized the signs. We had a long conversation that night- he assured me he loved me and in return, I got much better at hiding my drinking. 

The day after I was hours late to a birthday dinner because of ""work,"" my entire team was fired. I had no notice, no time to speak to the 15 people who trusted me before they were unceremoniously fired in a group Zoom call. I celebrated ""just"" being demoted by drinking a bottle of wine and sobbing in the park behind my apartment.

I'd be lying if I said things have improved much since March. I've known for a year that I need to get ahead of my drinking, but it's getting harder and harder to stop the voice in my head begging for the silence. 

When my roommate moved out last month, I started writing IWNDWYT on my dry erase board every morning. I've yet to make it to Day Two. Erasing that board always brings its own flavor of shame.

I'm tired of constantly picking on myself for my shortcomings and failing to make changes. How on Earth can I better embody the strength of this group and start truly walking the path to sobriety when I can't even put on my sneakers?

Every failed Day One hurts more than the last. I'm worried I'm going to give up on myself if I don't get ahead of my shortcomings soon.

People say ""I can't wait to have my big glass of wine tonight"" and yada yada yada constantly and so far I've just smiled and nodded with them. This week finally a couple of people asked me point blank what I prefer to drink. I tossed off a line to the effect of ""through many years of trial and error, I've realized that the right amount of alcohol for me is zero"". Everyone smiled and laughed a little and nodded and the conversation moved on. It was not uncomfortable for me in the least. It was similar to telling someone that I don't like broccoli or something. 

The super nice lady who had actually asked the question came up to my desk about 20 minutes later and said something like ""I hope I didn't put you on the spot there about drinking?"" and I assured her that she hadn't at all and she lowered her voice and said ""I have more respect for you than you can know.""",164,0

I had mild alcoholism compared to most but definitely still an alcohol problem. Drank daily, started looking forward to a specific time when my wife would make dinner so I could start drinking, started drinking more because my tolerance had gone up, all that. It‚Äôs been nearly 2 weeks since I quit.

Since quitting, I‚Äôve had some anxiety/depression issues since I quit. I‚Äôve also been more needy. Main issue is anxiety but it‚Äôs mostly subconscious I think. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong idk.

I‚Äôm confused about the following:

Since quitting drinking, I‚Äôve been having abdominal cramps and what feels like larger amounts of gas than usual but I‚Äôm unable to actually pass the gas. I ALSO figured out I‚Äôm lactose intolerant at pretty much the same time and have given up dairy. Me quitting and me quitting dairy happened within a day or two of each other, not sure which one came first honestly.

Is it normal to get physical withdrawals that are worse than the mental withdrawals? Like... I don‚Äôt sit around thinking about drinking a lot. It crosses my mind, but I don‚Äôt yearn for it or sit there and have to fight the urge at this point. The mental part of the addiction doesn‚Äôt feel all that fucked up. However the physical is, at this point. Bugging the everliving shit out of me.

What are other people‚Äôs experience with quitting? I don‚Äôt have nausea or vomiting or any of that. My stool has been much looser than usual. On top of that, I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm having issues digesting stuff or if I‚Äôm having withdrawal symptoms still. I‚Äôm not sure.

My plan: I listen to stop drinking ted-type talks daily and quit drinking meditations to fall asleep (been doing this for a while), daily journaling, asked a close friend and my brother to be my accountability partners, and I filled a prescription of antabuse that I leave on my counter. And I stare at it every time I go into the kitchen. I don't want to take it. I know that if I drink I will get sick - that's a given. But I also know that if I by mistake I eat something with vinegar (I love salads), or swallow mouthwash or even use hand sanitizer, I will puke. That scares me. The antabuse and I stare each other down daily. If I end up drinking one day, the next day I will begin the antabuse.

I shuffle my hands around on the bed, under the pillow, under the blanket, under myself, trying to find my phone. I press the home button, its dead. ""Fuck,"" I think to myself before falling back into the pillow. I can feel the guilt streaming into the pits of my stomach. The snippets of the past events are starting to poke their ugly heads out.

I reach over to plug my phone into the charger, pushing the home button on my phone once again. *Fuck, can you turn on already?* I let out a sigh, hoping the guilt that has completely absorbed me is not the reality of the situation from the night before.

I rub my face and eyes, realising just how terrible I feel. For some reason, I still feel drunk. Not good drunk. Terrible drunk. An idea crosses my mind for a moment. I guess I could have another drink ‚Äì make this feeling of horror disappear. No, don‚Äôt do that. I sigh, realising this dilemma in my head is just another issue I feel guilty about.

I lay in silence, staring mindlessly at the ceiling while I contemplate. After what feels like a thousand years pass, I see my phone light up and the home screen appears. I sit up and grab it. Message. Message. Message. Missed calls. An email. Work group chat. Ugh.

I open my phone and am met with the ruminants of the previous, drunken night. I could already feel the sick building in my body as I hesitantly pressed messages. This would have to be the worst part because you are always met with the last words you sent out before you finally passed out. These messages were never good. All they ever did was fill me with regret.

\-  -

This has been my life for the past year. A vicious cycle of sourcing out a quick fix to my temporary problems and inevitably creating a scenario way beyond what I could have imagined when I take that first shot.

I never understood addiction to this extent. The notion of being addicted to a substance was always foreign to me because I always prided myself on being headstrong. How did people drink alcohol daily? That stuff makes me sick! But here I was, a high-functioning alcoholic who was in complete denial of the mental anguish this substance was having on me.

There is a common denominator to people suffering with a substance addiction and that is impulsivity. A logical, rational person would know the difference of what a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù amount of something is versus someone who is impulsive. Being impulsive can override logic and care, it can make the most normal person seem completely insane.

I am impulsive. The logic behind impulsive behaviour is that your bad choices are momentary. Your logic may be that this behaviour will not be forever. This could be as simple as, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll eventually stop‚Äù all the way to, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll stop when this eventually kills me.‚Äù It all stems from the notion that this will cure your momentary pain until it finally ends. The sad part of this logic is the pain will never end if this addiction prevails‚Ä¶ and some people do take this pain to their inevitable demise.

I actually made it to 7 days last week, then picked up a couple of drinks on my last supermarket shop as there was a little voice in my head saying that I can cut down without stopping completely. 88p for a Tequila cocktail in a can is a bargain (reduced!)... couple of those to try and then a bottle of wine for over the weekend. I've been telling myself buying pre-mixed cocktails is better because if I pour my own, I'll end up making it too strong. Drank the cocktails on Thursday night and felt like crap Friday, then half a bottle of wine last night and I feel crap again today. Woke up around 4am with a headache and stomach cramps, and I didn't even really enjoy it, it just feels like I'm trying to prove to myself that I don't have a problem. 

It's a while since I've been a really heavy binge drinker, but I am nothing if not regular - member of a wine club and always have a bottle of gin in the cupboard. I drink more days in the week than not, and sometimes it's fine, and sometimes if I open the bottle of wine I'll finish it and know before my head hit the pillow that the following day will be tough. 

So I'm starting again today. Going to pour what's left in the bottle of wine down the sink, and next time I'm shopping I'll stock up on non-alcoholic drinks so when I get a craving in the evening for something I can grab one of those instead. 

I can do it, I know I can. I have a deadline for my Masters degree on October 12th so I am at least aiming for that, I need a clear head to get my assignment done and I've sat in front of a laptop all day today just struggling to concentrate on it.",2,0

I was offered a full time position at my job after working there part time for 2.5 years. I felt so happy and like I'm finally on track. But I messed it all up. 

I was supposed to dog sit for my old dog walking boss as well as do some farm work for them while gone. I made the mistake of accepting even though I knew i quit because everytime I had a gig I would drink any alcohol in the house. I thought maybe it wouldn't happen, but as always, it did. 

I drank probably 16 shots of alcohol before 3 pm yesterday, drove around town and by some miracle did not injure myself or others. I barely remember anything that happened yesterday- when I got back to the house, the neighbor met me outside and said the dog was loose, id left the door wide open, and he could tell i was shitfaced. He ended up calling the cops and the owners and my sister came to pick me up. I wasn't charged with anything but I have lost all sense of self respect and feel steeped with shame. I am unbelievably grateful the dog is okay and I didn't hurt anyone but myself. I have the tiniest snapshots of what happened but I know i made a fool of myself and engaged in so much anger. 

I have a meeting to go to tonight and have no desire to drink today, but I dont know how to make it through the day today in general. I feel so lonely and done with myself. I could have lost everything and I have no one to blame but myself and my choices. I hate alcohol and how I let it consume my every thought and action. I tried to reach out last night and this morning to apologize to the owners, but understandably haven't heard from them. I completely embarassed myself and ruined my reputation. My stuff is still inside their house and I have no idea how I will ever face them if they contact me. 

I cannot keep convincing myself this time will be different. It never is and it never will be. I cannot drink alcohol and I need to learn how to live with myself sober. Im not sure what this post is for other than desperately feeling the need to say it to somebody. I need help, I need a sponsor, and I need to be honest with myself and others about where I am with my alcoholism.",25,0

I've been a drinker for many years, not too heavy, about a pint a day, but the past two weeks I went on a giant bend of drinking about a liter of vodka by the end of my run. I was supposed to go on a train to go back home after visiting my brother, but drank so much I passed out in the station and I missed my train. my brother had to pick me up and literally had to drag me out of there before the cops did. He gave me two choices, go to this detox he found or go to jail. I went to the detox, came in and blew a .42. it took almost three days for me to finally blow zeros. Detoxing from alcohol is no fuckin joke, you're miserable, depressed, you shake, you sweat, you ache, you can't sleep, and all you can think about is drinking to make the pain go away.  it's probably the worst experience of my entire life, and was the hardest fight I've experienced. I'm currently on day 6 of detox and I'm finally about 90% myself, but the past week has been the most miserable of my life.
I always thought I had my drinking on under control, I never drink above a pint today, but like they always say it gets progressively worse. To anyone out there trying to stop, please stop. It's not worth it. you'll be miserable, you'll lose everything you ever have and all you'll have is the bottle which will lead you nowhere.

Of course, personal responsibility is important, however, if your brain is not functioning properly giving up alcohol will always be an uphill battle. 

My aha moment came when I read an article on the connection between ADHD and addiction. I had already been diagnosed with a specific learning disability - Dyslexia and so I started to wonder if I had been misdiagnosed? Turns out ADHD is five to 10 times more common among adult alcoholics than it is in people without the condition. 

My understanding is that people with ADHD (ADD) have a lower amount of dopamine in their brains and thus, they seek out a 'dopamine hit.' Now, this can come from many different sources, including gambling (when they lay a bet and win), food (binge eating and unhealthy food which tastes good), and of course alcohol. 

Fortunately, if you go over to [r/ADHD](/r/ADHD) you will see that many people have had great success with medication and I have even read stories of doctors prescribing these meds for other addictions like binge eating. 

Also, I should note that it was sheer luck that I stumbled across this information and I know it won't apply to everyone but if I can help even one person by sharing here then this will have been worthwhile. Please check out the symptoms of ADHD and get tested if you think you might have it.",13,0

I am excited to be asked to contribute to the SS this week. I‚Äôve always wondered if I would ever take the time to share my history here as I am one that always thinks my contribution is insignificant.  But, I had to realize for one, this is not a competition and for two, we all share some traits, you and I. Drinking too much and coping with alcohol to the point our lives are dysfunctional.

I didn‚Äôt start in my teens like many. I was in my 20‚Äôs and I began to drink to fit in with the crowd. I had the reputation of being a good girl. Too good for a lot of people. So I drank to shed that image and I replaced her with someone I am not. Alcohol did that for me and at the time I was happy about it. I stepped right into my new role. Party girl!! There were lots of ups and downs as I entered one relationship after another.  I dropped out of college because I couldn‚Äôt maintain my school, work and party life. Alcohol understood my decision and helped me to soothe myself into thinking I can always go back when I get my life together. Ha! College never happened. 

The man I chose to marry was a huge mistake. Our relationship was very volatile. He did a lot of damage to me physically, mentally, and emotionally. Alcohol was our biggest connection. We both drank to excess and we both behaved badly. We shouldn‚Äôt have ever married, but we did. For 11 years. During the last couple of years I did quit drinking to try and salvage this made for tv marriage but I was just in denial. Finally someone got thru to my brain that I had to leave but this time for good. And I did. We didn‚Äôt have children and I‚Äôve never spoken to him again. And to cope with this bruised and beaten down existence, I started drinking again. Just took right up where I left off. 

Enter marriage #2.  We didn‚Äôt get married right away. I was too afraid. Life so far had taught me men don‚Äôt stick around long anyway, why complicate it with another marriage? He just was different though. He never pushed me into anything I wasn‚Äôt ready for. And he had been thru it too with bad relationships so we took it slow. And I kept drinking. Even when he said he was worried about me. Our biggest issue was my drinking too much too often. He drank too but not like me. He never took it that far and he didn‚Äôt drink every day. We started off on pretty shaky ground but after 7 years of living together, we got married. Somehow we are still together 23 years later. 

By 2013, I had tried to quit drinking in earnest a couple of times. But only to reset so that perhaps this time I would become a normal drinker like my husband. I never had a different goal in mind. Then, my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. Thus began the hardest year of my life. I drove hundreds of miles every week or so to be with her and help her in any way. Then she was hospitalized and I took a leave of absence at work and stayed in the hospital for what became her last 2 months. I managed to stay sober except for 3 times when I got the opportunity to drink, I did. But I was too consumed with her well being to worry much about mine. After Mom passed, the stress only went up. My husband was being transferred to another state and we had to move. Again. Moving every 4-5 years makes my life so unstable. I honestly don‚Äôt know if I have another start over left. I was very unhappy with the move for too many reasons to list. The spiraling down had begun. 

During the last couple years prior to my mom‚Äôs death, I had gotten into a little bit better drinking routine. I was working out at night so it didn‚Äôt leave me much time to consume and I was physically too tired. But weekends were still available but I mostly chose low alcoholic beverages. But now that we‚Äôd moved all of that was gone. I was pissed and I didn‚Äôt care if I was stomping on boundaries. My moderation rules were nonexistent. I was not happy and I drank a lot. I blacked out and my body couldn‚Äôt take the toll anymore. My body was toxic. I gained lots of weight, my skin was horrible. My eyes were affected the worst because I take prescribed drops and inflamed is only way to describe them. They hurt everyday all day long. I was miserable. And miserable to be around also. I knew this isn‚Äôt the life I intended to live. Not even close. I googled how to stop drinking and this sub popped up. That very moment as I began reading, I had hope for a better life. Was this the missing piece to my puzzle? Like I said earlier, I had never considered not drinking other than to reset to moderate. I wondered if it were even possible for me. I had many doubts. The last time I had tried to put it down I lasted a couple of days. I failed. 
But, I joined Reddit that day and even though I kept drinking a little seed had been planted. 

After 2 years in the chaos we chose to move back to our home in TX. Our marriage was on the edge. We weren‚Äôt happy but neither would give up. I saw the future and it wasn‚Äôt what I wanted. What I wanted was the sober life I had been reading about. Yes that‚Äôs what I wanted. I prayed this would finally be my path to the life I wanted. I read nothing but recommended books or quit lit my first year. I was not about to let my subconscious take me back to romanticizing alcohol ever again. I did not hang out with people who drank. I checked in daily with DCI. I rewarded myself with every milestone in my first year. I also took over our lawn maintenance! They had pretty much killed our lawn and I told my husband I can do that for free!! It was like a joke but it gave me a place to think, scream, and physically work out my emotions. And just shy of 4 years later I‚Äôm still doing it AND getting compliments on the lawn.
To be honest, I didn‚Äôt think our marriage would make it. I didn‚Äôt quit drinking to save it. I quit to save me. The first two years of my emotional roller coaster were rough. My thoughts were maybe I will be alone but I‚Äôm not going to cave. By the third year, and after some dr recommended supplements, our lives improved considerably. Apparently, there‚Äôs a gut connection to health and mood! 

I know this is long and it‚Äôs condensed as I am 58 now. I wasted a lot of my life because I chose poison it. But MY future is not what it used to be. Our lives are now pretty simple, by choice. I surround myself with good friends and family and my fur babies. We are working toward our goals and pretty excited about a couple that are coming into fruition this month! We added a pool and pergola so that we have an outside escape from busy work lives. We are building a life we don‚Äôt want to escape from and it‚Äôs working for us. I will use my life to warn others about the sad story Alcohol really is. Life is too precious to let something so worthless destroy it. Most of all, I will not drink with y‚Äôall today!!

My gout flare up is gone. My dermatitis flare up is gone. I slept through the night without waking up once - hell, I don‚Äôt think I even turned to the other end of the pillow.  I woke up clear-headed and relaxed and not guilty.

Right before I started drinking again, I was at my lowest weight in a decade, and this morning I nervously stepped onto the scales, and was shocked to see that I was only 2 pounds above that lowest weight.  

I have not lost the progress that I had worked so damned hard to achieve. 

I swear to God, I almost cried on those scales.

It‚Äôs not the weight in itself - it‚Äôs the fact, which I only just now noticed, that I fucking hated myself when I was drinking again. And I am so glad to have come back to the person that I want to be - the person that I am.

I have NEVER in my life said, ‚ÄúI am blessed,‚Äù because it‚Äôs not the sort of language I would ever use, but I am saying it this morning.

I am an alcoholic. When I start drinking I don‚Äôt stop until I run out of booze or consciousness.

I am not running from that reality anymore, nor am I ashamed of it.  

God, to wake up a free man, to not be in thrall to the booze I drank last night, there is no feeling like it.  I am blessed, I really am.

I will not drink with you today.  And I am standing back up today, brushing myself off, and hoping to God that I can stay strong and sober.

What am I chasing at the bottom of the bottle?
Whatever it was by now I've surely swallowed.
 
Now my body is heavy upon waking as I just crave relief
My wallet is light from chasing my high by any means
 
More moral compass changes as I run low on funds
Now I'm contemplating doing things I never would have done.
 
I hear a voice in the back of my head saying ""Stop this isn't you!""
But I've already gone so far I respond ""What else do I have to lose?""
 
I'm just another addict who resorts to the bottle when I'm in pain
but how much longer before I'm dead or decide to change?
 
Through wasted times I've lost all my purpose
Now even the thought of life, well, it makes me nervous.
 
The bottle was a thief robbing me of peace
attempting and failing to use any substance as a release.
 
I've been filling a void for so long the old me is lost
but each day becomes clearing and I'm no longer engulfed in a fog.
 
With help I don't need the bottle to satisfy although at times I still think I do.
I'm being taught that once I get it and the high passes I'll just be back to craving something new.
 
I lived for so long as an extension of the bottle but am finding a new identity
Knowing now beyond any doubt if I start using again my using will embody me
 
The success I am aspiring to is now within reach, but I'm still hungry for more
so I keep going to every meeting letting fellow addicts move me forward.
 
I tell myself that I've got to stay sober and I know I can ""one day at a time""
Those 5 mores are what I grasp onto when it feels as though I'll lose my mind.
 
All those past years I had spent wasted never essentially went to waste,
for they can be harnessed and used as an example of how not to live my old way",5,0

Obviously my normal sleep patterns are all out of wack but honestly that's something I've experienced regularly for my entire life. The thing is, I haven't dreamt since I was about 10 years old (for context I'm currently 29 years old). I'm really hoping that this isn't something that continues long into sobriety. I wake up with my heart racing drenched in sweat and the feeling of stress continues for a few hours after. I wouldn't call them nightmares exactly, but more like weird and unexpected scenarios that I have to deal with. Many of these dreams are hard to explain. But a simple one is a scenario where I show up early to open the store I work at only to find a crowd of customers who are very angry at me because I wasn't available to serve them well before the store even opened. The rest of the dream is pretty much me handling the situation at the store (which has suddenly completely changed layouts and with different employees). In the end every customer leaves happy after praising me and I get to close early for some reason, hence why I wouldn't call it a nightmare. 

Anyway, I apologize for the wall of text. Honestly typing this out has been a good distraction from my desire to drink so I added way more than was probably necessary.

We had an absolute blast I woke up at 745 because she let me sleep in but that Meant I had 15 minutes before we had to leave to get to the zoo on time lol. So we live in Cincinnati and it‚Äôs like a 2 hour drive. So we got to the zoo with the kiddos had an absolute blast walked all over saw a lot of neat animals and rode the rides and our daughter loved it. Since we were done around 2 pm we decided to go to do some shopping I went into golf galaxy and she went to tj maxx I found a driver that I had been wanting was on sale. I called my really good sober friend  who is also my golf buddy and was like ‚Äúhey man you need to talk me down‚Äù he responded with ‚Äúdude where are you I‚Äôll meet you.‚Äù So I realized that I was talking about dropping 300 bucks on a driver he thought I was going to slip again. I immediately backtracked and explained what I meant that I was in no danger of backsliding and he laughed and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen you drive and no amount of money will ever help that.‚Äù Had a good laugh and just chatted for a minute. After I hung up I felt immediate guilt for worrying someone. However I realized that all day I hadn‚Äôt even thought about booze. Not even when calling my buddy who would immediately think I was drinking. It felt good. To make things more complicated my wife told me to buy the club. I didn‚Äôt I‚Äôm gonna sleep on it lol. Today was a great day and none of it was ruined by alcohol. We had a good family day where dad wasn‚Äôt pissed off because he was hungover and doing something other than sleeping it off.

They are an older lesbian couple and in the summer I help them with their yard work because they both have health issues and their yard only takes 10 minutes for me to mow. We sat on their porch and talked they offered me a beer and I declined and told them how long I had gone and they were both so happy because they have seen me get out of control.

The thought of giving up alcohol forever means probably changing my friend groups with my oldest friends, no more after work beer trips with the boys, and so many other things I love about alcohol. The thought of quitting doesn't sound fun. It's kinda scary actually.

Right now, in life, I'm 28 years old. Let me tell you that right now in life, I'm more lost than I ever was before. I'm not at rock bottom. I hit rock bottom once and climbed my way back up. -- A few years back I joined this subreddit on a different account, managed to quit drinking for 2 years. I did this so that I could put my life back together. 

I'm not entirely sure if I'm an alcoholic, but I know that I am some kind of drug addict. Even if I'm not doing a lot of something, I always come back to it as a means of escape, and I would rather not.  


During the two years of my sobriety, every day was a struggle. I saw areas of my life improve: my mental health, my financial status mostly. I even went back to college for a few semesters. That's something I never thought I would do.

Now that I have your attention I'd like to say that I have schizoaffective disorder, a disorder characterized by transient hallucinations and delusions, mixed in with bipolar depressive. I don't want to turn you off from this post because of this. I also have features of OCD, where I have intrusive thoughts around people...  


Somewhere along the line I lost my identity. It's like my entire young life was based around drugs in some way. All of my favorite bands from before I used drugs and alcohol wrote songs exclusively about drugs and alcohol. I have a hard time letting go of this. All of my t-shirts are heavy metal shirts.

&#x200B;

I'm fearful of people. I never show my true personality to others and instead show them fake personalities that I invent just to get through the interaction. In reality, all I want to do is be a sober person who watches anime and knows how to enjoy life and have fun. I really want to love cute things, listen to dance music, get rid of all my heavy metal shirts and forget my past. I want to embrace a new me and express a new type of personality. The trouble is whenever the going gets tough, I fall back on my old personality traits. The ones that glorify alcohol and drugs...  


Every day I get up and try to do something to improve myself and my situation and I just keep making mistakes. People don't like me. I get angry at strangers and act sort of threatening. I don't know how to be nice anymore.

&#x200B;

I know that in order to become this new me that I invision, before it's too late, is to give up all of the things I used to love. Black Sabbath, beer, music about weed and other drugs, all of that stuff has made me feel worse. It's in my blood. It's how I am. It's my life and it needs to change. I have even threatened my roommates recently over a broken heart, I threatened them in a really bad way. I've made so many mistakes that can't be apologized for.  


How do I get rid of all of this anger? How do I quit booze for good and feel good being sober... I hate being sober, it's always just an uphill battle. How do I become a new me before it's too late. 

&#x200B;

Do I throw away all my metal shirts? Do I stop listening to all of my favorite music? Do I just forget about who I am and become an empty person at 28? I've tried to do it for years but I don't ever feel like a full human being unless I'm being the mean, toxic person that I must truly be.

I had 214 days when I fucked up. My blood levels were back to normal and I felt amazing; I had no intention to drink again anytime soon. But a gentle reminder that it creeps up on you.

Excuses excuses, but I had a lot going on. It started one night when my husband was out and I was cooking. Cooking was an early days trigger for me, and with my husband out of the house I was day dreaming about drinking alone (I know, sad). I opted to taste a spoonful of wine and remembered how terrible box wine tastes and felt like I‚Äôd conquered a mountain.

The next night was a Thursday. Mind you my husband has been out of work due to Covid, and without going into detail, my job has been going through some changes that haven‚Äôt put my team in a good spot. Husband was gaming so I decided I could just have a glass. Still tasted gross at first, but after half a glass I was feeling warm and relaxed for the first time in ages. I had vacation starting after the next day of work, and I felt like I deserved it, so I had another glass and promptly felt drunk. I felt like a combination of a failure for drinking and also weirdly relaxed and like maybe I could moderate (spoiler: I can‚Äôt!)

I got through work the next day, only to find out again without detail that there was a wild ride of infidelity in my friend group (seriously, a soap opera), and we both realized it was going to rip everything apart between our friends (it did). While trying to pack I told my husband I felt like I could drink while we were on vacation. He‚Äôs been drinking heavily to cope with his job loss, so he was happy to have his drinking buddy back. I drank more that night. I drank before we got on the plane the next morning. I‚Äôd have drank on the plane if we were allowed to but couldn‚Äôt because of covid. I ordered a beer when we got to the resort, and it just went downhill from there.

214 days and suddenly I was back to throwing up in the shower in the morning. I looked at myself in the mirror and told myself I was done when we got back. My husband was drunk the whole time we were there, culminating in a huge argument about his drinking. I felt so sick by the day we left, and promised myself I was done. And I stuck by that.

For two weeks. I had a long weekend and my brain went ‚Äúbut vacation!‚Äù My husband had quit with me this time, but we just jumped back in. First it was just for the weekend, then a couple sober days, then we were back to it again. 

We had another vacation coming up (between these two, almost all of my vacation time for the year), and at that point my anxiety was so bad that I barely wanted to do anything. Drank the whole time, and spent most of my time dreading going back to my job the next week. My anxiety was back in such a way I spent half my time thinking about ways I could injure myself so I couldn‚Äôt work for a few weeks.

We got back and kept it up for a week.

But I was determined. I knew why I was feeling so anxious and upset. Things haven‚Äôt gotten better with my job, friends have been a mess, and my husband is still out a job... But booze is what was making me feel like trash. I missed the gratuitous amount of tea I used to drink. I worried that my blood levels were probably back up at this point.

I felt like I threw away over 200 days, but I realized something. With the two weeks I spent sober after vacation 1, I had 227 days total this year. With three months left in the year, I can still get over 300 days in 2020 total. For someone who hasn‚Äôt gone more than 30 days in the last ten years, I think that‚Äôs still a pretty big accomplishment.

Amazingly, the physical side of things is fine. I have no sweats, shakes, or anything like that and this is a guy who would down anywhere between 1.5 and 3 bottles of white wine an evening, in addition to a couple of G&T‚Äôs. 

What I‚Äôm finding hard is the loneliness. I‚Äôm married but she has no interest in me. We‚Äôre more like housemates who look after the kids together. I sleep in the spare room and she spends all night talking to her friends and scrolling social media. I‚Äôll ask her a question and get ignored. I have no friends anymore (a common issue for married men my age) and can‚Äôt get out as she complains at that. Drink was my escape and it would turn off reality and make everything less painful. 

Now it‚Äôs gone, which I know is for the best, I‚Äôm struggling with keeping myself occupied whilst she‚Äôs chatting away inanely. I‚Äôm sure others here have faced a similar situation of sobering up to an unfulfilling and lonely life, despite everything looking rosy on the outside.

Then I‚Äôll go to the beach because it looks like it‚Äôs going to be one of the last hot days of the Fall around here. And I already know I can have a good time at the beach without a drink because I already did it before during my last streak.

Then I‚Äôll be meeting my friend for dinner at one of our favorite ramen/sushi spots. Her dad died of liver disease (granted, it was Agent Orange), but it still serves as a reminder. I remember how hard his death was - for both him and her.

Life‚Äôs good. I don‚Äôt want to live it in a haze, a blur, or stupor anymore. I don‚Äôt want to hurt myself anymore.

Not that this is an extraordinary feat,but I'm 20 days sober off booze today.

I spent almost a week in the hospital 2 weeks ago, with my 5th bout of alcohol induced pancreatitis (one the most painful things a person can go through which can last for weeks and can be fatal, they equate it to being in labor but worse and these days they won't give you pain meds even if you're writhing in pain and screaming in the hospital bed)

On the second day I was in there day my father in law died suddenly (who was my mentor and the closest thing I've ever had to a dad) and it was days before my 5th year wedding anniversary.

After discharge, you still have intense pain and they prescribed me high dose Tylenol which is useless.

So ill take a few hits from a low dose THC or CBD pen sometimes for pain. Doesn't do much, but it's better than nothing. To me, this is my sobriety.

I plan on keeping this going because booze isn't worth it but living is. I cant bare the thought of going through a serious case of pancreatitis again (although one time it happened I was almost four years sober at the time) Plus, my wife needs me. Now more than ever.

My favorite season has arrived, and I've gotten back into my main hobbies instead of drinking every night(photography and woodburning) I feel better than ever and thats all that matters.

You can all do it too. Find something you love doing, even if you aren't good at it. And remember that the people around you want and need you to be healthy. You can't help others if you can't help yourself.

It‚Äôs the choice to turn to alcohol on a daily basis to take the edge off and numb those feelings of anger and frustration where motherhood takes a wrong turn.

Why I have a problem with the mommy wine culture:

üíî""Mommy needs wine to cope with the kids.‚Äù That‚Äôs heartbreaking. That means we‚Äôre saying our kids are such a burden that we have to drink to deal. How will they ever believe they‚Äôre good enough for anyone else if mommy didn‚Äôt make them feel like they were for her? 

üíîNot addressing a real potential underlying problem. Often ‚Äúmommy‚Äôs nightly medication‚Äù is being used to help with anxiety, depression, or stress. Instead of seeking professional/healthy help we are taking part in something that has been proven to make anxiety and depression worse. And your stress isn‚Äôt going to get much better after waking up with that massive hangover! 

üíîKids notice more than you think. They will grow up to think they need to turn to alcohol to handle certain situations. 

From a USA Today article, ‚ÄúWhen society encourages functional alcoholism among mothers because it‚Äôs the cool thing to do, it‚Äôs not only mothers who will suffer the physical, mental, and spiritual consequences ‚Äî it‚Äôs our children who will feel devalued and feel like they are a burden to their parents. We aren‚Äôt seeing our children as our heritage, as the gift they are to us when we encourage the Mommy Wine Culture. It needs to stop before mothers risk missing out on the lives of their children because they are too drunk to notice them.‚Äù

The point of this post is to not make you feel bad for enjoying wine at the end of the night. I wish I could just settle with just one. But that‚Äôs not how it ever was for me. Some people who were close to me never knew how bad my problem was. You never know who else around you could be having problems. So before offering a stressed momma a bottle of wine just ask her if she‚Äôs ok. Ask her if she wants to talk about why she‚Äôs stressed instead.",25,0

At the end of the day I nailed the interview, and the manager assured me that he would hire me on the spot, happily, if circumstances were different. He asked me to just sit tight and give him 2 weeks to see where everything's at, and reminded me that I'm the #1 candidate to get hired soon.

But I realized I‚Äôm not starting over, I‚Äôm picking back up. That break away from alcohol did happen and all those days were spent sober. I only gained from that - and I learned a lot about myself and the benefits of sobriety. I didn‚Äôt lose that when I drank again.

April 1st came and I actually got an even better paying job. 

I guess I was just bored and maybe lonely but I thought I'll have a few. 

It's been 5 months of me slowly slipping back into old habits.

I'm tired all the time. I'm sad and angry all the time. I'm getting fatter. 

And the worst part is that my professional life is great, it feels like there's no consequences to being a total shit-head when I leave work.

I keep thinking there's going to be an atonement. Like my mom is going to show up at more door and slap me. 

And for a little while I thought, ""Maybe this is who I was always meant to be""

And I was dead wrong because I feel miserable.

Laying in a dark room on a Saturday afternoon and being too hammered to go to my niece's birthday party isn't me. That's selfish.

I don't want to be the drunk uncle.

2834,2020-10-02 11:52:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/j3x1x2/an_irrevocably_heavy_month_without/,"An irrevocably heavy month, without","Hi, friends. Today is one month for me.

I've had to rearrange a lot of mental furniture in this time and there were times where I really missed how my brain felt before getting sober. Times when I couldn't sleep, when I was bored locked in my apartment, when I had to make phone calls that I didn't want to, when I had a particularly deflating day with work.

Those were all mildly unfortunate things in the short term, but honestly so fuckin' insignificant in the big picture. They are all just part of the mosaic of wonderful changes in my life: I sleep fully, I'm awake before 7:30 every morning, I have the energy to get into the gym 6 days a week, I cook thoughtful dinners, my brain is glowing fiercely, I mean I could go on all day.

Know what the main thing is, though? I'm experiencing this entirely new form of self-respect. That's the golden goose so far. My head is tilted up high 'cause I know I was not enjoying my life and so I did something to change it. And my life got better. Maybe marginally better, maybe it took some time of, yknow, not feeling better, but its now gotten better. Simply: my quality of life has expanded, rather than contracted. It truly that simple. I don't brag about it to anyone **but** I am proud to share with them that  I had a pretty heady dependency on my routine of booze and that it wasn't sustainable, so I did something about it. That's a new confidence that I absent-mindedly-and-pleasurably spin in my hands like a lucky nickel.

This thing we do, it's not the same for everyone. Y'all have your different partnership with alcohol and it's degree of influence in your life varies widely. I have a hard time relating to some stories that I've read here over the years, and it's because my experiences, clearly, were different. But this, r/stopdrinking, is my favorite damn thing on the internet because I get to experience pride in you all confiding that kind of thing with me, and with us- the good!, the bad, and the really really really bad. There's some *fucked up* stories through this sub, some shit that even I would take pause and consider before sharing with Reddit.

But the fact is that you did.Why?

Because you knew that it's just necessary to say it aloud. You know that if anyone could relate to some of this shit, it's probably the weirdo's here on  r/stopdrinking. (*And of course please know I use that term endearingly*). Let's face it- no matter how sad or broken your worst moment was here with booze takin' over, I can systematically guarantee someone else's here has got something worse. 'Cause that was booze be like sometimes.

I was gradually more wary of the person I was cultivating over the years, as I just got more and more comfortable with my habit of drinking every. single. fucking. day. Honestly, sometimes I did the mental math of trying to remember the last time I went a day or two without being drunk and I honest-to-dog couldn't. That probably sounds mild to some of you but for me: that was a pretty significant next stage revelation for me. Classic scenario: sitting pleasantly-blurred on my porch, chain-smoking for hours and not going inside to finish recording something I started earlier that night- considering to myself how I've never experienced what I would identify as a *rock-bottom moment* and that perhaps it wasn't quite time to *get around to cutting back* (I find my brain talks in a lot of *italics* when I'm drunk, similar to someone who's shit-faced and waves their hands around wildly to explain the simplest thing.)

But jesusfknchrist- that was the moment for me, I truly think: why in the living hell am I trying to anticipate, man alive- almost **planning** the damn thing- that moment of rock-bottom? What was I expecting in trying to consider the logistics and the angles and blueprint for myself what would happen if I was so fucked up that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?

I didn't want to wait around, so I stopped drinking! It's simple.

I don't want to wax here and sing you the greatest hits- ""*If I can do it, you can!*"", ""*I lost 9,000 pounds from not drinking!*"", ""*All the money I spent on hooch I invested in Tesla stock and now I'm a brazillionaire!*""- because a lot of people need some kind of iridescent neon sign of every problem you have is solved when you quit i**nsert debilitating habit here**. But yo, it's the only way to start. God damnit- the only way to change your situation if you're not happy about something is to, quite literally, do something else. You won't be able to do the things you used to. There will be seismic shifts and a thorough readjustment with your days. But why is this so terrifying? If you decide that your quality of life overall hasn't improved when you: stop paying money for depressants that waste your time, pretty much impair any semblance of motor skill coordination for hours at a time, getting over-emotional af and textin your ex at 3AM, make you fat and tired-looking, saying some shit that you're going to be rubbing your face the next day and saying ""*oh no*"" and ""*why did I say that*"", eating like shit, feeling like shit for more than half the waking hours the following day, filling your brain with an impenetrable fog, messing up your teeth, fucking up your natural libido and ahem, blood-flow in general-

I mean, if you vote that things overall were better, then you can just go back to drinkin'.

'sbeen a wild month. I'm very glad to be here with you, and I am humbled every day with your kind words and thoughtful stories and general compassion for one another.

2835,2020-10-02 11:49:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/j3wzka/absolutely_scared_of_the_weekend/,Absolutely scared of the weekend,"Hi everyone!

I have read some very kind messages and seen very supportive people over the last couple of days and it has helped me a lot, so thank you for that! But, I have something on my mind that I need to share and it scares me to death to share this as I have NEVER said this to anyone before. A little warning before I start, this can turn into a very long post, my apologies for that.

I'm a guy from the northern part of the Netherlands and when I just started drinking I never had any problem with alcohol. When I was 16 you were allowed to buy alcohol here. Back then I hung out with friends or we went to a bar once a week, usually on Saturday. When I turned 18, things went downhill. I had some relationship troubles and found myself in situation were I was being used for attention and buying things for them, now I think by myself how much of an idiot I was back then, but I guess love made my blind.

It started from 3 drinks per evening, just to make myself feel a little better, ofcourse this is the wrong approach but back then I didn't know about that. Later it turned into more drinks, but I never went over my limit. I was too scared of waking up feeling sick the next day, ofcourse most of the mornings I still woke up sick/with a hangover. But he hangover usually passed couple hours later.

Now I'm 24 and I know very well that I have a problem, I have known since I was maybe 21 years old. I guess this will be the scary part of how my brain works or how I'm thinking. I read many posts of people that gave insight in there history with alcohol. About drinking untill passing out, not remembering things the next day, blackouts etc... I never had that before, so here goes my mind while reading those posts ""You don't have a problem"", ""Go have a drink tonight, you'll be fine!"" or ""Just give up and go back to sobriety when you do experience those things"". I also sometimes wonder if I'm too young to say that I have a problem with alcohol, maybe this is how life is suppose to be at this age?

Anyway, these thoughts scare me so much. The worst thing is, that in the back of my head I know I have a problem with alcohol and that it is not just something to do with my age or that I don't need those things like blacking out have happened to me before I'm allowed to say that I have a problem. I guess this is what people call the dangers of a functioning alcoholic?

I want to thank those who have sticked around and read all my ramblings. If you have any tips or something you want to say about this, feel free to do so. I like to add that to quit drinking in this house is quite hard because drinking is such a normal thing here, after a hard day of work or during the weekends just indulging in alcohol.

My wonderful and amazing girlfriend got home from work with a cake and plans to make dinner for me, but found me blacked out in bed at 5pm. She tried to wake me up, but couldn't and my breathing was heavy. Eventually I got up early this morning to have some water and found the cake, unlit birthday candles and dinner half eaten. I missed out on my own birthday because I'm an idiot drunk.

I had about a week and a half of mild withdrawal symptoms (night sweats and a persistent headache) but I started reaping benefits of sobriety immediately. I think the biggest change is to my mood - I feel less anxious and more peaceful at a baseline, feelings of irritation pass quickly, I no longer experience that depressive dip when the buzz wears off. I've noticed dozens of other small improvements to my life as well.

I ran and hiked all summer but in September I started to ramp up my running, going out 5x a week and running 25-32 miles per week. I started to experience runner's high for the first time - only once during a run, but consistently after running I would feel a long-lasting, clean buzz. Not drinking has also made me much more consistent with my workouts. I used to skip or move around 1 or 2 runs or workouts every week because I was too tired or hungover to do them. Now I pop out of bed at 6:30am and hit the road.

I'm training for a solo time trial Halloween Half, which will be my fifth half marathon. Today I had a 12 mile run on the calendar. At 11.5 miles I realized that if I ran an additional mile I would beat my best half marathon time by whole minutes. So I tacked on an extra mile and beat my old time by EIGHT AND A HALF MINUTES. During a casual training run! Without even trying!

I've put a lot of work into my running this year and it feels weird to chalk this up to sobriety but ... I don't think I could have done this if I was still drinking. I think sobriety is a superpower and I can't wait to see where else it takes me.",14,0

I haven't told anyone of my intention of quitting completely, but the idea of having someone next to me for Sober October was inspiring. I got a text this morning from her saying...""Sober October is a bust."" **My first thought: Seriously...you didn't even make it through the first day...** I am trying so hard to not be disappointed.  I'm reminding myself that I haven't had a drink since Saturday night and today is literally the first day I've felt like a human being, and not a complete depressed mess. I need to continue to hold onto this, and keep working, and keep reaching for what I NEED. I need to let go of this crutch. Process my feelings, no matter how difficult. Learn to be a better version of me. I'm just so sad. I wanted her to be successful, too. Even if it was only going to be for a month. My therapist (who I just revealed a lot about my drinking habits to) suggested that I try my first AA meeting with a friend. This friend is who I was going to ask. Now, I think I need to just do this on my own. Overcome my own fears. I don't want to be let down by another person right now, especially now that I am going through the process of dealing with many unresolved mistakes. I will be seeing her tomorrow along with several other friends and family members who will be drinking. I am scared of what will come from this.

I went nearly a year and a half before this current attempt. Long story short, in 2018 had an ER visit with insane pain/bloating lower left abdomen.  They diagnosed me with diverticulitis but saw some issues with my liver with the cat scan. Fatty liver they said and to change my lifestyle. During my treatment for the diverticulitis flare up my bilirubin went through the roof. I guess the intense antibiotics and pain killers they had me on really pissed off my liver. I eventually recovered and really changed my lifestyle. Quit drinking, ate super clean and tracked everything I put in my mouth. Along with exercise I lost 30lbs and my bloodwork was stellar.

stood sober for 4+ months earlier this year and my anxiety and depression didn't go anywhere. I've lost my best friend due to the ""she's not drinking, therefore she feels better than us"" bullshit, despite my honest attempts to keep the relationship going. 

I've been on antidepressants, but they don't make much difference, I'm like a still, lifeless doll when completely sober. Drinking redirects my attention from my general feeling of nothingness, and being slightly hungover every day made me attentive more to myself than to people around me - so I didn't see how much people around me don't care about me. 

But I don't know if I want to have real relationship/s. I come from abusive family and I feel I'm broken for life. I think about quitting the relationship with my current (sober) bf, because it's either too much or not enough for me and it makes me feel things I don't want to feel. I don't want him to be with somebody who hates loving him. 

I guess constant drinking is just prolonged suicide, but if you really don't want to live, yet can't really die, what else is there? 

I'll give my honest attempt to not drink with you today, but I'll be honest, I really feel fucked up for good. I really don't want to be alive and I don't want to experience the life.

I've had less than a handful of moments where I find myself thinking how great a dozen beer would be. Knowing where it would lead, coupled with not being hungover ever and being a better father and husband, is enough to keep things at bay. On top of that, I've learned how much I hated drinking. It was lonely. It was depressing. It was painful. It was lost time.

That's all great, right? Sort of.

After the first 4-5 days, I was definitely in pink cloud mode for a bit. Based on how my brain is working now, I can't even pinpoint when this started. I work in a highly analytical role directly with clients, constantly working through problems, communicating, scheduling tasks, completing tasks, etc. Very fast paced, little room for error, everything requires a response, everything has a deadline. I'm normally awesome at it. Crush it day in and day out, and I love every minute of it.  Always organized, able to make sense of complex things, able to develop solutions, and have always had a sharp memory.

The past couple of weeks (or more?), I've been having trouble remembering what I did the day before, who I talked to, what deadlines I agreed to, what plans I made, etc. It's absolutely terrifying - like having blackouts. That, and my mind is sluggish, it takes me forever to get anything done, and I feel like I'm losing my marbles. I write everything down that I need to do, as well as put numerous reminders in my calendar. However, I can talk with clients, rattle off numbers, coordinate work, explain things in high detail (I can remember talking with them and sending emails with the details, but I don't remember 80% of the actual conversation). Pretty sure I sound like I'm on coke/manic as well half the time.... but that may be due to my previously depressed (by alcohol) brain going a bit haywire after a month of sobriety. Two days ago I almost broke right down talking to my wife at night. After realizing how bad my memory and some of my cognitive functions were, I felt like I needed a doctor/hospital.

Then I visited Dr. Google. Definitely sounds like PAWS.... but holy hell is it a terrifying thing. I feel like my mind is a shell of its former self. Amazing how kind it was to my when I was on the booze train for over 15 years. I'm taking regular vitamins, along with 100 mg of B1/Thiamine, vitamin D, and probiotics daily, but I have no idea if they're helping. I know they're not hurting.

I've read that a number of people have had success with meditation, so I think I'll start giving that a shot. More exercise is definitely next on the list of things to add, and then eating healthier (I gave myself a 30 day pass to eat garbage). However, I'm open to and would greatly appreciaite any suggestions or stories that anyone might have. I suspect time might be the best medicine, but the sooner I can get things cleared up, the better, as this has rocked me to my core. I know my brain is healing and I deserve a bit of a kick in the pants from it for what I put it through before, but I had no idea it would be this intense. By far the worst withdrawal symptom I've ever experienced and yet another tick in the ""con"" box.",5,0

Alcohol and I have had a very rough relationship for many years. I'm in my late twenties now but I've been struggling with substance abuse and ""taking it too far"" and doing shitty things while drunk since I started drinking at 20. I also maintained generally the same group of friends until a few years ago, when I quit drinking for the first time. The whole group has always been extremely alcohol-focused. So naturally, everyone stopped inviting me places. I didn't try to reach out either, to be fair. It was fine... until it wasn't. I felt really isolated and started drinking again.

This cycle happened over and over and over for the past ~4 years. I'd quit drinking, I'd feel lonely, I'd call a friend and start up again until I did something stupid or hurtful in a blackout, then I'd quit again. Slowly, I felt myself losing more real friends each cycle, and relying more on surface friendships and fake connections to deter loneliness. My text history has become a graveyard of old coworkers, people I'd see at my regular bar, and fuck buddies.

I never meant for this to happen, and all of my old friends seem to want nothing to do with me or are very reluctant to hang out with me, whether I'm sober or not. They're all problematic binge drinkers too, so it doesn't totally make sense to me. A number of them have also expressed concern with my inability to stop drinking once I've started, but they've never tried to hang out to do anything that doesn't revolve around alcohol. 

I guess I understand because by flitting back and forth, they view me as even more unreliable and unpredictabe. Or maybe my behavior was even worse than I thought? Should I try to mend any of these friendships (and how), or just focus on moving forward making new ones? And in the time of Covid.... where do I start?

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out **trying** not to drink, we make a conscious decision **not to drink**. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hey, SD! Happy Friday!

&#x200B;

Yesterday, we started talkin‚Äô about how our emotions are a useful form of communication for understanding whether we have an unmet need or not so we can become better advocates for ourselves. 

&#x200B;

Today, I have a resource for making that a bit more practical. It comes from Marshall Rosenberg‚Äôs concept [Non-Violent Communication](https://bookshop.org/books/nonviolent-communication-a-language-of-life-life-changing-tools-for-healthy-relationships/9781892005281) (NVC‚Äîseminal book linked, but many amazing and brilliant people have built off this concept since!). Essentially, all humans have the same universal needs, but we may develop different strategies for meeting those needs. 

&#x200B;

All conflict arises from disagreements about the right or appropriate strategies for ensuring our needs are met. Effective conflict resolution consists of tracing contentious strategies back to the needs they‚Äôre meeting, then together arriving at new strategies to meet everyone‚Äôs needs in a more favorable way for everyone. 

&#x200B;

NVC is a great method for better interpersonal communication, but it‚Äôs also really helpful for more effectively listening to yourself. Let‚Äôs try: 

&#x200B;

One of my favorite resources is NVC‚Äôs [(partial) list of universal human needs](https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/needs-inventory). You‚Äôll notice there‚Äôs a lot more here than on Maslow‚Äôs hierarchical pyramid! And they‚Äôre all important. 

&#x200B;

Which of these needs have you tried to meet using drinking alcohol as a strategy? If you‚Äôre struggling with cravings, this exercise is especially important. If you don‚Äôt find alternative, healthy ways of meeting the needs that you‚Äôve been meeting with the support of alcohol, it‚Äôs going to stay very, very difficult for you to stay sober.

&#x200B;

Some needs that I‚Äôve used alcohol as (or as part of) a strategy to meet are spontaneity, stimulation, sexual expression, and authenticity. My opinion now is that it never actually really helped with any of those, but I‚Äôve only discovered that with time and some effort practicing different strategies! 

&#x200B;

May you easily find fulfilling strategies to meet your needs.

May the people you encounter easily empathize with your needs and prioritize them.

May you and those around you take pleasure in making life more wonderful for each other.

This was a really hard one.,"Let me preface this by saying that i go to a lot of shows. Going to see live music has been a huge part of my life since I was about 13 (I‚Äôm 32 now) and it largely defines my my personality.

I‚Äôve never seen a show sober. Not once. Going to see live music and getting really fucked up was a way of life for me. I really didn‚Äôt know how I was going to handle this.

I had a ton of anxiety about it throughout the day, knowing I was going to have to relearn how to do my favorite thing in the world without booze.

The first set was pretty hard. Everyone around getting drunk sipping down beers, smoking weed, dancing around, hooting and hollering after every song. I was silent and barely moved my body during the first set. After a few songs, I walked over to the merch tent and got in line to take my mind off it.

A few songs into the second set, that feeling of joy I know so well came over me. That feeling I was so terrified i couldn‚Äôt feel without an absurd amount of alcohol. Before I knew it I was dancing with a big smile on my face, singing along with the band.

I enjoyed the show infinitely more. I didn‚Äôt have to leave my group every 10 minutes to shell out 15 bucks for a beer or run to the bathroom every couple songs to take a piss.

I didn‚Äôt get so hammered I fall down and get kicked out, or pass out on the ground, or throw up on the ground, or one of a million other horrible things I did under the influence.

Afterwards, I was able to DD for the first time in my life, and now I‚Äôm going to bed at a decent hour not worried about calling out of work tomorrow bc my hangover is so bad.

I did it. I knew this was going to be the hardest test for me and I did it.",52,0

More often than not, I find myself wanting to slow down my thoughts, but I hate the feeling of just existing when I'm drunk. I either don't have any thoughts, or I just don't remember nor care about them. I'm worried moving forward. Relapse starts way before the first sip. I'm scared I'm past that point. I listen to others talk about how I'll feel the same way next time, that I'll regret it the morning after, that it gets easier. Right now, I don't care. I don't kmow what I want, but I am sober.

This marks my one year of sobriety. Last year I decided to give Sober October a go. There was so much happening in my life that my world had become too overwhelming. Tip of the iceberg: Some dear people in my life passed away, my relationship was failing, my job was ending, and I had to say goodbye to my greatest BIG love as he crossed the rainbow bridge. I needed relief. This was the perfect challenge for me to take a break from my dipsomania. So, I gave myself a month. It was easy for me at first, because I was extremely busy with a full schedule. Having a nightcap would have made things worse. Around rolls November, I made a choice. It was just a few weeks until my job was ending. Why not keep riding this train? One of my dear friends from work said with the perfect inflection, ‚ÄúLife is beautiful, man.‚Äù He‚Äôs been sober for decades. He knows what he is talking about ;). That‚Äôs what it took. It was the right phrase at the right moment with the right MINDSET to light a fire. I was feeling incredibly clear and focused just as I do today. I really enjoy being present throughout all the parts of my day. It‚Äôs not easy having to face every single little thing as it comes, however it is very liberating. Everybody is different. What works for me is I haven‚Äôt put unobtainable limitations on myself. I have never once said, I‚Äôm never drinking again. Forever can be scary. But I do tell myself, I‚Äôve got this. When those hard moments arrive, I breathe through them and remind myself, ‚ÄúYou have a choice.‚Äù 2020, you have been awful. I remember every f***ing moment of it, and I am proud of myself.

I‚Äôve noticed I always feel ‚Äúdown;‚Äù specifically bored, depressed, or tired. It‚Äôs crazy because throughout the day I am busy or choose activities that make me happy, but it‚Äôs like as soon as the sun goes down I‚Äôm bored and don‚Äôt have energy or interest in my hobbies that I happily participated in earlier in the day. It feels weird picking ‚Äúdepressed‚Äù or ‚Äúbored‚Äù despite 90% of the day feeling content and even happy. But that‚Äôs my mood at the end of the day. After sunset and until I fall asleep I just feel down. Some days I‚Äôm full on depressed, as I have no energy to distract my anxious mind from replaying past mistakes or focusing on negative aspects of myself. The hours between sunset and bedtime feel longer than the whole day. I just noticed this and wonder if anyone has experienced this? Nighttime is such a trigger for me and instead of reaching for beer I‚Äôm reaching for ice cream and while this works day to day I know this is not sustainable.

I‚Äôm not gonna lie.  I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm tired of failure. I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll never lose the weight and be the regretful bride.

I write this post because I'm very stressed out in this days. By evening I'm exhausted.

I used to drink very much during the last two and half years, I drank every day strong beers and cocktails and during the weekends even more. 

I've never suffered from physical abstinence but my tolerance is very high and I'm mentally dependent. It became an obsession to me, every day is a fight against myself; on the exterior I look normal but inside I'm shaking and craving for a drink. Sometimes I see no further to leave job to go to my favorite supermarket to buy some beers. 

I started to moderate in February trying to stay healthy, I lost weight and I'm proud of that and became capable to stop myself from drinking during the week. 

I've never wanted to stop completely. I drink regularly during the weekends but I'm starting againg during the week. I'm trying to justify myself in every way but I know there's no justification. I know it's just my mind trying to f\*\*k me another time wasting all the job I've done so far. 

SO this is my question: is there anybody out there who really is capable to moderate? Is moderation even possible for an alcoholic? 

I'm young but I feel I've wasted my life. I've got nobody left, I'm alone in this.

I don't have much of a relationship with my mom and I've been trying not to engage her but FUCK she's driving me crazy. We had a huge fight just now.

She brought some vodka and made fun of me when I declined. I ended up telling her I have a problem with alcohol when she didn't stop her nagging and she called me a 'drama queen'. 

Apparently I'm just looking for attention. I should know what a 'real' alcoholic looks like thanks to my father. I'm ungrateful, because she went out of her way to get my favorite brand. I'm ruining her night, I'm a buzzkill, who's trying to make her feel bad about her own drinking. I'm crazy and not acting like myself and she's my mother, so it's her job to tell it to me straight üôÑ

So sorry I'm having a hard time explaining my drinking problem to the woman who did lines in my kitchen earlier and thinks it's not a big deal...because of course that's a fucking normal thing to do when you're visiting your son!

Sorry I'm not having seizures or other withdrawl symptoms, so I can act like a 'proper alcoholic'.

Yeah, so far it was pretty easy for me to stop drinking compaired to others, but that doesn't mean I'm not struggeling! I'm just really shit at moderating ffs, so not drinking at all seems to be alot easier than just having one. 

And I fucking wish I could just enjoy the drink in my hand, because I love tasting a new whisky or craft beer. I miss bonding with people over a couple of drinks. I went on a fantastic date recently and I hated having to turn down the wine he paired with the meal he had cooked for me.

I miss drinking, I miss being drunk and a part of me wants to say 'fuck it!!'. 
I didn't drink today and I won't, but I'm really angry and tired right now. 

My mom will probably be gone in a day or two and I'll not hear from her again for atleast a couple of months, so I don't even know why her opinion bothers me that much. Fuck! I just want this day to be over. I'm exhausted.

People drink like this for years on end, I'll be fine!"" Then I realized how i was treating the people around me, not really remembering much of my 21st year, waking up feeling dreadful, shaking because I need a drink. All of these things made me realize that drinking is holding me back from my happiness. The last 2 months I've cut back the most I have since i started drinking.

 Last night I had 3 beers (3 more than I'd like) and it wasn't a great night.  A few arguments broke out over the silliest things with people i care about, which i'm not very appreciative of.

2) I need to do a better job creating a new and positive post-drinking life.  During my last period of sobriety all I did was just stop drinking - I really did not change any other behaviors.

I've always liked to drink a lot, but like I'm sure with many others, quarantine was particularly bad for me in how it entrenched that habit. That was bad, but the night of the debate, I fucked up worse than ever. The next morning, with the support of my girlfriend and another close friend, I'm deciding to go sober for a month. I really do hope that one day I'll be able to actually moderate myself, and I think I will. But for now, it's no drinking for me.

Also I just wanna say a word about how sad I find it that our society and consumer culture glamorizes alcohol as it does. I know I'm sounding like a preacher, but I really do feel this way. Alcohol is ubiquitous, particularly in college (I'm currently a senior) where frequent binging is seen as normal. I'm coming to realize that it's not healthy and my drunk self is not happier or better than my sober self. The only thing it does is destroy my body, make me do and say things I shouldn't, and most importantly, make me want to drink more alcohol.

I'm glad I found this subreddit because there's a massive amount of shame that goes along with acknowledging that I have any sort of problem with drinking, and seeing people here talking about it openly and supportively is a huge breath of fresh air. So let me also offer that same sentiment and extend my love and encouragement to anyone reading this.

Additionally, with my new abundance of free time, I've picked up a full-time job that allows me to work remote all while managing my businesses. To add to that, I am 4 lbs. away from my weight loss goal. I am currently down 41 lbs so far since the beginning of shelter-in-place so it helps to stay sober in exchange of constant weight loss.

My 2 cents for others reading this is, create a positive feedback loop that helps reinforce the decision not to drink. For example, when I get a craving to have a drink, I remind myself how many calories I'll ingest (generally would be 300-600 calories). So instead, I distract myself with working out. That usually will do the trick because when I work out, it release's Endorphins and I feel like I can take on the next project/task and push through. When I've made it toward the end of the day, I reward myself with a good and healthy dinner generally accompanied by some type of flavored sparkling water, ginger beer or root beer (there's no alcohol in these just FYI). Finally, when I wake up in the morning, the first thing I do is weigh myself after going bathroom.

Sobriety is very personal, and some of us aren't ready to tell our friends, and I get that. In my experience most, if not 99% of bartenders have incredible respect for sobriety. They will have no problem pouring fake drinks for you.

I'm a bartender myself, and every weekend I end up making at least a dozen of fake shots/cocktails for people that approach me and tell me that they don't want to drink that night. 

N/A cocktail ideas:

Mules (the only ginger beer I've seen with alcohol is crabbies)

Seltzer water with fruit, a classic, but looks like a drink.

Virgin mary's, just essentially tomato juice/bloody mix (also has the perk that no one is gonna ask you to try it)

Lemonade + mint + lime topped with sprite is a virgin mojito.

Arnold palmers (looks like a long island and every bar/most bars can make them)

Oj and sprite for a virgin mimosa.

Muddled cucumber/berries + lemonade + lime.

A Roy rogers is a shirley temple with coke instead of sprite.

Pineapple + oj + cranberry is basically a sex on the beach without booze.

Lemonade/juice + tonic.

Of course, I go to therapy to get things out, but just having that friend I can call anytime or have a cup of coffee with is what I truly desire. (I want to be that person for someone else, too.) Meeting people is not one of my strengths...take booze out of the equation and I am completely shy and reserved. I find difficulty in finding things to talk about. Instead of spending my time learning and absorbing information that would contribute to good conversation, I have been killing my brain cells with booze for years. Additionally, things are much more difficult with the virus and everything going on. I plan to begin ""attending"" church, but of course, the services are online. I thought maybe another idea would be to go to an AA meeting -- but my anxiety holds me back so much. Does anyone have any suggestions to overcome this? Or any other ways of meeting people? I can't remember a time that I have attempted to physically go out and meet people. I'm terrified, but I know that going through this alone is not going to work. Calling my drinking buddies is not going to work, either. It's too much of a temptation no matter how much I think I can abstain.",6,1

All of a sudden I went from a part of work and the family to a mess who was passing out early in front of my kids and just a wreck emotionally and health wise.

I had been without alcohol for two weeks, but when the end of shift came on Friday I had built up an attitude that said ""fuck it!!! I want some kind of reward for the way that I have been having to work.""
My partner and son were staying in her mother's for a few days anyway, so I had a free house.
I finished work, went to the off licence and bought a 70cl of vodka, I went home to get a bath and then went straight to the pub as soon as I was dressed. Because of the 10pm curfew in the UK I tried to get as much alcohol in to my system as possible. Double gins 43% per shot, sambuccas, Magners irish cider, Beer Moretti and Tiger beer were the order of the day. I went home and carried on drinking.
When I woke, around 7am, because I can't deal with hangovers it wasn't long before I was drinking again. I went back out around 4pm, where the same level of  drinking was replicated the night before. I was drinking around family, but I was in a state and no fun to be around. I'm too scared to see any of them because I know I've insulted one or two of them, but I'm not sure which family members ? Family members had to listen to me tell them how my dead mother was wronged by them. I dont know what time I finished drinking that night, cant remember getting home or the taxi journey.
On Sunday pretty much the same happened as I still had vodka left in the house, so I finished the bottle then went back out. Magners Irish cider and sambuccas chasers with every cider. I've embarrassed myself all over town.
My partner came home because I had lost my phone during Sunday's binge. She could not believe the state I was in, she said she had never seen me so bad. She went back to her mother's, I had no recollection of the conversation or of her even being there. I got my phone back, I had dropped it in the pub. It turns out that there were a lot of interactions I could not remember having with my partner that weekend, or other people as I look on my call list.
I went back to work on Monday, it was hell on earth. I done Tuesday, but phoned in sick yesterday. I physically not do it this week. So now I'm in hiding. Too scared to see anyone, too scared to be seen.
My body is an absolute overweight mess, but I no I havent fully recovered.
Anyway it looks like my time is up, I'm a terrible, terrible binger an now I think the whole world can see it. My partner and her family are in no doubt. But more importantly, I have no doubt myself. I have a problem. Once I start I can't stop. I'm a binger, so incase you are wondering, I haven't had a drink since Sunday.",15,0

Recovery definitely isnt a straight, smooth course. My nervous system and body seemed to have finally kicked paws. I'm willing to share my story and answer any questions.","I quit alcohol, cigarettes and drugs 12/01/2018. I had no idea what i was in for or that alcohol would be the one that would give me the most hell quitting. I thought once I put my mind to it, i could free myself. That particular attitude lasted 2 months. 

In mid February 2018, I relapsed and drank 12 beers. It wasnt good enough to have 2-4. I went straight for my old comfortable number of drinks... then the hangover hit. As a grown man in his 30s, I had to run home and get nursed by mommy it was so bad. I learned though. I learned that I wasnt drinking to have fun, I didn't like the buzz anymore and I was numbing my anxiety and emotional pain. 

Now every second of this rollercoaster ride was complete inhumane hell. Time stopped, fear and panic is all that I knew and I was not in control of my happiness or much at all emotionally or functioning wise. Stress and unfamiliarity of how time passes and how ""normal"" people fill their day is just the tip of the iceberg. 

I recommend anybody going through this to seek counseling. I already have a therapist. I'm diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Brings generalized anxiety. Also was able to dive in more and realize how severe my ptsd is. It was hard to look at these things (especially the ptsd). But if I didn't accept and understand my trauma, I just had to try anything to change my hell. At this point my social anxiety was out of control and I never had this problem before.

A lot of therapy, a lot of suffering, a lot of learning and a very good attitude/perspective was it. Building a new life was slowly starting to happen. I had more brain capacity to address and be present in the things I wanted to manage and care about. Alcohol somehow made me very selfish in ways i never could see before.

Covid hit and i took a nose dive health wise. Isolation for too long and daily stressful news added to my out of control stress. I have lost a ton of weight on top of loosing weight. Stress has been the name of the game for over a year and a half at this point. The nervous system took so long to repair. 

Alcohol is one of very, very few drugs to effect every cell of the body. My nervous system has finally stopped rattling around. I'm managing my life like a completely new person. I physically look like a healthy, new person a year and 10 months later. 

I can finally say I'm free of this monster and the hell of suffering. It is hard to pull what was my illness and what was the paws. Both had to be addressed for me. I had a medication issue due to weight loss that was giving daily panic attacks for over a month and a half. So it's hard to say when I recovered, but my nerves are feeling in the same universe of comfortable. 

I joked with my friend who said he needed a beer because it was a hard day. I replied with, I need 10-12 and that's my problem.",23,1

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

&#x200B;

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out **trying** not to drink, we make a conscious decision **not to drink**. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hello beautiful people of SD! 

&#x200B;

I bet some of you are here today for Sober October‚Äîwelcome! I hope you‚Äôll stay a while :) And/or, you may have just completed Sober September‚Äîwhether you did or didn‚Äôt drink the whole time, congratulations on making that commitment to give it a go. That means a great deal! 

&#x200B;

Yesterday we talked about the very common intention of drinking to numb painful emotions. Most importantly, we explored how we actually turn the volume down on ALL of our emotions when we try to just turn away from the bad stuff. Essentially, we cut ourselves off from fully feeling alive. 

&#x200B;

But what are emotions, really? What does an ideal relationship to our emotions look like? 

&#x200B;

A lot of outdated (imo) ideas suggest that there are two options: either you control your emotions or they control you.

&#x200B;

Today, I‚Äôd love to propose an alternative! 

&#x200B;

Our emotions are a form of communication from self to self. When we feel hurt, angry, sad, etc, it‚Äôs our body sounding an alarm to say ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs not right. Our needs aren‚Äôt being met.‚Äù

&#x200B;

I‚Äôm not saying responding to that alarm is comfortable! But, if you‚Äôve been around earlier this week, you have a resource to help turn towards uncomfortable feelings instead of running away from them. 

&#x200B;

As if having access to joy, connection, and wholeheartedness isn‚Äôt enough of a reason to stay in touch with our emotions, we get better access to our personal needs and preferences when we approach our emotions with patience and curiosity.

&#x200B;

Think about a time recently you had an emotional reaction to something. Make sure you‚Äôre in a headspace and physical environment where you can feel safe and compassionate towards yourself. Then, get curious! 

&#x200B;

If you felt hurt, is there an unmet need for acceptance or understanding at work? If you were angry, is it because you‚Äôve gotten frustrated by someone repeatedly not meeting your needs? Is it time to set a boundary? If you felt excited (or nervous! Sometimes those two feel the same), was that an invitation to press the gas on a new initiative in your life? (There are lots of possible options! Just trying to stir up some inspiration here)

&#x200B;

Tomorrow, I‚Äôll have a resource for y‚Äôall about needs, but for today, let‚Äôs let our own observations and intuitions drive. It is a full moon, after all ;)

&#x200B;

May you be a fearless and skillful advocate for yourself today. You are worthy of one!

Now that I‚Äôm getting completely sober, I‚Äôm finding I have the time and energy to invest in old passions that either disappeared shortly before I began drinking, or fell by the wayside once I started. I still miss alcohol but it‚Äôs a nice feeling to be able to be passionate about something that isn‚Äôt a drug for once. So I‚Äôm making this post to remind myself of how much my life has improved for when the alcohol cravings return. :)",16,0

Not that I had a crippling dependency on alcohol or anything close to that...I just binge drink and make self destructive decisions. I had to take a break indefinitely and it‚Äôs going very smoothly. I have a wonderful girlfriend and network that holds me accountable. Although I‚Äôve turned to weed here and there to curve cravings but I‚Äôm okay with that.
