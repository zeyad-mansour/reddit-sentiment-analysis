Share your good, your bad, and your ugly (or your pretty, or your future, or your funny, or whatever else is on your mind) with us below!

-----------------------------------------

**The Good:** I just bought some great new storage boxes of clear plastic for my art supplies. I told a friend of mine, “I need an organization system where I can just open the lid of a box and shovel all my stuff into it.” 

He responded, sarcastically, “You're a regular Marie Kondo.” Then he told me that more than one person has said that they immediately Kondo'd *The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up* when she said to get rid of any books that weren’t being read.

**The Bad:** I did an online class of *sashiko*, which is traditional Japanese embroidery of white thread onto indigo fabric. I held the sample square of indigo cloth in my lap and accidentally started to sew it onto the pants I was wearing. Luckily, I only did a few stitches before I realized.

**The Funny:** I’ve learned so much from my mistakes . . . I’m thinking of making a few more.",35

Hi all - I have 39 days of sobriety after nearly a decade of on again/off again “high functioning” alcoholism.  I’m 32 years old, driven, hardworking, and yet extremely sensitive as a person.  If you’ve heard the words empath or highly-sensitive-person , that’s me.  Not having the skills to learn how to feel my emotions and cope in a healthy way, I turned to self medicating for years.
  
The craziness of 2020 showed me that I no longer wish to live my life.  I decided to start going back to AA and figuring out how to finally live a sober life.
  
I’m struggling.  I feel everything so strongly.  Not drinking (as well as therapy) has helped me to start processing things.  I know this is all for the best, but when I get upset or overwhelmed, I immediately start to get cravings.
  
Any other sensitive people out there?  I’m having a low point and I would love to hear how others deal with these intense emotions.  Thank you all",9

On September 28th 2015 I was found in my room by my Dad by chance and it would change everything. 911 was called but before anyone got there I remember taking one more sip and saying to myself ""this is the last shot i'll take, whether I live or die""

The police and paramedics, doctors and nurses saw a 23 year old very near his end. None of whom thought I would survive the night. They certainly didn't believe why I was 105 pounds and dark yellow at such an age. I was drinking a liter of vodka a day. Regardless, they did their job, they gave me a blood transfusion and took very close care of me and in a month managed to save my life. 


From Stage 4 cirrhosis/failure of the liver, Stage 3 hepatic encephalopathy, heavy jaundice, needing a transplant and in an extremely altered state. My addiction had taken it's toll, but Death recieved no such satisfaction. 


On October 24th 2015 I was released to go home and continue the battle, one I literally didn't know was coming. Doctors told me ""six months"" of no drinking and i'll be on the transplant list. For the next two and a half months, while I was actually conscious now, my altered state continued and manifested itself in memory loss and both auditory and visual hallucinations. 


Then on December 3rd, back in the hospital for overnight tests, I was told my liver had begun regeneration. After that I took my medication to clean my blood, finally started to eat again and suddenly I woke up one day in early January 2016. Took a shower, put on my favorite Iron Maiden shirt and went to the doctor. Only this time I was finally ""awake"" and aware of everything. My skin was back to normal, I had gained weight and my encephalopathy or altered state was gone. I had officially survived and conquered the first and biggest steps. Stay alive and get sober. Now the everlasting task of staying sober. 


I had a ton of doctors to visit over the coming months and years but with each appointment my liver just kept getting better and better until the words ""liver transplant"" were thankfully a forgotten phrase. The lasting effects and damage I have caused not only to myself but to my friends and to my family are a sharp point both in my addiction and in my sobriety. It is a hard reminder of what I had done. 


But I am pleased to say that today, the 29th of September 2020, in this horrible year, I mark a very proud moment in celebrating FIVE years sober. My life was saved, I survived and I continue to live, and though I have permanent nerve damage in my eyes, legs and feet, it is far better than what could have been.

If you have read this far, I thank you. Please if you or someone you know is struggling with addiction tell them my story and to please not go this far. I blacked out most of that final year and can't remember much before the hospital so I did not know to get help or how. I used alcohol as a medicine and know others use drugs the same way. Maybe this will help others to know it's never too late, you can break addiction and live again. 


I was asked by my Father on that final day, ""do you want to die?"". I said, no.

Sometimes you feel like you've come so far after a little sober time, but eventually you find yourself in a situation that hurts you deeply.

Sometimes things just don't go your way. You put yourself out there, ready to change a circumstance in your life and you fail. You told yourself you were ready to take on a risk- but it just didn't pan out. You think, this is what I get for trying. If I just didn't try, I wouldn't have to feel dissapointed. Not so long ago, I would have drank about it. 

But I won't do that today. I didn't pick up a drink today. If that is the only thing that went right today- it is good enough. I am sober, and despite it all, that makes today a good day.",20

Time passes by and my hearts beating fast

This signal just echoes through the seams of the room

My back is against the wall and im afraid to move and I believe this feeling won’t come to pass but I now know I have something to lose

The floors fill with guilt and its like I’m floating in something I can barely understand 

The ceiling fan is spinning just like me caught in a spiders web wrapped in my head

One more drink is to many and it feels like I could be dead but that was just a useless dream

Seconds turn to minutes like crawling up a wall to the clock laughing at me every time I fall

The windows break and I can finally breathe

It all comes down to me fighting this urge to feel something but nothings as it seems

though my brain doesn’t stop my heart will never stop trying

the minutes turn to an hour only to find myself quietly smiling 

I walk downstairs and step outside

I see the people I love and theres no need to hide 
that feeling is worth all the pain I ever felt inside

I’m alive

And they see me

They see me

Hello guys!

Let me start with that I've been reading some hopeful stories in this group and I want to thank everyone for sharing their stories.  
Alright so I am starting to think alcohol is becoming a problem in my life and I wonder is anyone else might recognize some of the things I am about to tell and maybe can offer some advise on how to deal with them.

In the beginning I go/used to go to a lot of parties during the weekend and I would usually end up drinking to the point of getting sick and going way overboard with the quantities. Back then though it was still all fun and games and most of my friends drink on a regular basis also so I never saw a problem.

After the parties in the weekend I started to drink in the week also, not daily but it became a more consecutive habit. Still I didn't see much of a problem at the time either because overall everything seemed to be going fine regardless, I still had lots of friends, Got myself a stable and nice girlfriend etc.

As of lately though I am starting to notice this ""habit"" is becoming a problem. If I have a bottle of alcohol in my house I will end up drinking it every day until it is empty. I am starting to notice the sudden downward mood when sober and well my girlfriend is starting to get worried about it as well. The problem is sometimes I am starting to feel outright depressed but when I start drinking again it starts to go away. I am noticing I am becoming increasingly emotionally unstable when not drinking and somewhat emotionally unresponsive towards my SO and friends when sober.

Frankly I know I'm at fault for this and I am noticing my entire character/behaviour changing because of it and not in a way that benefits either my SO, friends or myself and its reached a point where it is causing huge rifts between me and the people I care for.

Did any of you guys go through this? and if you did how did you manage to pull through and turn it around? Also what do I need to expect/prepare for when going down this path?",12

I often share it in the group I attend. Paradoxical Comfort.,"The funny thing about comfort is that it does not have to be rooted in anything positive or healthy for ones being. It can just as easily be established by something negative or toxic.
Comfort is often found within our normality, the things that are familiar to us. These things are predictable. That easily foreseen future is effortlessly prepared for, causing little malaise and surprise.
Wanting to grasp tightly to these negative things that have for so long brought about a paradoxical comfort to me is understandable.
Only with deep introspection of oneself, an understanding of what I truly want and need, can I accept my negative actions of the passed that have hindered the wellness of my being. Not allowing myself to become a victim to them so that I may instead learn and decide I'm not walking down this path anymore.
Change is never easy, regardless if I'm aware that it leads towards a brighter future. The path can be tormenting and slow, filled with obstacles and relapses of a more familiar way.
However, commitment to a new reality, despite the difficulty of the journey must be realized and held onto no matter the hardships if my being is to flourish and grow.",9

I’ll go a week or 2 without and then I’m right back to it because I feel like being sober isn’t worth it and my anxiety and lack of excitement creeps back into my life. I really want to try going sober for October this year and I’m worried I won’t make it if I don’t have some support. I have a few good books, but have seen so much positivity around AA in this sub that it makes me think it might be worth it to try? The only problem is I know God or a “Higher Power” is a heavy influence. I am not at all interested in that. I’m a staunch atheist and don’t want to just call any old thing a higher power bc I truly believe there is not one. Are there any atheists here who have had success or found something that works for them through AA without the God part?",2

Alcohol has wreaked its havoc on my entire adult life in a way that others here relate with. I find many of the things I read here comforting and meaningful. 

I find my patterns fall into ""binges"". the consistency of my drinking is usually pretty steady, as in I was usually drinking 4 to 5 days a week.

  ""I can keep the ponies in the stable"" (or so I tell myself), ""it was my mood, dont drink when you're mad or sad anymore"" ""dont drink alone""  are all frail excuses I've made. 

but there is always going to be that time waiting around the corner where I just lose my mind and become this unpredictable mess that will usually end in my incarceration or terrible things being said to people I love.

If you met sober me, you would never imagine I was capable of this.  I have been arrested four times in the last ten months after being in no trouble for three years.  

I cant do this alone anymore, I need a plan. I was wondering how some of you who are binge drinkers like myself contain the beast and have had luck with stopping your drinking entirely.

2020-09-29 15:39:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/j26js7/something_i_learned_about_quitting/,Something I learned about quitting,"Thought I would share this for those who might be just starting this journey. I have struggled with alcohol for the better part of my late 20s, early 30s (I just turned 35). By struggle, I mean that I have a hard time going without a few drinks every night, and especially during social occasions. I don't binge or day drink, but I have definitely had nights where I drank more than I should. At my worst, I probably drank a six pack of beer a day. Anyway, I ""quit"" several times, as most of us here could probably relate to. I usually get to 2-3 weeks before I crack, sometimes sooner.

But I did something interesting last year, I quit for five months! It was by far my longest stretch. I went without alcohol on my birthday, Halloween, and Thanksgiving, something that would have been unthinkable before. I broke the streak on Christmas day, but stayed sober a month after (I called it an island in my sea of soberness). Eventually though, I went back to normal drinking once all the Covid drama hit and was basically like ""fuck it"" for lack of a better reason. 

I decided to start a tradition and quit drinking in July like I did last year.  What is crazy is how much easier it is this time! This has by far been the easiest time quitting I have ever had. It used to suck so bad for the first 2-3 weeks, but this has been a cake walk. I think what helps is all the memories I have from last year. Instead of memories of drinking, I have memories of being alcohol free from which to reference from. It 's like my brain snapped back into sober mode. I don't even think about how many days it's been, etc. I couldn't tell you even if I wanted to (some weekend in July). It is truly liberating, it's the first time in my adult life that I feel free from this problem. 

I can't promise that I won't drink again, but as long as I keep a level head I am feeling a lot better about the future and my relationship with booze.",16

My husband and I visited family on a camping trip.  His whole family are drinkers and in the past I've been right there with them. I knew it was going to be a challenge going into the trip though- not because his family wouldn't be supportive (they were) but because I was afraid of feeling lonely (I did).   There's something to be said about being the only sober person in a group full of 15+ people.  When I told them I wasn't drinking I got responses like ""for how long?"" or ""why?"" followed by ""good for you!"" and ""great job!""  I encouraged my husband to not feel stifled by the fact I wasn't drinking and told him to have fun with his family.  He ended up drinking more than I've seen him drink before- probably in part because he didn't have to be my babysitter as I got wasted.  

I wasn't prepared for the loneliness i felt even though I was with over a dozen family members.  I wasn't prepared for the craving I felt- not for the alcohol itself, but for a sense of belonging.  

As the nights grew on everyone got more and more intoxicated.  We were camping and the freedom of not having to drive anywhere pushed the levels even higher.  I thought to myself, maybe I should just have a drink.  Then realized I would be so disappointed in myself if I did. I listened as everyone got louder and watched as some started swaying.  I was immediately ashamed at myself because I knew that I was the same way when I drank, and usually worse.  

At one point in the night I sat by myself on a picnic bench and pulled up Reddit to read this sub.  The stories everyone posted helped me feel like I wasn't alone.  You all reminded me that there's a whole other world of people out there that aren't wrapped up in the drinking culture that society has made the norm.

So, I met this guy who was stationed in my state when he was here for training, for a year and a half, and now he's back to the other side of the states (about 2k miles away). We've been on again off again talking, since we're both busy with work, but as of late we've been chatting more. I've come to realize that he's an alcoholic. This is my assumption by him getting blackout drunk every night (he tells me the next morning that he blacked out) and playing drinking games on his own. Yesterday, he said something that made me really concerned. He asked if I have ever watched a particular show, and I said I hadn't and asked if it was worth a watch. He replied with ""If you consume prodigious amounts of alcohol and haven't been happy since elementary school it's a lot funnier.""

When I asked him if he hasn't been happy since elementary school, he replied the next day saying ""sorry, that was drunk me texting, not trying to con you into being my therapist."" He immediately changed the subject and didn't want to talk about it, to which I told him that I was there if he ever needed to chat because I was his friend. But I'm really worried about him. I never knew he wasn't happy until he said that comment.

I know the first step to stopping alcohol abuse is admitting you have a problem, but that's all within him. How can I be supportive from afar? I don't want to/I don't believe it is effective to lecture someone that they are doing something wrong, but I want to show that I support him and hopefully have him realize he has a problem and get help.

Is being there as a friend enough? Can I do anything more to help? I'm not in touch with his family/any of his friend's over there, so it's not like I can reach out. Not sure what to do at this point. I don't think he's suicidal, but then again I didn't know he wasn't happy.

I had started making notes on my progress several times per week, and recently I read back through them.  Right now I am somewhere between 250 and 300 days sober.  I'm not really into counting the days.  Reading though my notes was interesting because I can now see how evident it was that I just needed to stop.  Each week I started with some notes about how I drank over the weekend and it turned into more than I planned.  I would usually have a mid week entry that looked similar.  Basically it was small failure after small failure, but always ""I can do better"".  Week after week this continued.  One excuse was followed by another.  ""I wasn't going to drink but blah blah blah...""  We all know the saying about how insanity is repeating the same behavior and expecting a different result.  

Eventually it struck me that I needed to stop, and I have.  This look back was a great reminder to me of what will happen if I try to to go back to moderating.  The most important is seeing that I never really was able to moderate.  I almost always ended up drinking beyond the limit I set for myself.

I am now welcoming serenity and light. For the first time in my adult life I look forward to my tomorrows instead of dreading them. I am meeting my true self for the first time - because the last time I was truly sober I was just a kid.  
 

Life isn’t perfect, things aren’t always easy, and I still have a long way to go mentally. Some days I’m so fucking bored with this pandemic that I’d love nothing more than to day drink and binge eat. But this hope I have for my future is easily the greatest feeling I’ve ever had. It is truly surreal to come to terms with the fact that I have finally broken that scary, toxic cycle. For once, I actually trust myself.  
 

The “pink cloud” only lasted the first couple of weeks or so but I don’t need it anymore. The benefits of sobriety are enough. I don’t need euphoria every day. Just contentment.

Long story short, some drunk ass hole punched me (f25.. Also 5, 5"" and 100 lbs) in the side of the head just because I didn't want to talk to his belligerent ass and told him to leave me alone. 

Luckily he was arrested right away, and I was sober enough to explain what happened to the cops. I haven't gone completely sober but I have cut back a TON in the past couple months and this is just a reminder of how important it is to keep doing what I'm doing, keep my wits and be present in the moment.

He wasn't provoked, it wasn't some drunk quarrel, it was just plain assault. And if I had been drinking like I used to, I don't think I'd be able to trust my own judgement. Not to mention it would be much harder to avoid alcohol while I rest up for the week.

I have committed to this time being forever. I know now that I cannot drink like “normal people”. One glass of wine means at least a bottle gone, more likely a liter. I have the full support of that same son, who grew up watching his mom get drunk every night, and my husband of 43 years. We are even able to joke about it now!

I had been on countless medications over the years for anxiety and chronic depression, I was so miserable for so long.

I am currently on the longest run of sobriety of my adulthood after many slips over a few years.  This run began 2 years ago on my birthday.  My son was born last year also on September 29.  I closed on my first home purchase this past week and flew in last night to move to my new state.

So how is it?  It has its ups and downs that is for sure.  I made a commitment to get sober for a year and do the AA thing, finish steps, go to meetings, yada yada yada.  Finding a good sponsor and being of service (through volunteering at a food bank, not as much so in the rooms) are really what helped most.  Going to meetings was and still is a drag, though I do it.

I got to a year, and looked back and realized a few things.  I was physically healthier, definitely an introvert, and had accepted financial and professional mediocrity.  See, part of my getting sober journey (I don't really like that word, but I'll use it here anyway) was going to rehab 4 times, losing my job, 3 visits to a hospital, going to a mental ward, and many other lasting personal embarrassments.  It was not a smooth transition of waking up one day after the buildup of negative events culminated into the necessity to quit.  It was a painful and humiliating slow process.

I went without work for over a year after losing my job due to drinking.  I eventually took a job that paid $18/hour compared to my $125k/year director level professional job I had.  I actually enjoyed the work and the low stress that it brought.  I had the luxury of my wife supporting financially and putting up with my slow downward spiral.  We moved to a studio from our nice 3 bedroom house, went from Audi to Kia, stopped spending time at Tahoe, etc.. you get the picture.  The only time I didn't enjoy my job was when I was asked by someone what I did for a living, especially people that knew me in my drinking years.  Luckily this instance was extremely rare, as I was mostly a hermit with the exception of my AA meetings.

I kept sobriety going after that year, despite still not really enjoying it.  Part of it was really realizing that I was not a 28 year old party guy anymore.  I was pushing 40, had terrible gout attacks, and hangovers were only cured by continuous heavy drinking.  The euphoria was lost, I was drinking alone, and my only hobby was now boring.  So while parts of my life were better when I was drinking, namely my social life and professional life, I kind of knew I couldn't go back to that lifestyle.  It took me a while to realize that it has more to do with my age and change of friends than with my drinking. Part of me holds onto that lifestyle.  But again, I start to wonder if most people feel that way as they are pushing 40.  Life was probably 'more fun' 10-15 years earlier for most.

So today, I am still faking it 'til I make it, especially in AA.  I have a sponsee and pretend to be enthused about the program.  I question if this is how everyone feels inside and my sentiment is typical.  The drinking hobby that I spent all of my free time on has turned into a rekindling of video games and delve into fantasy soccer.  I am still not proud to be a college graduate working entry level jobs that require no experience or special training.  My son gives me joy and has changed my outlook on life, but I still can't help feel that my best days are behind me.  Here I sit at 4am romanticizing of the good times, how I used to have a good time with friends, and now am exhausted by hanging with someone longer than over lunch.  Yet I'll keep trucking on because I've built up more to lose now if I fell off.

TLDR: So does it get easier?  I'd say yes, though there is a lot of grey area.  Best of luck to anyone reading and thinking about stopping drinking.  You can do it and just know that there are more positive days than negative.",117

“You’ll never understand or experience true happiness UNLESS you work the steps” 

Now see, that rubs me the wrong way. Looking through the perspective of the program, I can see/understand where they are coming from. The idea that a person entering into the rooms of aa who do not work the steps are simple a dry drunk is something pushed heavily. I get it. The program works for those who work it fully. However, the statement above is just one thing I do not agree with. Old timers will tell me it’s because I haven’t worked the steps and I’m in early sobriety I’m sure. The thing is, I have experienced and achieved true happiness. I understand what the pinnacle is and what it can be. I understand what it is I’m working towards in my sobriety. I refuse to agree that I cant or haven’t achieved moments like this in my life simply because I haven’t worked the 12 steps of aa. I hear it in the rooms all the time. How the program has changed and immensely improved the lives of those who have committed themselves to it. I’m sure there is a feeling that you grow into through service and sobriety. This doesn’t affect my feelings toward the program or my personal sobriety. It does help me to keep an open mind that my journey through sobriety is my own. That was only one person’s opinion. 

If this goes against the rules I’ll happily take it down. I just wanted to see what other people’s opinions were on this topic.",8

Looking back over Reddit posts and comments I can very easily identify which ones were created under the influence of alcohol and which weren't. Quite often the content I have created really doesn't align with who I think I am, but I created it, where else could it have come from?

So who the fuck am I really? 

Am I to believe that everything I have said and done when I was drunk is completely fabricated by a substance? The thoughts and feelings I have when I am drunk are completely inconsequential? 

As you get sober and reflect upon your life you start to see 2 different people, not completely divided but often viewing the same life from very different perspectives.

If I said something when I was drunk it had to come from somewhere right? So in some small way do I actually feel that perspective? 

Has societal cordiality reigned in my true nature to a point where I can only express myself while inebriated? Or does the alcohol cause me to dismiss reasonable norms more than I otherwise would?

I think ignoring this problem is one of the main causes of relapse, we don't want to think about the person we are when we are inebriated, we want to pretend that person isn't us, but it is.

That drunk version of you that is confident and forceful holds attributes your sober self envies. 

You are subconsciously drawn to that carefree life, free of the responsibility adulthood thrusts upon you.

Just statistically I have probably made more decisions drunk than I have sober and my life turned out ok, how can I hate this guy that got me to where I am? Or should I be blaming him for where I'm not?

The flip side of this is you realise you can't blame every shitty decision you make on your drinking, the longer you are sober the more mistakes you will make and then, possibly for the first time in your adult life, you have to truly own them, this sucks, real bad. You start to realise you are not the perfect person you think you are in your head, it's not just the alcohol, YOU actually may be an asshole sometimes.

Sobriety isn't about finding your best self or cleansing your soul, it's about figuring out who the fuck you are, something you can't do whilst living as 2 different people.

Every time I try to talk about this with friends or family they just brush it off and say “Oh you’re young don’t worry”. I feel like I can’t have a good time without a drink. The worst part is, is that I turn into a dick when I’m intoxicated, I’m mean to my family and my friends. I’m starting to really hate who I am. I always say I’m done drinking but next think you know I’m in line buying more coronas. I don’t wake up with hangovers and I’m always ready to go for another around. I know I’m young and it’s what young people do but usually they do it socially but I’ll just buy myself a twelve pack and sit in my room by myself and get drunk.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

&#x200B;

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hi, sobernauts! I'm having the best time hosting the DCI. Thank you for bein' here with me!!

&#x200B;

Yesterday we built on the idea that the key to having compassion and loving-kindness for ourselves is curiosity by looking at the 3 components of curiosity: gentleness, precision, and openness. 

&#x200B;

This week we’ve also talked about shame as sort of the opposite approach to relating to ourselves and how damaging it can be to our self-esteem and our overall well being. 

&#x200B;

But shame also hurts how we connect to others, too.

&#x200B;

The resource I’m drawing from today is one of the most watched TED Talks—It’s called [The Power of Vulnerability](https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_the_power_of_vulnerability/transcript?language=en#t-1190238) by Brene Brown. She’s a researcher with a background in social work. 

Here are a few selected quotes from the talk to help us take our next step for the week:

&#x200B;

>By the time you're a social worker for 10 years, what you realize is that connection is why we're here. It's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives. This is what it's all about….  
>  
>  
>  
>There’s one thing that really unravels connection, and it’s shame. Shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection: Is there something about me that, if other people know it or see it, that I won't be worthy of connection? ….  
>  
>  
>  
>It's universal; we all have it. The only people who don't experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection. No one wants to talk about it, and the less you talk about it, the more you have it.  
>  
>  
>  
>in order for connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves to be seen, really seen.

&#x200B;

Basically, we have to allow ourselves to be vulnerable in order to truly connect with others. And we have to connect with others in order to find purpose in life. 

&#x200B;

Here at SD, at the DCI, we already know this! We are vulnerable each time we check in—especially on a day 1!—and say “I will not drink with you today.” Because we know there’s a chance we might slip up at some point and reset. We know there’s a chance that when we say “Yes, I’m going to do this!” We risk showing our fallibility to others if life gets in the way of fulfilling our intentions. 

&#x200B;

Each of us has a different level of comfort with vulnerability. For many of us lurking here, the idea of posting at all feels like far too much. For people who have posted, there’s always a feeling of censorship around what kind of content might be too much. We toe this line and practice vulnerability and observe its power as an antidote to shame here every single day. It’s amazing!

&#x200B;

Tomorrow, we’ll keep looking at another couple concepts in this talk I find really special. But there’s a lot in there! I highly recommend giving it a watch! 

&#x200B;

For today, I encourage you to \*\*trust\*\* that being vulnerable is healthy and necessary. That doesn’t mean it’s going to be comfortable! But trust that it’s good for you anyway, and think about where—in your life, in this community, in your relationships with others or with yourself—shame is holding you back from real connection. 

&#x200B;

Try being a bit more vulnerable in that relationship today. Or make a plan to work towards it! I know this shit is scary and I ain’t here tryna rush ya. I accept you just where you’re at today and am so grateful that you’re even here at all—that’s vulnerable, too. 

&#x200B;

Thank you all for the gifts of your vulnerability and thank you so much for accepting mine. 

&#x200B;

May you feel the cozy embrace of true acceptance for yourself as you are.

May you offer that to yourself today.

May you offer that to another today.

May shame and disconnect melt away from you.",64

I don't have much to recommend. I'm finally getting around to *Community*, personally, and just reading this and that. Light stuff mostly. 

But I am hoping we can discuss something this week, in addition to your usual shares and recommendations. Triggers. Triggering content. I had been thinking about this after reading some posts and comments around here this weekend and realized I never actually had a good strategy for handling these other than avoidance. I restricted my reading and viewing to things I was pretty sure would have minimal drinking and even still it was upsetting in my early days and months to see, for instance, a show where everyone is taking shots or otherwise pounding drinks with no negative consequences whatsoever. One of the shows I watched in early sobriety was Rick & Morty and I remember even feeling jealousy at a cartoon of a drooling, belching old man who gets to carry around and sip on a flask. Sad but true. 

Unless you listen to classical or something, music is probably the worst. Rock, hip hop, pop, punk, alternative, country, and all of the many subgenres I'm doubtless forgetting here-- all replete with incessant booze references. Songs about having a party. Songs about new romance. Songs about breakups. Songs about life's general tendency to suck. Booze booze booze. And often drugs too! 

My good news for the newer to sobriety: for me at least, it's gotten so much easier. I really don't care anymore about pro-booze content, though I certainly don't love it of course. I roll my eyes at worst. I never encounter it and yearn for it these days. 

So what do you guys do? How do you handle triggering content? Or like me, do you simply avoid it whenever possible?",10

Imma bout to kick this shit to the curb and get back to enjoying what life was like when I was 12 years old. All I cared about was riding my bike to a friend's house, run around in the woods, play video games, or play with my radio controlled cars. 

Just found a Hobby store right near I work so I can get my radio controlled truck fixed, my 10 year old boy loves riding his bike and we just bought a new bike for my wife, we have 3 Nintendo Switches and an Xbox One S, AND we have a tent that I could set up anywhere. Hell, I've camped out in our backyard before with my boy and he loved it.

Have to reset my days AGAIN, but it's always going to be one day at a time. One hour at a time or even one minute at a time. I know and understand what alcohol is and has done to me but I will always move forward. 

Even if moving forward means thinking backwards. I AM NOT POWERLESS OVER ALCOHOL AND ALCOHOL DOES NOT CONTROL ME. 

Although I have continued to drink I know I'm on the right path to a fantastic and sober lifestyle. Anyone else struggling with this must understand that YOU ARE NOT POWERLESS OVER ALCOHOL. 

Alcohol is an addictive drug and can do the same thing it does to you as well as any other human being on this planet. I hate that I'm still drinking after gaining so much knowledge about alcohol, but I'm human and I fuck up.

Been doing really well. Taking care of my body and mind, sleeping well, drinking wayyy too much sparkling water. Roommate made us some drinks (almond milk warmed with cinnamon and maple syrup) and we were dancing and having a good time. Then i accidentally picked up his and had a sip of it. His had a shot of makers in two cups worth of milk. Immediately tried to make myself throw up but only succeeded in giving myself heartburn and a headache. Im absolutely devastated because 1 am this upcoming morning was my true one month and i can feel good or honest saying that to myself. Im back to zero on the exact day that was supposed to mean so much to me. Fucking stupid.

I know its not a lot but it still feels like a massive failure. How do i forgive myself for accidentally slipping up?

EDIT : Thank you all for the kind words. It was an accident and I know all i can do is keeping moving forward. IWNDWYT :)",8

- realizing the medication I was taking for anxiety was not being allowed to work when I was canceling it out with a depressant. Meds are working and the anxiety that I was using alcohol to cope with is so much more manageable.

- I realized you have to want it. You have to be ready. You have to say to yourself, enough is enough. For me, I was so tired of the mood swings, pancreatic aching, not remembering things, not giving my pets full attention or my schoolwork. 

- Realizing also, only you can keep yourself accountable. I was at a friends house who had several wine bottles open in the kitchen and thought, “I could literally chug one of these here in the kitchen by myself and no one would know...” and that’s not true, because I would know. At the end of the day it’s ME who has to keep ME accountable.

- since realizing this, I’ve been able to hang out with friends who are drinking and respect my sobriety. I’ve went to weddings and left early because I realized how annoying and embarrassing drunk people can be.

- I ultimately feel like I’m being called for something higher, something that drinking cannot coincide with. I’m in school to be a psychiatric nurse practitioner and I realized, I cannot help others if I can’t help myself. I have to be stable and consistent if I can expect to ever be therapeutic or helpful to those who need me.

I have lurked here for a long time, but have never posted, I have found reading a lot of your stories and experiences to be really inspirational and amazing, if you are doing well, congratulations! If you are struggling, I'm sending you good vibes.

Where to start? I have really been coming to the realization that my relationship with alcohol is not a good one. I drank a lot prior to joining the Army 10 years ago, and continued to party the whole time I was in. Last summer was a crazy one for me. I was unexpectedly diagnosed with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, and that set off a chain of events which I was not entirely prepared for. I was scared and mad and lonely, and sad. So I did what I always did, I drank a bunch. I was eventually placed on a once daily medication and am now in maintenance mode concerning my CML, but as a result, I was retired medically from the Army, which I had planned on making a career out of. I was disappointed because, I had never found what I wanted to do with my life until I joined and it was a great fit and experience for me. But all of the uncertainty of what to do with myself following my retirement, I continued to drink heavily, sometimes, I would forget to take my medicine, or would be unsure if I had in fact taken it or not. I was drunk this weekend and confessed that much to two of my best friends. I felt pretty ashamed. I spent all of Sunday hung over and avoiding writing a paper that was due that night. I turned it in, but I'm sure that even though I got a decent grade, it was not my best work. I'm here writing because I suppose it's rather cathartic to type all of this out. I've decided to do Sober October, though I am hoping that will create momentum to just continue to not drink beyond that. I am worried that I will be rather lonely, because most of the activities I do with my friends involves drinking. If anyone has strategies or recommendations, I would love to hear them. I am going to use all the extra time I have not getting hammered either learning to be a better guitarist, or spending time with my daughter, and getting my schoolwork done. I just really needed to write this out, I've felt like such a shitty person lately, hollow and uninspired. If you've read this far, thanks. I look forward to checking in on a regular basis and experiencing this new mindset and feeling. IWNDWYT.",6

I decided my final drink was April 21, 2020 (the why doesn't matter for this post, but like most people it involved embarrassment, anxiety, fear and became my last straw). I had already ordered ""Quit Drinking Without Willpower"" by Allen Carr off Amazon the weekend before which happened to arrive the very next morning. I binged it before lunch and didn't drink for 6 weeks. One night thereafter, I drank. Next day, hungover, I read the book again and realized that I need a reminder why I'm not drinking. In the moment of whatever, when I reach for a bottle, I want a tattoo on my right inside forearm to remind me why I'm not drinking: a last minute visual reminder.

This posed a couple of challenges, the two biggest ones were:

* What did I want it to say?
* What did I want to tell people when they asked about it? (since the truth is none of their gd business, I don't need to justify my non-drinking to anyone)

At the same time as this was going on, with my now copious amounts of free time not drinking, I was learning how to read Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs (which is way more advanced/difficult than my ignorant pre-conceived notions believed). I realized this solved the second problem quite nicely. I could get anything tattooed and absolutely no one in my life would ever know what it really meant. I could say it means anything I felt like given the person I was talking to and no one would ever question it. 

So what did I want it to say? I toyed with a number of phrases, and experimented with translating them into hieroglyphs (Thanks to a ton of help/guidance/patience from /r/AncientEgyptian in my experimenting/learning). Then I found you all here at SD, and the wonderful, deep, unifying, uplifting and encouraging phrase: IWNDWYT. It also happens that grammatically, it's not that difficult to translate for a beginner.

So, first opportunity with my artist post covid lockdown I booked it, and two sessions later, here it is (link at top of post), bandage removed just this evening: ""I will not drink you with today"" Tattooed in Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs. It's roughly 5.5x4.5 inches wrapped around my right inner forearm.",33

It’s worth all the frustration and seeking solutions, finding ones that don’t work for you and still persisting until you find those that do work. I don’t know how many times I tried before I succeeded, but once I got it, I got it.

I have done so much in the past half decade that I couldn’t or wouldn’t have done when all I cared about was getting drunk every night. I left a career that wasn’t for me and transitioned into one that is. I did the work to think about what kind of town/city I want to live in, and I moved 3500 miles to be in a place that had those qualities. 

Once I was sober I could see the big things that needed changing, and once I had stayed sober awhile I was able to start seeing how to change them. And trust myself to have the energy to follow through. 

Life is still not easy - but now it’s because I’m challenging myself to keep growing, and to deal with the stress of this shitty year in as healthy way as possible, instead of because I’m too drunk or hungover to do much of anything. 

If I could visit the me who was struggling back in 2014, trying to stop drinking and failing again and again, I’d say “relax. You’re going to get past this. Keep reading about the experiences of others. Ask questions. You’re going to find the path that connects and makes sense to you, you’re going to leave this shit behind, and six years from now you’re going to look around and have a life you can’t even imagine yet.” 

I think I’d just leave the part about the pandemic out...no point in having myself worrying about that for 5 years. 😄

Wherever you’re at in your journey, just keep going and know that you can do it. The support is here, and so many experiences for you to learn from. I love you all and I’m sending all the hope in the world your way.",33

This year I committed myself to building relationships, and now I have enough friends to play online multiplayer games. :)

\-------

Last night I got to play a couple rounds of Among Us with some friends. Before this, I had looked the game up and saw that it was most fun when played with people you know, and with groups of more than 6 or 7 people. I wrote it off...no way I have 6 or 7 friends, let alone 6 or 7 friends who would all be willing to get together at the same time to play a game.

When I got sober, I realized early on that all of my friendships were built around alcohol and that when I cut out alcohol, those relationships deteriorated. Even the friends that supported me in my sobriety were still drinking excessively or indulging in other vices, and I just couldn't continue down that path. I got out of college with a degree and my sobriety (both no small miracles) but no more friends. I started dating my partner after about a year sober, but that was really it. I was friendless, and I didn't know how to navigate the world of making friends 1) out of school and 2) while sober.

This year, my New Years resolution was to make new friends. I started a Dungeons & Dragons group with some coworkers I like, and then accepted an invitation to join a second D&D group where I only knew one person. I wasn't used to interacting with new people, especially without alcohol, and this was absolutely terrifying to me. I almost quit both groups several times. But guess what! I stuck it out, and it was fine! Yeah, things were awkward at first, but as the weeks went by and I got more comfortable, we eventually became friends. And now I have **7 new friends**! This is more friends than I've had in years.

And last night, about a week after I celebrated 4 years sober, I got an invite to play Among Us. It was several of my new friends, plus some of their friends I hadn't met before. A year ago, the idea of willingly joining a voice call with people I didn't know would have stopped me from agreeing. But instead, I joined and I had such a great time! It was so much fun.

Afterwords, I cried a bit because I was just so happy and proud of myself. I think to some people on that call, it was just another game night with whoever was around and willing to play. But to me, it was a milestone that proved the hard, scary work I've been doing this year is paying off. I've got new friends who *invite* me to things. I'm fun to be around, and people want to hang out with me! I almost can't believe it :)",18

And I cannot remember ever feeling better.

I was in my last position for about a decade.  My hours were 8 to 5, but I was salaried and no one really paid attention to when I showed up since I was the senior manager in the office.

So I could easily knock over 18 beers a night, get to the office at 8:45, and acid-burp my way through the morning dozing at my desk without anyone noticing.  And I did.  For years.

I was in really bad shape as recently as a few months ago.  Distended abdomen, flushed red drunk-face, unkempt clothes and barely shaving once a week.

I don't have that option with this new job.

The guys are all super hard-working in a warehouse and loading dock, and all show up super early.

I now get up at 4 AM to be at work by 6:30, and I can't drink if I want to do that.  So I don't.

And in a setting like that, the manager is expected to pick up the slack when the staff gets swamped, so I find myself rolling 250-lb barrels around and slinging half-ton pallets with a manual pallet jack.

I've lost 10 pounds in the past three weeks.  My complexion has cleared and I have ten times as much energy as I used to.  I feel deliciously tired when it's time to go to bed, instead of drinking enough to pass out.

But I think the most important thing is that I identified the source within me from which the urge to drink originated:

I.  Felt.  Useless.

And now I don't.

When I had the number-crunching desk job, I felt like a useless, redundant cog with no tangible impact in the world.  Every day was the same as the one before and I knew the next one would be, too.

Now, I don't deny that I have a problem with alcohol.  I absolutely do; I'm an alcoholic.

But finally realizing that the alcohol itself is not the cause has given me the power to deny it.  The alcohol was just an escape, a toxic remedy.

And even if this job doesn't work out, I at least know what my deep trigger is, and can avoid it.

I’ve been sober curious for a long time. I gave up for 9 months in 2016 then thought I could moderate. I can - 2 bottles of wine per week and sometimes a little more - but I just think about drinking all the time ya know?

And then a few weeks ago I read This Naked Mind. She says at the beginning that by the end you won’t want to drink again and I thought, you dont know me, but by the end I didn’t want to drink again. I know in my bones I won’t drink ever again and so far it’s been easy, easy, easy. Nothing like my previous attempt where every day was temptation.

But. But. But. I’ve read some blogs etc including Mrs D is Going Without, where she said giving up drinking opens up a lot of feelings. Not me! I thought. I’m a normal person with no trauma to open up.

And then. Last night I started on Nothing Good Can Come From This. In the chapter “Shadow Life” the author talks about how secretive she is, because telling things attracted bad attention from her family, spiraling her mother’s anxiety and her father’s anger, how she always had to keep something back for herself.

Oh.

She was describing me.

I feel like a tiny crack has opened in my veneer. I could worry at that crack and open it wide. Or I could try to paste over it. I feel like I have a million layers to start to unpack. 

It’s only been three weeks! What else am I going to start feeling? 

I’m not tempted to drink. Not at all. But for those of you with experience - how do I make space for all these feelings?",11

I probably made some crap excuse to feel sorry for myself.  Regardless, I fell off and the wagon left without me.

In the last three years, I doubt I went more than half a dozen days without a drink. If I didn’t drink, it’s only because I was too hungover.

My mind is frequently moving so fast that I can’t identify any single thought I may be having.  It is not uncommon for me to be sitting and staring, trying to find the next thing I should be doing, but unable to because of the whirlwind in my brain. So I drink to slow things down, not realizing until the morning that I had forgotten whatever thought I was finally able to capture. 

My personal and professional life have not been without stress over the last few years. I know ... ""get in line"". The truth is I'm weak. I'm unable to properly address the issues. So I drink to make the stress of the day go away for a while, ignoring the fact that it's all going to be there again tomorrow. 

People scare me. Scratch that. Fear of rejection scares me. Social situations - IRL or online - are terrifying and bring me anxiety that sometimes feels paralyzing. I would likely have been too afraid to join any group such as this if it weren't at the urging of my therapist. Typing this is done through trembling hands, shortness of breath, a tightness in my chest, and tears. So I drink to allow myself to be more social, leading to the early morning check of the phone to see what stupid things I said this time. 

Let me be clear - I'm sober as I type this. I'm using present tense above because I don't think it's fair or accurate to speak of drinking as something in the past. After all, I hit ""Nine days sober"" before.

So here I am introducing myself to this world. Nine days sober ... again.",21

As the saying goes, I got here one day at a time. Some days were really fucking hard, but there were a lot of good days, too - days and experiences I wouldn't have had if I was still stuck in a cycle of self-destruction. I know I might never be 'cured', but every day I'm still here I have the choice to be better than I was. It's humbling, but rewarding in its own way.


It feels strange and scary and good. IWNDWYT x",29

I am new to this page but first I would like to start and thank everyone on here that take the time to post about their experiences. Over the past week I have been popping in and out of this page and using some gained perspective from stories when deciding how to go about sobriety. 

I have always struggled with alcohol since I was in high school. In a household where I felt that my opinions didn't matter, I wasn't really allowed to go out with friends and I wasn't in many groups/clubs due to needing to babysit everyday after school, the only time I truly felt like I didn't care about missing out on it all is when I was drunk, sneaking out of my house so I could listen to music (and probably scare the crap out of my neighbors when a drunk 16 year old emerged from the corn field singing Stand). Because of this, I started using alcohol to deal with emotions I didn't know how to process. I started drinking any time my parents weren't around, which included in the mornings before school. The final straw was when a student told the principal on me after she saw me drunkenly sobbing in the hall to my friends. My little sister possibly had a tumor and she was going to the doctor to find out if it was confirmed or not. In my fear of losing her, I drank so much that I blacked out at school. I blew a .22, barfed all over the ambulance they called, and when my parents arrived at the hospital, they refused to let me hold my sister because I was drunk. I went sober for 2 full years after that, refusing when my parents offered me beers my senior year and going through the embarrassment of everyone at school knowing I had an addiction. Teachers gave lectures to the entire class while I turned bright red in shame. The loneliness I had been trying to avoid with alcohol made it that much worse.

I started drinking again in college, your typical frat parties and what not. I wasn't drinking a healthy amount but I also wasn't using it for emotions. I didn't depend on it for emotional stability and therefore it was easy for me to take a sober cleanse when I wanted to.

I met my fiancé in school, moved to St. Louis with him and all was good. Sure, I would buy a 12 pack of pumpkin beers, but I wouldn't drink the whole case in one night or drink it to get drunk. It was just something I liked. 

About 2 years ago my fiancé's dad unexpectedly passed away in a car accident, leaving his mom severely injured and in the hospital for weeks. Him being the oldest sibling, he was suddenly shoved into the spot of his father that he had just lost. 

I don't know if it was my lack of experience with traumatic events, I've never lost someone particularly close to me before. All I know is that I was scared, I hated being in a situation in which the person I love more than anyone in the world was heartbroken and there was nothing I could do or say to make it better. I so much wanted everyone else to feel better that I stopped caring about me. I started drinking again, no more an activity so much as a habit. Blacking out every night. Waking up to see I had texted people embarrassing things. My high school ""friends"" laughing at how I slurred my words and couldn't type messages, once again being the butt of the joke. I surrounded myself with people who could 'drink at my level' because that was easier than being judged by those who drank less.

&#x200B;

I am making progress. I no longer black out every night. I'm trying to do no booze on weekdays. I'm debating weekends as well, but to be honest I don't know if I'm ready for that yet. I've lost 15 of the 35 pounds I gained (without even noticing) during my binging days. I read books again. I've started running again (Z25K is amazing to look forward to). I may not be perfect (I blacked out for the first time last night in months), but damnit at least I am trying to do something about it instead of choosing to remain stagnant. Even just considering sobriety, no matter how long, is better than not giving it a single thought. 

&#x200B;

I'm sorry for the long story, I guess I just hope that someone else can realize maybe they aren't drinking alcohol every single night because ""it's fun"" like I thought I was doing. It took me a full year of coming out of that habit to realize I was basing my drinking on my emotions. The first step in fixing the problem is realizing that you have it. Thank you to everyone for creating a safe space in which I was able to share my HONEST story without judgement. And IWNDWYT! Day one wooooo!!!",7

I started drinking when I was a teenager. Only socially and at parties, but I was always known for drinking way too much and doing really stupid or obnoxious shit while I was drunk. When I turned 21, most of my friends had moved away, grown apart, or simply grown up. I got depressed, and wound up drinking a lot. I kept that up for over ten years.

Because of my drinking, I've become an embarrassment. I've passed out in my father's living room with porn playing on my laptop, I've wandered down town and left my wallet in a convenience store after making a scene, I've sent bizarre and rude texts and voicemails to friends and family. I've alienated loved ones and have no friends.

I like to tell myself that I drink because it's the best way to have fun. In reality, it's the only way I can have fun, because I can't stand myself. When I'm drunk, I'm not ""me"", I'm drunk me, and drunk me loves everyone.

Its time to make myself into someone I love, sober or otherwise.",98

I took September off from drinking after a couple months of just excess everything.  Gained like 10 pounds and just looked and felt like shit everyday.  So just went cold turkey from drinking and vaping and started to hit the gym hard (5-6 days a week).  As the month ends here are a few random thoughts.

-	Damn I wasted a lot of time either drinking, looking for a drink or recovering from a drink.  Feel like I have double the hours to do things in a day and I have accomplished way more this month than last 2.
-	Damn I spent a lot of money at bars and bottles at home.  Every bar trip was at least $40 and at least went through a bottle once a week.  I have rewarded myself to new gadgets and clothes with the money I’ve saved.
-	Damn I neglected my body so much and the signs it was trying to tell me.  Daily I would wake up with sore feet, sore liver, sore throat, groggy head, sour mouth and bloodshot eyes.  Also an ever growing belly.  Just a month of no drinks and vaping and I feel so much better.  My lifts and bike times are as good as the past.
-	I went dark with all my buddies this month but to be honest I didn’t get too FOMO.  Every time I did I’d just remind myself we’d end up getting pissed drunk again.

I’m not ready to go complete sober yet but as I start October, I feel this reset has taught me a lot of lessons and changed my priorities.  As long as I keep a healthier addiction (gym and fitness), I am confident drinking will become an occasion and not a necessity.  Just have to hold myself to it as a lot of you do.  I don’t know any of you personally but this month I did think of everyone here going through the same struggle.",21

Where I’m at it’s noon. Halfway through that first day. 

My head is feeling heavy and a little achey, but my spirits are high.

My first day 1 after drinking for 10 years straight was a lot more rough a couple months ago. At this point, then, I was suffering burning gut pain that I couldn’t quite pin-point as my stomach, liver, gallbladder, or pancreas. All I knew is that it was something and that it hurt terribly (like a heavy weight of a burning ball in my gut that only got relief if I was walking or laying it certain positions). I had anxiety all day long and was counting down the hours from my last drink - because I knew the pain faded around 14 hours since my last drink. I could hardly eat because I felt sick. I was dry heaving over the toilet after every time I tried to get up too fast. I’d force myself to drink smoothies to get something in my system. At night, I’d wake up multiple times, reaching points of pure panic where I knew my life was real and not a nightmare - so terrified I was dying. 

It was rough and I thought I’d never crawl out of the hole I’d found myself in. The lowest point in my adult life. But I did it. I powered through four weeks after that first day. 

The first week is a huge challenge; the first few days can be anxious and painful. Then it’s the battle of not giving in once you start to feel alright again... the whole “Wow. I must have just been overreacting these past couple of days because I wasn’t feeling good. I can drink again!”. I promise that giving in will get you back to point 0 in a day or 2.

The following weeks I started to realize the things I was doing for myself that I wish I had done so much sooner. I found new drinks (sparkling waters, coffees, teas, kombuchas), I found new hobbies/distractions - even old ones. I found new movies and shows to watch instead of hyper-focusing on my cravings, and I even watched the ones I’d watched while drunk and hardly remembered. I picked up exercising and eating better (AFTER I gave into hungry cravings and chocolate my first couple of weeks, because those are a much better alternative to more poison)! I cooked dinner and more complicated recipes because I wasn’t too tired/drunk/hungover to do them. I hung out at occasions where I’d have normally drank - but I said no. And I’d wake up in the mornings so proud of myself for being strong and feeling good.

I even started to realize how long and clear my days were because I wasn’t passing out early. My surrounding were vibrant and my thoughts were no longer something I struggled to portray. My memory was quicker to grasp. I was able to spend quality time with my SO and I was also able to talk to my mom without lying to her about how well I was doing. I was proud to talk to her and not ashamed.

After a month of this, I relapsed. I’d given myself a deadline and that deadline taunted me. I was so happy with my new lifestyle and how incredible I felt physically and mentally. It was a 50/50 of what I was going to do when the day came, and I made the wrong choice. 

The first sip was sad and regrettable. I think I knew what door I opened with that first swallow (I remember after taking it, I considering throwing it up). I proved myself correct with the spiral I had. I thought I could moderate (or did I really?) and it only took about a week to drink like I had a little over a month prior. Each day I have regretted that first sip, and each day I struggled to start sobriety again.

But here I am and ready to do this. I woke up knowing today was the day. My old fire was back and I wasn’t going to let it burn out.

So here I am again, Day 1. And I’m ready to fight this fight with all the other Day 1s, all the other relapsers who are back again, all those who have been sober days, weeks, years. 

I’m aware the struggle never ends, but I need to learn from my mistakes and reflect harder this time so that I can make the right decisions for myself and my health. If I hit a 50/50 again, I know what choice I need to make this time.

I dusted off the cute ole’ sobriety stickers I bought for myself a couple months ago and planted my (new) first one down on the calendar marking today.

No deadline, just one day at a time.

2020-09-28 15:55:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/j1jhpn/so_ive_survived_my_first_sunday_funday_with/,"So, I’ve survived my first “Sunday Funday” with friends, after having gone on the wagon. That was a little tricky, I did preserve nevertheless.","Pre-Apocalypse, my group of friends and I had little bit of a going tradition on Sundays.  Basically, this consisted of all of us convening at some rich dudes house, we’d all get super fucked up, eat junk food and watch movies, and just generally hang out all day.  My (35m) best friend (34F) would generally take turns driving out to the place. It’s about a 90 minute drive, so there was never a point in us driving separately since we live close to one another.  Generally, one or both us of would usually get super fucked up and end up crashing at said house, only to have to drive back super early Monday morning in order to re-enter humanity for the work week.  I haven’t really hung out in the past month and change that I’ve been off of the bottle, and so some interesting things occurred.  

I’ve been pretty mum on the whole sobriety thing. I know that cannabis usage is a little bit of a point of controversy around here, but I’ll be honest, though I don’t consider myself a stoner, I do enjoy whipping up the occasional edible and/or spliff.  Being in Southern California, it’s a little bit inevitable, but my main justification is that I’ve not experience an increase in usage since having quit drinking, so for what that’s worth, there’s that.  

My BF has been noticing little changes in me, and finally, last night, I’m taking the wheel home in her car.  She wasn’t drunk, but did have a few drinks, I did not, and therefore, even though we took her car, there was no reason in the world for me not to drive home.  Great feeling, by the way.  I can drive wherever I want, whenever the fuck I want. It’s almost like a super power that I overlooked.  But she did notice that I’m a bit different, to the point that she finally said something like “Ok dude, what THE FUCK is going on with you?  What is with this whole ‘Hey man, I’m all good, I’ll just have water shit?’, she asked, not in anger, but utter confusion.  I finally spilled the beans and said “Look. It’s not a huge deal, but my drinking was obviously heading in a direction that wasn’t good for anyone, me or otherwise, so I’ve pulled the plug on it.”  She was surprised, but supportive, so that was no big deal.

At the “Party” (if you want to call it that) however, things were a little weirder.  Nobody gave me shit or anything, but I did notice some of the behavior in some of my other friends and I thought to myself, Jesus, I really hope that I didn’t say and/or do shit like that, even though we all know that I have. (As have most of us)

The scary thing was that a lot of my friends, though they are good people, don’t even seem to realize that there is a little bit of a problem here.  We were getting FUCKED UP almost all the time.  A few of us driving great distances to do so, and I thought, wow, even technically, all of those late Sunday night/early Monday morning drives were legally OK, to me, I feel like now, driving whilst hungover super early in the fucking morning is no better or potentially worse than driving drunk.  Just not a good idea.  And I’ve been doing this shit for absolute years. Why?

Bottom line, I survived Sunday Funday, surrounded by massive amounts of alcohol and I wasn’t even really tempted to drink.  I was a little intrigued by this concoction that this one flamboyantly gay dude was assembling, a mixture of champagne, orange juice and something else-smelled wonderful, but at no point did I feel like I should be drinking. I take that as a huge win, as even mere weeks ago, all of that would have resulted in a massive hangover still even at this point.  The only words I got all night were “Hey, are you sure you just want water? We’ve got all sorts of shit here!”, to which I would reply “Awww, no thanks though, I’m on this super new and weird diet and I can’t really have any alcohol or sugar right now”, which I guess is a lie, but it’s also technically true since I really don’t eat sugar AND quitting drinking is TECHNICALLY a weird and new dietary restriction I have imposed on myself. 

At one stage, I thought, wow you know, I’m doing pretty well, I’ll bet that I can have just one little cocktail and call it day, and maybe I could have, but as soon as that little devil thought popped into my head, I squashed that shit immediately and thought what’s the point. Why have a drink for no reason, when I have skated right through a month without drinking, with the only little MacGuffin being the first week of hell where I was absolutely and miserably bored out of my fucking mind all day and night. 

Thankfully, as for last evening, the drama in which I was involved was the typical banter aimed at my BF and I, “Where are you guys going to finally get together/bang/whatever”, which is kind of a running joke with us, not happening by the way. 

So here’s to yet another week of not drinking.

Sorry for the book, but I guess the point that I’m trying to make here is that prior to a month ago I was absolutely fucking nightmare of a human being. Destroying relationships, embarrassing texts, fucking things up in general, and if I can do it, then I promise that anyone can.

So many of the comments were, ""Oh, they're just drunk, it didn't mean anything!"" and ""Haven't you ever had fun?"" and comments where people were calling OP a ""wet blanket"" because she expressed that she expected the female friends to be more mature since they were older.

This is *exactly* the kind of culture that leads to alcoholism. It's become like a rite of passage to get stupid drunk and act an ass, and if you don't partake, or expect people to be held accountable for what they say and do while drunk, you're somehow ""wrong"" or ""not fun"" or a ""prude"". It's disgusting and I hate that poisoning oneself has become so socially accepted.

I always hated the gym, always procrastinated going. I let my membership lapse.

After many failed attempts to SD I decided I needed to replace my drinking habit with another habit. One that makes me feel good.

So I joined the gym again, and with all the covid stuff happening, nobody is going! Also they have restrictions on the jacuzzi and sauna. Only 1 person at a time. Sweet!

The way I tricked myself was to say, I am NOT quitting drinking, but rather I have to hit the gym for an hour and 20 minutes in the sauna before I can have a drink.

The trick is that after doing that you feel so good and fresh that you really have no desire to drink at all. Rather I want to drink coconut water and maybe eat an Acai bowl or something else really healthy.

It makes me feel so good and satisfied that drinking just seems awful.

Not to mention, I have lost 4 pounds in 10 days, and this is just the beginning. 

I plan to hit the gym every evening until election day in hopes that this will form as a strong habit, and my drinking will no longer be a habit at all.

I wont drink with you tonight, but I will hit the gym and sauna!",11

Beautiful hotel, small smoke filled casinos. Took us about 3 hours to get bored in the small town. Wife wanted a beer, and after asking me if I would be ok at a bar, we went to a small historic bar. Started vaping and gambling with a soda. Good music on the juke box, I put on some Tom Waits. I gamble all of my cash, and don't take any more money out. Wife on third beer. I ask for Ginger Beer in a copper mug. Kind of like a super virgin Moscow Mule. 50g of sugar, but it's more enjoyable than fountain soda. Couple of drunk locals spark a conversation with us. One guy asks me what I am drinking, I say it's Ginger Beer. He puts his hand on my shoulder, starts telling me what great whiskeys they have. And I should try an Woodford's. I tell him, nah I don't drink alcohol. And just like that our small glimpse of friendship was over. As my wife is having her 7th Corona. There's about six people at the bar. The bartender comes to us and says that the man with the dog would like to buy us drinks. I'm so full of soda and sugar that I decline. My wife contemplates on another beer. But the bartender just gives he one anyways. I can see the man, he's alone, with his dog. Chain smoking, gambling at the bar touch screen machine. Ten minutes later, same man goes to the bell and rings it. Looks like he's not buying all six of us a drink. My wife still has her beer half full, so we decline that too. And since it's late, we decide to go back to the hotel. We thank the guy and say hi to his dog. My wife brings her beer with her, because it's legal in NV. We cross the street and go up to our room. As I laid in bed ready to fall asleep many thoughts went through my head. Was I impolite by declining drinks? Should have I even been there? Was I a ""buzz-killer""? I could have had a conversation with the drunks, but what's the point? I know there was no chance I'd throw my almost 8 months sobriety count away just to appease some drunks.

My girl lives in NYC and I'm in Philly so it's manageable within a reasonable bus / train every other weekend. It's coming up on about a month for me and she's been supportive, of course- 

I don't say ""of course"" lightly, but I guess it's something I never could imagine her not encouraging me. She's definitely fond of drink but when we're together I always felt like I was the one drinking way faster. To be fair, I'm about 6'3"", 180lbs and so it certainly takes a bit more for me to ""get to where I'm goin"", sure. There were times however where it had to be 3:1.

She came over this weekend and we hit the taco truck down the street from my apartment. It's in the parking lot of the local brewery in town (Philadelphia Brewing Company, really clever name, amirite) and this is a place where I'd haunt probably 4-5 times a week- being very close to my spot and cheap, since it's direct from the source. 

I had made it a point to bring up a few times that I didn't want her to feel uneasy about being able to drink while she was around me, which I think she understood and believed me. When I quit before, that was a real sore spot for me and I really disliked it when people would feel uneasy if I wasn't partaking. I mean I absolutely understand but it was not a feeling I enjoyed feeling. While waiting for our tacos, I asked her if she wanted to pick up something for herself and she agreed but realized she forgot her wallet, along with her ID. She started walking back to the apartment and I just said that's ridiculous: we're right here, I have my ID, I can just buy it. This was probably the only time she seemed hesitant but agreed and we walked over. 

Thing about drinking too much is that, whether you like it or not, you become pretty familiar with people connected to drinking too much. Whether it's the guy who was at the same bar that you used to go to every night or the familiar face behind that bar. I've talked to this guy working there about a hundred times. He seemed surprised to see me after a while and we talked for a couple minutes. I swiped my card and thought about that familiar charge on my statement, same 12 dollars, same name, I can picture it very clearly. The weight of the six pack felt weird in my hands but after that initial observation, we walked out, retrieved the tacos from the taco man, and went home.

Because I go to bed so early these days, it's a little strange for us- she wakes up no earlier than 11, stays up til 3 whereas I'm in bed by midnight and up every morning by 7:30 at the latest. This is very different for me and because of it we go to bed separately when we're together. It's strange but I'm happy that it works for now.  When I wake up, I have the whole morning to do whatever I want to do, which is very important to me. Part of the reason why long distance seems to work is that I have trouble spending that much time with someone in general. When I looked in the fridge that morning, I think I was kind of struck by the fact that there were 4 beers left in that six pack. It took me a few seconds to remember that not everyone is drinking to get fucked up and I closed the fridge and didn't think about it anymore.

She left last night and there's one bottle left in the fridge. I recognized this last night when I was meal prepping and don't exactly know what to do with it. I have absolutely zero interest in drinking it and don't feel nervous being triggered by it or anything. It just looks... weird in there. One thing that's cool about not drinking is that I actually have room inside of my fridge. It's a very small unit and the refrigerator is comically tiny. It's nice to be able to have room in there when there isn't perpetually 12+ bottles taking up space.

I guess I'm just gonna leave it in there until she comes back over. No one else comes over these days, given the nature of a global health pandemic, etc. But it's nice to think I could offer someone a beer if they did for some reason come over. I'm just glad that it's something that doesn't even cross my mind. No intention in gloating on it, but just acknowledging it's nice when it's an absolute after thought.",6

\- Not drinking will make my friends hate me.  
\- Not drinking will make me boring to my wife.

\- When I'm happy, then alcohol is a justified numbing agent.  
\- Alcohol is terrible for me.  
\- I don't enjoy the flavor of alcohol.  
\- I feel emotions more fully when I don't drink.  
\- Not drinking will make me more appealing to my wife.  
\- Not getting shitfaced at social functions will avoid unwanted attentions.

The whole thing just made me feel really down on myself. The people talking about it dont know that I'm struggling with sobriety and they aren't people I feel comfortable talking to about it since we aren't that close, i see them maybe twice a year, and also a few them are big drinkers, like multiple drinks a day after work kinda drinkers.

How do you guys deal with people bringing up your old embarassing stories? It just felt so embarassing knowing they remember these things and openly laugh about them. I know I cant change the past and im glad I'm not drinking anymore so I cant create anymore stories but it still felt awful.

She had had a few duis and after legal consequences had embraced sobriety and was a huge cheerleader for me. We celebrated her 5 years back in February, we chatted often. I really looked up to her. 
She got into a sudden and sort of chaotic relationship and that with quarantine led her to a relapse I guess. She’s not told me about it but my fiancé found out. I know that it’s not about me but I can’t help but feel.. hurt? Betrayed? Confused why she didn’t reach out? I guess because she wanted to pick up and I know that’s her journey and her issue but I just feel so shitty about it. 
Shes casually been trying to bring attention to her drinking again with snapchats/whatever. I haven’t taken the bait and acknowledged it. I just don’t know what to say. I want to say “that’s too bad” but I don’t want to put her down and make her feel ashamed.

Normally my kids ask me to re-up, but they haven't done that this time. Which is perplexing, because I was rather obvious about wanting them to ask me. I was probably too obvious about it and annoyed them.

So the thoughts about drinking are back, but with them, comes a dose of clarity. I remember that, towards the end, my life revolved about wanting to have a drink. During my drive home from work, I'd be focused on it. At family gatherings, I'd either get blitzed or be itching to leave and go home where I could get blitzed.

I think the first time I ever got drunk was at age 12 when I snuck some vodka out of my dad’s cabinet. First time I blacked out was 15-16. I’m 26 now and I’ve been drinking steadily since about that time.

It grew and developed into more consistent drinking in college where I’d show up to classes hungover or drunk (I would Uber to them). Then it just continued because there was Fuck all else to do near me, at least not to my mind. I’d go to the gym and take care of myself but just drink nightly. Alone, with friends, whatever. 


Now in quarantine it’s just so easy. I’ll drink a bottle of wine and a six pack or two six packs or something just watching Netflix alone.


I’ve gone sober for a month this year, but then I just get right back to it.

I’m stressing about next weekend because one of my neighbors/friends is having her birthday party. I can’t not go, but I 100% don’t want to drink. This is how my two or three weeks of sobriety always ends...with a social function. I feel strong today, but my fear is that I won’t feel strong on that day.

I want to be strong enough to hang out with drinking people but not drink. It’s just that old fear of not having fun or not being fun. Of course, I know all the rational arguments that go along with this topic, but would you all offer me tips on how to look at it and what to tell myself on that day, in the moment, that’ll make me feel like I am capable of abstaining or share stories of how you have made it through similar moments so early in sobriety.

I don’t think anyone would notice that I’m not drinking except my mood would be more subdued and less party girl. I feel like I could easily hold a yeti, and no one would even know so it’s more about me being enjoyable or simply enjoying it myself as this is a group of really heavy drinkers. Drunk people are such a turn off when you’re sober...which should give me insight enough to not want to be the drunk one, but we all know it’s not that easy. Anyhow, any advice is welcome!",2

(See earlier post if ya want.) Just wanted to share an experience from this weekend if anyone is going through something similar. 

(Not the shortest post but worth it if you are working on your own emotional healing toolbox :) )

On two separate occasions this weekend, unplanned just running errands, I ran into coworkers. Both are extremely kind people but both “rank” higher than me at work and so my anxious/alcoholic brain puts them on a pedestal. In the moment I was so proud to be not hungover when I ran into them. Nothing wrong in the conversations. But on both occasions as I was leaving the conversation, my body went into autopilot and I got a physical chill down my spine and intrusive thoughts of “they think you’re hungover anyway” and “you’re so selfish you didn’t ask enough about the other person.” This made me realize that almost on a daily basis driving home from work I get a chill down my spine while over analyzing conversations with people during work and leaping to negative conclusions about what they must think of me. Anyway, yesterday I was able to challenge those intrusive thoughts. Reality check— they likely were not thinking those things. I treated myself with kindness and even told my embarrassment THANK YOU for looking out for me but I got this. (Emotional healing toolbox brought to you by Tara Brach, Brené Brown, and you guys.) I know I will continue to have anxious experiences but I’m proud of myself for continuing to work on them. IWNDWYT!",3

Hi I'm an alcoholic...

Over the last year I can count how many days I have been sober on two hands and 1 foot.  

Thoughts of my first day...  Definitely want to drink but realize I'm killing myself slowly.

I was able to function durring the day.  It was night time that was rough.  My heart rate was through the roof in bed, my arms went numb and I was almost sure it was a heart attack.  As it turns out it was just a panic attack.  I noticed all my dreams were lucid through out the night and my poor wife had to wake me up multiple times while I shook in the bed.

The good news?  I woke up feeling like a million bucks.   It was great.  

Here is to hoping day two goes well.  

If you read this far thanks.  Maybe share your experience or give me a heads up on some other weird crap that quitting will do to my body and mind.

I don't have  a compulsion to drink all the time. But rather i drink, then i'm turned of from it for between a week to about a month. And then i do it again. And almost every time, i get completely black out drunk. 

And when i'm in this state, for some reason, i can say pretty much anything to anyone. And by that i mean i can say some absolutely batshit crazy things that i don't actually believe in at all. I'm not one of those guys who get mean every time i drink. But that can happen as well if i feel like i'm have been rubbed the wrong way.  And i'm pretty sensitive when i'm drunk so its not entirely uncommon. 

And the crazy thing is.. it doesn't seem to me that i have a strong compulsion to drink after the time has passed. Its more like i have forgotten why it would be problematic, so i do it any way. 

So about a month from now, i will probably think something like: ""oh come on.. it isn't that bad, you are just overreacting during the typical hangover anxiety... everyone gets those"". 

And a lot of time when i drink the people around me will say that they didn't think i was that bad afterwards. But what they don't understand is that i wasn't in control of my self, even though by pure chance, nothing happened that time. 

Plus i will have a 3 hour black spot in my memory where i have interacted with multiple people and i have absolutely no idea what i have said to them, or who i have even talked to, whilst knowing that i could potentially have said something really stupid. The anxiety is unbearable. 

I have had this problem for over 15 years now. ever since i first started drinking. And i have decided to quit for good many many times. But it doesn't ever seem to stick. I just don't know what to do with my self any more.",2

Yesterday, I celebrated 1,000 days...

1,000 days of no hangovers.

1,000 days of no drunken arguments.

1,000 days of no drunken regrets.

1,000 days of extra savings.

1,000 days of better health.

1,000 days of better decisions.

1,000 days of shame-free fun.

1,000 days of self-discovery.

1,000 days of self-respect.

And 1,000 days of being free from the lies of alcohol. 

If you are on the fence right now, imagine who you could be in 1,000 days time.

Apparently one of them, stumbled over a chair and the rest of the crew laughed at her as she did so.  I pretty much realize for myself, the moment I step outside my front door and head down to see them, my 13 days goes down to 0. 

I instead rent a movie on Vudu and fall asleep on my couch. I'm realizing pretty quickly that I'm going to need a completely different circle of ""friends"" and habits to win this battle. It's weird, I've become oddly protective of my 13 days. Just wanted to write through what I'm feeling this morning. IWNDWYT.",32

You are awesome! AWESOME for working on yourself. Awesome for stepping up against your alcoholic brain and saying enough is enough! No mas! Bastaaaa.

 I am trying to remind you all of of those ""lovely nights"" that all started with one sip. One sip turned into two, two turned into 1 liter of Vodka and a lot of regret and shame in the morning. For me it really helped to realize that alcohol is such an addictive thing. Dont let it get you. Don't pick up that first drink.

I’m afraid I’ll go right back to it after that because what I’ve been telling myself the whole time is that “I’m just trying it out.” But after this arbitrary 3 month time period, I’m afraid a night or a moment will come when I want a drink. And I’ll just say “Well I tried it for 3 months and I want to go back to it.” I’m afraid of all this because I never really hit a big rock bottom. I just got angry one night and then got drunk alone. And then a few days later I was really sad one night and realized the drinking didn’t help with that sadness. Made it worse of course. And the following day I decided to try a life without drinking for a while. I’ve been telling myself “One day at a time”. I’ve only been to one Zoom AA meeting and didn’t want to commit to more. Felt like one more thing to add onto my plate. I’ve liked my life without drinking well enough. But I’m scared of that 3 month mark. Any thoughts are welcome. I don’t know what I’m looking for.

It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Monday SD! (and happy Tuesday to all you lovely humans on the other side of the globe from me!) I hope your week is off to a good start. 

&#x200B;

Yesterday’s DCI was all about cultivating loving kindness and compassion for ourselves as part of working on a new discipline—like meditating, exercising, or maintaining sobriety. Personally, I do believe that working towards goals and having a sense of purpose and fulfillment is important—that it is a universal human need. 

&#x200B;

But, I also have seen how easy it is to get caught up in polarized thinking. We’re either good or bad. We’re either achieving or failing. When we feel disappointed in ourselves, whether it’s unintentional or with the intention to motivate for next time, we risk entering a shame-driven spiral that only makes things worse.

&#x200B;

Yesterday, I asked you all to think about times when you had a hard time accessing compassion for yourself because of something you did (or did not do, but meant to). Today, let’s bring some nuance into the picture! 

&#x200B;

Yesterday’s passage that I shared from Pema Chödrön’s book [Comfortable with Uncertainty](https://bookshop.org/books/comfortable-with-uncertainty-108-teachings-on-cultivating-fearlessness-and-compassion/9781611805956) started to touch on how curiosity and tenderness are key to feeling loving-kindness for ourselves.

&#x200B;

Here’s the next part of that teaching so we can go a step deeper into that practice:

&#x200B;

“Curiosity involves being gentle, precise, and open. Gentleness is a sense of goodheartedness toward ourselves. Precision is being able to see clearly, not being afraid to see what’s really there. Openness is being able to let go and to open. 

&#x200B;

When you come to have this kind of honesty, gentleness, and good-heartedness, combined with clarity about yourself, there’s no obstacle to feeling loving-kindness for others as well.“

&#x200B;

Gentleness. Precision. Openness. 

&#x200B;

In my 10 weeks (wow! Thank y’all for the support!) of not drinking, I’ve realized that it’s a lot easier to be gentle with myself when I’m not actively engaging in behaviors that drive a lot of my feelings of disappointment, shame, and anxiety. Instead, I’m caring for myself. I’m gifting love to myself each day I don’t drink.

&#x200B;

It’s also a lot easier to be precise about how I’m seeing myself when I have no problematic drinking to try to hide from my own conscience. No more drinking means no more mental gymnastics to convince myself I’m not drinking too much. I see what’s in front of me. When tough stuff comes up, I’m ready for it. I have no reason to hide from myself.

&#x200B;

And, y’all, I’m OPEN to all the work! Not drinking sets me up for success in the work of cultivating loving-kindness towards myself, but it doesn’t do the work for me. I’m glad! I wouldn’t want to bypass this kind of self-care anyway. I trust myself to handle whatever comes my way with unshakeable grace and compassion. Even if it doesn’t come right away :) 

&#x200B;

We show up for ourselves here. I’m really proud of that. I’m proud of you.

&#x200B;

And I’m curious about you, too! Whether you choose to share or not, I hope you’ll spend a moment today thinking about what it would look like to mix a bit more gentleness, precision, and/or openness into how you relate to yourself and your sense of purpose. 

&#x200B;

May you be safe

May you be healthy

May you be happy

May you be at ease

&#x200B;

May you live in loving kindness.

I joined AA and sought sobriety back in April, so I started with COVID soon meetings. I was living in LA, and there is no shortage of meetings there. I’ve met some amazing people through it all. However, due to the pandemic, I ended up moving back to my old city, which is much smaller and much more alcohol-oriented. 

I’ve never attended an in-person meeting, and I probably won’t for quite some time due to the pandemic. People here don’t really seem to care much about it, unfortunately.

I’m dealing with a lot of issues of loneliness, both in general and in my sobriety. I don’t have any sober friends at all, and I don’t know how to meet any, especially in a pandemic situation. My old friends I used to hang out with are no longer people who bring value or love or happiness to my life, so I don’t have much of a base here yet. The two friends I do hang out with still are both in serious relationships, while I am not and they are often hanging out with their SOs, which also makes me a bit envious as well as other emotional labels. 

I just needed to share. I have nobody to tell but my sponsor, and she’s back in LA. I’m so unhappy & sad & alone. Not in a suicidal way, just in a “why bother leaving my bed at any point of any day” kind of way.",17

I didn't realize how long the reply had become, so I'm just gonna make it a post. I hope this helps anyone who needs to hear how we slip, and roll down the hill.

I personally couldn't do it. I've been a problematic drinker for at least 3-4 years and a drinker that got continually worse for the prior 6 years. 

""It turns in to a snowball, right. If I start to use alcohol as a motivator to reward myself for things I feel I need to do (chores, cleaning, work, etc). I will slowly start to throw that alcohol at every facet of my functioning. Then I become a functioning alcoholic, and I'll do great for awhile. Blackouts start becoming more frequent, but hey, at least I'm just drinking at home. 

Well, now I'm so hungover that I take a shot before lunch, so that I can actually do my job, because being a little drunk is more efficient in my mind, than being hungover. Well, it's starting to wear off, but I'm still at work and I can feel the dreaded hangover rear it's head. Well, I can maintain if I just take another shot, I just have to make it through the shift.

Man, that was a rough shift, I'm so glad I made it through it, well it's getting late, I'm going to drink a little more to help me sleep so that I can do it again tomorrow.

Well, I didn't know how frequent the blackouts were becoming. I don't remember how I got home, did I finish work? I really hope my boss doesn't call me. Well, even if I'm blackout, I know that I did my job. 

The boss called today, he's furious. I left without closing down, shit I didn't even lock the fucking door. No, I don't want to see myself on camera. It won't happen again, I'm so sorry, -I promise-. 

I think I've just gotten better at hiding it. I mean they don't notice, I'm still doing a good job, I think, yeah... 

My family is tired of me sleeping in, but work is just so stressful. I tell them that I'm not really drinking, but they know. I need a drink to have this conversation, the anxiety reduction must be better than me possibly saying something I don't mean. I mean they can't tell. I can function, right?

I had to sneak off to do laundry today, I didn't know I pissed my pants, Im glad nobody noticed, thank God I didn't do it in the bed. I'll just drink less this time than I did that time. Well, maybe I'll just eat more.

I think the neighbors hate me, but I can't possibly face them, I mean I'm in an apartment, and I come home late and blackout. I think a neighbor may have had to let me in to my own place. I'm so pathetic, I'm just gonna drink anyways, who cares about me, I'm just such a mess. Man I could go for a drink, I mean what else is there?""

Slowly and slowly we roll down in to our rock bottoms. I'm choosing to stop drinking because I've been through this scenario enough to know that I cannot do it anymore.

Since graduating college 15 years ago was a binge drinkers that would go hard on the weekends. That turned to most week nights and that turned into every night.

I have been playing hockey in a “beer league” (AKA local men’s league) for years and
tonight the season started back up. In our league there is a case of beer on ice for each team after the game. I made it through tonight without drinking but man that was hard.

2020-09-27 22:52:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/j147r5/trying_for_real_this_time/,Trying for real this time.,"Okay, friends, 39 days down. This is the most serious I’ve ever been at quitting, and the first time I’ve ever posted anything here. I’ve been wanting to do this for years, and I’ve tried a few times before, but always with the thought that I could quit for a while to reset, and then drink again in moderation. Of course I’ve had to finally pound into my brain that moderation is just not possible. But here I am, finally trying to take this seriously. 

My first 2 or so weeks were absolutely amazing. From the first day I stopped drinking, I felt great, and almost immediately the pink cloud of happiness settled down around my brain. I had energy, enjoyed reading again, always looked forward to the next day, and went to bed every night with a lightness in my chest, like I was just excited to be alive again. 

Then it went away. Ever since then, I’m tired everyday, no matter what amount of sleep I get, and the headaches... the HEADACHES! Every single day, I get a headache. They’re usually not that bad, but it’s every day. I can usually get through a fourth of my day headache free, but then it comes on and stays the rest of the day. The other day I woke up with it, and it lasted all day. 

Yesterday I was googling around, and I came across several websites talking about hypoglycemia. Sounds about right, so I did some research about how to handle it, and woke up with a plan. I made myself some oatmeal with fruit and nuts as soon as I woke up, had a peanut butter sandwich on whole wheat a few hours later, some healthy snacks before dinner, plenty of water, etc. All the same, I still developed a headache which has lasted me the rest of the day. It’s driving me insane, and I can totally see how this alone would be enough to cause people to relapse. 

Anyway, I’m not looking for medical advice, just hoping that some of you can tell me that they’ve also been through this and reassure me that it gets better. I’m determined to get through this, but by god is this wearing me down.",10

It’s pretty upsetting every time the spouse starts discussing future job related conversations for me as well as what my triggers are, it fuels the fire and I get upset. Maybe I’m not mature at 32 yet as my therapist says. It’s tough living in someone’s shoes for anyone in any occasion and sucks it leads to arguments. 

I truly hope this helps me and let’s me restart in all ways in life. Doing what I love everyday instead of going to work and having a better relationship and not arguing about bs.

When I was drinking, I mainly did it to self-medicate for social anxiety. Alcohol worked- I used to be a shy person with almost no social life, to having a lot of different friends. It helped me loosen up and get out of my head. It made me relaxed and enjoy socializing. 

Well, it worked until it didn't. I built up a consistent pattern of blacking out and putting myself in danger. Putting myself in situations where I could have easily been killed, arrest, lost my job, coming to with injuries I didn't remember getting. Being humiliated after hearing what I did when blacking out, or having excruciating anxiety wondering what I may have done or said while blacked out. After countless attempts at moderation failed, I eventually decided I had enough and quit this year. It's been 7 and a half months since I stopped drinking.

I expected it to be a disaster for my social life, but it wasn't. All my friends were really supportive, I maintained most of my friendships I made while drinking, I was around drunk people while not drinking myself and it was fine. I thought that based on my support structure, I might get away with a relatively easy transition away from drinking.

Until this weekend. I went away for a camping trip with a group of friends. This was the first overnight trip with people since I quit drinking. Being with people for so long non-stop without a break caused my anxiety to grow and grow. It overwhelmed me, I felt incredibly awkward, it was tough to make conversation because I was so stuck in my head. I guess it was a lot harder spending a weekend with people then just an evening hanging out.  I'm wondering if the people I was with will want to see me again because I was awkward. It tensed all my muscles up to the point that it hurts physically all over my body, I still feel the pain after being home for a few hours. I hate that I have a mental illness, and that something that is supposed to be fun is so difficult for me. I hate that I am so sensitive to being awkwardness that I am reacting this way. 

I guess it's not as bad as the anxiety I would feel after blacking out. I'm not going to start drinking again because I can't deal with the consequences that go with it.  But this still feels absolutely awful, and makes me worried about living my life without alcohol to self-medicate my social anxiety. So, here I am reaching out for support.",18

Anyway he was speaking with a martial artist of some kind and they were speaking about this concept of “killing your clone.”  

The idea is that at midnight each night your clone shows up to kill you and replace you. And at some point during the day you need to do something, ANYTHING to improve yourself incrementally so you can be prepared to “kill your clone” and keep your place. 

Anyway I’m not even entirely sure I’m communicating it properly, but it really resonated with my efforts here in this sub. Not the least of which because I’m often hammered at midnight and would be woefully unprepared for battle lol. 

But aside from that, I often approach drinking as a sort of “I deserve the break” when this “kill your clone” mentality reminds me that I also deserve to grow and improve myself. And that’s only done one small action, one day at a time.

Haven’t posted in a while but still comment here and there. I’ve officially made it 5 months which is crazy to me. 

In the last few weeks I’ve been questioning myself which has sucked: “Do I REALLY have an alcohol problem? Look at me I’ve made it 5 months!”

Then I come to this subreddit during those times and am reminded by all the people who relapse that alcohol lies. Thank you friends for these reminders. 

Here are some things I’ve learned: 

Not drinking does not solve all your problems 

Sobriety is an active state that requires ongoing work

Smile and nod when people feel inclined to talk about how little they drink or justify their drinking when you mention that you don’t drink 

Fun things are actually more fun without alcohol 

Waking up without a hangover is worth an evening of boredom

Boring ALWAYS beats destructive

The feeling of loving myself and feeling pride in myself for my sobriety is more valuable than any chemically induced feeling

Exercise is good for the mind, body, and spirit 

Feelings were meant to be felt. Don’t resist them. Embrace the suck

Discomfort is temporary. Learn to sit with it

Juice in a wine glass tricks the brain in a great way

Alright that’s it for now. Hugs to all",45

My stepfather replied ""it's sad to count"". It made me realise I'm not very sure of myself and that small things like that can get under my skin. It's something I'm going to work on improving about myself. Improving my ability to take things on the chin. For what they are without attaching my emotions to them. Without taking it personally. I'm realising that when others lay in to you with negative energy. In the form of actions or words that bring you down. When that happens it's usually more about the person than it is about you. He's a drinker. I'd say alcoholic. Functioning but alcoholic nonetheless. It's his choice at the end of the day so I shouldn't judge. Maybe it is sad to him and to many others. But after some thought on it. I don't think it is. I enjoy counting the days. Yes maybe it holds me back a little. Maybe it adds extra pressure on. But maybe I like counting. It's my choice and it gives me control. Everyday I count I empower myself. Everyday I stack up in my head I grow more confident in my own skin. Every time that counter above my Reddit name goes up a number I became more human. So is it sad to count? No I don't believe so. The counting has become so pivotal to my self awareness and helps me become more present. These past 18 days I've been in tune. It's felt like a lifetime and I believe that is because I'm counting the days and living the moment. Anyway just some bedside philosophy. Thanks for coming to my ted talk. IWNDWYT. Love you all.",55

This was my first (and hopefully last!) time in treatment. I was very lucky to be able to go to a highly regarded treatment center in New England (USA).  I was just in such poor physical and emotional shape that it didn't seem like anything could be worse than what I was already going through.

This was covid times (I got out a couple of weeks ago) so there were some extra precautions in place, including staging people in two separate buildings before entering the primary residential treatment building, but otherwise it felt like covid didn't exist - except for the fact that nearly everyone there attributed some part of their being there to covid.

Anyway, it wasn't at all what I expected. There was a huge focus on spirituality (a term I wrongly associated with religion prior to this) and a great variety of recovery topics, including Refuge Recovery, which definitely felt right to me. I hadn't been exposed to that before, so that was neat. I've been looking into Buddhism a lot since then - and it's very helpful!

Even though it sort of sucked at first I ended up getting a tremendous amount out of it - I only wish I had gone sooner. There was daily meditation, yoga, camping, outdoor activities, and a lot more.

So yay! 10 weeks sober now and I finally feel like I can manage this. Woohoo!

However my dad quit drinking when he had his heart attack, but my brother brought wine.  He’s quit hard liquor at least..

It was so tempting to just have a glass.  I was telling myself that it wouldn’t really matter, and I could stop again when I got home.  It was actually the thought that I’d have to reset my counter which stopped me. I had plain seltzer and lemon, and in the evening smoked a bowl and watched a nature documentary.  It was fun smoking my parents weed which they don’t smoke but keep around for guests and special occasions 😆 

So I’m two weeks in.  It’s so nice having extra energy.  The worst part about my drinking habit was impatiently waiting and worrying about when my next drink would be.  I would cut get-togethers short if I might not make it to a liquor store before it closed.  I’d only leave a party when all the booze was gone or I was hammered.

Now I’m just enjoying talking and being with my family.  IWNDWYT",12

He doesn’t understand alcoholism because he can always just have a couple. He gets mad when I drink too much but then a day later is telling me to come to a terrace with him because he wants to have a beer with a couple of his friends. We live in a city where COVID cases are spiking and I’m a healthcare worker so already at risk. It’s a bar with picnic tables outside so he insists it’s safe and dismisses my concern. His argument is he’s seen me “just have a couple” hundreds of times or he says he’ll buy me something non alcoholic. I forced myself to go because I didn’t feel like being alone at home but once I got there I started feeling super anxious and decided I couldn’t do it. 

I tried to walk home but I realized I don’t have my keys so I’m sitting in a park across the street until he’s done. He keeps texting me to come back but even if I wanted to I’m too embarrassed. It’s not at all representative of our relationship. 95% of the time he is a great husband and very supportive and patient.  I don’t even feel like drinking but his lack of support today is hurtful.

2020-09-27 17:56:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/j0zqbb/what_a_time_to_quit/,What a Time to Quit,"I vividly remember waking up hungover the last Sunday of January. I ordered my usual takeout and had my pity party for the day as I tried to become human once more. I had tried to quit before but it was always like a bow string. I would have a solid stretch of sobriety and then swing back hard to make up for lost time. I still to this day have never blacked out, been arrested, or done anything I truly regret while intoxicated. If you looked at me and my lifestyle back then you probably wouldn't think 'oh that guy has a drinking problem' because of how ubiquitous binge drinking is with US culture, particularly in the Tech scene. In fact, I still don't even consider myself an alcoholic. I believe my behavior was more in line with 'problem drinking,' but it still needed to be fixed.  

At first, I was just seeing how long I could go without a drink. One week turned into two, and before I knew it a month had gone by. It was then that I started to realize that I wasn't as anxious as I thought, and that I actually have a volcano of energy that I was artificially suppressing.

The pandemic hit and there were so many different opportunities to end my stretch...but I didn't. The world was on fire, I got laid off, and then I had to celebrate my 30th birthday mostly alone. Still, I kept going because solo drinking can turn into a deep vicious spiral. The last time I was unemployed I went a bit too hard with the booze, and it ended up setting the pace for the next five years. There were several times I thought 'man, a bourbon could take the edge off,' but what I did instead was sit with what I was feeling and to my astonishment, the negative feelings went away on their own! The best part was that there wasn't the 'anxiety rebound' effect afterwards because my dopamine levels weren't being impacted. This is more of my own personal experience, so your mileage may vary. 

In closing, I just wanted to thank the folks on this subreddit. I went from thinking 'I can never be like the super heroes on here' to 'alright maybe I can hang just a little bit' to finally 'well damn, I made it 8 months.' I'm still not sure if I will ever drink again, but living alone during a pandemic while unemployed is certainly not the time to test it. Thank you all, IWNDWYT",96

I’m almost 30 and have had a problematic drinking issue since I was around 23. I distinctly remember working until midnight in my early twenties, bringing a six pack home and having my mom question it but my dad reinforcing it by saying “if he wants to have a few beers after work to relax, he can.” This progressed to older family members pushing beer on me at social events because I’m shy otherwise and it helps me open up. My dads side of the family are big drinkers so it’s always been normalized in my life.

I’ve cut down for longer periods of time here and there after college. I quit for a year once but now for the last 3 years or so, I’m lucky if I can get through one week of not having at least 3 beers every night. I mostly drink due to boredom. I don’t have a huge sob story behind my reasoning.

Some nights are easier and I can cut it off at 3, others are worse. I never go beyond 10. I know beer is technically better than liquor but it’s still a problem. I know there are people who are addicted to vodka etc but I still black out just from beer some nights.

Every time I’ve tried to cut it off completely I’ve noticed the triggers everywhere. Commercials, internet, ads everywhere. Friends who are pushy and don’t think I have a problem because I’m able to hold my life together. Cool? I’m still hungover 6 days out of 7. It makes me sad that I’m drunk sometimes with friends on the phone and they don’t even know. I’m terrified of what it’s doing to my organs constantly and still, I keep doing it.

I have avoided AA because I don’t believe in god, but it seems to be my only option at this point. I am afraid of trying it out because I feel like I’m too cynical for it  and won’t take it seriously. It’s a really strange existence knowing alcohol is poison and stupid but still craving it and giving in. I know the rush of happiness is fake. 

I’m tired of seeing so much alcohol consumption normalized by the younger generation. This shit has plagued me whether it has destroyed my life or not. It’s at a snails pace as far as progression but it’s constant and I wouldn’t wish the anxiety and trapped feeling upon anyone. It’s the worst drug there is that’s always swept under the rug. It’s my girlfriend acknowledging my problem but assuming I can moderate enough to have drinks with her at events. I feel like I’m screaming with a straight face sometimes and no one can tell.",18

It was stress and depression that got me, not the little lie of 'just one is alright.' So at least there's that, I didn't fool myself about it, I just gave in.

My ex gave up, she won't visit the kids anymore. I got the message first thing in the morning and it wore on me, then it struck me in the afternoon she actually might have killed herself. 'I can't do it anymore.'

I could have managed that. I did the groceries with the kids and focussed on my steps as we rolled past the liquor. I did great.

But then the youngest has been so clingy, and there's so much to do, but she wouldn't stop crying and wailing at me.

It was all too much and I went back into town just for wine.

I'll pull myself together today. Got a psych appointment booked. I'll deal with the ex issue, then I'll have more to give for the kids. I can do it.

I'm glad I have a place to talk.

I’ve discussed it with him in the past, and explained why I want to quit, and ask him to not stop at the liquor store, but it only lasts a few days. 

I don’t really struggle when it’s not in the house. But it’s when he drinks in front of me when I cave. Also, I’ve concluded that it’s pretty annoying to be around him when he’s drinking and I’m sober, so I decide to have 1 or 2 with him which turns into more. However I know ultimately this is my decision — my body and my health. I can’t force him to stop if he’s not ready, and I need to stop for myself.

I am struggling with quitting drinking because all I feel is empty when I’m sober. I want to feel emotions, I want to feel happy or sad or just anything, but I don’t, it’s just a weird vague emptiness all of the time.

The only time I feel anything is when I’m drunk, and so I drink most nights just to feel something, even though it’s generally a sad/lonely feeling these days, I would rather feel and express those feelings than have them bottled inside and not know how to express them.

It’s definitely a weird one, but I don’t know how to quit when I don’t know how to feel without it.

This medication is hard on your liver so the Dr. said to only have a half a glass of wine or maybe one glass a few times a week.  Since I’m not interested in wasting calories on a half a glass of wine I decided to just stop drinking all together.  

On Friday night, which was 33 days, I had 2 (large) glasses of champagne and felt absolutely terrible the next morning.  Not sure if the hangover effects were intensified by the medication but my head was killing me.  I can’t believe I used to feel like that (or worse) every day. 

So I’m thinking about maybe continuing to not drink even after I quit the medication, but I know without the deterrence of the medication I will have a hard time sticking to it.

I'm posting here to create some sort of anchor for myself. I have stopped before and I think I was up to almost two years but over the last three years I have drunk a lot. 8-10 50cl beer cans and smoked a pack of cigarettes per night. Not everyday since I started but it has gone from bad to catastrophic over the last year. Like I might lose my apartment, I have no job, no money, no people around me. Tomorrow will be a tough challenge. So many things to pick up and try to repair and recover. I gotta save whatever I can. Hopefully the situation is less bad than I think it is but I'm terrified. Absolutely fucking terrified. I know some of that is withdrawal as I'm having terrible shakes , sweating and confusion. Can't eat either as I still feel really nauseous and my stomach is upset.

Anyway I decided to finally try AA. I gotta stay honest and it seems like going to meetings is a good way of doing that. There's a place very close to where I live so it's super easy to get there, it's a five minute walk.

What can I expect from the first time? I'm nervous to the point of almost throwing up. If anyone would like to share their first experience I would appreciate that very much. Any support is great for me as the only friend I have left lives far away from here.

This board is the only support I've had. And while i comment sometimes, and always give thumbs up...
 
I know that I have received more from this group than I've given.
 
And all I can say is, ""thank you."". 
 
And all I can do is to live each day free of alcohol, which allows me to have a better impact on the people I encounter each day. And thus a better impact on the world. 
 
And if you're just starting out, or if you've had a lot of day ones, the best advice I can give is this:
 
* Become your own best friend. Be kind to yourself. And be very, very gentle. Be compassionate. Be understanding. Be encouraging. And above all, be loving and accepting. 
 
The fact that you're on this board and even trying, means you're already on the path. Every time you think about letting go of alcohol, you're further on the path.
 
I cannot count how many day ones I had. Literally dozens, likely more than 100. I even had stretch of more than a year a couple different times. 
 
It was finally letting go, and letting go of all the religious and negative beliefs I had about myself, and just finally accepting and loving myself for who I am, as I am . 
 
The self-compassion and self-kindness and self-acceptance, and really self-love, turned everything around for me. 
 
And remember, it doesn't matter if you have one minute, one hour, one day, or 10 years. It's really all the same thing, because we can only live one day at a time. Really, we can only live one breath, one moment, at a time. 
 
I was in a really dark place 3 years ago. I probably have a day one post, and I know I have a one year and a two year. 
 
Gratefully, my life is an entirely different place. And my world looks and feels entirely different, even though I'm in the exact same physical place. 
 
This board was literally my only support. But I still read it oten, specifically the posts about people who are starting over or having a very rough time.
 
Please know that I truly send love and compassion when I read each one of these posts. 
 
And again, I'm grateful to everyone here. 
 
Thank you, and I wish you all the best, today, and for the rest of your life. 😊

PS - I was alerted that today was 3 years because I had set a reminder last year that I totally forgot about. And in that reminder, I pasted the link for the beatles, here comes the Sun. I listened to this song so many times over the years when I tried to stop. And it always made me smile and gave me hope, even if I was crying with a drink in my hand at that moment. Hope is a beautiful thing period and so is this song. 🤗

Day 7, I refuse to give up!","I’m officially in the bargaining phase of sobriety. Everything just feels so, loud and exhausting, and annoying. I don’t think I realize how much of my brain I trained to desire that first shot, and how quickly the others went down when I stopped giving a fuck. 

I haven’t been a week sober of booze for 3+ years. Covid accelerated my already indulgent drinking.  The money wasted, the minutes lost, and not being able to sit with myself came to a head last weekend. Husband and I are in this together but today I am struggling while he seems content. 

So here I am! Biking and sipping crystal light while I have a delicious roast smoking low and slow and home baked rolls baking. I’ll remember tasting this meal, I’ll enjoy each bite instead of stuffing myself only to drink more and hit the snacks hard later too. 

Here’s to saying fuck you to alcohol. We are breaking up and while I’m still white knuckling my way through each day, grieving what I’m coming to terms with as my “favorite pastime” I’m feeling optimistic that I am turning over a new leaf.

I was already feeling a lot of shame because I threw up at the bar, in the Uber, and at home in my effing bed. I already felt shame from this and another wave of shame hit when I got hit with a $150 Uber cleaning fee. Now, days later, I'm going through my emails and I see that I took not one, but TWO Ubers. I do not recall the first one in the least. I have no idea if the first guy saw I was going to get sick and kicked me out of the car or if I had him pull over and let me out. It took me a short distance and then I called another one in a few minutes. I don't have any recollection of any of this. 

I was just starting to feel better about things, forgiving myself and making a promise to fix myself. Now a new wave of panic, shame, and self-loathing.

&#x200B;

Mandatory long time lurker, first time poster and, English is not my first language, so be gentle if I make any mistake in my wrighting.

&#x200B;

As the title says, I've made it to 60 days without a single drop of alcohol. Long story short, I(31M)'ve drinked since I was 16 yo and my alcohol intake slowly increased and became daily these last 5 years. I was in a really bad place in the end of the (hopefully first and only) lockdown in june and had to see a doctor in the beginning of july (2 days before my birthday). He gave me some medication for anxiety and asked me to take an appointment to a specialized facility, wich I did. And,in a blink on an eye, the psychiatrist I met there explained that my alcohol consuption was probaly one (but not the only) reason for my anxiety and my depression. I had, and still have some médication and I am meeting him regularly. Didn't have an appointment for therpay yet but I am looking forward to.

The first few days wern't really a struggle, few craving here and there. Whhat helped me is a obviously my friends and this this subreddit. I  read most of the post and I am amazed of how supportive you guys are.

&#x200B;

I will try to keep it short, I am really proud of myself and seeking to continue my sober journey one day a a time.  As it was mentioned here before, sobriety doesn't solve every problem, but be damn sure it help you handling life. If any sober curious or person in early sobriety stumble on this post, know that you're not alone. It sounds cliché but it is really true.

I quit drinking almost as many times as I drink. I have summers off and was drunk almost the whole time. I became a comfortable and mostly functional alcoholic. Now that I am back at work, I just get drunk on the weekends but holy crap I am done with it all. Yesterday I thought I would imbibe and have a beer with my wife on the patio at 2 pm. She had one and stopped. I went into my studio and drank 7 more. The problem is after 2 drinks my dopamine levels are high and I can't seem to stop what seems at the time to be a great way of feeling good. I need to learn to fast forward the tape because the end result is always the same: brain fog, poor glucose control (I am type 1 diabetic), regret, anxiety, and depression. 

I have been an alcoholic for most of my adult life. I think I have had enough to drink for one lifetime. I am tired of resetting my badge every weekend. I am going to go for it now. I must remind myself that not drinking at all is easier than trying to control how much I drink when I give in because if I don't have to work the next day, experience has repeatedly shown me, 1 drink leads to many every single time.

I haven’t yet been able to stop or even cut back much on drinking. I’ve tried seriously three times this year. I did make it about 60 days the first time but now it seems harder every time I try. 

I don’t have a reason to drink too much. I have a great life. I have a great family and good friends. I have a good relationship with an amazing woman. I even get along well with my ex-wife. I have an interesting job. I’m in good physical and mental shape for an old (64) guy, aside from this alcohol dependence and a few aches and pains. 

I don’t do bad or embarrassing  things when I drink.  But I’m killing a bottle of wine a day on average, occasionally supplemented by a few cocktails. I know it’s not healthy. I drink mostly alone and mindlessly. I enjoy the first and second ones. The rest is mechanical . . . I don’t even realize I’m drinking. It robs me of time. It makes me less able to contribute to the world. I feel like I can’t control it, which frustrates me. 

I reset my counter again today. I’m going to give this another try.  Day zero today.",6

A relaxing and peaceful end to a hopefully productive and rewarding weekend. Recharged and ready to leap off the island of rest that is the weekend and dive headfirst back into the unknowable waters of the coming week.  

Sunday is also the day of the week where we come together to celebrate how gosh-dang fantastic each and every one of us is. Whether you're counting steps, counting calories, or counting miles, I want to hear about it. Whether your calves hurt from a recent run or your butt hurts from a recent ride, I want to hear about it. Want to brag about a recent hike? I've got an ear to listen. New workout program going well? tell me all about it!  I want to hear the ups, the downs, the all arounds. I want the good, the bad, and the ugly. I want to be there to hoist you onto my shoulders in celebration or offer you my shoulder to lean on in defeat.  

Whatever it is - all things fitness related and adjacent - let me have it down below!   

\----

**The Good**  

second week of running 5 days a week is just about in the books and its going pretty well. I think I need to foam roll my calves a bit, I'm feeling rather tight today and I haven't run the mileage I'm supposed to today, but all things considered not too bad!

**The Bad**  

Didn't have a greeaaaat run yesterday. I was supposed to run 10 miles and I *did* run it but at a much much slower pace than I'm used to seeing on my easy runs. My right inner ankle -  which always kinda hurts when I run - really kicked up and the surrounding muscles began seizing up and growing painful as well. I don't think any serious damage was done - the leg feels fine today. I'm gonna go out in a bit for a RIDICULOUSLY LOW KEY EASY (pace) 6 miles and hope for the best. :)   

**The Ugly**  

this one's gross so feel free to pass up lmao. I was running my tempo run when suddenly I guess a big ol' loogy that had been chilling in the back of my sinuses finally slid down into my mouth. Cue abrupt gagging and total chaos. Very fortunately, I was running past a trashcan so I stopped and spit. I hate spitting in public, pandemic or no, but there was just no goddamn way I was swallowing that so the trashcan was a lucky break. I kept right on running only now I'm *dry heaving* (while maintaining an 8 minute mile lmao) uncontrollably because I hate *hate* when this happens. I finally got my guts back under control and pick the pace up because my run is really almost done and I wanted to finish strong. Cue the biggest cramp in my entire life. I thought I've had cramps and stitches before. Oh no. no no. that was a lover's sweet kiss compared to this monster clawing its way into my guts. It felt like someone had reached into the muscles lining my side, gripped them in a fist, and just twisted mercilessly. I immediately began to slow and try to focus on breathing but *nothing* was assuaging this monster. I ran maybe a 1/4 of a mile that way, fingers pressed into the knot of angry muscle, other arm raised to help open it up, face just contorted into a sneer of agony. I wasn't breathing, I was ripping oxygen out of the air like some sort of trapped and terrified animal lol. I finally did have to actually stop, raise an arm, and just breathe. After maybe a minute it stopped and I was able to start back up and finish the run.  I did manage to get a new 10k pr somehow despite this bodily snafu haha - 50:43!  

so you all, your turn! how'd it go? lay it on me down below its time for **Shape Up Sunday**!  Also, we're still looking for someone to take on the mantle of aggressive fitness cheerleader! if interested, drop in the comments below or PM me or one of the mods. Ya'll're the best!

Overall, I’m pretty proud of myself and surprised I haven’t had bad cravings.  The thing is I’m still feeling pretty fatigued and my sleep is inconsistent.

My moods are up and down and occasionally irritability comes out of nowhere (and is usually directed towards my spouse, poor guy).  Anyone one else with similar experiences?

Internal and external. Each works for a while. Then I return to the same feeling. Flat. Dead. Numb. I do not want to carry this cross anymore. Its weight is slowing me down. Normal things in normal life seem pointless. The joy of the simple has been taken away. My energy has been removed. This morning I spoke to a doctor about the situation. I didn't want to be there. I didn't want to acknowledge that the work I had done over the years hadn't worked. It left me scared. That it was all for nothing. All the recovery. The meditation. The exercise. Travel. All pointless if I'm going to end up feeling the same... it was a warning sign.

I know where the feeling leads. It isn't a good place. Ignoring the feeling of hopelessness costs lives. Nobody wants to be sat in a GP's office spilling their guts to someone they hardly know. But it is a damn sight better than standing on a bridge hoping for a miracle. Life is fucking short. It shouldn't be spent in misery. Yeah, we have to do shit we don't like to survive. But there are numerous days between should be enjoyed. It's difficult to do when the dark cloud descends. The world seems ominous. The future without help is scarier than reaching out. The ego will tell you to walk tall. To soldier on and prove the world wrong. There are no winners in a one-sided war.

Last week, I was working at home and burst into tears. It lasted a few hours. I didn't know why? It had been building up over the weeks. Each day a little harder than the last. Body getting heavier. Mind getting foggy. I didn't drink. I didn't want to drink. There was alcohol in the house I was staying at. I looked at it and thought what fucking difference would that make? I wanted to not feel the way I did. But I knew escaping wouldn't change a thing.

I booked the wrong train tickets. Then I got on the wrong bus, twice. Had a panic attack. Mind started barreling around. I felt lost. I was less than a mile from my house. It was scary as fuck. I've been in places around the world and felt fine. A mile from my house and I was freaking out. I felt embarrassed. I had no option but to admit defeat.

I went to the doctors. I told them what had happened. I got prescribed Prozac counselling and a blood test. The works. I have been against antidepressants forever. Now I am out of options so I will try. I am sick and tired of being sick and tired. The same situation as when I used alcohol to escape. That eventually stopped working also.

Even after six and half years of not drinking I still am not immune. Mental health is a tricky bitch. Even with a clean-living life, it is possible to succumb. I didn't want to reach out. I felt ashamed. I felt weak. I felt like less than a man. Even in the waiting room I still wanted to run. Didn't want to acknowledge it. History has taught me that denial is a fool's game. So I stayed. I spoke. I felt better when I had got it out in the open.

We all have to do things in life we don't want to do sometimes. Sometimes it saves your life. I didn't want to quit drinking. It saved my life. A result of quitting is that I've had to face myself. Look inside and acknowledge problems. But even with that introspection, it is still possible to ignore issues. That is a dangerous road to walk. Last time I started feeling depressed I bottled it up. Eventually, I became housebound and suicidal.

Quitting drinking might not have made me invincible. But it has made me aware enough to not have to get to that extreme again. It isn't easy. It is far from being cured. Thankfully, I don't have to suffer in silence.

READY TO KICK SOME MORE ASS.
NOW TO 14!

My longest break in the last 11 years is 30 days.

I want to eradicate drinking from my life. 

I will always remember the following to prevent me from drinking more.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Taking that 1 drink means:

5 nights of ruined sleep before my sleep schedule goes back to normal

30-ish minutes after that initial drink until it wears off causing me to drink more. 

50% chance of a hangover that will domino effect into - 
panic attacks, 
basically losing a day scrolling on my phone with a headache,an excuse to not workout

50% chance of going too hard and blacking out/waking up naked in my bed with no knowledge of how I got there with 1980s wrestling on the TV and burnt in circles in my peripheral vision whenever I look at a blank surface

50% chance of drunk dialing my friends and saying some unforgivable shit that I don't mean. (One time I called a very good friend after our mutual friend commited suicide and told him I wished it was him instead) 

50% Chance of wasting a bunch of money I don't have(credit) on some stupid shit I don't need

50% chance of having to grab a trash bag before bed in case I throw up

50% chance of arguing with my fiancee and purposely breaking something (my headphones, cellphones, Car passenger seat Visor, Car driver seat visor, car rear taillight,  car windshield wiper fluid reservoir, Windshield - note that each one of these were broken on separate occasions all from alcohol)



100% chance of shame/guilt 

100% chance of rancid gas and acid reflux

100% chance of additional weight gain 

100% chance of less testosterone damaging my sex drive and relationship

Those are some shitty odds up there. 

Especially when there's no reward for all the risk. 

------------------------------------------------‐------------------

Fuck all of that.

Bonus Confession: When I was younger, I used to hit my head on hard surfaces when I was drunk and mad. 

Why the fuck would I want to do any of that above?

Alcohol. Thats why. 

Never in my life have those things happened from staying plain sober. 

I don't know how I can possibly look back on any of those times through rose colored glasses. 

Fuck That

I don't want that for me. And I don't want that for the people around me. 

I want to be a good person. I know in my heart I'm a good person because I feel like shit for all of those things listed above. 

I am not helpless, I have the power to change my actions. 

Alcohol is my enemy and it can go fuck itself, and anybody that gives me shit for stopping can go fuck themselves too.

Went out and... what a run. Everything was symbolic, about drinking, about sobriety, about victory, about this fucking awesome transition that I've experienced and don't want to trade away. The weather and animals were in on it and lyrics too. It's one of the first times I was emotional at the beginning of the run. The miles flew by as I journeyed through worlds.

The only reasons I have drank in the last year were that I was seeing 2 specific friends who for different reasons I ended up drinking with. Someone close to me also had a baby shower recently and I had some drinks there after one of those friends kept prompting me for a drink and whilst I was there I won a bottle of bubbly in one of the games and so now I feel people are seeing me drink and think I will drink now.

 I've had people explicitly say to me they're expecting me to drink and that I have to and whilst I understand they have good intentions I know deep down I don't want to. My main motivation to drink has always been the social aspect of it, being more relaxed as I am quite an insecure person so I am feeling like I could drink a little and have fun but also since it's my 21st I know if I drink at all that will be a slippery slope of having drink after drink given to me and downed in a timely manner.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

&#x200B;

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Sunday, sobernauts! I’m so excited to host the DCI for my first time. I’m consistently inspired by the amazing sense of community here at r/stopdrinking. 

&#x200B;

So, I’m feeling honored to contribute by hosting the check-in, but also to have this opportunity to put myself out there with y’all. This week I’m going to share some concepts that are very dear to me, that have helped me heal and grow. I hope there’s somethin’ nice in ‘em for you, too.

&#x200B;

Pema Chödrön is an American Buddhist nun in the lineage of Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche. My favorite one of her many amazing teachings is about approaching a meditation practice with self-compassion and loving kindness. Whether you meditate or not, there’s some juicy stuff in here! 

&#x200B;

Here’s an excerpt about it from one of her books: 

&#x200B;

“When we start to work with any kind of spiritual discipline, we often think that somehow we’re going to improve, which is a subtle aggression against who we really are. It’s a bit like saying, “If I jog, I’ll be a much better person.” Or we may find fault with others—”If it weren’t for my husband, I’d have a perfect marriage.” “If not for the fact that my boss and I can’t get on, my job would be great.”

&#x200B;

Having loving-kindness toward ourselves doesn’t mean getting rid of anything. We can still be crazy, we can still be angry, We can still be timid or jealous or full of feelings of unworthiness. Meditation practice isn’t about trying to throw ourselves away and become something better. It’s about befriending who we are already. The ground of practice is you or me or whoever we are right now, just as we are. That’s what we come to know with tremendous curiosity and interest.” 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We’re all here because of a shared interest in not drinking today. For many of us, the idea of drinking alcohol is tangled up with shame. When I feel shame, it’s like pointing a dagger of blame back at myself for the way things are and the way I am. The focus shifts from possible solutions to ME, my identity, my perceived failures. 

&#x200B;

By the time I find my way back to thinking about solutions and feel hopeful that things can change—that \*I\* can change—it seems like I’m responding in a constructive way.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But the truth is, it is possible to grow and heal without the aggressive, destructive emotional rollercoaster. Shame doesn’t need to be part of the process. 

&#x200B;

That’s a lot already for today (thanks for reading!), but I’ll bring it back to how we can accomplish growth with loving kindness towards ourselves before I close with a prompt for today. 

&#x200B;

Pema Chödrön suggests it takes tremendous curiosity and interest. 

&#x200B;

For today, let’s all not drink together, shall we? While you’re at it, can you think of an example of a time when you had a hard time compassionately accepting something you did? Or something you wanted to do, but didn’t? Did that affect how you felt about yourself as a person? If it did, how did that affect the rest of your day?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If you’re feeling curious about exploring curiosity a little bit more, amazing! So am I. See you tomorrow? :) 

&#x200B;

P.S. Here’s my answer to my own prompt in case anyone wants to share but feels a lil timid about going first ;) 

&#x200B;

Recently before I decided to stop drinking, I was depressed and struggling with some work deadlines—especially for one freelance client. I hadn’t answered one of her emails and I felt ashamed that I was being so unprofessional. I couldn’t accept that my poor mental health and general state of 2020 overwhelm was temporarily leaving me with no more mental resources for this one thing. 

&#x200B;

Instead, I made it personal. I let shame spiral, I got really anxious, and I reached for a beer to calm myself instead of asking myself what I needed that day to work towards a healthier mental space as my priority. Simply put, it did not help! 

&#x200B;

Resource: Comfortable with Uncertainty - Pema Chödrön

&#x200B;

That book has 108 approximately page-long distinct teachings of Pema’s pulled from a variety of books. I believe the concept we explored together today is explained in more depth in one called Start Where You Are. If you’re interested in her work, I recommend checking out her collection and starting wherever you feel most called!",55

There was one night.

In your Winnetka apartment.

Where I was sitting on your bed. Just to make sure you kept breathing. I had my headphones in. Listening to that song. Just watching you lay there. Blacked out. You kept trying to force yourself onto the tile but if I let you, you would jerk in your sleep and hit your face so I just sat there for 8 hours. Keeping you in place.

I didn't know what to do. 

I was so worried about you. 

I knew that if I tried to force you into something it would have ended poorly for everyone involved.

I was dying inside and all I wanted was a well u/cursedseductress.

Try to take care of you until you made the decision you ended up making.

  I think this fits here since the side bar mentions controlling your drinking as well as stopping.  Over the last few years, drinking has taken over my life from college to post grad and has really effected my relationships and mental health.  After talking with a therapist, they suggested that I was using it as a way to 'self medicate' for my OCD.  

I'm thinking about taking six months off of drinking to try and get a baseline for casual drinking instead of focusing on a bottle or two of wine (this was my own red flag I started seeing) every time I sit down to drink.   

Has anyone had success with taking a break and finding a healthy balance again?  I'm usually an all or nothing person, and completely quitting seems kind of extreme in the long run if I'm just using it as a crutch.

I have found myself crying, deep resonating cries, the past couple of days. It occurred to me that all of the myriad things I wasn’t processing while drinking are bubbling to the service. It feels healthy, but is exhausting. It feels like the booze spirit within me is in the death throes from lack of alcoholic nourishment and these cries seemingly come from nowhere.

My house is falling apart. It’s like as I’m breaking down emotionally my house is breaking down as well. All at once. Literally the shirt I was wearing broke a strap today, as I was trying to fix my dryer which stopped working. I cried in frustration as it felt that literally even the clothes I’m wearing are coming apart at the seams.

However, I am tackling these things head on. I’m allowing myself to cry. I called my landlord and spent an hour crying while he gave me wisdom and encouragement. He said that life is not all suffering, but we all do suffer. It’s facing these moments and pushing through the suffering that matters. It occurred to me that I haven’t done that in so long because I drank to avoid the suffering. 

I am broken. I am frustrated. But I do not have the desire to drink today and that’s a first. I think that this may qualify as growth, which I’ve likely been stunting for a very long time, despite my outward appearance as successful in life. 

I am just sharing this for anyone who may feel similar. And to share with a community that has supported me over the years while I quit, and then start again, and then quit. I’m hoping this time will be the long haul and I feel that to be true. I’m not punishing myself by not drinking, I am rewarding myself. This is a new outlook for me.

Before, I would have drank with her, however SHE is capable of having just the 1 glass. If I were to have drank with her, I would have drank until passing out, possibly finishing a bottle or more.

I was a pack a day cigarette smoker, then switched to vape when I stopped drinking as a way to taper. The problem is I started sucking on the vape 24/7 and probably wound up consuming more nicotine than ever. These last three days since I've quit I have INSANE anxiety. Tunnel vision, rapid heart beats, cold sweats. Man... Nicotine is truly evil. I don't remember it being this bad last time I quit smoking, but I only vaped for two weeks that time. This time around I was heavily vaping for almost two months. I don't know what my point is with this post, but I just felt like talking about my feelings of anxiety to distract myself... from my anxiety.

The restaurant we ate at tonight had a nice alcohol-free white wine, so I had a glass of that.

I've NEVER been a reader but reading some alcohol books when I first started this journey as well as FINALLY reading the Harry potter series has gotten me into it. I also got a new mug for my herbal tea (I can't drink caffeine due to anxiety) and needed SOMETHING to drink to make into a new nightly routine and herbal tea has stolen my heart. And I got some new bookmarks! And now about to get some chipotle to bring home and relax with my dog and a movie!

It feels SO GOOD. I can't even put into words how great I feel and how proud I am of myself. 

Also at the bookstore I experienced something pretty perfect for today. I told the cashier about how its day 100 for me and turns out her AND the other cashier (both around my age probably late 20s) have both been sober for 2 months!!!! We all start talking about our journey and tools that have helped and recommending things to each other and it just was such a cool experience.


Just wanted to share. Every day sober is a win but hitting 100 days is a pretty monumental one! It's been 100 days of thinking ""one day at a time"" so I've been looking forward to when I could post on this day. Thank you all for your stories and constant support. Love you all!

Before and after: 
http://imgur.com/a/IotdkQN

What it was like before I quit:
I was a social drinker/binger from 17-25ish (I'm 32 now, and have been lurking r/stopdrinking since like 26). It wasn't out of control until mid 20s and then I was drinking everyday by myself. I gained 20 pounds from all the alcohol. I drank so much that I was sick all the time and called out of work constantly. I had 3 write ups and I was on my final before termination when I quit drinking. 

How I did it: 
I tried AA summer of 2019. I liked it, but I knew I needed more intervention and could not stop drinking. January 2020, I went to Kaiser's outpatient chemical dependency program and completed the program. When I finished it, I started attending AA again to maintain sobriety and connect with others in the recovery community. 

Now: 
I attend Kaiser dialectical behavioral therapy groups once a week, early recovery group twice a week, I meditate twice a day and exercise for 40 minutes everyday. I also found a sponsor and attend AA via zoom 3 meetings a week. 


Some info: I had no business EVER drinking. I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder and bipolar type 2. Drinking was making all my symptoms 10x worse.

However, all docs have said I'm fine and all blood tests look good. Still got an ultrasound next week then I'm in the clear. Interestingly though, what gave me the most comfort (and laughter at comments and nausea at pictures) was just now browsing r/poop (and this sub has also been of great help). Apparently what is coming out of me is totally normal and that is very reassuring (thought my doo-doo was too light in color).

I signed up to do this last  Saturday, and then Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away on Friday, and I used it as an excuse to get shitfaced. Woke up and I was too sick and hungover to volunteer. I was so ashamed - it seemed like everyone I knew was springing into action and here I was in pain and trying to puke and sending a lame message to the campaign organizers that ""something came up."" Yeah, my alcoholism came up. 

Last night the campaign texted me to confirm and said ""Really appreciate you, you've really been there for the candidate and all of us"" and I felt ashamed all over again. Not sure if the person who texted knows that I canceled last time. I did do this one other time in August, and that time I was hungover as fuck and struggling to walk around carrying a bunch of brochures in the sun and wildfire smoke. And then I fucking went to a BBQ (in my 4-person social bubble) and drank two beers anyway. Ugh, never again! 

My fiance's BFF is coming over to drink in a few hours. This is all definitely too fresh for me to be trying to tell other people what to do (not that I'd do that anyway, but it'd be especially sanctimonious after just a week), so I'm just gonna chill with them. In a weird way I kind of have this dude to thank for quitting. Left to my own devices I'd probably just keep drinking half a bottle of wine a few times a week and waking up with moderate hangovers and not having a terribly healthy relationship with alcohol but never having any episodes dramatic enough to make me want to quit, but my fiance's friends and especially this guy go HARD and it tipped me just far enough into bad decisions that it became unsustainable.

I don't have much desire to drink right now after walking around in the sun for two hours, but in case I do get tempted later on, here's an incomplete list of stuff I can do instead: eat chips and salsa and popsicles, pound La Croixs and iced tea, play Animal Crossing (Bug Off!), force the guys to watch Korean boy band music videos while they're drunk and helpless, read posts here, take a walk, or go in my room and read or do yoga.

This is my second run and I am so ready this time. I needed to relapse to know for sure that it’s true - just one drink has never, and will never, exist for me, and that my life literally depends on “never again”. “Never question the decision.” Say “yuck” or “poison” to yourself every time you see booze, let’s call it like it is. It’s not sexy or fun or glamorous, it doesn’t help - we were sold a lie and goddammit we are smarter and sturdier than that. It ruins our lives. It’ll ruin every last one of them unless we stop for good. 

If you’re still sober-curious, what helped to gently pull me out of this most recent black hole was listening to sober authors - Holly Whitaker and Russell Brand Im particular - there are so many memoirs and self-help books out there it’s crazy. They helped me level with how bad it had really gotten for me. They helped me to process things for about 6 months before a sudden moment of clarity and determination struck me. They became cheerleaders in my head who understood me when I was too embarrassed to admit I needed help to my loved ones. I got to do this in private driving to and from work and it transformed the way I approached quitting this time. It made me WANT to stop.

Today is only day 3 for me. I did something bad, stupid, selfish three days ago and I’m still unsure of what consequences await me. I am just a ball of nerves and anxiety at almost all times, and I’m struggling even more than I used to—*before* I ever drank heavily—to interact with even the closest people to me.  I’m feeling very hopeless and scared because I’m for the most part handling this situation on my own due to shame and embarrassment and self hatred. 

Anyway, the title is somewhat relevant because I struggle to relate a lot to the more extroverted alcoholics(I should say more extroverted than me, which isn’t saying much) on here who suddenly have very happy and fulfilling social lives once they sober up. I have a few people who are very close to me and are supporting me in the ways they can, but I know how I struggle to open up and connect to anyone long enough to form meaningful friendships they way a lot of people on here seem to. I mean, the only reason I’ve ever drank was to kill the anxiety and depression inside of me and to open up and stop making new people uncomfortable with me(because sober me can be a practical mute). I never liked the taste of anything alcoholic, and it isn’t “fun” for me to have two over the span of several hours it’s just head ache inducing. Is there anyone out there who can relate? 

Either way, I know this isn’t the solution to my anxiety anymore. I can’t keep doing this and I’m slightly better than I used to be, socially and in terms of self confidence. But I still cannot relate to so many alcoholics I’ve met. My personality is just dry and low energy naturally lol But I will shut up now and leave it at this: I will not drink today.",7

I cleaned house, went to park, did dishes, cleaned out closet..it s early and I want a drink...but as we know 2 becomes 6 becomes 8...ugh...i am trying to loose all this weight I gained from drinking and that is the only think stopping me right now....so i am rambling hoping this helps me. I just need something to do yet there is nothing to do lol and i am afraid if i leave the house i will go to the liquor store. Thanks for listening.",2

2020-09-26 13:40:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/j0acmo/why_i_cant_have_one/,Why I Can't Have One,"Hi everyone, 

I wrote out the below in a message to someone in an online game who asked why I disappeared. I thought I should share it here with this community. I haven't posted much here (maybe at all), but I do like reading the posts and comments here. It's reassuring to know I'm not alone, and it's somehow cathartic to read similar stories and thoughts in other people's words. I hope that the below is relevant here, and that by posting it, I strengthen my resolve even further. 

I was an alcoholic and by the time I went to rehab, I was at the point I needed to drink a little bit in the morning before work to make the shakes and anxiety go away. I wanted to quit but had been drinking so much for so long that it was mentally and physically painful to stop and medically dangerous to even try. 

I went and did a week long inpatient program where they help you get through it with medicine to make it safe and not so shitty to get clean and teach you relapse prevention skills. And help you start getting your life back on a healthy routine again. 

I stupidly felt overconfident in my strength to stay sober without any kind of medication after rehab ended, and I ended up falling back down the hole again after a couple months. I was down at a resort in Orlando Florida for a week attending a work conference and was a dumbass thinking I could just drink during the trip because it was sort of like a vacation, and never stopped. 

Went on a month+ long bender where I didn't even go to work for a couple weeks straight and was just obliterated drunk from the moment I woke up to the moment I fell asleep. I tried to quit on my own in the morning on a day near the beginning of March because I was too proud to ask for help again, and ended up having a seizure from the withdrawal that same evening. 

They gave me enough medication at the hospital to make it until I could see my doctor, where I asked to be, and was, put on Naltrexone and Campral, both of which reduce cravings and desires to drink. I also hooked up with a therapist at the same time. I've been sober since then and feel that this time I'm going to stay that way. 

The conference wasn't my first relapse, I had quit and then started up drinking again a few times before that. But I think that I've finally proved to myself that there's just something inside of me that when I start feeding it alcohol, it almost instantly takes over my brain and makes me not even want to limit myself or control myself. All I want to do is drink more.

Work becomes something I have to do for money to buy more, the people and animals I love become annoying obstacles in the way of me drinking, and literally everything else in life that isn't an absolute necessity for my barebones survival becomes completely irrelevant. 

And there's no more experiments to run, no more sets of rules to make for myself about when I'm allowed to drink. Once I've had some, it becomes all I can think about when I'm not drinking, and it doesn't take long before I convince myself it's ok to make an exception to the rules. And when I do follow my own rules, I always can't help but move the goalposts. If I successfully only drink on the weekends for a month, then it's ok to have a couple drinks one workday a week. One day becomes two, etc.

Once I've allowed myself to drink again, the moment I have the very first drink, the subconscious addict is already in control, already won. I just don't know it yet. 

So the only thing I can do is abstain from having that first one, because everytime I do, I end up in the same exact place. A pale, bloated zombie that only lifts my hand from the couch to pour another shot into my mouth. The only variable is how long it takes me to get there. 

Alright, sorry for the wall of text. I haven't said all of that in a while, and it's good to remind myself of all of that. I never want to forget the journey or how bad things can get, or that once I start I don't stop until I have no other choice. My hope is that by keeping it fresh in my mind, it will be that much harder to convince myself that one would be ok to try again sometime.",6

I’m a little over 40 days alcohol free. I went with three girlfriends who I used to have lunches with weekly - and we’d get through a few bottles of wine with each lunch.

I’m not sure that they care if I drink or not, they seem to have a great time regardless. The thing is, they became so annoying after a few glasses of wine that I didn’t even want to be at lunch with them.

I know plenty of people have talked about losing friends because of not drinking, I’m just wondering ultimately who’s choice that ends up being. 

I feel like I’m going to be the one who doesn’t want to hang out with certain friends anymore because when they do drink it just makes me think they’re kinda gross.

sorry. 

If anything, it was a great reminder to why I made this choice in the first place. There’s nothing like going home and having a productive end to the day after lunch rather than drinking more or having to take a nap.",9

I am absolutely devastated. I spent most of my childhood and teenage years living with my grandparents. She was hands down one of the best people on the planet. Kind, generous, caring, funny, eccentric, loving, cooked like a beast, gossiped like crazy, and was completely in love with Will Smith and Colin Firth. Of course since it's the time of covid no one really got to say any goodbyes or be by her side. I will miss her immensely but I am going to feel all of this grief and deal with it without destroying myself. There is no amount of drinking or binge eating that would change any of this. I'm honestly surprised I'm not even tempted but it's true. I guess I just wanted to post and reach out because this is a hard time and I can use all of the support I can get.

We were talkin' and after a while, while never too eager to gush about it 'cause I know when I start, I have a bad habit of talkin too much about it, I mentioned how I stopped drinking almost a month ago. He was listening and encouraging and all but it wasn't until maybe ten minutes later he told me he's been in AA for over three years. He was happy about it, was glad to answer any questions I asked him, but otherwise didn't have much more to say about it.  


What's remarkable to me about it is how we, people in various stages of recovery, can find it hard to not talk about a lot of times with people who are supportive or can relate directly. Ever notice before how people getting clean just seem to talk in circles about it? No coincidence when you finally realize by now how much mental real state it takes up in yr head. I do it all the time, but try to be mindful to change the subject once I realize I'm *doing it again*. That's a rule in general, talking too much about anything, but little more so about booze and this complicated re-arrangement in my life.

That's why it kind of touched me hearing him so nonchalant about his recovery. I loved that. He knew what he was about and that's really all there was to it. I feel like it's a relief talking to anyone else who's experienced this kind of emotional / physical hemorrhaging that is forcibly removing booze from your life entirely. There's a connection that you don  It's something I'd like to get better with, along with *all the other* things I'm getting better with in sobriety. Doesn't mean I'll ever stop spillin my damn guts out with y'all, of course :))",10
2020-09-26 13:08:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/j09rzk/is_it_normal_to_experience_existential_crisis/,"Is it normal to experience ""existential crisis"" after stopping alcohol?","I am 31 and was basically a weekend blackout binge drinker for ten years. It began in college and then by my mid 20s I was basically using it on weekends as a vice, just drinking alone. It was kind of my ""thing"" that I'd look forward to once or twice a week. I workout almost every day and eat healthy, but then I'd down 10 craft beers or a bottle of whiskey on fri/sat while watching movies or listening to music. Pretty sad, but it is what it is. As I got older I couldn't handle the hangxiety the next day. I'm also otherwise very healthy so it was always at odds with my lifestyle, but I found it difficult to give up because it was so ingrained, and I still really love the euphoria of getting a good buzz. But I finally had a wake up call two months ago where I drank a bottle of tequila on an empty stomach and felt like I was dying the next day. I had to call my mom and at 31 years old it was embarrassing and humbling to have to rely on my mom to help me. It reminded me of Duff Mckagan (bassist for Guns n Roses) talking about how he sobered up after his mom was in the hospital and he realized how selfish he was being. 

So I've been off booze altogether since then, two and a half months, and felt pretty good until a few days ago. I suddenly began to experience what I can only describe as an existential crisis...I was laying in bed about to fall asleep when I suddenly had a massive panic attack and couldn't stop dwelling on the fact that we are on a giant rock floating through an infinite void, that none of us know how we got here or what the meaning is. I've always grounded anxiety attacks by thinking ""everything is OK, it's all in your head"" but suddenly the concept of living on a giant rock in the middle of a vast universe absolutely terrified me as I realized there is nothing ""normal"" or safe about our existence haha. I don't know why my brain is fixating on it, but it's almost causing me to disassociate - I suddenly get moments where I think ""there's no way any of this can be real, I must be dreaming"". I was afraid I was having psychosis but I think people going through that typically lack self awareness. I'm fully aware that my thoughts are intrusive and pointless to dwell on, but I can't stop fixating on them.

I do have a medical marijuana card and have been using mostly 1:1 CBD/THC blends since obtaining it in March, although I actually haven't been vaping as much recently as I was a month or two ago when I first gave up alcohol. I'm a creature of habit so at the time I basically used it as a crutch to avoid booze, so I would get a little high on a Friday or Saturday thinking it was healthier than downing a bottle of liquor. However I figured I might take a break from the MJ until these thoughts subside as I know marijuana can potentiate paranoia and anxiety... but I don't really know if that's what is happening or if it's my brain ""coming down"" from the alcohol numbing it for so long? I have always had a very over analytical mind. I think I used alcohol to escape to some degree (even if it was subconciously) and so it may just be rebounding back now to its pre-alcohol state, but I almost feel like it's running a million miles per second 😂. I used to drink 4 or 5 cups of coffee per day and feel groggy by afternoon during the week and now I have one or two cups and I'm FIRED UP (*Al Pacino voice*). 

I don't know if anyone else has gone through this or has recommendations or advice. Or maybe I'm just going through a midlife crisis of sorts and it's unrelated to the alcohol.

Thanks for any insight you may have!",13

I know I'm a baby in sobriety, but since quitting, I have had zero urges to drink and zero cravings, which is probably partly due to being pregnant. Well last night I had a very vivid dream that I was sitting on my couch with my sister and my husband walked in and handed me a glass of red wine.

My Uncle passed away a few months ago in Nigeria and due to Covid (and the way Nigerian funerals work) the actual burial is happening this weekend. My family (here in the states) is having a Celebration of Life tonight to honor him and I know everyone is going to be drinking (including my husband).

My kids already asked me if we are going to be spending the night at their Grandparents’ house because they are used to everyone getting so drunk that we have to sleep over BUT I was proud to tell them that since I’m on a “break” from drinking I will be able to drive us home.

I have a bunch of La Croix and Kombucha that I am bringing along so I can be under the radar, but I am already feeling a bit resentful towards my husband being that he drank Bourban last night and got sloppy and it was annoying so not looking forward to an evening of my entire family drinking and feeling “left out”.

I have been using edibles and cannabis for now as they help with my anxiety and appetite (recovered ED) so I have packed a gummy to bring with but overall just feeling a little overwhelmed.

Will be checking in later, but hoping for a few words of encouragement!

In the past few years I have gone through an incredible amount of life events that have led me even deeper down the rabbit whole of abusing alcohol. I'm scared for my health, and I think today is the day that I wake up and throw away all my booze. This will be my 3rd time trying, and I need it to work. I *love* the idea of living a healthy lifestyle where I cook healthy food, feel good, can think clearly, and feel like my life is together... and maybe even feel like I can take care of someone else. 

I just worry about caving into social pressure and drinking with friends. I'm extremely extroverted and love going out and having a few cocktails--but I need to learn how to enjoy not drinking even more. I know it's a process, and I'm curious what people here have done to really break the habit/addiction. I truly envy people who don't drink and would love to feel as good as they do, yet I still find myself pouring myself multiple drinks 5 or 6 nights out of the week. The dream of feeling as good as they do is only one decision away, but it's such a hard decision to commit to, no matter how powerful the dream of feeling healthy is. I think the next step is finding a community of people with a similar goal in mind, all helping one another out to achieve a better and healthier lifestyle. So, hello!

A little background about myself is I'm a musician and producer, I've had my music played in Carnegie Hall, and have found other significant successes along the way, but I feel that as my drinking increased, my success has decreased. I think that committing myself to music whenever I feel an urge to pour myself a drink is a good first step that I need to hold myself responsible for.

What tricks do people have to get around the pressures of drinking with friends? I was thinking that buying a calendar, and putting a red ""X"" through every day that I don't drink so that I can physically see how I'm helping myself, it could be a routine part of my day, and it would be something to constantly remind me that I'm doing something good for myself.",10

It's been up and down of course, but I have had segments of a week at a time without booze. My last stretch was 20 days, which ended about 10 days ago. I thought I'd give myself a pass for the night as my wife and kid were both out of town and had the house to myself. I figured one cheat night wouldn't be a problem and I would jump right back on track. We all know how this story ends. I got too drunk on my cheat night and could think of nothing other than the hair of the dog the next day. That lead to a pretty bad, for me, 5 day bender. I've safely withdrawn and feeling back to myself, and am on my second day of complete sobriety. The two days of withdrawals after my last drink felt extreme to me, and nobody in my family knew. I was having to go for walks during my panic attacks and explain the my stomach was just upset when I couldn't eat. I know many of you can understand that feeling.
If I can do 20 days, there's no reason I can't do 200. I've sought out a counselor and will start attending some virtual meetings. I've been following this forum for a while and feel comfortable sharing here. Not looking for any particular response, but it feels good to get this out there.",6

I wanted to make this post more for cathartic reasons and document my progress so that I can look back. Maybe it will help someone else as well. (36yo Male)

My story begins like most of you back in High School where I drank at weekend parties, but that was not often. By the time I got to college I was attending parties pretty regularly and drinking heavily at those. Once college ended I wasn't really drinking more that the occasional social event or a drink over a meal. I have been looking back to try and try to really pin down where this all started.  I think I was either drinking to ultimately escape and convince myself I was happy and then was unable to sleep unless I had a drink.

I moved back to my home city a couple of years after graduating and scored an unbelievable loft with and overlook of the city. There were no shortage of places to drink around and it was a great way to meet new people. I lived in the loft by myself which gave me all of the freedom to drink inappropriately.

Fast forward a couple of years and I met an amazing girl who ended up moving into the loft with me. I don't think my drinking was yet out of control, but as responsible as she was she also enjoyed going out for the occasional bar excursion or dinner. Eventually she grew tired of living downtown and gave me the ultimatum of moving to the suburbs and buying a house or living without her. I relented with conditions on where I wanted to move. 6 months later we found a great house in a private lake community.

There were no shortage of projects there, but I missed living downtown. This with a job that was really wearing on me I found myself drinking more. She started to notice and made some comments. I did the wrong thing and started hiding my drinking. I would go to the basement to do some ""work"" where I had a hidden stash. Eventually I pulled back so much that she grew away from me and asked me to move out. There was nothing I could do to convince her to work on things.

I spiraled out of control from here. Ended up moving into my brothers house who has a large bar of which I defiantly indulged. After some time it was time for me to go. I made the decision to move out of state to somewhere more tropical. While I was getting my affairs in order I ended up moving back into my parents house. I found myself picking up a pint on my way home from work and stopping at a local secluded park knocking that back almost daily. I also kept a bottle under my bed. Eventually my family caught on and had an intervention which me being the stubborn ass I am did not go over with open ears.

I would go to my storage unit I had and drink, sometimes passing out for an hour on the sofa stored inside. How none of this set off an alarm for me I will never know looking back now. I moved in with a guy a met at a bar of all things while scouting locations during a 2 week vacation. I continued drinking as I was taking a 6mo break. He enjoyed partying as well.

I know this is long, but it is almost to the ah-ha moment. I moved into a small apartment by myself and actually slowed down a bit. Eventually a girl I met from my home town moved down with me. We got another, nicer apartment with a garage. Somewhere along the line I would go to the garage and have a drink, come back up like nothing. The ah-ha moment comes when I realized I wake up at 4am every day to puke. I would have to take a drink to make that go away. I have lost my drive at work, my sexual desire. I realized I drink 1/2 of a fifth a day. 2 days ago I looked at my fifth and just said to myself, ""this has to stop"" and committed that I would not be picking up my next one.",18
2020-09-26 07:12:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/j048os/alcoholism_is_everywhere/,Alcoholism is Everywhere,"Hello all,

today I was on Facebook and saw a post from a cancer charity requesting people do sober October to raise funds for cancer research. In the comments, people were complaining and one comment stood out in particular - the charity offer 'tiered' voluntary packages, ranging from 7 days to 21 days of sobriety to commit to.

Having been sober for nigh on four months now, this is absolutely insane to me. During the dark days of my alcoholism, I wouldn't have bat an eyelid at this. My drinking got so bad that I always expected it after work, I trained myself to swallow my vomit from drinking too much \[so I could continue drinking\] and I blacked out every single week once or twice.

This is insane because my stint of sobriety has blown this hoax open. Alcoholism is everywhere. The majority of the population are so hooked on it that they don't see how ingrained it is into all of our lives. I suspect the people who do this don't realise they have a problem and do it 'for fun' as a 'mates banter' kind of thing. The low day counts for sobriety mentioned above seem so low, almost pointless to me. You don't see benefits in the short term unless you're properly hooked and need 2-4 weeks to actually see meaningful changes. It's like asking someone to give up takeaways for a week or two. Seems easy right?

The framing of alcohol normalisation in the media is problematic because it is normalising addiction. I always told myself 'it's normal drinking this much' and it was, because I bought in to it. With my newfound clarity, it absolutely is not normal to abuse your body in the way I did. To crave drink every weekend like I used to scare me now, and I cannot believe I functioned drinking as much as I did. I feel that good sober that even one pint changes my bodily chemistry and I will feel crappy.

If you are looking for a taking from this, consider this. Keep going with your sobriety if you are in the early days. Congratulations on realising it is a bad thing. One day I hope you all can see what I now see, because it's shocking to say the least...

The normalisation of alcoholism as we are all used to is criminal.",55

I went to see a doctor and got diagnosed with IBS after a few tests to rule out other things, and I’ve tried multiple different treatments but my digestion remains stuck on fast forward. It was never this bad before I started drinking.

2020-09-26 07:04:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/j045kw/one_month_done/,One Month Done!,"As the title would suggest, I’ve done it, I’ve done one month sober for the first time in two years. Here are a few thoughts and a few experiences that may help anyone contemplating quitting or anyone in those difficult first few days.

Why did I drink?

Well I suffer pretty badly from anxiety, intrusive thoughts mainly that make some days really bloody bad.

Drinking quelled that anxiety somewhat and gave me a bit of perspective so that I could see how stupid my anxiety was.

I thought I had a pretty good relationship with the alcohol in this regard but I didn’t. Slowly it crept up on me and I couldn’t make it past three in the afternoon without looking to a beer to make my anxiety go away.

I’d be out and about enjoying nature with my girlfriend and constantly be thinking about the sweet relief of that first beer when I got home.

It wasn’t good and I got to the point a month ago where I was just constantly anxious, to the point where I didn’t really want to live.

I had a realisation that the alcohol was probably making things worse - who would have guessed? So I decided to stop, I was depressed as a result of my anxiety so why would I continue drinking something that made me more depressed and more anxious?

I read this sub, got my day timer and decided enough was enough. Here’s how my journey has been so far.

Week 1

This was horrible. The first five days I was busy working thank god, but it felt like hell on earth. Every afternoon the anxiety would hit hard and I’d think I was going to die or lose my mind.

But, day by day the anxiety started hitting later on in the day, until one day it didn’t hit at all. It was maybe after a whole week that I started to feel normal again. The anxiety was manageable and I felt like a new person.

Week 2

Wow what a feeling. I was on top of the world, I had so much energy and was almost constantly happy. Why did I ever think drinking was a good idea?

I was finding fun in things I’d previously written off as boring and I was just simply enjoying being alive. Also, the physical cravings had begun to drop off massively.

In week 1 I HAD to eat sweets every night to keep me from thinking about the booze but in the second week I’d almost completely forgotten about my cravings.

I now realise that this week was probably the ‘Pink Cloud’ which was something I had read about but hadn’t really thought would happen. It felt amazing but, it didn’t last...

Week 3

This one was a toughie, a real honest to god toughie. I allowed myself to completely forget about my alcohol problem and my achievements and began to wallow in anxiety.

The first day that my partner went back to work I struggled with intrusive thoughts and all of a sudden my mind was working against me.

“See you’re still anxious John, it had nothing to do with the alcohol, you’re just broken”

And so it got worse, my mental health didn’t hit rock bottom but it got pretty damn close. Fortunately it was so bad that rationally I knew drinking would only make it worse.

So I stayed off the booze but I completely caved to my anxious thoughts and feelings. I got carried away with myself, I allowed myself to think that I was going crazy, losing the plot or a nutter.

Without booze to take away the anxiety and give me a perspective I went tumbling down a dark ravine of negative thinking patterns.

Week 4

Finally I got some perspective, I realised that I was paying way too much attention to my anxious thoughts and also expecting far too much from sobriety.

Subconsciously I had allowed myself to think that going sober would completely eliminate all of my problems and make me feel better straight away.

I still suffered a bit with the anxious thoughts and even with some real bad physical symptoms of anxiety but I struggled on by anyway.

Now I’m beginning to see a way out of that and reaffirm my own belief that sobriety is a journey and one that I should be proud of.

I’m meditating, I’m talking, I’m exercising and I’m trying to accept that I’m not always going to feel great and that I don’t need a silver bullet to save me when I’m feeling down.

Anyway, here are a few of the things I’ve noticed in this past month:

1. Alcohol lies, and you’re not going to be able to see through all of these lies after just one month of sobriety.

2. Weight loss. I haven’t necessarily lost weight as I think alcohol was keeping me quite slim, but I have noticed a big difference in body shape. My gut has almost totally disappeared, I can see the results of working my chest at the gym and the puffiness from my face has gone.

3. Skin clarity. I used to just think that I was a spotty guy who would forever be plagued by these facial blotches, well that’s not the case. After a month my skin is tighter and clearer than it has been in my adult life.

4. Emotional intensity. I’m experiencing positive emotions way more than I have in years and finding love, excitement and happiness in way more than I used to.

Conversely this means I’m also experiencing negative emotions more intensely, but, what is life without a full range of emotions?

5. Thinking patterns. Drinking gave me an almost nihilistic approach to life, which was good when I was anxiously worrying about tiny little things but not so good the rest of the time.

I still find myself thinking the worst or judging people and myself too harshly, but I’m starting to notice that now rather than just having it as a pre programmed thinking pattern.

6. Triggers. I’ve been to a friends house for a few drinks and had non alcoholic beer, I’ve been for a couple of meals and drank coke and honestly, it’s been easy.

The triggers for me though have been small things that I didn’t expect to be triggered by. One was listening to my favourite podcast and hearing John Robins talk in fine detail about his favourite ciders and beers.

Listening didn’t make me want to instantly pick up a beer but it did make me crave the idea of being ‘cool enough’ to enjoy alcohol responsibly.

7. Congratulate yourself. Somewhere along the line I completely forgot of myself as a problem drinker and mentally ignored my achievements so far.

The first week it was easy to see how much I was improving with time off the booze, but after that it became more difficult.

I was too hard on myself, I forgot just how hard it is to break a lifetime habit and I began to think of addiction as something I had conquered.

Don’t do that to yourself. Wake up every day and congratulate yourself for not drinking the previous day. Recognise every day as one closer to recovery and better mental well-being.

How long will I remain sober?

I have no end goal of how long I want to remain off the booze for. That’s not because I’m looking forward to drinking again, rather it’s because I don’t want to over-face myself.

I am not drinking today, I am not drinking tomorrow and I am not drinking for the foreseeable future. I’m happy to check my app every day and see my counter go up and up and I’m proud when I tell my girlfriend that I’ve achieved another milestone.

I don’t want to look too far ahead because I don’t want to make this journey any harder than it has to be. Realistically I don’t think I’ll ever drink again, but regardless of that it’s still one day at a time and even one hour at a time if needs be.

&#x200B;

Always hated the smell or even idea of coffee till I tried it one day while on the phone with my sister. The conversation felt different, almost as if I had a surge of euphoria, like I had a shot of whiskey. Maybe booze effected me differently, but I would get an uplifting, energy boost when I would take a sip. I have since averaged 2 to 3 Venti iced coffees a day..can be more or less. I know it's my addictive behavior, and is a result of something deeper...but I'm really starting to beat myself up about it. It totally screws up my sleep schedule because I sometimes have my last sip around 8pm. I know I'm learning a little late, but I'm also a night owl.

I know I should pull back on my intake and stop earlier in the day, but it's really bothering me. I have accomplished so much quitting on my own, but am afraid I've found a new drug per say.

EDIT: might be worth noting that that first try at coffee was a cold brew stumptown can, which is apparently really strong..",12

Like yesterday for example. I knew it was a Friday and that's a trigger for me.

I knew in the morning but started my routine of trying to talk myself out of it.

Cravings got more intense later on in the afternoon and they just became unbearable.

When the cravings are really bad my heart races, horrible anxiety, I can be nausea, I got a headache. Its awful.

There's only so much of that I can take. 

Anyone else know how to beat an intense craving?",5
2020-09-26 05:51:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/j03cq5/sober_at_a_birthday_party/,Sober at a birthday party,"I used to drink A LOT when attending to parties. Most of the time it ended with me drinking so much that I'm sleeping (or in coma) at max three hours in. Of course feeling like shit the next day bc of the alcohol and feeling like shit for maybe months for the embarassing shit I did. I really struggle to open up and often I feel very uneasy talking to strangers. I think thats part of the reason this happend almost everytime. I always thought that I have to get (very) drunk to enjoy events with (many) strangers involved. 

Yesterday I was at a party of a friend of mine. There were some of my friends and some people I've seen occasionally or for the first time. 

Even though I'm a social mess and always thought I need to have alcohol at these type of events, I really connected with some people I've barely spoken to before or havent met until then. It came up that we share some interests and the conversations just kept going and going. One of them even said what a cool guy I was. For me who is very insecure with his social skills, this was so nice to hear!! And because I had no alcohol, these conversations and connections are so much more valueable!!

In general everyone who heard that I stopped drinking almost 7 months ago was very impressed or said how respectable that is. There was this girl which said she tried it too, but gave up shortly after. A friend of mine told me what a huge step forward that is for me, but that he (now) cant get to this point. 

To sum it up, even though I'm a social mess, I went sober to a party, had good conversations with strangers + friends and got many compliments for my abstinence, which really boosted my confidence.",25

I recently went to rehab for two weeks and when I got out was so happy, calm and optimistic.  I have a great support system (besides my mother, who says she’s supportive but goes out of her way to berate me and call me names), and I’m in therapy twice a week.  
My problem is that two weeks ago I was redecorating/ cleaning and once I was done felt so happy and excited that I figured I could go have some wine since no one would know and I was just going to sleep soon anyways.  
I felt guilty the entire time I was in line buying the wine but just kept telling myself it was ok and it would just be one time. 
It wasn’t just one time.  It happened almost every other night and I still hid it.  I finally got caught by my mom and I felt so ashamed and promised I would stop.  That lasted three days.  A friend from rehab called me up and we met and since she had already been drinking I just thought “screw it.  If she can so can I”. 
My therapist wants me to go back to rehab.  I have a lot of responsibilities at home so I don’t think I can. I have a sponsor who I have called when I feel like drinking and she has helped me. But the next day I end up drinking anyways and it’s a lot more than I used to drink.

2020-09-26 03:08:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/j01fyt/another_demon_of_recovery_fits_of_shame/,Another Demon of Recovery: Fits of Shame,"I’m in recovery from three different substances. If I’m honest with myself, the first signs I would eventually have problems with alcohol started as early as eighteen, though the “problem drinking” didn’t really start until I was about twenty-three, and ramped up hard from twenty-four through twenty-eight (with fits of relapse for the four years thereafter). My problems with Vyvanse only lasted from last September through this May. The final Vyvanse binge that threw me into the emergency room coincided with heavy marijuana use, though I never really had a “marijuana phase.”

The real point is that I’ve had a bad relationship with substances for over a decade now (I’m thirty-two), and I’m realizing that it was right around the time I started developing those problems that my life started going to shit, at first slowly, and then faster and faster. I can’t tell you the number of people I’ve alienated over the past decade. At every turn I told myself that it was them, that somehow, through some insane statistical anomaly, I simply got wronged, betrayed, or abandoned by person after person, and that I was more or less always in the right.

One of the ugliest psychological aspects of recovery, I’m learning, is having to entertain seriously the idea that if there was an exodus of important people from my life, and if I’ve had such a hard time making deep connections in the past years, the problem has probably been me.

One difficulty is that I can never determine in what proportion the things I’ve done in the past decade were a result of the substance abuse and in what proportion they were just representations of what an ugly person I can be. And really: very few of us became addicts because we were happy and self-confident and well loved to begin with. What if I’m just kind of an asshole?

Cause and effect gets tricky here. Life gets hard so you abuse substances and then abusing substances makes life harder. You alienate people by doing stupid things when you’re hurt or high and then you do more stupid things because you’re hurt or high because you’ve been alienated.

Honestly, I really do still think there are times I was wronged, seriously wronged in the past decade. I have a lot of pent up anger and indignation that I have no real outlet for. People saw I was hurting and kicked me when I was down—people, no less, who flatter themselves that they’re good and caring and charitable, but who turn tail the second you become a liability.

But even though I’m quite certain I was wronged in some instances, I more or less have to accept that if my substance abuse had even the tiniest part in what happened, then I have to take responsibility. I simply can’t ignore the fact I started getting drastically less popular around the time I started drinking and experimenting with other substances.

The social aspect of recovery is also difficult. Now more than ever I need social support, but a lot of people don’t extend to addicts the charity they might extend to people going through other struggles. Shame really does adhere strongly to addiction, and I’m staggered by how powerful that feeling can be. I can hardly concentrate sometimes I’m so overwhelmed by unwanted memories of things I did and by how I imagine others feel about me. My day is a marathon of imaginary arguments with people I haven’t seen in years.

My current attitude is that my next few years may simply not be that enjoyable and that I should just look forward to having my health back, getting my finances in order, and slowly rebuilding a social life. I regret not having been more forward-looking in high school, for instance. I was an awkward gay kid; if I had just worked hard and told myself that my real life would start when I turned eighteen, then I could have done my undergrad at a university where I fit in better, and people probably would have respected me more for working hard rather than trying desperately to be liked.

Now, I’m telling myself, it’s the same: I’m not going to attract anyone by saying, “Hey, I know I was an asshole for the past decade, but I’m sober now, so please pretend that everything I did was the result of the substances and that I’m actually a new-born angel.” I’m trying to keep faith that if I work hard, stay sober, play the long game, and pull my head out of my ass, the universe might fling some nice things my way.",10

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

**Carry the Fire**

>\--You have to carry the fire.  
\--I don’t know how to.  
\--Yes you do.  
\--Is it real? The fire?  
\--Yes it is.  
\--Where is it? I don’t know where it is.  
\--Yes you do. It’s inside you. It was always there. I can see it.  
>  
>\-Cormac McCarthy, *The Road*

If you have never read *The Road*, it is a harrowing tale of a boy and his father’s journey through a desolate, dystopian world. A world full of cannibal bandits destroying all that is sacred – life and hope and light and goodness.

Carrying the fire means acting as the light when there is darkness surrounding you. The base in us we must not show. We are the hope we want to see. We act for the common good. And we do the right thing. The fire is the symbol of humanity.

It would be easy to say we need this more than ever right now. But the truth is, we should never deviate from doing the right thing. There is never a time it is okay to do the opposite. There should never be a time where we need it more than ever. We should just be willing to show up and make the right decision.

As long as humanity exists, it is our duty to carry the fire. We can and should always pass on this gift of goodness to those around us.

In *Meditations,* the first note that Marcus Aurelius wrote to himself is something we should live by:

>“When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can’t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own – not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are obstructions.”

We are born with an innocent goodness. We understand innately right versus wrong because we feel it inside of us. We must protect this in ourselves and in our family. Because the more wrong we do, the more the fire fades from our being. We must act as an example to those around us, and especially to those of whom the fire has faded. We must not lose faith in humanity. As long as a fire burns, there is hope.

Think about how true this is with alcohol. The misdeeds that happened as a result of being drunk. This isn’t an accident. Good and bad snowball in their respective directions. And there are so many ways to do the wrong thing. That’s why the right thing, or the good that you do, is called walking the straight and narrow path. And it’s also why it’s so important to be a living example of what it’s like to live with sobriety. We aren’t dead because we are sober. In fact we are more alive than ever, and we should be willing to show others this light.

As Marcus Aurelius also wrote, “Just that you do the right thing. The rest doesn’t matter. Cold or warm. Tired or well-rested. Despised or honored.”

When making decisions today, think about what is right. Think about how you can show courage. How you can live moderately. How you can be the hope for someone in need. Think about how you can be the person you know you can and should be. It is not just our duty. We all need to live it together.

Thank you all for letting me share some of my thoughts with you this week and for sharing your stories and your thoughts with me. I really enjoyed reading everyone’s responses. This was an even more rewarding experience the second time around. Hope everyone enjoys their weekend.

Not drinking with you today in San Antonio.

There are countless posts about how great people feel after being sober for x days. I can’t be the only one who doesn’t feel especially great, and so this post is for others who may also be living my reality. 

Yes, real sleep is amazing. However, I now have a hell of a hard time waking up in the morning. Go to bed earlier, you say? I’m getting 10 hours of sleep, already. Maybe my body is still physically recovering; time will tell. 

While drinking I managed to stay fit and conscientiously lifted weights 4x a week. I slept like crap, so getting up early to go to the gym wasn’t too difficult. Granted, I was hung over and felt like shit, but I powered through. Now I wake up 30 minutes before my first meeting (I work from home due to covid), and haven’t managed more than one gym session a week since I climbed on the wagon. I’ve lost muscle mass, but not weight. (Comfort food to reward myself for not drinking.)

I’m irritated easily, and unmotivated to do beyond the bare minimum. 

Make no mistake - I have no regrets. Not drinking is better than drinking. I know all of these symptoms will pass. Maybe they’re down to that PAWS thing you guys keep talking about. If so, that’s fine. I have nothing but time.

Anyway, if you’re newly sober and thinking “WTF?”while reading all the “I feel AMAZING!!” posts, you’re not alone.

I got my ass up and to the gym this morning before work. I felt good about that all day. I plan to do it again, tomorrow.

This is really the first hard day I’ve had but that little fucker demon is still there.  He always will be.  The whole 40 minutes I was out walking he was fucking with my head trying to convince me that one couldn’t hurt.  I cheated on MY diet change and had McDonald’s for dinner which was against doctors orders and my wife said “you’re allowed one cheat day as long as you don’t eat like that all the time” so I think that triggered that little fucker to creep up in my head.  

I’m just posting here to help keep myself accountable and reading all the other posts keep me motivated.  If I have a drink I could die and I don’t want to die.  Plain and simple.  I appreciate this community more and more every day.

Maybe because it felt too serious and not applicable to me. I always wanted to be one of those normal people and moderate. Even when I accepted I couldn't moderate, and quit, I still didn't use that term. Choosing to be sober felt like such an extreme decision sometimes. 

Well, last night I drank 6 beers and a bottle of wine. Hungover and puked this morning. That is alcoholic behavior. THAT is extreme. 

I am an alcoholic and it is so liberating to admit that. I'm back on day 1 and I'm going to approach things differently this time. I'm going to treat this with the response it deserves, that of an addict who is in recovery. 

I will go to an in-person group of some kind (never done that before). I will start posting on here instead of just reading. And I'll go see a counsellor (got some other issues to deal with too).

Alcoholics shouldn't drink. I am an alcoholic and I will not drink!

Then my husband got angry with me and said this is all a choice and doesn’t understand why I’m still so obsessed with alcohol.

She is 10 weeks pregnant so the morning sickness is on full effect.  Because of the throwing up and her low blood pressure, I have been driving her to work everyday and picking her up for about two weeks and will be doing this until her morning sickness is done,  all this while having to work a full time job myself and adjust my work schedule to accommodate this.  On top of this, we also have a 17 month old that I have done most of the work at home for since she got pregnant.  Don’t get me wrong, I love playing with him and going for walks with him, but it is just tiring when you don’t get any breaks.  On top of that, we are also trying diligently to get him to sleep in his own bed.  Since she’s pregnant, I’ve pretty much spent half my night laying on the floor or comforting him for about two weeks.  Long story short, I’m just fucking tired.  Obviously, she is bringing new life into this world and pregnancy is very difficult, so I never complained about this, but I’m still just tired.

So to the argument today.  My wife has the day off and I got done working at about 3.  My son didn’t have to be picked up from daycare until 5 30, so I figured I would just take a bath, read a book and relax for a while.  The argument started when my wife couldn’t find triscuits I got from the store last week.  She asked me where they were and I told her.  She still couldn’t find them.  So, annoyed that she’s interrupting my only free time not spent at AA in the last two weeks, I tell her if I get out and find them I’m throwing them away.  She responds “you probably just forgot to get them like you forget everything else.”  So I immediately get out, find the triscuits, show my wife then and throw them away.  Petty, yes.  Immature, yes.  But then my wife said “you need to go to an aa meeting.”  Idk, that really just pissed me off and hurt.  Felt like she was using my AA against me.  Just cause I go to AA, whenever I’m stressed I need to go to a meeting?  

Whatever, I left, I ended up going to a meeting and then reading a book at the park cause idk what else I would do.  In the past, I would have just sat on the barstool for 3 hours.  Anyways, end of rant.  Both of us are being immature and not apologizing first.  I’m still pretty pissed.  Whatever, I’m not gonna let it ruin my sobriety.  IWNDWYT",2

And then there goes my Sunday. I’ll be hungover, the hangxiety will kick in, regret, nausea, dehydration. I’ll be mad at myself for smoking/buying cigarettes. The list goes on. Sounds so fun, right? But it’s still not a guarantee that I’ll make the right choice. Crazy.

Because of the pandemic no one in my training has gone out until last night when they got a chance.

As it's one of the only places we can socialize and the outing was only a couple of hours the rest of the class came to the classroom afterwards and were generally noisy and rambunctious. I don't have a problem with this, I usually wear my headphones and that's exactly what I did. 
My problem however is just feeling the childish notion of being left out of some fun and blowing off steam because of my addiction. I'm glad I didn't go because it's very likely I would have drank, but has anyone else felt like this? I know my choice to not drink is going to lead to many more nights like this and feeling generally crappy and feeling sorry for myself. 
I'm hoping it will be better once I get home where I have a wonderful life with my wife and dog, who are both just the best support system, buy it'd be nice to hear some similar stories and things that have worked for others in the mean time.

I would like share his musings with you and wonder your opinions about it. IWNDWYT
***

Alcoholism does not seem to be a search for pleasure, but a search for an effect which consists mainly in an extraordinary hardening of the present. One lives in two times, in two moments at once, but not at all in the Proustian manner. The other moment may refer to projects as much as to memories of sober life; it nevertheless exists in an entirely different and profoundly modified way, held fast inside the hardened present which surrounds it like a tender pimple surrounded by indurate flesh. In this soft center of the other moment, the alcoholic may identify himself with the objects of his love, or the objects of his “horror and compassion,” whereas the lived and willed hardness of the present moment permits him to hold reality at a distance. The alcoholic does not like this rigidity which overtakes him any less than the softness that it surrounds and conceals. One of the moments is inside the other, and the present is hardened and tetanized, to this extent, only in order to invest this soft point which is ready to burst. The two simultaneous moments are strangely organized: the alcoholic does not live at all in the imperfect or the future; the alcoholic has only a past perfect – albeit a very special one. In drunkenness, the alcoholic puts together an imaginary past, as if the softness of the past participle came to be combined with the hardness of the present auxiliary: I have-loved, I have-done, I have-seen. The conjunction of the two moments is expressed here, as much as the manner in which the alcoholic experiences one in the other, as one enjoys a manic omnipotence. Here the past perfect does not at all express a distance or a completion. The present moment belongs to the verb “to have,” whereas all being is “past” in the other simultaneous moment, the moment of participation and of the identification of the participle. But what a strange, almost unbearable tension there is here…this embrace, this manner in which the present surrounds, invests, and encloses the other moment.

The present has become a circle of crystal or of granite, formed about a soft core, a core of lava, of liquid or viscous glass. This tension, however, is unraveled for the sake of something else. For it behooves the past perfect to become an “I have-drunk.” The present moment is no longer that of the alcoholic effect, but that of the effect of the effect. The other moment now indifferently embraces the near past – the moment when I was drinking – the system of imaginary identifications concealed by this near past, and the real element of the more or less distanced sober past. In this way, the induration of the present has changed its meaning entirely. In its hardness, the present has lost its hold and faded. It no longer encloses anything; it rather distances every aspect of the other moment. We could say that the near past, as well as the past of identifications which is constituted in it, and finally the sober past which supplied the material, have all fled with outstretched wings.

We could say that all these are equally far off, maintained at a distance in the generalized expansion of this faded present, and in the new rigidity of this new present in an expanding desert. The past perfect of the first effect is replaced by the lone “I have-drunk” of the second, wherein the present auxiliary expresses only the infinite distance of every participle and every participation. The hardening of the present (I have) is now related to an effect of the flight of the past (drunk). Everything culminates in a “has been.” This effect of the flight of the past, this loss of the object in every sense and direction, constitutes the depressive aspect of alcoholism.

Hi everyone! 

I have been getting compliments from my friends that they notice I look so much healthier and glowy than before. 

I used to binge drink every weekend. Get off work at 3pm and hit happy hour until I blacked out & caused more mayhem. Every weekend i would wake up sooo hung over and wanting to be dead. I hated myself but hated myself even more when sober. 

My journey really starting in Jan 2019 when I woke after drinking all night up in a strange bed with someone I DID NOT want to have sex with (but I guess I did). I was supposed to work in the morning but instead was still drunk/hung over from the night before that I didnt show up & I was rightfully fired. 

Even tho i have had worse nights than this one, for some reason I really felt a call to change. I couldn't do it anymore. I felt so ashamed and I felt I had two choices: change or continue drinking & live a life of misery. 

I didnt become completely sober until Nov 17 2019 after another bad night of blacking out, taking my clothes off in front of people, and threatening suicide. 

This sub reddit has saved my life a few times and im so glad it exists. Thank you everyone!!! 

Every day I am so glad to be sober. My only regret is not stopping earlier. I wake up with a fresh mind and a sense of calm & peace. I used to have acne, bad rosacea, and puffy cheeks. My skin looks a thousand times better without the hangover/alcohol seeping out of my skin. 

My before picture is the morning of that day. I was hung over,  my heart was hurting from relationship drama, and I just felt so dead inside. I can tell im forcing myself to smile. 

The second picture is from this summer, my smile feels genuine. I look happy because I am happy! 

With being sober, I was able to apply & attend grad school, won a scholarship, built better relationships and showed up for people with greater capacity, & i have started a happy family with my partner & kittens. 

I love sober life!!!",538

Fits my cycle of behavior: I relapse, say never again, and then relapse again.  I don't think I have been free of this poison for more than 3-4 days in the past couple of months. On the other hand, now I know what thought and lifestyle patterns not to fall into which lead me there. 

I have never shared my alcohol issue with anyone else. Part of it also stems from much larger issues: I get addicted to anything quite easily. I have been working on that and have got it under control, but this is definitely the biggest one. 

Alcohol sky rockets my self-esteem for a couple of hours, then dumps it in the gutters for days. It's like there are two versions of me: the addict who makes the mess and the real me who has to clean it up. It is like some evil clone version of me who shows up every couple of days to fuck my life up. I'm so tired of that person. The most toxic relationship in my life right now is with a part of me. 

I have never confessed like this in life, but this is feels strangely freeing. 

Will be posting in the daily check-in threads everyday, which feels like a nice way to be accountable.

I was alone for the first time since March and very much alone for the first time since I stopped drinking entirely on July 4th.  

To be back at my house was so overwhelming I couldn't really process it.  The essentially abandoned house all dusty, so many memories.   And of course going back to the old stores, seeing the leftover bottles around the house, etc.  But I persevered and did NOT give in and happy to say I'm back ""home""(?) with my folks and 83 days AF and counting!  I will admit I did have some weed to take the edge off, but holy shit I needed it.  I've never had a substance issue with pot, just smoked it in college and the occasional bit now and then.   

It's nice having more of my stuff back, my room actually kinda feels like ""mine"" now with my silly nick-nacks and shit.  Still no real contact with my husband, but one thing at a time.  This was a big step forward and will hopefully open more doors to communication.",10

Just got home from a mini vacation and really did not care that I didn’t drink... I focused on the vacation itself. The free time. The time with my fiancé. The relaxing. I laid by the pool a lot. I ate dessert. I slept. I read. I woke up early every day and worked out, walked to Starbucks for my coffee. All the things I wouldn’t have done if I were binging nightly and hungover daily! 

Tonight is family birthday dinner... tomorrow is friends. All the people in my circle are on board and know that I am sober and are very supportive! I think this is a huge part to my successes with sobriety. 

I found “alcohol removed wine” at Publix and I plan to have a glass or two this weekend. I’m not planning on incorporating it into my routine, but I’m looking at it as a tool in my sobriety toolbox for when I am in social situations. It has calories though so it won’t be something I buy often; seltzer is calorie free and does the “trick” for me. 

Other than that just wanted to check in and say “hey” to all my sober friends, and people who are just sober curious. 

Life is good, better than ever- it’s not easy all of the time but it’s a hell of a lot easier than being stuck in the alcohol cycle I was in.

A little background: my abusive mom had a massive heart attack in her sleep. My sister tried CPR but she was already gone. I listened to the details while my sister sipped wine and I was fine. It was bringing my mothers clothes to the funeral home that seemed to break me. I thought I should drink wine with my sister so we can talk about.

 I drank one glass and felt flushed - not with boozy euphoria but with shame. 
I'm stronger than that. I didn't need that shit.

The real kicker is the next day I needed a break from my family so I spent the day alone. My father asked where I was and my sister replied I was too hungover to be around people!

They made me feel like I literally could not even attempt to quit on my own, because I also kept seeing  online that each unsuccessful quit attempt makes the next try worse.  Then I started seeing a substance abuse specialist- and it was super confusing that when I was completely honest with the amount I (F26) would drink daily (9-15 standard alcohol servings over the course of  maybe 4-7 hours), he wasn't recommending any prescriptions or a treatment facility. I saw him once last month and will see him again next month, and there's stuff we're working on to help with quitting, but it's taken me a couple weeks since I saw him to commit to quitting without more medical intervention partly because of all the stuff that pops up at the top of Google searches about quitting symptoms and advice.

So much is nonspecific and seems to be aimed at those looking for a reason to quit or something. I click on a site link that has what looks to be helpful page that just lists off all the good stuff that happens when you quit drinking, like frontal lobe function and your liver flushing out all the nasty and whee happy rainbows *SKIN HEALTH* you'll be so much better omg buddy, weightloss?!! UGH. I just want to know if my hands tremoring is a symptom of quitting, or the same side effect I've experienced intermittently for years from one of my prescriptionmeds. I want to know how for how long I can expect to suffer this type of headache. Yeah, I already KNOW that alcohol dependency can lead to dehydration and vitamin deficiency; that's old news. I want to know if the QUITTING causes dietary issues, and all the other things I dont know about and wouldn't even think to suspect.

Sorry, I'm definitely suffering from irritability in this stage of my quitting journey, and trying to search for specific information still leads me to the same mostly unhelpful sites that either just talk about DTs and in-patient treatment procedures or tout the improvements and healing your internal organs go through over months. Sure, I'm glad to know I didn't necessarily permanently destroy parts of my brain, but the symptoms list they give is identical to like 80% of the ""side effects may include"" sections on medication ads and sites like those left me more scared of quitting alcohol then to continue drinking at the level I had been.

Meanwhile this subreddit sees me having a semi-private place to vent and read about other people's experiences and side effects, along with a new evening walking routine to replace the time I spent drinking, and lots of chewing gum, water and hot tea to take care of that oral fixation.

I used to think that my apathy towards everything was cool/interesting, but it isn't. We don't care because we put alcohol first, and everything else is just secondary. Selfishly clinging to catching our next buzz, or doing our best to survive a bad hangover.

I think one of the biggest ""pink cloud"" killers is when the shit we've been ignoring comes back to be dealt with. The reason why we act awful during our blackouts, is that there's no one at the wheel to avoid our problems, they just start pouring out all at once, when our brain is no longer watching. 

I actually cannot believe how boring I've become, losing little parts of myself that made me who I am, and just choosing booze. On day 4/5 now, and I'm catching glimpses of my personality coming back. Gonna have a hard road ahead, but I can't also believe that I'm coming back! 

As much as it sucks being a bar manager and sober, I'm so much better at DEALING with my job, and not just skirting by. Being afraid that I was going to be fired any day, just because of booze anxiety. 

The two quotes for all of you, that are really helping me frame my problem:

""Sobriety doesn't fix your problems, but it makes all of your problems fixable""

And

""You never hear successful sober people say: 'man I really wish I kept drinking'""

I will not drink with y'all tonight.",13

This is the closest I've come to a relapse since I've started my sobriety journey 11 months ago. Got into a very heated back and forth argument with my girlfriend of 7 years. We never argue but today was different. We were arguing over dumb stuff. And she kept saying the phrases ""It's no big deal"" and ""No worries"" but would surround these words with such an angry attitude and an angry tone of voice. We were sending voice messages back and forth on the Facebook messenger app. I just feel like she's nasty to me sometimes and a lot nicer to other people and our own kids. But when dealing with me it's an automatic mean tone sometimes. Anywho that's my close to relapse story. I'm just stressed and pissed off. I hope you all are having a better weekend than I am currently having. Who's ready to commit to a weekend of sobriety with your guy Mick? Will you choose not to booze with me?

A month ago, I was sitting in the ICU because my depression had hit an all time low and alcohol the night before had given me the ""extra boost of confidence"" to try and say goodbye to this world. If someone had told me a month ago how much better I'd be in just a month from that day, I wouldn't have believed them.

In March this year, after a really bad bender, I decided to go sober. I did it with a combo of sheer willpower and guilt. This recipe works for a time, but it’s not foolproof, and just over a month ago I brought wine back into my life with gusto (covered with the veneer of self-control).

My rationale was this: I’m not a “real” alcoholic (that’s my husband, he’s the one with the real problem). I can stop drinking any time I want to. Hell, I stopped for 6 months just this year?! Wow. I’ve got this all under control. I can have a glass of wine. 

That glass of wine became an obsession: when was it too early to pour it? Should I leave a mouthful in the bottom to prove to my husband that I’ve got it completely under control? Could I have 2 glasses then just not have any tomorrow? You get the picture. 

This slight cracking open of the door led to me fully blowing that door completely off its hinges a little over a week ago in a huge bender that started with: Yup, a simple glass of wine.

Here’s what I’ve learned in a nutshell:

1. There’s more to properly recovering than just not drinking. 

2. AA is a helpful programme and has helped me to get real and stop kidding myself. 

3. Six months of white-knuckling sobriety is bloody hard work if all I’m doing is fearfully waiting for the next relapse or bender than sneaks in.

4. This disease is tricky... and it tricked me into believing that I was fine and didn’t have a problem. It was lying to me, and I was lying to myself. In 12 step programmes they say that alcohol is cunning, baffling and powerful. 

5. Recovery means filling that hole in my soul with something more meaningful.

Anyway, if you’re struggling with the fact that you just can’t seem to stop, don’t be afraid to read a bit more about 12 step recovery programmes. I was doing myself a huge disservice with my incorrect perception that programmes like that are just full of wrong’ns.

I’m a white middle class mum of 2, and I thought I didn’t fit the profile for recovery programmes. Newsflash: I do fit the profile because I’m a alcoholic!

2 weeks ago I hit rock bottom.  Wont go into the details but had a major wake up call....I’m sure we’ve all been there.  I decided I need to take a break, 30 days minimum, to assess my alcoholism.   After 14 days sober, I’ve noticed a few things - some good, some not so good.    

The good:  I’ve had below average cravings for alcohol.   Not really sure why....maybe my rock bottom moment is still so fresh I don’t miss it yet.  Also, I’ve realized that a 30 day ‘break’ from alcohol needs to expand to total abstinence—it’s clearly a substance I cannot control.   I wasn’t an every day drinker, but the few times a week I would imbibe I could not control when to stop.   Also, the rate at which my alcohol addition grew over the past year is breathtaking—from ‘a little bit of a bad habit’ to ‘wow, I put my life in serious jeopardy, over and over again’ within a year.  

The bad:  I’m feeling really crap.   Anxiety is through the roof; Feelings of guilt are absolutely unending.    The past several days, I found myself recalling past instances of drinking—what was said/done, etc....what I can and cannot remember.  Looking back through old incoherently drunk texts to family and friends.....Just a truly horrible wave of guilt that started a few days ago and is just horribly intense today.  I can’t imagine it getting any worse, and hope it doesn’t.   I have an immense feeling of needing desperately to escape these feelings.   

I’ve been musing this evening if it’s some deep rooted mental pains or other feelings that I’ve not allowed myself to process because I’d just drink the emotions away in the past?  

Does anyone have any advice on how to subdue these awful feelings?  No matter what I’ve done the past few days—work, working out, reading, watching tv, listening to music, etc.—has helped in the least bit to ease the intense guilt I’ve been feeling as I continue to recall the past and my mistakes.    

A few examples:  I receive a text, and the prior text is incoherent babble.  I feel ashamed.  I then scroll up to read dozens more.  I feel mortified.  Put the phone down, and listen to some music while I work.  I then hear a lyric that makes me remember another prior drunk activity, and I feel horrible.  Rinse, lather, repeat all day long.

I used to go to go to work every weekday, but suddenly I was home all day every day because of covid. I stayed in bed for a week and lived off tequila and gatorade. Then I had to start functioning again. So I slowly introduced food even though my appetite has been GONE since April (never was an issue before). I've been drinking morning until night since then. Never drunk, just enough to always have some in my system. Enough to forget what happened. At some point I started waking up around 3 am with the shakes. 

I quit 30 hours ago. I felt like my body was just starting to fail. I feel terrible. I had bad night sweats last night and was in this weird half asleep/half awake state and going from hot to cold.

My whole body feels achy.

I am in therapy and will not see a doctor until I have some more time under my belt.

""Not on a Thursday?"" he looks at me with puppy eyes and seems disappointed, but I know it's because he's judging himself. ""I am just starting to feel so good now, my running feels better, I sleep great..."" I say, he knows very well that I want a forever quit, and how difficult I find it. I also don't want him to feel like I am judging him or want him to not drink because of me. He quickly contains himself, turns back to the bottle that's just been brought and says ""Great! More for me"". 

Husband has got used to me not drinking on weekdays now, as I've cut back in the last month. Not an attempt to moderate- I've proven to myself more than enough times that I am incapable of that. I wanted to give myself the best shot, by not trying to be early in sobriety on certain events in the last month. This was going to be my week. Anyway.

He's drunk a bottle of wine (minimum), with few exceptions, every single night for the 11 years I've known him. It's not like me having half of it would have changed anything, we would have just, as always, gotten another bottle. 

The evening turns sour in seconds and we end up arguing because I got back to talking about running and how I feel like I am improving. I guess he felt like it just underscored the fact that I was sober and him drinking. I know he's supportive of me, but I also know that he has a very difficult time with it because of himself.

He's a very vulnerable person who never feels good enough and has a tendency to feel inferior whenever I achieve or succeed at something. It's gotten so much worse over the years and I feel like his drinking is a major player in it. 

He has tried to quit before, actually gone months sober once, but that was long before I was ready unfortunately, so we never tried together. He won't admit to having a real problem, but he does admit ""It's really hard without a drink"" when he's tried to take a day off recently.

Throughout the evening as we got through several courses, he finished off his bottle, all the while arguing, I just kept playing the tape forward, as I've learned here in the last few days. It worked surprisingly well! Such a simple trick. I knew that if I'd given in at any point, I may have saved us from the arguing, but I would have come home and kept drinking into the night. Tomorrow I would wake up late and regret it on my planned long run, which, I would have not enjoyed feeling hungover. Not to mention the shame and anxiety.

On the way home I got myself an ice cream.

Going into this quit, I've told myself if nothing else can motivate me, at least it's for my marriage or myself this time. Our marriage has been suffering for a couple of years, and I know our drinking has had a lot to do with it, since it just brings out the worst in both of us.  I feel like we've been getting somewhere in working on it this year, and I don't think that tonight was too big of a deal, while obviously very hurtful still. But this quit is for me to do my part in healing, and if we can't heal together then I need to heal for myself so I can reconsider if I want to stay. 

Proud to say, day 4, head just hit the pillow and I am sober. Come at me, weekend!

TLDR: Stayed sober through a stupid fight with my husband, fuelled by my decision to stay sober while he drank his wine, and his judgment of himself. Had ice cream. Going to bed early so I can enjoy my morning run tomorrow!",55

I was pretty upset as I was: in pain, feeling like I maimed myself because of my own stupidity and mad, because at 2 years+ sober I thought I was done harming myself.  On the way home from the ER my  husband expressed worry because it was the most upset I'd been in sobriety, and there have been some challenges!

I was honestly surprised. Drinking had really not even almost crossed my mind. I was supposed to chair an AA meeting that night and I thought to get it covered, but drinking? No.  In my  years drinking and year+ trying to get sober I'd significantly injured myself and been hospitalized multiple times. I was finally done drinking when I realized that I was going to die young and soon. Not 'oh it'll take years off my life I'll regret at 75', but I'm going to accidently kill myself at 34, next week.  And I know if I drink again today I will VERY quickly be right there again.

I am thoroughly convinced that I am an alcoholic and to drink is to die.  My odds are worse than Russian Roulette, because if I pull the trigger once I'll just keep going until the bullet gets to me, without a doubt. So I'm sad that my hand hurts, but I'm not going to kill myself over it, I'm not that insane today.  Instead I'm going to keep reaching out, I'm going to cope/heal and I'll live another day to do something stupid, sober.",6

2020-09-24 13:35:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/iz1rud/one_week_sober/,One week sober!,"Hi all. As of today, I’ve been sober for a week, the longest I’ve gone without drinking in over three years. I’m 24, and I’ve had a serious problem with drinking since I was 17. For years, expressing the extent to which alcohol had taken over to other people was minimized because I was still young; well-intentioned friends and other adults would assure me everyone drank to excess in university, and that how I was living was normal.

Nothing about what I was doing was normal. I would drink a magnum of wine a night (usually alone in my room), have devastating hangovers that would send me spiralling into panic attacks the next day; I always had a half a dozen beers before appointments and classes and social functions under the logic that it would take the edge off and I wouldn’t be consumed by anxiety that had controlled me for so long. Most of the time I just drank because I was in so much pain from surviving a childhood with a violent alcoholic mother, but I could never be in denial about the fact that I was simply repeating her mistakes in efforts to further myself from here. I knew I was an alcoholic, but I thought I would have to hit some kind of drastic rock bottom to get better, and even when things were extremely bad, I didn’t get the wake up call I expected. I would take inventory of my life: well, I was fucked up, but I was still enrolled in university, and I had great friends who put up with me being cruel at times and chaotic always. I never woke up in my own puke or drove drunk (but put myself in a hell of a lot of danger regardless), and plus, I didn’t have a long-term partner or kids to get sober for like my mom did. This was all bullshit. I was fucking miserable. But I kept drinking. 

I spent a lot of time in the emergency room in my early 20s, mainly for cutting episodes that I would commit while nearly blackout that always required over 50 stitches at a time. I’ll forever be covered in scars I don’t know how I got. Last year, I finished school and moved cities. Within two weeks, I tried to kill myself because my addiction had gotten so bad. I was in a coma the day of my college graduation, and terrified my friends and family. But it still didn’t seem like the kind of wake up call I needed. 

I didn’t want to go to AA because I felt insecure about being so young. My shrink told me time and time again that all my depression and anxiety was fuelled by my drinking problem and I would need to stop if I wanted to see my mental health improve in any significant way. My friends and family echoed similar sentiments but I could tell they were tired of having the same conversation with me where I wanted to get sober (or at least “cut back on my drinking” lol) and they didn’t know what they could do to help. 

After all that, I went on a bender during lockdown, and spent the last six months mostly drunk. But I’m so tired of living this way. I know there isn’t going to be a remarkable moment of clarity that makes trying to get sober easier. It’s a million and one things that have all added up to knowing I can never drink, and I don’t want this to be my life. It has created so many problems I never needed to have, and I have had so much pain from trying to drown out my shame. 

Finding this subreddit has helped me in the past week to remember that sobriety is freedom, and it isn’t impossible. I now have a wonderful partner who has been a major motivator in getting sober, but I’m not doing it for her. I’m doing it for me, finally, and I know it’s the greatest gift I could give to myself.

I used to be a couple drinks a night guy, and it slowly creeped into an all day, everyday type of thing. I’ve been trying to quit for the last month or so by tapering off. I’ll have a week or so where I can wait to drink until night and I’m proud of that because it’s definitely improvement, but then I’ll hit stretches where I start drinking every morning, and we all know that that first drink is all it takes to lose control.

Even when I can control my urges until nighttime, I end up drinking almost an entire fifth in a night.

I have a fairly significant nicotine addiction and also smoke weed, so I think it got out of hand because it helped me manage chest pain from smoking. 

My real reason for posting is, when I look for tips online to help quit it’s usually stuff like “practice self-care” or “talk to your doctor”, basically stuff that doesn’t tangibly help me in the slightest.

I’m looking for solid tips and advice from actual alcoholics who will talk to me as a peer, and know what I’m going through.

If you could share any real, applicable tips that I could start practicing immediately, or even share your story and how you overcame it, it would be greatly appreciated. 

I’m not necessarily looking to go completely sober, I just need to gain control over it instead of letting it control me and affect both my college performance and day to day wellbeing. Although I think a stretch of complete sobriety for a month or two would be the best thing for me.",4
2020-09-24 13:16:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/iz1er2/helpful_analogy/,Helpful Analogy,"Hi, sd. I wanted to share the following analogy, as it has been really useful for me to shift my perspective and pull me back from the ledge, so to speak. (I didn't come up with it; I heard it from Holly Whitaker who had heard it from someone else that I'm not certain of.) It goes like this:

Think of this time in your life like an hourglass sort of shape. At the top, where the glass is widest, you've just quit drinking. All the good reasons for sobriety are right there, you remember all of the bad, and you still have the same social circle. Time moves forward, and you slide down the glass. It becomes narrower and narrower: those friends start falling away as you recognize your need for them (and like for them) has faded with sobriety. You don't really know how to have fun anymore. Life seems very very small. Drinking sounds better, since those concrete reasons for not drinking are pretty far behind you, and you don't have much social support, and there's nothing else to do. But what happens next is the hourglass opens up again: you start putting in the work (and it will be *work*) to build a new social circle; you seek out therapy; you form new hobbies, become more healthful in your life as a whole. You learn how to have fun again, without drinking. In the happier, more fulfilled, life-is-big-again state, your reasons for not drinking are crystal clear, to maintain the good rather than avoid the bad. 

Everyone has a different timeline. For me, life has seemed pretty small for the last six months or so. But thinking about things like this really helped calm me when I would spiral into sadness and anxiety about the state of my life. Patience has been a big part of it for me. And putting in the work. But things always always have the potential to be better. I have an hourglass I drew taped on my mirror now.

Sitting at 550 days, feeling good. Started playing on a coed rec soccer team (with social distancing etc. measures in place), and getting out of my house and being social with new people has been really nice.

Like the shame of the bottles on recycling day or waking up every night at 2AM worried and anxious.  There has been a lot that I related to.  I wondered how others have coped emotionally after they have quit but their spouse continues to drink or family members in the household continue to drink.  I'm not a righteous person and don't generally push my views on others.  Don't get me wrong either, I was a drinker for decades and years went by that I wanted to quit and didn't.  Now I have and while I do not have a desire to drink - oddly - I fear it will create a tension with my loved ones.  I guess I'm just interested to hear experiences and thoughts from others.

I appreciate this site, the posters and the positivity of everyone.

The freedom and clarity I have in my life is amazing I really have kept it simple to the point of one day at a time, I never promised my sobriety to anyone and to myself I chose each day not to drink, no grand promise just don't drink today. Now I have read some great books, podcast, movies, and of course here is where it really came together for me. I do every now and them think of a drink, but the longer I get away from that last drunk the easier it is to deny the beast that knocks on my door. 1000 days means I have not had approx. 9000 cocktails that just sounds crazy to me, also I have not spent over $10k on alcohol though I seemed to have spent it somewhere because its not in my bank account. Life without alcohol is so much easier and more simple to manage. I believed for so long what alcohol had to offer, relaxes me , makes me less anxious, makes me more creative, makes me have a better time while doing anything, makes me funny and more appealing to the opposite sex, gives me confidence so I am less insecure, and on and on. But what a lie it is that we all have believed in at some point in our drinking. i am more calm and relaxed then ever, relationships are better, work is better just basic human interactions are better and more fulfilling.

I had been sober; feeling my best, looking right hot. In my dream my hair is long and dark, I'm thin like I was in my twenties and thirties, wearing a tight pair of seven jeans with a crisp white collar shirt. Confident. At the small raised table at which I was sitting, I politely asked the waiter for Pellegrino. But then a minute later a server in a fancy catering uniform unceremoniously set down in front of me a long stemmed expensive shimmering crystal glass of delicate, smooth, velvet red wine. I drank it. Almost immediately thereafter, everyone left and I had no ride home. I wandered lost to the train station. Ensued missing train after train, blindly stumbling around railroad tracks, feelings of despondency... Believing I had wrecked my sober streak and thus wrecked everything.....I woke to day 23.

In other news about a week ago I almost drank red wine, and literally the only reason I did not was because I already had heartburn from something I ate. I was never grateful for heartburn before now.

Thankful for this group because so far it's a lonely journey otherwise.

This really hit home with my history of anxiety and depression.  In an effort to help the thinking problem I started taking antidepressants about 6 years ago.  In my constant battle to rationalize my drinking or find a way to get back in the game.  Note**I’m 477 days sober and still am battling the drunk brain daily.
I remember when I first started taking my meds I felt that the medication made me drink more.  I explained this to my doctor and was brushed off.  Today after reading my daily collection of post on this sub that thought came back and I did some digging online.  I wanted to know if there was a connection between increased impulsivity and taking antidepressants.  I vividly remember my brother getting arrested for theft shortly after he started taking meds could I have experienced the same side affect?  I was already a “problem drinker” but feel there is some correlation between the start of the meds and my spiral downwards.  I don’t want to start drinking again, I’d rather be on the meds and happy then off and be able to control my drinking.   I found this case study, give it a read if you feel obliged.

Here's the deal with me though...I am a business owner, I am trying to get another company off the ground, and there's a lot of stress that comes with it.  I'm also in MENSA (brain has trouble setting down) and have a lot of latent anxiety as a result.

I don't day drink.  I have never been one to crave it when I get up in the morning, and was never a ""hair of the dog"" guy.  

I live alone and when I drink, it is alone.  This is most nights.  I have become somewhat dependent on it to help me sleep.  That's no bueno.

I have quit a few times, most recently when I did the whole30 diet all July.  I went without for a few months in 2015 in solidarity with an employee who had stopped.

I need something effective that will replace booze at night.  I got some cannabis liquid and tried that but WOW...sent my heart and mind racing.  Did the opposite of what so many claim.  

Ideal night would be to have something (mostly) harmless and natural that provides a drowsy ""high"" to ride off to sleep while reading.  I took Ambien once and it worked well but I don't wanna do chemicals if possible.

Fast forward to two days ago and I noticed that my wife had been distant from me for nearly a month and things just seemed off. I approached her about that and to see if we needed to talk and I was blown away at her response. Apparently I said some very nasty and hateful things to her when I was drunk at least 2½ years ago and she has internalized those things and they were now coming to a head and she is not sure if she wants to be with me any longer.wjat a gut and heart punch. I had concentrated so much on my sobriety and not drinking daily and never thought that I also need to work hard on the good positive parts of my life. I just mistakenly thought that the good life that a sober life brings would just organically happen. That's just not true. For the record, she still drinks daily and like to go out with her girlfriend(s) and coworkers for drinks at lunch and is even trying to plan a girls weekend getaway at a condo at  the beach so they can sit in a hot tub and have drinks and look at the ocean and talk. Those words that I said and don't remember because I was drunk a few years ago are still coming back and I am scared for my marriage and have no idea what to think now. If only I had known then when I began sobriety I feel that things could be worked out. The lesson I learned is maybe clear the air with your partner at the time of sobriety and find out if there were things that need to be addressed at that point. Thanks for listening. I just have no friends now because our friends circle all revolved around alcohol and I have driven them away concentrating so much on myself and my sobriety.

I have fortnightly calls with my local alcohol service but it’s just not enough. Has anyone completed any online 30 day programmes that have really helped them? There are tonnes out there so any advice would be massively appreciated as I think this is my next step.

Thank you in advance",8

Some observations:","So I made my first post on day one just giving a backstory of being a hard drinker for a long time, and a problem drinker for only a slightly shorter time. I work in a bar where drinking is encouraged and about 80% of the staff is already at a problematic level. 

Full backstory here: https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/iws7y4/long_time_lurking_and_ignoring_my_problem_looking

Anyways, I timed my day one to be on my first day off, so that I'd be in better standing to handle my first shift back as a sober person. I'm still not sleeping much, and my body just feels wicked off, but the shift went well. I had all my opening work done early, and I got out early for wrapping up fast.

Some observations were watching my owner drink half a fifth of scotch while still ""working"", getting drunk, sloppy, and off putting. Watching pleasant bar patrons turn in to bad/shitty guests as the night goes on and drinks are flowing. Just how miserable of an experience it is to be in a bar in first place. Just the dumb shit that happens because people are drunk.

I went out to dinner the other night with my SO and some friends, I stuck to cola, while they drank some really cool craft cocktails. I had an observation that when I straw tasted their drinks (dip in straw, cover the top, eye dropper into your mouth), that I've lost my palate for good drinks. I'm a bartender that specializes in craft drinks, but at some point in my slamming of cheap whiskey over the years, I can't even appreciate fancy, or balanced drinks. I just want to drink as much and as fast as possible. I've lost the ability to even enjoy what I produce. 

My SO ended up getting way too wasted and crashed on our friends couch (she drinks like once every 3 months, so it's not triggering/a problem for her. She just had too much fun and got carried away.

But, I don't have that ability, I cannot simply have a few awesome cocktails, and truly enjoy the experience. I drink to get wasted, and forget what/who I am.

I know it'll get harder before it gets easier, but hopefully some of you guys get something from the post. I've a long road ahead, but here's to a sober 4 days, bar shift, and here's to many more.

I will not drink with you tonight.",9

The main thing I’ve learned this year is that I already have everything I need inside myself to cope with tough situations, speak my mind, make and sustain connections with others, and just... be happy. 

This year, I’ve survived a tough and messy breakup, a pandemic, TWO cross-country moves, started a new relationship, and am even now facing a potential layoff... and I haven’t actually felt like drinking about any of it. As hard a year as this has been, it’s also felt productive and positive.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

**The E-Word**

>“Being truly human means behaving in a way that is not merely ordinary, but *ordinate*, a word the *Oxford English Dictionary* defines as ‘ordered, regulated; orderly, regular, moderate.’ It means living appropriately, *à propos*, so that one estimates things at their right value and behaves in the way correctly suited to each occasion. This is why, as Montaigne puts it, living appropriately is ‘our great and glorious masterpiece.’”  
>  
>\-Sarah Bakewell

To Tiger Woods, the e-word was the “code word” that should never be used. When Tiger was still young, at eleven, twelve, and thirteen, his dad, Earl Woods, would often cuss him out in the middle of his backswings. Calling him a motherf\*cker, a piece of sh\*t, and racial slurs. This was Earl’s way of taking Tiger to his breaking point. *Enough* was never used by Tiger because to him it was giving up and letting his dad get the better of him.

This would haunt Tiger for years to come because as a professional golfer, dominating the sport and pleasing his dad became gods to him. He would never be able to let up because of the tactics Earl used. He was trained to have zero feelings. So, he played through injuries and broke his body as a result. And as most of you know, he found other ways to cope, which resulted in a lot of pain and public humiliation in his life.

Most people look at Tiger Woods and don’t feel sorry for him because of the amount of success he has had in his life and the feeling that he dug his own grave with his misdeeds. But no matter how successful the man, by our worldly definition, you can’t look at his childhood and think that this didn’t have a profound effect on him.

Enough may have been an expletive to Earl, but it shouldn’t be for us. Enough is anti-ego. Ego takes us beyond what we need. Ego is simply our desire for more. Enough is living the moderate life, which as Montaigne put it, is “our great and glorious masterpiece.”

Kurt Vonnegut wrote a poem for The New Yorker back in 2005, which was a true story. He and Joseph Heller were at a billionaire’s party on Shelter Island and in Vonnegut’s words, this is the conversation that ensued:

>I said, “Joe, how does it make you feel  
>  
>to know that our host only yesterday  
>  
>may have made more money  
>  
>than your novel ‘Catch-22’  
>  
>has earned in its entire history?  
>  
>”And Joe said, “I’ve got something he can never have.  
>  
>”And I said, “What on earth could that be, Joe?”  
>  
>And Joe said, “The knowledge that I’ve got enough.”

There is something so simple and wonderful about this. Knowing that you have all you need and everything else is just icing. So why do we keep pushing ourselves for more? Why do we continue working ourselves to death doing something we dislike in order to have more money or a better house or a newer car than our neighbor?

It’s certainly easy as a problem drinker to relate to this idea of excess and more. It was always one more drink. I can stay out for one more hour. I can go to my friend’s house for one more NFL Sunday instead of staying home with my wife and son.

No matter how much I drank, there was always more.

Yesterday, we talked about The Pyramid of Mastery and the areas of our life that are affected by booze. Our ego gets in the way of all these areas and prevents us from focusing on the right things. Instead of time with family, it’s one more weekend project to hopefully get that 3% raise.

Like a lot of things, it sounds good in our heads, but when you see it on paper, it looks a little silly. Life is about finding that “golden mean” as Aristotle put it. And we can’t find that with alcohol. This is quickly realized with even just a small amount of sobriety.

So, today, I will use a word Tiger couldn’t use. I’ve had enough trying to keep up with everyone else because the world somehow thinks that is what’s best for me. The world has no idea what’s best for any of us. Only we know that. It’s not fun and it adds nothing of meaning or value to my life.

I have water, good food, a nice shelter, and relationships that I want to grow. All of the other stuff is just icing. I still have to pay the bills, but I won’t run myself ragged for just a little more money. I will devote my free time to what is meaningful to me and where I feel I can make a real difference in the lives of others.

That is what enough means to me.

>“What do we want more of in life? That’s the question. It’s not accomplishments. It’s not popularity. It’s moments when we feel like we are enough.”  
>  
>\-Ryan Holiday

Today, think about what *enough* means to you and how your ego has prevented you from finding that place.

Up until this evening I’ve been lucky enough to not have any real cravings at all; just passing thoughts that were easy to swat away. I’ve gone to the liquor store to buy booze for others. I’ve been around drinking multiple times yet none of those times tempted me like tonight did. I was just watching a twitch stream and the streamer had made himself a drink. At first I didn’t know why this triggered me SO much but I think it’s because I associate being on my laptop in the evening with drinking since that’s what I always did. 

Since being alcohol free I’d really cut back on laptop time in favor of other things and I think I need to get back to that. My trigger isn’t the liquor store, the grocery aisles, or being around other drinkers. It’s me being in my element, content on the computer just chilling. The feeling that craving gave me was horrible and I’m going to do my best to avoid it!

At first I wasn’t bad because I still had other friends that weren’t in a frat and we did stuff together. When I was at the house there was always someone drinking but I didn’t always participate.

Then my two non frat friends both broke up with their girlfriends relatively close to each other so all we ended up doing was drinking all the time. Then sophomore year I roomed with a senior and all we did was drink. Junior year I lived with three seniors so that’s all we did. Senior year I was a senior so that’s all we did.

I moved to a town and had no friends so I’d pretty much drink and play video games. I quit that job and became unemployed so I drank and looked for jobs. Got a job in a different city and got fired for attendance issues- from drinking.

Now I’m in a new job in a different city. I again have no friends and I moved just before corona hit and now everything is closed so I don’t even know how to make friends so I drink. It’s starting to become an issue work-wise. So I need to stop for that.

Speckled throughout are girlfriends who I ultimately lost due to my drinking. Apparently I’m fun to drink with until I black out and then become a complete asshole.

I was thinking of some kind of reward system for each day sober. Nothing big. Just some way to treat myself each day and then maybe a monthly larger reward. I hope I make it a year. Has anyone setup their own reward system?

What’s the best way to back myself off. I definitely need to stop during the week so it doesn’t affect my work. I was going to start trying that and just drink on the weekends. My only fear is that I won’t stop into the next week. Didn’t find out until about a year ago that my family is riddled with alcoholics and it embarrasses me when people jokingly call me that because I know they’re right. Is it best to just STOP or slowly cut back?",5

Without alcohol in your life you may be missing that rush. 

The good news is sport is much more funner, healthier and enjoyable than a shitty bottle that damages and dehydrates you. 

Here's a list of sports you could consider picking up:

- Tennis/Squash/Badminton/Table tennis
- Rockclimbing
- Basketball
- Netball
- Surfing/Wake boarding
- Snowboarding/Skiing
- Running/Trail running
- Hiking or trekking
- Football/Soccer/Rugby
- Golf
- Swimming/Water polo
- Bike riding/Trail riding/BMX
- Skydiving
- Martial Art/Boxing/Karate/Taekwondo/Kendo

The list of sports is endless though! Find one you like and get active! 

Now is the time to pick it up, don't be afraid to start a sport whether you are 20 or 90! You will be good at a sport if you practice no matter what age you start.

And then I just wanted a break, so I had ""a day"" where I had a bottle of wine - but responsibly, over a sensible 8 hour period with lots of food and water between and after.  I woke up the next day feeling great, got so much accomplished.  So of course I start thinking well... maybe I can do this once a month and not get into the same habits.  

So back into the committing every day to not drinking (aiming for a month!).. until yesterday..  when my 46 yo husband was diagnosed with Stage 4 Metastatic cancer.  I keep going through cycles of 'they're wrong"" to ""it can be treated"" to acceptance.  I am trying to be a support to him and succeeding (I think) when we have time together.  During the day, though, while he's working ...   I can't focus on anything but that - I find myself just standing in the same spot, not knowing where to focus my energy.  I am lost.  I am devastated.  My soul mate.  The only person I've ever loved in my entire life (including a marriage to another) - I cannot fathom life without him.  He is my better half. 

We often joked that together we make 2/3rds of a real person.  But I can't imagine living life without him.  We thought there'd always be time.  

So... part of this is to say that yes, I've given up for just a bit on the stopping of the drinking - and not to diminish from anyone else's accomplishments.  I am so proud of all of you who are stronger than I am.  But also to say that my heart feels like it's been physically ripped from my body, thrown on the dirty ground and stomped on.  I know it's not good, and it's not healthy and the last thing I want to do is take attention from him and turn it around on me - which is why I'm sort of hiding it.

I don't relate to most of these posts in that I'm almost never drunk, don't drink daily, don't have a family history, drinking hasn't interfered with work or family, and I haven't had anyone concerned about my drinking habits. Except I have a growing concern about myself. Here's a rundown:

* 5pm every day (give or take) especially on stressful days, I look forward to a glass of wine, a beer, vodka tonic, etc. I just want to relax and take the edge off the day. I also want the artificial joy that alcohol can give. (COVID has me lightly depressed)
* When I drink, I almost never have just one glass of anything. But it's also rare that I really overdo it either. Maybe 2-3 times a year when I'm away with some girlfriends I'll drink bad enough for a real hangover.
* The longest I've gone with zero alcohol in the last few years is about 30 days.
* I feel like I'm on auto-pilot sometimes when it comes to alcohol. The default is yes, I'll have a drink when offered.

So...any thoughts? I really hate the thought of a habit controlling me and this is a fairly new thing for me to be dealing with. (I'm a 51F). Thanks for this space.",6

I feel extremely isolated, and unlikeable, and unloveable.  I don't know what else to do but post on this forum.  My family sucks, my dad is dying, I hate my mother (narcissist), I'm estranged from my bro and sis since our parents suck (narc abuse for decades).  I feel like I can't make a connection or trust anyone and often have anxiety that I will live the rest of my life alone, not being able to connect to anyone.

**TOO**

This is a problem that so many people, myself included, feel like we struggle through alone. When you watch a television show, everyone ""just needs a drink to take the edge off"", or when your friends go to a casual gathering ""I brought you the standard gift, a bottle of wine"". Drinking is so *normal* that not drinking can make you feel like a freak. And seeing that one of the most common words we say is **too** shows just how similar our experiences are with other people in this strong, growing, healthy, supportive community. ""I feel this way"" or ""I went through this"" is so commonly met with ""I went through that **too**, and I made it through, and you can **too**."" It shows a sense of community. An arm over the shoulder to support you when you're not strong enough to support yourself.

We're all here for the same reason. You want to lead a better, healthier life. You want to find your new normal. Maybe I can help you get there. But I need your help, **too**",8

Is really a healthy attitude to need to keep up all the support group stuff once you are comfortable in your sobriety?

Then I started by with measured amounts when I’m lonely and bored working from home. As you imagine it grew from there to now I must make the real commitment to stop. I thought alcohol made me more outgoing, talented, friendly, creative, but it is just a crutch. 

I don’t really even drink on the weekends (maybe 1 glass of wine if a friend brings it over, but that is truly it). I really only have these cravings/wants when I’m bored and lonely at work.

Food is usually 100-150% and the best sex is 200%.

2020-09-23 12:49:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/iydw0b/its_time/,It's time,"I've known that I've had a bad drinking problem for a few years now (currently 30 y/o). I am not a daily drinker, but when I do drink, I cannot control how much I drink no matter what I try. My drinking nights usually end at around 4 or 5 am, or when I run out of alcohol, whichever comes first.

Over the years I've taken so many of my roommates beers from the fridge at 2am because I wanted to keep drinking and the liquor stores were closed. I always felt really guilty about it in the morning and tried to run out to the liquor store to replace them before anyone noticed they were missing.  

For about the past 4 years, my denial has slowly morphed into a lukewarm acceptance that my behavior is not healthy and that I need to quit. However, all of my attempts at moderating how much I drink have either failed, or were half-assed promises to begin with. 

I finally got motivation to actually quit for good yesterday. On Monday I wound up drinking with my friends until 4 30 am. After that I drove home drunk, and then drank some more when I got home. I don't remember falling asleep, but I do remember waking up at 3pm, hours into my work shift. I work from home, and no one said anything to me when I logged on to work, and I didn't lose my job. I'm well-liked at work and do a lot of important stuff for the company. But I'm sure someone noticed and just didn't want to say anything to me. 

The fact that I could've totally been the guy to lose his job due to drinking really freaked the hell out of me. To make things worse, I am diabetic, and drinking is already terrible for my body. Drinking hasn't ruined my life yet, but that is the direction it is going in. I am going to wind up losing my job or getting in a car accident if I keep going the way I am. Or I am simply going to wreck my physical, mental, and emotional health. I don't want to wait until that happens to finally stop. 

I see now that moderating my drinking is a fool's errand. Over the years I've even set up ""rules"" for myself to limit how much damage my drinking does to my life - ie. no posting on social media once drinking starts, no texting anyone, no online shopping, only buy enough alcohol to get me drunk for one night, etc.

The truth is, the only way I can control my drinking is if I don't pick up that first drink entirely. The nights I don't drink, I don't even think about it. It is only the nights that I start drinking that I lose control and don't want to stop. The only option left for me is to just not drink at all anymore.",3

Something with the change in weather triggered me and, for the life of me, I couldn’t figure it out. But I think it is the up coming date of my wedding anniversary. Lots of sadness through those years. Lots of humiliation, hurt, abuse, and regret. They say the funny people are actually the saddest. I feel like that is me. I can entertain and be funny but it is a way to avoid what hurts the most. Not that I still love him, just the constant questioning about why I wasn’t good enough. Why all thé years of being lied to. Anytime you are cheated on or experience infidelity it leaves you questioning what was your part. Im most sad that I lost all those years and my family didn’t protect me until the worst abuse occurred. When this happens I do 3 things. 1. Stop all alcohol 2. Start exercising 3. Stay busy- the garage is a good start.

I finally decided to take action and I asked my doctor to refer me to an addiction specialist/therapist. I was sent to a Mental health Nurse practitioner and she prescribed Neltrexone 50mg. I wasnt aware of medication to battle cravings for alcohol.

She also told me to seek a therapist and I found a good one. We Skype call once a week.

Now Im 30 days sober and feeling great. The medication Neltrexone has been a game changer for me. Very good medication. I also drink a ton of Gatorade after work instead of beer and it has also worked well for me. Also eating a delicious cheat meal work too.

**A little story about my life if you want to read :)**  


3 years ago I was 525 lbs. and at one of the lowest points in my life. I moved from my parents to try and work at hospice in Indiana. I left because I was running from opiates but discovered drinking. I would drink a liter of whiskey almost daily. I would eat 3k calories in a single meal and have about 4 to 5 meals. I would drink 2L of soda to wash the alcohol and taco bell down. I was 28 years old and 3 years prior I graduated college with honors, was getting ready to go to physical therapy school to be a doctor, and had the girl of my dreams with me. Now I was so done and alone in life I wanted to do nothing but just fucking die. Of course I saw a video of a mom saying that when her son committed suicide that it destroyed her. I thought about my mom and realized I couldn't do that to her. I didn't want to live either so I figured a heart attack would be the middle ground. I would drink when a patient died which happened a lot. My family in Indiana wanted to help me but I was so lost and mentally broken I couldn't see up from down anymore. My dad heard about this and called to ask if I wanted to come back home. I cried so hard right after that phone call I put my two weeks in, packed all my stuff 3 days before my last day at work, and when I was done with my last shift the next day I bolted. I dad lived in Arizona and I was on the other side of the country in north Indiana. The drive with the detour in Colorado for weed to Arizona was 27 hours worth of driving. I got to my moms in 32 hours from when I left. That tells you how much I wanted to go home. I slept on the bed for 3 days and never got out. I thought back then it was cause of the drive, really though for the first time in 6 months I felt safe again.   


*So a little back story I used to take opiates since 2014. I didn't buy them and I didn't get them from a doctor. My mom has had horrible pain all her life and has been prescribed pain meds. She didn't give them to me either and didn't know I was taking them for a long time. If you can understand what I am trying to say I was a total piece of shit to the one person trying to keep me alive. Even when she knew I was doing this she didn't kick me out of the house, even though I did it so many times even after we had so many talks. I am not proud one bit to this but please listen as truth is she saved my life and I owe her everything for it. Been sober from pills for 4 months now and very very proud of that record. My relationship with my mom is also better now than it ever has been because we know how much we truly love one another. Give your mom a hug if you can, if you cant think about a favorite moment you had with her and say thank you to her in your head. We should love more and hate less.*  


Anyway my mom said she didn't recognize me when I came home from Indiana because I was so overweight and looked like a mess. My outsides 100% matched how I felt inside to make you guys understand. Her friend hooked me up with a job at home and a mac to photoshop images for him. I had never worked on photoshop for a job just a hobby but his act of kindness gave me a chance to work on myself. I didn't take full advantage of the time back then as I rediscovered opiates again sadly. My mom had such a large back supply due to.... well her old doctor can no longer legally give out pain killers if that gives a hint. I would think I was being responsible this time because I am trying to quit alcohol and weed; I also had myself convinced that since I wasn't trying to take enough to make me go into a semi coma state for a day it was better than before. I justified taking drugs by saying thinking I'm quitting by taking those drugs. *(Now thinking back its a wtf moment but in that state of mind it made sense. I kept saying I was able to be myself when I was on the drug, I could talk to more people, I was more friendly. Truthfully I like being quiet now that I am sober. I enjoy taking a few extra moments to fully absorb what someone is saying and process it before responding. On opiates I was just reacting and over time it would have been a hellish situation. )* 

It was later that I saw a deal for stomach sleeve surgery over in Mexico. My mom has had a few friends who have done the surgery there and said it was better than hospitals in the U.S. I didn't have any money on me and my mom wanted so badly to help but also didn't have money for it. My dad and my moms ex bf's aunt decided to pitch 3k each to pay for the operation. They didn't owe me anything but yet gave me everything in my eyes. I have lost 225 lbs. since that operation and can move again. I can go further hiking than anyone in my family currently and love to move. I am still losing weight but since I dropped drinking I have lost another 20 lbs.  


I could keep going cause I have a butt load of huge examples but I realized I would be writing a book at that point. What I want to say about this story is a lot of people tell me its amazing what I have accomplished in my life. That an autistic boy who was in special needs classes in elementary and middle school; goes on to graduated in the top 1% of your class in college. That a boy who has in his life, lost a total of 360 lbs. during two parts of my life ( was 315 lbs. in 2009). A boy who is finding peace after attempting to kill himself with pills more than once. Really I'm nothing without you all :)",102

From schlepping back into my home group of AA and admitting I couldn't do it anymore and god, the guilt, shame and remorse were INTENSE but I made myself go.  And god picking up that phone and asking some stranger to be my sponsor and then calling him everyday was quite humbling.

But over and over again, I've pushed myself to do what didn't feel good at the time and to be open and honest and holy shit, I feel so much better and I'm so grateful to be sober today.  

And thank GOD for Zoom meetings.   I love these things and have never experienced such growth in my AA program before.  And more than ever before, I feel like I'm connected to a world wide fellowship.  It's so amazing.

2020-09-23 11:02:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/iybsi3/health_scare/,Health scare,"Hey guys. I’m new here. And I’ll be honest, I don’t want to be here at all. I can easily admit that I’m an alcoholic, or a binge drinker (same shit). I’ve been drinking more than half my life. I was once a meth addict and I quit easily. Alcohol though, my god is this a different beast. 

Let me get to why I’m here. This is now the third time in a few months I’ve woken up to very swollen feet. This has never happened to me before. I know this is a symptom of liver damage. I’m also like 2 years overdue for bloodwork and guess what? I can’t bring myself to go get it done. I’m absolutely horrified when I think about receiving confirmation that I do in fact have a bad liver. I can’t imagine how devastating this will be to me. I’m only 38. 

You wanna know the saddest thing about it all? I’m more scared of the bad results because I DONT WANT TO QUIT DRINKING. I don’t think I can! I watched one of my best friends drink himself to death at 45. He was jaundiced. He couldn’t walk due to edema. He was bloated. His esophagus was bleeding. He had blood coming out of his ass. It was the literal worst death I ever seen. He just couldn’t stop. THIS IS ME. I’m so scared I will accept dying before I try to quit. 

Guys, I’ve been drinking for so long that my whole life seems to revolve around it. What do I do for fun? Go to bars and breweries.  I love to travel and try different cultures drinks. I love being drunk and finally feeling happy. Music sounds better.  I feel alive when I drink. When I’m sober I’m bored and I’m BORING. I’m shy. I’m not funny. I suck when I’m sober!!! The thought of going sober makes me sick. But I’m scared of dying like my friend did. I’m just scared of sobriety. I’m scared of what will happen if I don’t quit. I’m laying here with my legs elevated because there’s a possibility that I fucking ruined my liver because I’m a horrible worthless piece of destructive shit alcoholic. 

God I’m rambling. I’m just having a mid life crisis of sorts. What do sober people do? I’ve been to AA meetings and I’ve hated them. I really think I’m a lost cause here. Has anyone felt this? Am I beyond help? Sorry if this post is a jumbled mess of thoughts, I’m basically having a panic attack while writing this. I need to change because even if my blood test comes back ok I know it’s only a matter of time. And I have a feeling deep down that it won’t come back ok. Edema in my feet? What the actual fuck? Anyways, thanks for listening.",3

I’m finding my biggest challenge now is to avoid falling into the despair and developing a nihilistic attitude that nothing matters and might as well enjoy the substances. Without getting too political, the nihilism is most influenced by state of the world and American politics. I actually am not craving alcohol and have stronger urges for marijuana, but that has historically led me to drink more as I chase that feeling of intoxication. 

I felt like I pushed past it last night and don’t feel the same way today. Would be interested to hear the experiences of people who were/are in similar boats",6

I took an unusual approach to get here, but I’m glad I did. One of the biggest changes is my outlook on life. I’m happy for the today’s.

When I was still drinking, the thought of taking a week or two off seemed like a non starter. Just for today though? I can do that. The cravings and temptations still creep up here and there, but it hardly lasts more than a few minutes, and I’m back to feeling good about not drinking.  If anyone is on the fence about their drinking, I would just give it a try and see how it feels, because for me, I really like the non drinking version of Dave.

2020-09-23 10:54:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/iybmyx/30_days_of_night_guy_here/,30 Days of Night guy here.,"Wow.  So, I woke up today, had some tea, looked at some things on Reddit, lo and behold, I’ve been AFAF for 30 days now.  You have got to be shitting me.  The maniac that I was a month ago could have never for-seen this.  It is not a hell of a long time, I know, but it is interesting, because even though I’ve taken breaks from drinking in the past, this is the first time I can remember spending 30 days straight up in one HELL of a long time.  Here are a few things that I’ve noticed:

*Waking up, well before work, making some tea and cooking a tidy little breakfast complete with scrambled eggs with peppers is infinitely better than waking up half-fucked-up and grabbing whatever “thing” from the store before beginning work.

*Also, I’m beginning work in the morning now, rather than 3:00pm.  So, that’s a big plus.  I’m able to think more clearly as well, whilst working.  That was a big one.  I’ve always heard that the “sober high” ends eventually, and maybe that is so, but I haven’t reached that point yet.  If it happens, then it happens, but I am not super worried about it at this point.

*Text messages, CHRIST, the horrific texts that I sent whilst drunk.  Yeah, those are done.  I don’t know why I had such a motivation to share my anguish and despair with people via text when drunk.  That was a bad idea.  I likely destroyed a number of relationships, but that’s ok.  Hindsight being crystal clear, it probably wasn’t a good idea for me to be around some of those individuals anyway.

*I no longer workshop the idea of killing myself.  Not that I was hiding in my bedroom closet with a bottle of Xanax and holding a gun to my own head, but I previously spent a lot of time thinking “What the fuck is the point of all of this?  If I’m going to be bloody miserable and depressed all of the time, I may as well kill myself.”, or at the very least be fucked up all of the time.  Now I’m actually being productive, cooking food properly, writing and working on new material has been amped up, and I don’t really see any signs of slowing down.

*Reading books has resumed.  I’ve read a number of books over the past month, including The End of October, by Lawrence Wright.  This was released in March, was written a couple of years ago and happens to be ABOUT A GLOBAL PANDEMIC and was eerily prescient in terms of everything we have experienced over the last number of months.  It’s not QUITE up there with Steven Soderberg’s Contagion in terms of verisimilitude, (The End of October gets a little big and cumbersome towards the end), but it was still shocking to see all of this stuff play out in fiction, basically the same way things have been handled in the real world.

*Drunk people are really fucking annoying.  God bless them, I was one more often than not for longer than I would care to admit, but Jesus.  I can’t really see myself going back to that.  I’ve been to a couple of little get together or functions, and while there was alcohol around constantly, I never really had the temptation to join in on the games.  On one instance, this annoying dude offered me several beers (I was never a beer guy, it was always bourbon), and I kept declining politely as possible, but the guy exclaimed “What the fuck mrrrann, JIsT hAvE a DrANK wiv mE!?!”, since nobody knows about my little experiment, I didn’t really want to say “Oh, well, thanks, but I used to be a psychotically depressed problematic drinker, but I’ve stopped drinking now, so thanks all the same!”, so instead I just tell people, who ask, that I can’t drink right now due to a new diet, which I guess is technically true.  

So there we go, a month, I haven’t relapsed. I’m not saying that I will be fuck up free forever, but right now it seems pretty good.  Is the world as we know it ending?  I don’t know, maybe.  Are we heading into a particularly acrimonious election season? Almost certainly, it’s going to be a shit show.  But at least I’ll remember it, such as it is.  

Thanks to all who post and take part in this sub.  I completely stumbled on this by accident and it has been a super good mistake.  Seeing what everyone has been sharing has been absolutely inspiring and sobering, no pun intended.

I need sobriety to become my lifestyle. I’m not a moderator and I will not learn to moderate. That is a lesson learned.

I want to feel like I did in August.

For some reason my Day 1 is lacking the feeling of drive I had last time. It’s not that I want to drink, but I fear I won’t feel as accomplished this time around with each passing day. Somehow I just feel so failed for having relapse. But I know this low feeling might just be the depression I have from drinking for a few weeks.

I really want to do this. And I really want to do this for the long haul.

I chose to stop drinking after 10 years of being a daily drinker. I had gotten to the point where I would wake up around 3am each night in pure panic and not being able to tell myself “it’s all just a nightmare” because it was actually my real life.

I could physically feel it in my gut - the pain that had come from drinking for so long. The daily panic attacks I had because I knew I was killing myself slowly would last for 12 hours sometimes. I tried to pretend I didn’t know why my anxiety was so bad, but deep down I knew it was because of my relationship with alcohol.

In August I decided enough was enough. I didn’t want to kill bottles of wine everyday anymore. I didn’t want to drink while I worked (from home), panicking that my colleagues may have noticed on calls. I didn’t want my SO to come home to me obliterated or passed out before dinner time. I didn’t want to call my mom and feel guilty just talking to her - knowing I was killing her child.

I came to this sub every day and proudly posted my accomplishments. I broke through that first wretched week, until I finally began to not feel the withdrawals anymore. I powered through three more weeks sobriety through vacations, people visiting, being out at bars with friends even. I would DD. 

I took morning walks to avoid the urge of wanting a morning drink. I had a whole month of no drinking down. I was in a good place.

Then, when I hit my month goal, I thought “I reached this point. I can drink again. I can learn to control it this time and will drink like a normal adult.”

So, I drank again. And I drank every day after that but one - because I was too hungover. I passed out a few times and had patchy memories of my days or nights. I got back home from a vacation and continued to drink everyday when I had told myself I wouldn’t do that. Yesterday I passed out very early - and day drank a can of wine before polishing off a small bottle of whiskey... something I didn’t even normally drink before I went alcohol free.

I’m here to tell those that are struggling with the idea of wanting to drink again after a period of sobriety that it’s not even worth it. It sucked me right back in and it’s done nothing but brought me back to point zero - hell, even lower. Because now I was drinking whiskey as well. 

I can feel that my physical and psychological pain and anxiety are slowly coming back to me. 

During my sober month, I had fun. I was always worried that I’d lose my fun if I stopped drinking, but I didn’t. I had fun and I felt great and I was proud. My friends still enjoyed being around me, even when I wasn’t drinking anything. And I had a clarity and happiness I hadn’t had for a decade.

But having relapsed, I feel awful and guilty and unaccomplished. I feel sorry for the me who worked so hard and was so proud - because I chose to take it all away with that first sip. And that first sip gave me the incentive to want to continue because “I already drank anyway.”

Keep it up. Don’t lose the happiness you’ve gained for yourself to take that tempting sip. The first feeling I had after mine was overwhelming sadness followed by disappointment. I felt like I lost a new friend... who was the new me during that time. I’m getting that person back.

Here’s to Day 1. And though I’m not setting a goal to tempt me to relapse again, I can’t wait to break past that month mark without giving in this time.

Oh well, I’m sober and that’ll have to do until I get a little more motivated. I did buy hummus and celery to replace the cheese n crackers. Baby steps! Keep on keeping on!",32

Well, the universe certainly has a way of turning things around on you. 

I woke up in the middle of the night with a stomach bug that kept me running from the bathroom to the couch for several hours. Needless to say, I feel like shit today and definitely do not feel like drinking! I’m also kind of laughing about it though. What timing.

Anyway, I have a zoom interview in a half hour and then plan to veg out with mint tea and saltines for the rest of the day. I will not drink with you today!",5

In several ways that was the worst day for me so far. And I 'm sorry for being so negative in my post yesterday, I was so irritable all day and I didn't mean to be. 

My first day was not great, I was a little shaky but nothing bad and by the late evening it had mostly passed. I had some cravings for alcohol, but I managed. 

Yesterday though I had slept a total of between 4-5 hours in total since I stopped drinking, and I hurt my back at work and just everything went wrong all day. No question my worst cravings since I stopped on sunday.. I wanted to just smell my wine bottle but I knew what that would have ended up with so I somehow managed not to do that. I did one nice thing yesterday.. I went for a long drive in the rain at night on my own with some loud music. I went out into the country and it was pitch black, no other cars and I stopped at a parking lot in the middle of the woods were there was no cell signal and had a cigarette before driving back home again. I figured if I was sober at midnight anyway I might as well make something nice of it.. I fell asleep around 8 in the morning after the workers began making noise, but no explosions today! Either that or I slept really really heavily.. 

So today I have finally got a few more hours of sleep and I feel better. My back still hurts and today I will help an aquaintance with some stuff so it will probably get worse by the end of the day. Day four, here I come... IWNDWYT",4

Since I've got my life back on track, I rarely feel an urge to even drink at all and I don't count the days that I've been sober. 

Last weekend, I figured that a few beers and some gaming could be fun. I think I'd been sober for a month at that time, but again, I don't count the days anymore. I'm just happy to be out of my abuse and not having the urge to drink anymore. So I picked up a six pack, drank four beers before feeling like I had enough and finished the last two of the pack with my dinner the next day.

All week, I've been feeling depressed. I'm not sure if I was feeling depressed before this weekend, I can't remember. I had some edibles Thursday because I was feeling like shit and a good high usually makes me feel okay for a few days. I started studying an English course recently and today, I just sat in class and stared into the room without following along with anything. I just felt so depressed. I had to get up and go outside at one point because I felt like I was going to vomit from how anxious and depressed I felt.

I keep telling myself, it's just because I had alcohol, it will pass if you don't touch any, but there's this dark voice in the back of my head telling me that I can make the depression go away if I drink. I know it will only be for a moment, but right now, even a moment of not feeling depressed seems alluring. I know this is how the downfall into relapse begins and knowing that is the only reason why I'm not drunk right now even though I feel like shit. 

I don't know what I want with this post. Has anyone else felt this way after only a few beers despite staying sober for a while?",1

So here's my pathetic story for anyone with enough time:- [https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/iwxvh5/turns\_out\_people\_who\_have\_been\_down\_this\_road\_do/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/iwxvh5/turns_out_people_who_have_been_down_this_road_do/)  


Anyway, these crazy dreams you have when you first stop drinking, they seem to get crazier with each quit right? I used to just have bizarre dreams, the last 2 cycles they were actually scary (I may have had sleep paralysis which I have had in the past) on both occasions I was being smothered on my bed or pushed down with a terrifying face snarling at me.  This time was different, I had a bizarre dream but I am convinced it was a message..  Here it is, WDYAT?:-  


In the dream I was trying to take a shower, note the location was actuallz quite public and I could see people walking around outside the cubicle. I kept going in there with my clothes on, first fully dressed, then underwear and a really colourful winter hat that I only saw in the reflection of the glass, I didn't realise I had it on, then next time I was wearing a leather jacket… I just couldn't get a shower.  It could be my unconscious interpreting me 'getting clean' literally or it could be my unconscious trying to point out that I've been trying to do that so far with barriers. I took it as a sign and decided to get real. I am usually secretive, I'll quit furtively and not talk about anything. 

Today I told my husband I am done, that's it - I am  quitting, up to him if he wants booze in the house, fortunately he's not much of a drinker (how do so many of us end up with these mysterious people that can take it or leave it?!) so he was all, sure no problem, we'll be a booze free house. He agrees it's the best thing for me and for us all. I also started to open up about the kinds of things I've been feeling, researching and looking at (I used to minimize my screen in the past if he came in) and I don't know... I just feel like being really open and honest about it because until now I haven't ß I defaul to being childish, secretive, petulant and self-centred. Maybe I need to totally open myself up to the sunlight and be brutally honest. I never have been before, I am always hiding. Is this a serious stepping stone, like it feels or am I just kidding myself?",2

I have been drinking 10 years. Last 4 years 2 or 3 days a week heavy whiskey drinker. I have tried so many times and failed every time. I know it's too early to say but I think those 8 days even a success on my side. Here are some changes in my body and life:
1) No more diarrhea which made my life terrible especially when I went outside looking for toilet everywhere. Scared of shittin in my pants (which never happened but could have been)
2) No more tired and felt sick mornings.
3) No more anxiety (Not as much as the day or so after drink)
4) No more random pains especially at my back and side)
5) No more angry feelings without any reason.
6) No more regrets the day after. ( Who I spoke to or did silly things normally I won't do)
7) Thinking far positive even there is a problem.
8) Didn't think about my ex girlfriend so much (we were in love for 7 years then broke up)
9) Feeling hopeful about my future.
10) Not feeling tired when I am doing my job

Sum up for a long time I didn't accept that alcohol makes my life misserable. I always drink to relax and forget some feelings and toughts which I don't want to. But afterall I realised that alcohol it's self is causing most of my problems.
I can proudly say IWNDWY and other bright hours mornings days...

A friend from that night has invited me and my partner to dinner tonight. I’m nervous to see her as she’s not really a good friend (I only met her that night when i blacked out, she came over for a dinner party before). I was apparently spending a lot of time with her, so I’m nervous to see her again as she knows more about what I did & said that night than me! 

Anyways I wanted to go to dinner with her to kind of face my social fear of seeing her again as I don’t like blackout anxiety to run my life. I find walking into fears is the best way to grow. But the restaurant she’s inviting us to is a wine bar / deli, and it looks like wine is the main event with some dishes cooked as well. 

Wine was my drink of choice and it makes me stressed to go and have to explain im not going to have a glass - i don’t really want to explain this to someone i barely know and who I was drinking a lot with last time I saw her only a few weeks ago! 

I don’t want to be rude and cancel, I don’t want to reveal point blank I’m not drinking anymore and I don’t want to be stressed out at a wine bar refusing a glass of wine :/ - Im not worried about relapse as I’m not easily triggered and completed 1 year of sober socializing, but I certainly won’t be comfortable.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

**Self-Gratification and Life Clutter**

Living with addiction can be described as a world of excess and self-gratification. And self-gratification is mindlessly fulfilling your own base desire, which is pretty easy to do when surrounded by alcohol.

I chased a lot of external excitement, lust, and distraction. By externals, I’m generally talking about things like alcohol, drugs, gambling, buying stuff, eating junk food, excess phone use, video games, etc. And one thing these externals are great at is creating more pain and anxiety. These distractions are what I will call, life clutter. Some of it is ok in small doses, but all of these can get out of control in a hurry and suck up all of your time.

I used alcohol to combat my pain and stress, which only added to it. So, I found other things to chase. I ate junk food and destroyed my health. I cluttered my home with stuff and my credit cards with debt. I gambled on sports and elevated my stress. I played video games instead of spending time with my wife and son. 

This is where creating habitual behavior to combat Resistance has come in handy for me. If I create habits that work for me, it replaces that distraction with a meaningful practice. I realize I'm beginning to sound like I may have a computer chip inside of me. I still have my time set aside to watch football or movies, but only after my practice.

Succumbing to life clutter is the easy way. Creating thoughtful habits is hard work, but it’s work that brings real joy and fulfillment to our lives. And I really try to use these habits to work different areas of my life.

One of my favorite Tony Robbins’ contributions is the Pyramid of Mastery, which covers the 7 major facets of everyone’s life. From the bottom to the top of the pyramid these are the layers: 

1. Physical Body
2. Emotions / Meaning
3. Relationships
4. Time
5. Work / Mission
6. Finances
7. Contribution and Spirituality

This appears as an order, but we work through all facets simultaneously. Think of it as a stool with individual legs we are working to strengthen and balance. If your focus is limited to a couple legs of the stool, it will be wobbly and topple over. All the legs should be as strong as they can be.

Alcohol was a destructive force to each of these legs like termites working their way through the wood framing on a house. I enjoyed all of my clutter too much. And it wasn’t until I quit drinking that I could see the destruction done to each leg of the stool.

Building new habits is what created a practice to strengthen each of these legs. 

**Physical Body:** Drinking was a major trigger point of a poor diet for me. I had high blood pressure, I was overweight, and I was never consistent with exercise. Once I quit drinking, I started eating healthier. I lost weight and was able to get my blood pressure under control. My fitness level improved with gradual change in my routine. It’s not all perfect, but my energy has improved drastically, which helps me in all other facets. 

**Emotions / Meaning:** Negative emotions were a force permeating through my life when I drank. Fear, anxiety, and anger were emotions made worse through alcohol. My anger was ubiquitous and expected. My fear and anxiety were only hidden with alcohol and subsequently increased when hungover. I still experience all of these emotions, but in a way that I can face and manage now. I face my fear with courage. Anger is a work-in-progress, but I’ve come a long way. I give thanks for what I have. This has given me more joy in life than I ever experienced with alcohol. It has helped me to find meaning over chasing some high. 

**Relationships:** Alcohol was an excuse to choose drinking buddies over my wife and son. I spent a lot of time at the bar and really not with people I care about all that much. Before I quit drinking, I always imbibed before seeing anyone outside of the house. Now we are spending quality time together and with our families. Not time filled with booze or thinking about where my next drink will be. 

**Work / Mission:** My work has been one of the primary drivers of why I drank so heavily. It supported my anger. And it led me to drink daily to get my mind off the job. I even tried sports gambling to replace my income. Hint: it wasn’t the answer (as if you were guessing the other way). This pandemic has taught me some valuable things. One of them is being more conscious with how I spend my time. Especially on what is fulfilling to me. I still have to make money, but I can do a lot better than chase money 50 hours a week in a job that negatively impacts my mood.

**Finances:** I was consumed with buying needless crap during my drinking life. We filled our house with junk that would get donated or thrown away. Because I did well in my job, I thought I could afford to spend money carelessly. And maybe I could, but at what cost? All of the movies that were purchased, the Apple Watch that serves little purpose other than recording workouts, the iPad that doesn’t get used. None of these things bring me joy. As nerdy as this sounds, I have more fun seeing how many days I can go without spending a dime. Books will always hold a special place in my heart. But beyond the essentials, I don’t need many other physical items to enjoy life.

**Spirituality:** Whether you are religious or not, all of us are spiritual creatures. For some this is a relationship with God or other higher power. For some this is a connection with nature. For others it’s a mediation practice or your philosophical principles. Spirituality is how you find meaning and purpose in your inner life and connection to others. All of us can define what this means to us individually. For me, a relationship with God is like the foundation of my house. When booze was at the center of my life, I never spent time in prayer. Today, it’s an important daily practice and one that I can’t skip. Whatever your spiritual practice may be, the externals of the physical world will never bring us the happiness or joy we desire. And none of what we accumulate in the physical world can be taken with us when we die.

**Time:** I left time for last because it permeates throughout every facet of our lives. We have to choose how to spend our time in the right way and on the right things. If we don’t choose, we settle for what is easiest. It is far easier to sit around debasing ourselves in lustful thought because we are bored and uncommitted to doing something better for us. I have to consciously decide to spend my time in a more purposeful way. 

I get it, all of this sounds unsexy compared to playing video games or buying stuff on Amazon. But this is more about a commitment to the process. These externals are nothing more than dopamine hits and even that happens more in the anticipation of than the actual activity.

The practice and process is about delaying gratification. In the long-run, I know my writing practice will bring far more happiness than buying one of these new video game systems and devoting unnecessary time to playing every day. This isn’t to say you shouldn’t or I shouldn’t buy the system. It’s more about being conscious of how that time spent affects what you *could* be doing. If it affects my ability to put in my daily writing practice and daily weight training practice and the time it takes to prepare healthy food, then I am sacrificing something far more important for a virtual figure on a screen.

Delayed gratification is a muscle that must be exercised. Otherwise we will find ourselves on the couch eating a bag of Doritos every day. No one else? Ok, don’t mind me.

As long as I am focused on my daily practice, I keep self-gratification at bay. I don’t use my money on junk. And I don't procrastinate away large chunks of my time.

Am I seriously quitting alcohol after at least a couple of decades of heavy drinking?  Did I really tell many of my friends and family of my intention?

A part of me feels betrayed... angry... boxed into a corner.  I wanted to drink tonight and the fact that I have told so many people that I was quitting helped to prevent me from pulling down the wine glass.

Damn it.

For most of the past few years especially, the thought of going through a single evening without wine would have been laughable; now I’ve done that 30 times. But am I really serious?  Do I really intend to be sober during every upcoming picnic, restaurant meal, holiday, and visit with friends? During every upcoming Friday night? Every Saturday night? Through every evening while working late on distasteful tasks at my job?  

Tonight I’m thinking, did I really do this? Am I really ready to do this for the rest of my life?  What the heck did I sign up for?

I've known it for years, he's suspected for a while. I have done my best to hide it for a long time, which has been fairly easy because he works rotationally and is away for 2-3 weeks at a time. I spend those weeks drinking alone as much as I want and trying to hide the evidence. I hoard cash so he doesn't see trips to CVS on the credit card because he would know that's where I buy wine (classy, huh?). I drink his beer and then buy more before he gets home so there is the same amount left in the fridge as when he left. I take the trash out before he comes home so he doesn't see the empty bottles. I don't answer the phone when he calls and I've had enough that I know I'll slur. I am so ashamed. 

While it wasn't terribly difficult to admit it to myself, it was awful telling him. I know I shouldn't be but I'm embarrassed that I am not stronger. We've been married for a little over a year (dated for and lived together for years before that) and him being away is getting harder. I get very lonely and bored and then drink. It's not an excuse - I love drinking and getting drunk - but it's also my terrible coping mechanism for missing my husband. I called into work last week because I was hungover (not the first, second, or third time that's happened) and he called me out on it. I had tried to make up a story about food poisoning but he knew. And I am so relieved. I am so lucky to have him.

Why did it take me so long to tell him? I didn't want to stop drinking. I don't really want to now (god I miss wine already) but I can't handle the anxiety, the shame, the fear of losing my career or my health, anymore. I work in health care and while I have never, never, never taken care of a patient while under the influence of alcohol, I have worked while significantly hungover and that is not acceptable. I'm making a promise to myself that I will never do that again. Now that he knows, there's someone else to hold me accountable. I'm already grieving over the loss of my nights sitting alone on the couch with a bottle of wine and that's pretty telling.

So it's Day 1 again for me after many attempts, short and long. The longest I've gone without drinking was nearly 11 months and was the best 11 months of my adult life. The length was mainly in part because I had weekly alcohol tests and check-in at an outpatient rehab center due to my second DUI.

After not drinking recently, I tried to normalize drinking again and started telling myself that I'll control it this time since I'm older and have more experience. But that didn't work. I went right back to blacking out, feeling shameful and regretful, and drinking again the next day to mask my feelings —basically, an endless loop.

I usually start drinking due to work stress, and as time goes on, I realize the drinking created more anxiety and stress than I had to begin with. Soon the REAL issue I had is over with, yet I'm still drinking because of all this made up anxiety created from the alcohol.

For the 11 months I had quit drinking, it was easily the best of my adult life. I had NO anxiety, no stress. Even though I had problems at work, I dealt with the issues head on and never felt any long-term stress or anxiety from them. I was in the best shape of my life, lost 25lb, was at the gym every single day. Mentally and physically, I felt on top of the world. Unfortunately, I figured after 11 months I could control it this time, and soon learned that I couldn't. Had some short term stints of not drinking, 1-2 months at a time; always felt amazing during those periods but came back to drinking thinking I could control it. Same thing over and over again.

I figure enough is enough. I've been lurking for years, but need to hold myself more accountable. I've realized that drinking won't ever be normal for me. It's caused enough problems in my life, and for others around me that I love.

As for now, I'm just trying to get rid of the short-term guilt and anxiety from recently drinking and looking forward to brighter days.

This time with a therapist,"I first quit for a year back in early 2018. Started drinking casually after my year mark, and with the right combo of triggers I was back to getting wasted daily. Didn't leave my house except to buy booze for nearly three weeks, luckily I kept my job. Went to the doc, got some outpatient meds, was clean, clear and happy-ish again. The initial upward climb of writing was never difficult for me when I've been able to quit with medication.

Now in 2020, with COVID, all the stuff that's wrong and bad, and the crazy stressors I started drinking casually again in early spring. Had a great track record of casual drinking for months, until one day I happened to find myself at the right place and right time to get wasted. So wasted that I had to drink the next day to dull the hangover - at least that's what I tell myself. Anyways, here we are three weeks later with an average of 10-12 drinks per night.

Today I went to my doc and got some meds to treat the withdrawal symptoms, and tomorrow I'm going alcohol-free. In the past I didn't do much to stay sober except promise myself I wouldn't drink again - and that didn't work well for me. This time I'm pairing it with therapy - it's gonna be expensive as hell, but if I can work out ways to prevent me from thinking it's okay to drink casually then it'll pay for itself in 3-5 years.

Have you guys been to counselors/therapists to help understand your own substance abuse? Anything you've found to be helpful when working with someone else? My drinking is very impulsive, and I've found it hard to introspect and understand while in a sober state. Any shared stories or advice for areas to focus on would be appreciated, I have my first session on Monday.",6

I have known my alcohol drinking has been a problem for awhile now. I got fired from an EMS position in 2017 for not showing up to work. I was drinking a 5th of whiskey after my shifts at that point. Before that I had to leave the volunteer firefighting position because I couldn't show up for calls. (Also because I took a full time EMT position) 

Since then I have had 3 red flags from drinking telling me to wake up and change my behavior. The first is a year ago when I drank too much at a friends house and had to clean vomit out of their carpet. The second was blacking out at a family gathering this summer and coming to with no idea where I was or what was going on. The third and final straw was last night.

I live with my parents and am lucky as hell to be able to rent free. I am 27 this year as of this month. I have been able to go without drinking and cutting down on drinking with them around. The second they leave for any extended period of time my first thought is ""I can get wasted now!"" I go and buy too much alcohol, drink all/most of it then wake up the next day hoping I didn't do or say anything too stupid.

I said something stupid.

I've been dealing with long repressed questions about my gender and sexuality during this covid lockdown. That along with anxiety/depression stuff exacerbated by the lockdown itself has caused my headspace to not be very good. So I went into last night with an entire box of wine ready to chill out and have fun. 00:30 hits and I wake up in my bed this morning. The usual routine of making sure I haven't accidentally destroyed anything, hurt myself, or been an asshole begins. I calm down after everything seems good. I did some weird drunk posting but everything seemed fine. Until one online friend reaches out and I see the shit I said to them last night.

I cannot excuse my behavior and my lack of self control any longer. I knew I had a problem and thought I was dealing with it. I was lying to myself.

There is an in person AA group meeting in a local church tomorrow night that I will be going to. I have a six pack of beer and I've poured five of them out.

Last week had a conversation with my SO about drying out for a while (at least through Halloween.)  So I stopped...and it has sucked. Being miserable led me to checking out stuff about quitting alcohol -> then to withdrawal symptoms and here.  The headaches have subsided a bit, still a bit antsy and irritable.   I'm glad I came across this site as it has helped me.
   I never thought I would get to a point where I couldn't easily just stop something...  I've drank relatively heavily off and on since 18.  I might dry out for a bit, on a whim or for a bet, but then I would go back to partying.  I don't know when the last time I had an extended period of sobriety, probably about 7 years ago when my wife was pregnant.  I would generally binge on weekends, but in the last couple of years started drinking occasionally on weeknights as well.    
   I'd intermittently look into going dry, but never really took to it.    
   Covid has changed things, staying home, working from home, taking care of kids at home, being the Teacher's assistant at home... It started off with drinking more often and earlier and has become a pretty much daily habit.  It probably wouldn't be so bad, except a significant portion of my day is me watching my kids.  That leaves the evenings for me to get my work-work done, by which point I'm already tired.  Getting loaded just ensures that I get nothing done and if I keep it up then I will no longer be employed.  
   On reflection my relationships have suffered and I've been a poor friend, since too often it's been more of a priority to stay home and drink instead of being there when I was needed.

I drink between 5-10 beers a day. Everyday. Alcohol % ranging from 5.9% to 9.5%. I tend to drink higher percentage beers so I can drink less of them. I am kind of tolerant to that now though. I have gained 25 pounds over the last 5-6 months, I am overweight (5'8"" 195 lbs) and I feel like shit daily usually until the end of the night when I have a decent buzz.

Well, I got blood work done the other day and today I got a phone call. The doctor is very concerned about my results on a comprehensive metabolic panel. My liver enzymes are elevated and they want me to get a biopsy done on my liver and my gull bladder. My liver enzyme results are as follows;

&#x200B;

AST (SGOT) = 76 u/L \- Normal Range is 0-37

ALT (SGPT) = 80 u/L \- Normal Range is 0-41

Alk Phosphatase  = 141 u/L \- Normal Range 40-129

Anyone with any knowledge on these numbers. How messed up have I gotten myself? I plan on quitting drinking by the beginning of next week, tapering a little each day. Are these numbers really bad?

It's been a lot of up and down in this last 265 days, but I have learned a lot about myself, and I feel better about myself. My last post that I put up, well I was frustrated that day that I physically pretty much look the same, etc. But I've been thinking more about it, and it's actually not a big deal in the grand scheme of things. September is important to me because, well last September was my first attempt at getting sober, and also at the end of this month is the 2 year anniversary of my Dad's suicide. I was 38 when he died. I was 24 when my Mom died suddenly, also in a pretty graphic way, so when I think back I'm trying to focus on what I've made it through, and not the fact that I don't look like a new person. I'm trying to actually give myself some credit for once. I also try and leave as many encouraging comments for people on here as I can. Now, I figure that maybe I will try and extend that to myself a little more. This time last year I could barely make it through a week sober. Today is 265 Days (plus I agree with the people on here that say we should get extra credit during the pandemic. And I'm still doing it : ) IWNDWYT",7

I’ve never drank every day (until now), but I’d always overdo it or jump at any opportunity of alcohol, and I started really young, probably about 12-13. I’m a 20 year old female now if that helps. 

For the last month I’ve been wasted every day. I used to be drunk about twice a week when COVID started and I’d see my boyfriend, but now we’ve broken up and all of my friends are at school now so I sit in my room and drink. 

I know this scenario isn’t really that bad but I’m worried about myself because I don’t see this stopping as I’ve been trying to stop/limit myself and I really just can’t right now. I don’t know if rehab would be smart because again I haven’t been in this exact cycle for long but I don’t want it to get too far. 

I’ve been googling, but I can’t seem to find a direct answer.. What are some good resources for my situation? I’m not sure that therapy would help, but would outpatient rehab be smarter? I’m getting tired of this already and I’ve seen what alcoholism has done to a lot of people in my family unfortunately and I really don’t want that to be me. 

So, I guess I’d just like to know if there are any resources available that I haven’t look into yet. Thanks in advance!",9

She said ‘sure, but I will not be drinking anymore’.

Thank god for that. I could’ve broken my streak and woken up feeling dirty and foggy today.
Instead I had a nice morning where I went on a walk and rode my bike.

No desire to drink, having a very good, happy, pleasant day. Then around 6PM my stupid alcoholic brain starts saying ''today was such a fun and happy day, why not get drunk tonight to end this good day with a bang?''  So I give in and buy a lot of vodka and get really drunk, listening to music and posting embarrassing nonsense on Facebook. Now, all hungover.

Clearly, I should have been thankful for a very good day and ended it with tea or sparkling water. That way it still would have been a great day, with no regrets and no misery.",8

Now I am sober about to turn 30 and have two kids. I’m so happy to be alive, I’m worried I won’t have enough time to do all things I want to do. There are so many hikes, trips, bike rides, swims and movie nights I want to do with my loved ones. Taking drinking out of the equation really opened up my life. Before I had tunnel vision and all I cared about was the next time I was getting drunk. 

After the birth of my first child 2.5 years ago my drinking slowed was down but I was still always thinking about the next time I could drink to get drunk responsibly without having to worry about my daughter. So I know moderation won’t work for me. Maybe I won’t be drinking everyday but I will always be thinking when I can drink next. No more mental gymnastics and I love it. Iwndyt",28

Here I am. Again. I feel like I’ve “tried” so many times that there’s no use in even attempting again. I just poured out the beer and took out the recycling to try and erase the memories and the substance. Seems like for the thousandth time. There is so much guilt and shame in my head right now, I just want to pull out some more and drink and drink and drink. I want to be anywhere but here, in my body and mind. I’m willing to destroy everything in my existence to get there, apparently. 

I called out of work because of a “fever” yesterday (after calling out almost once a month for the last few) and somehow got saved by a coworker taking my shift and I just gave up completely and started drinking again. And then sleeping. And then drinking. My body finally had enough after a few beers and made me sick. Couldn’t even do that right! Damn. I’m almost sure I’m fired this time around. I already feel like the biggest piece of shit for being unreliable. And lying, constantly. I need this job, for the money and for something to do. But alcohol doesn’t care about that! I’ve basically ruined another job too. Somehow didn’t get fired after a lot of bullshit because a) I have skills that are hard to find and b) I was friends with the boss. I’m hoping my skills and my personality willl salvage this job as well. I don’t know. 

It’s just a continuing cycle though. Fall down, repercussions, repent, the memory fades, and I’m back to boozing. Even if I do lost this job, and I’m putting it out to the universe that I won’t, I don’t know if it’ll stop me. I literally do not know what will/would. I’ve dodged a bunch of DUIs and gotten into a fender bender and that only stopped me for a bit. I’ve tried to commit suicide via OD while drunk, and that only stopped me for a bit. 

I had a really important surgery that was somewhat predicated on my health (duh) and mental health and I went to one preop appointment clearly hungover, could barely abstain in the week before then surgery, and started back up as soon as possible after. Then didn’t care for myself very much after which altered the results. 

There have been so many of these incidents and cycles I’ve honestly given up. The fucked up part is I don’t know if I even want to stop. There are so many damn negatives but the very few positives seem to win out. I honestly don’t want to be here, in my body and mind, and booze gives me an escape. I’ve lost so much in my life that the pain makes me want to drink to forget. There is so much uncertainty and pain in my life that the certainty of getting drunk is a solace. I am so lonely, and now isolating, that drinking brings out the social in me and helps me “connect” (falsely I know). I’d do anything to not feel all this, so I just drink my face off and hope for the best. 

Or the worst. I don’t know. It’s for sure become a form of self harm. Absolutely self sabotage. Like if I drink and lose more than I have more reason to drink? That’s fucked up. It’s proof positive that people don’t like me and I lose everything and that nothing good happens and that I have no reason to even try. I’ve created my own hell, I’m living in it, and it’s known and therefore somewhat comfortable, so I’m not driven to get out. Maybe? 

I’ve wasted so much of my life to alcohol. It eats at me. I can’t really get past it. And yet I waste more. I used to be fit and smart and driven. I’ve thrown all of that to alcohol. I used to follow my own morals. Tossed that to alcohol too. The lies haunt me. I know I have some willpower in there. But I fail to use it/be able to use it in this situation. It’s baffling. 

The dark thoughts are coming back. My depression is definitely rearing it’s ugly head. I know I’m making it worse with drinking. Don’t seem to care about that either. Cutting for release is starting to sound appealing, it’s almost long sleeve season. The pile of pills I have are starting to call to me. I’ve put them out of sight, but not out of mind apparently. I’ve lost a good friend to all of this bullshit and she was my main support. I don’t really have anyone to talk to. 

Yes I’m in therapy. Yes my Dr knows, some of it. Yes I’m in some very small form of IOP online. I haven’t tried meetings in a while. I have so many quit-lit books it’s not even funny, and yes I read them. I come on here and read and respond and post. I do try a bit. But I get back to maybe I don’t want to succeed? It’s backwards and baffling. And also it seems that the more involved I get in being active in sobriety the more I want to go back out and drink. Wtf?

I’m lost. I’m scared. I’m alone. And I don’t know what to do or how to get motivated or how to make it stick :(",9

Starting tomorrow (4 months + 1 day), this will be the longest I've gone without drinking since I was 21. Went for 4 months once in 2016, desperately trying to make it to 6 months, but now I'm not planning an end-point, if I ever have one, and I'm feeling so much better about it. Thinking about starting drinking honestly makes me feel sad. So why start again?

I somehow made it through three years of college without drinking - people were always asking me why I wasn't drinking with them, but I never told them that I thought drunk people acted like sloppy idiots, and I didn't want to be like them. You know, it doesn't change too much when you're not drinking as an adult, lol. (Trying my best not to be pious about it this time, though. I want to feel good about myself because I'm awesome, not because I've made myself feel like I'm better than others.) 

But I still really hated drinking. It made people not present, say thoughtless things, be clumsy, rude and unapologetic. I think one day, I just caved and felt like I needed to be a part of this thing that everyone else seemed to be. The initial novelty was fun, but it became less and less enjoyable as the years went on, and just became kind of a thing I did that started to have a tighter and tighter grip on me. I discovered boxed wine, and started drinking waaay more than I felt comfortable with, but it started to become an escape from my anxiety and ADHD, and all the terrible shit happening around me at the time.

A tornado hit my house and ripped the roof off like opening a tin can in 2015. That storm brought a record number of tornados to Texas that year. So much so, it was actually referenced in a nationally-released textbook of mine that I was reading a few weeks ago. I was like, ""Hey, I was in a textbook-level disaster! Neat...?"" I had to wear a raincoat and use an umbrella to get around the house the first 6 weeks before the roof got repaired - so many houses destroyed that year, we got put in a waiting list to get ours fixed. It rained every day for months. The floor was littered with dozens and dozens of bowls, pots, pans and every concave surface in the house, all always full to the brim and needing to get dumped out from catching vigorous leaks all day and night. The first day, there was water coming out of my ceiling fan, destroying my bed and soaking everything in my bedroom. I slept on the (very not comfortable) sleeper sofa for months in the only unaffected room in the house. Wine became an escape for me, and it became an escape I just became so comfortable with, even after the disaster ended. Because there's always going to be that next uncomfortable time, that next difficult liminal space that alcohol helps numb the pain of, but also numbs everything else with it.

The last time I took a sober 4 months off was in 2016, and it was the hardest fucking thing. But that was after having a default 1-2 bottles of wine at parties habit, a habit of being one of those people I found myself so annoyed by in college. This four months was a challenge the first month, but it has only gotten easier as time has passed. I even dumped several bottles of liquor down the sink, and gave my favorite brand of whiskey away to a dear friend. Though, it was literally, like, $150/bottle, and there was a quarter left and he just downed it in a few gulps. Welp, that's fine, I suppose, lol.

I think finally getting medicated for my anxiety and ADHD has made a huuuuuge difference in me feeling like the grip alcohol has had on me the last 5-6 years has released. Seriously, find a highly-rated psychiatrist on Yelp in your area, and let your life be better through chemistry. (If you can't make your own neurotransmitters, store-bought is fine.) I'm out of working in minimum wage retail, and I'm also out of my parents' house, living with an amazing partner and back in school to become a surgical tech, where I'm kicking ass. I also did a Whole90 (a Whole30, but 90 days instead of 30, because why not?) a few months ago, which is where the not-drinking began. Gave up dairy, grains and sugar too, because they made me feel bleh, so I'm feeling fan-fucking-tastic now.

I really don't miss drinking so far. I even socially-distanced hung out with a big group of my normal very goth/nihilist drinking, smoking, etc. (*ahem*) friends, and they were all doing all the things, and I was just so happy to be around those hilarious knuckleheads for the first time in 6 months. One friend even checked in with me to make sure I was doing okay, since they knew I was doing the sober thing. I was really proud of myself for focusing on the good things in life, and not being nostalgic for drinking, a thing that ranged from not really being that great, to mostly just making me miserable.

I read somewhere once that addiction can start from a fear of a loss of connection or alienation from loved ones. When I was out with my friends, and alcohol started to call my name, trying to focus on the connection really helped - the funny jokes, the stuuupid puns, the fun-poking, the heartwarming, intimate stories. And at home, I try to focus on the good stuff too - my endlessly supportive partner and the fun times we have, and the heart-to-heart texts from my friends (many of whom struggle with substances themselves) to tell me how proud they are of me for doing so well, and how far I've come, and how much ass I'm kicking now.

I like how this chapter is going so far.  Don't miss the closed chapters.  Alcohol had a lot of negatives and no positives.  The biggest surprise is I am perfectly happy in my own skin and don't need alcohol.  For the most part I started drinking too much to try and calm down from being totally stressed out from work.  Bad answer.  Never was physically addicted.  It was like a bad habit.  Then was in a rut.  Alcohol keeps people in rut.  Had to dump the booze to get out of the rut.  Feeling great.  Have a good day people!  IWNDWYT,5

I feel like I'm looking into a broken mirror, which gives me false feedback on reality.","Some time ago I had to let go one of my potential clients, simply because the woman was too difficult to work with. I wished her all the best nonetheless, honestly. I felt bad about how I had to withdrawn and stop, seeing how bad things were going. I still stand by this decision today, I can't imagine us cooperating peacefully.

Today I could see what she created with another designer she found - and it's in some ways better, and in some ways worse than what I could've done, as expected. For some reasons it shook me, however. I think it spoke to my deepest, most insecure core. And it woke something up.

I became really mad with insecurities, despite having other clients and a stable work as a designer in agency on top of that. I literally have no reasons to feel hurt by this situation, if anything, I'm glad she found someone to help her do whatever she wants to do. I really felt guilty by leaving her, so there is some heavy burden falling off my chest seeing she's doing alright.

But the feeling of being replaced, no matter what the circumstances, made me feel really... replaceable. There is some freedom, but also some angry, underachieving aching in this.

I'm glad I could put it down here. I want it out of my head. I don't want to be upset, I don't want to feel trapped. I don't want to feel it's something so beyond me, that only something other beyond me (alcohol) can calm it down. I want to feel grateful that this woman found the designer she was looking for. I want to find back my strength and inspiration and continue on with my day. I still have something to do.

I hope some of you can feel understood by me when I say it doesn't matter whether you're replaceable or not. To some you are, to some you're not, to some it's not even the right question to be asking.

I’ll be twenty days sober tomorrow. It hasn’t been easy but I feel like I’m starting to embrace this new normal. 

The other day I spotted some non-alcoholic beer at my grocery store and thought I’d give it ago. I’ve had O’Douls before but was never really a fan. This time I picked up Coors Edge and it was surprisingly good. So much so that I drank it pretty quickly and wanted another immediately after, which I abstained from.

Part of me felt strangely guilty for drinking a harmless “beer.” Part of me worried it might trigger me into wanting the real thing (it didn’t). The biggest part doesn’t like how quickly I drank it and the immediacy in which I wanted the next. I worry those are troublesome signs.

Anyway, all that to say I probably won’t be drinking NA beers for a while, which is a bummer because I really do Iove beer. I was excited to have some...but perhaps too excited. I don’t want to let anything threaten my sobriety, this included.

I don't have much to contribute this week as most of my media consumption has been shallow escapism. I make no apologies for this, but the fact of the matter is that it gives me nothing to recommend.

I haven't put in a plug for Judith Grissell's *Never Enough* in a long while so I want to throw that one out there. If you're newly sober or thinking of getting sober and want to know like, what the fuck happened to your poor brain to make it where sobriety is now this pretty difficult thing to achieve, well, check it out. It's my personal favorite addiction book. It's about the neuroscience of addiction written by a neuroscientist who herself is an addict. It's not written to guide you into sobriety so much as other books like *This Naked Mind* or *Alcohol Lied to Me* are, but for me it really helped me feel better about having become addicted and still to this day helps me remain vigilant against trying out having a drink here or there. 

You guys who've been around a while will remember me gushing about this book in this post week after week for several months. It really was **that** helpful to me.

Everyone have a great rest of your week and share with everyone what you've been reading, watching, or listening to that is helping you through sobriety. Or just 2020. **",16
2020-09-21 23:29:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ixfry5/my_brothers_problem/,my brothers problem :(,"(I'm sorry this is so long) 
my brother (26) and I (19) both live with my parents. when my brother was about 20 he would go out and have an occasional beer and hang out ect. no harm done. The problems arise when his relationship of 4 years fell apart. He started combating his depression and heartbreak with drinks with the boys. Even then, he wouldn't get too wasted and it wouldn't be every day. 

things sped up a little the past 2-3 years when he started drinking everyday with his friends and would come home suicidal and depressed. the problem is, when he would be sober the next day he wouldn't believe me when I told him about the state that he was the night prior. obviously he probably forgot because of how innebreated he was. I didn't really have a problem with his drinking until the past month. 

there would be nights when he'd come home and get angry, feel bad about his past relationships, and start spiraling into a rabbit hole of self hate and suicidal thoughts. two nights ago things really got serious.

he went out to his friends house where supposedly he had fallen over and hit his head while he was drunk. his friends dropped him home at 12 am when he called me to open the door for him. I come outside to see him passed out two houses down the street on the driveway of my neighbors. when I woke him up he began crying and furiously yelling about how much he's not worthy of living and how much he wants to die. I try helping him up and walking him back to our place, when he slips out of consciousness. I'm not the strongest person and I was struggling to take him back home. after repeated attempts of me helping him walk, he pushes me away and after two steps, he falls flat on the ground again. after about an hour of him crying, yelling, and passing out, I finally get him inside. my parents are asleep In their room and I'm terribly worried. I feel the need to wake them up or call an ambulance but I don't out of fear tht I'm just panicked for no reason and he'll be okay. I set him down on a couch downstairs and that's when he stops breathing. I try waking him up, pinching, slapping him and nothing works. I check his breathing and it has stopped. I check his heartrate and i feel nothing. this is when I begin to do CPR in hopes of reviving my brother. he wakes up for a few moments, asks where he is, and then slips out of consciousness repeatedly. he begins having spasms (siezure like) and at this point I'm very afraid and I'm panicking. he mumbles to take him to his room and after dragging him up the stairs (it's about 2 am now) I take him to his room and put him in the recovery position. his breathing becomes normal and he falls asleep. 


today (9/21/2020) he seems really out of it. he reports headaches and feeling a bit dizzy. he still goes to work and drives about 30 mins to get there. he's lost all will to live. it pains me to see my brother like this and when I try to talk to him he doesn't care what I have to say. he doesnt want to go to therapy. he wants death. hes a functioning alcoholic and he's beginning to make really bad decisions. 

being his 19 yr old brother idk where else to turn to. I just wanted to put this out there just In case anyone has some advice. my parents are not aware of how bad  he can get and mental health is kind of a taboo topic. 

I really thought I was going to lose my brother that night. he drunkenly mumbled to me that he couldn't breathe and how he feels  that I should let him go. his eyes rolled to the back of his head and it has scarred me. he has a doctor's physical on Thursday and I'm hoping he'll tell the doctor the truth about his state.

I was never much of a drinker until hitting a big rut in life (losing my job for unrelated reasons) and being stuck in a horribly abusive relationship.

I take responsibility for my actions, no one made me drink and it was a poor, poor coping mechanism.  The facade of happiness, ""escaping"", and being able to fall asleep quickly/easily were my justifications.   

I'm trying to keep telling myself that even though alcohol makes me feel better in the moment, it is a catalyst to my bad moments.   That I will be happier and healthier after giving up for good.  

I'm kind of disappointed I've had to repeat this to myself today like a mantra.  I didn't realize how much of my time and thoughts are spent on drinking.

Now I won't be 100% sure for a couple days, but based on how I was right before I got sober, I'd say that the cold medicine is behind this.

I was never the drinker who woke up with a shot, or simply HAD to have it, but 80% of the time that I did partake, the melting away of anxiety and negative emotions along with a hand to mouth fixation that kept me smoking for years in the past almost always caused me to drink rapidly and blackout.    


After about 3 drinks I can be the best date you've ever been on. Suddenly nervousness and insecurities are gone and I can become the person who all my friends who know me soberly have so come to enjoy. But often times, this would lead to more drinking and I'm left the next day puzzled as to why loved ones and friends were upset with me. It wasn't uncommon for me to never get to know just what I did or said.  


Once on a date with a most interesting man years ago my belligerence became increasingly apparent. Later in evening after some time he wanted to sleep. I instead stood at my window sill and rambled about things I could not recall later and once he slept I put on his shirt ( we were dressed similarly) and proceeded to smoke cigarettes (a vice I kicked some time ago) in his shirt. He seemed annoyed about this the next day and rightfully so. 

&#x200B;

There are tens of similar stories to this one, but the one which lead me to this decision was what I can only describe as a beautiful love story with pages removed by my drinking, Neither of us were perfect, but the chemistry and the emotions were there. It was more than enough for me to fight for. Love is never easy and usually these difficulties can be resolved through sometimes uncomfortable conversations. In my case they tended to come out irrationally, and fear-driven. It simply wasn't me.  

&#x200B;

My last conversation with this person was collectively about a half hour of which I only remember one line. ""you're drunk right now aren't you?"" I can only assume we were talking about my drinking's role in the ending of things. Even through the black out I felt embarrassed. I lied to someone I cared for when the situation was so blatantly obvious. That was the breaking point. 

&#x200B;

In my time in the service industry drinking was a rite of passage for servers, bartenders, and really anyone who was of the legal drinking age (and some who were not). When given the choice between heading home to deal with issues or unhappiness there and heading to an oasis of escapism, even if only temporarily, I almost always chose the latter. I was usually pretty adamant on driving home no matter my state and in 2018 I got a DUI. Only just now has the dust fully cleared on my state supervision, a long and arduous process. 

&#x200B;

My life was already going in a great direction so I am absolutely excited with how this decision will 

So here's to having my charms, my persona, come out naturally over time rather than with chemical aide. Here's to no more unexplained injuries and wracking my brain over what exactly happened on a given night. Here's to remembering my memories. 

&#x200B;

And oh ya, don't you shit on me if you see me out with a mock-tail

TL;DR  Just a few of the ways alcohol was ruining my happiness and cost me the love of my life.

Most people burst with pride when they know they are - they get an award, are recognized by their peers, or just have that inner flow of one who is ""different."" I thank God that I know my difference - I know my brain reacts differently to drugs and alcohol. The demons of irrationality, impulsivity, and irresponsibility are loosed and overcome all that is good in my life when I use. The benefit of all this is easy to recognize. I know which poisons to avoid - and if I choose to commit slow (or rapid) suicide, I know that's just what it is because the outcome of chemical use for me will be death. If it were just my demise, that would be bad enough, but I'll make plenty of other people suffer in the process. Who with good sense wants to be a suicidal social time bomb? Not me - I'd rather be ""normal."" Since I can't be ""normal,"" (my chromosomes won't let me) I'll ""just"" be sober, and will give myself the award of one clean day at a time.

I was cleaning out a box of some old things I have of my dad's the other day and found a note tucked in between family photos, report cards, and newspaper clippings. It was a note he had written in January of 1982, at the age of 33 (same age I am now) on one of his visits to rehab. My dad was a doctor, a thrill seeker, beloved by his coworkers and patients and a hard man for his family to love despite their best attempts. It was the only sign in this box otherwise filled with accomplishments and milestones of the sickness that would eventually take his life. Everything else was a testament to his potential and all the great things he did, but this was bigger than all of that. I spent a lot of my life angry at my dad for things he did even during his years of sobriety from drugs and alcohol, but still maintaining those compulsions of addiction that find their way in if you're not careful. I'm still figuring out my own relationship with alcohol. I know I'm happier without it, and for now I'm on day 2 of deciding to abstain through the rest of the year. For now I keep this note in a journal I use for nightly meditation as a reminder that this work is hard, and requires a lifetime of acknowledgement, showing up, and rolling up your sleeves.

I recently (2~ weeks ago) finally made the decision that enough is enough. I'm not that old, but I'm old enough that it will hurt me in the long run if I keep going the way I have.

I spoke out loud for the first time ever. I told a friend, a friend I trust and whose qualifications in the area will be of use to me, and asked their advice. I have been relatively sober since - I guess just saying things out loud has an affect - and I will be reaching out to a local organisation soon to find out what next steps might make the most sense in my situation.

I can’t wait until I can reach for a cup of tea at night instead of a beer and not have any cravings. I go through periods of daily drinking and then periods of just weekend drinking, but it is rarely just one or two drinks. Like I have seen on here, I don’t seem to have a signal that tells me to stop. I am making healthy changes in other aspects of my life as well: eating better with meal prep, exercise, meditation (just started the meditation and it’s so relaxing before bed). I downloaded a habit tracker app today to keep myself accountable but I feel like I need people to talk to about this before I tell my family. They most likely know about my above average drinking but I am not sure if they know the extent of it. I’m also away for school right now so I do deal with some homesickness that sometimes exacerbated my drinking. 
I was supposed to start my new rotation today but I couldn’t leave the bathroom. Luckily I was able to call in and blame it on something I ate. They were very understanding but I don’t want to lie again. I don’t drink during rotations, and this is the truth. I put myself into them and I make sure I sleep 8 hours depending on my schedule. But last night I had beers left in my fridge. I figured I would just drink them while I meal prepped so I wouldn’t have any left for when my rotation starts. I didn’t know or I just wouldn’t let myself acknowledge how many I actually had. 
I don’t want to wake up feeling like this anymore. I want my digestion to get back to normal. I want my skin to be more radiant and less red. I want the bloat and weight that has crept up and just ballooned me to melt off. I haven’t had any serious health issues yet but I know that it is only a matter of time.

I’ve struggled with the idea of celebrating/memorializing my sobriety as I’ve never felt like I had a “problem” per se with alcohol. Indeed, I had in the past gone weeks, even a month here or there without drinking and never struggled to do so. But this feels different. This time, I’ve approached sobriety as a chance to truly look at my relationship with alcohol and decide if it’s making me happier, better. 

Like so many others, Covid/quarantine brought on a bit of a mental breakdown. Being home with my family 24/7, with zero alone time, I was relying heavily on alcohol to get me through, and those 5pm drinks kept starting earlier and earlier. One on particularly rough day when I couldn’t stop crying, I sent a trusted friend a long email detailing my mental state. She urged me to talk to a doctor and consider antidepressants.  

In May I started on prescription meds for depression and quit alcohol cold turkey. I don’t know what I can attribute to the not drinking and what I can attribute to the meds (prob a bit of both) but the past 5 months have left me literally feeling transformed. 

Physically, I’ve lost weight, my blood pressure is normal for the first time in I don’t even know how long. I used to say I had white coat syndrome and that’s why it would read high; I now realize that probably wasn’t true. Mentally, I have a clarity and confidence I’m not sure I’ve ever had before. I used to feel like I needed to get many opinions before making a big decision- this made me always feel like I was floating somewhat through life, like life just happened to me sometimes. Now I feel I can be purposeful and responsible for myself. I don’t even yet completely understand the shift, but I just feel like MYSELF. 

I went to visit family a couple weeks ago to celebrate my mom’s birthday. It was my first time being at home as an adult and not drinking. My parents are big wine people, so I thought this might be difficult. It wasn’t; I had the best time at home I’ve had in years because I felt fully present, I wasn’t escaping into alcohol to be funnier, more charming, carefree. I could just BE and that was enough. Stranger still, I had a sip of wine (like really good wine $$) to toast at dinner and I didn’t even like it. Objectively excellent wine didn’t even do anything for my tastebuds. 

I don’t even know where I’m going with this. I just needed to share. I thought alcohol was so central to my identity, and it turns out it just isn’t. In fact, it obscured my identity. I think back to what I needed it for and it makes me sad- I thought I needed it to be brave or vulnerable, to make men like me, to be sexy, to be clever, to make friends. None of that was ever true and if anything alcohol actually impeded many of those efforts. 

So now, I want to see myself and my life clearly, soberly. I don’t want my life to be such that I need a drink to “take the edge off.” Life is meant to have some edges, no? Maybe you can dull them with booze but they still exist, you still have to deal them one way or another. Mostly, I want to live a life that is intentional and I want to be present for it. 

So friends, wherever you are in your journey, I salute you. And IWNDWYT!",16

A went from a functional alcoholic to nonfunctional in one day.  I rage quit my job of 12 years.  I started my career at the bottom of this company and didn't stop until I hit the top.  I thought everything would be so great once I hit that top spot.  I hated it.  Drinking until I passed out every night. 

Eventually, I started having a drink at lunch to help the afternoons go by.  Then one awful morning as I'm shaking with anxiety and the hangover from the night before with only 30 minutes left on the clock before i had to walk through the door, I had an idea.  If I have a drink, I'll feel better!  Genius!  Well it worked.  Eventually one in the morning and one at lunch wouldn't stop the shakes so I had to drink at work. 

They knew.  How could they not?  I thought I was hiding it well, but looking back at it sober?  They knew.  I still did my job, no one said anything, but I was miserable.  Stuck. 

There were many days I thought of packing my shit and leaving, but I was scared of change.  Then the day came, another fight, another thing blamed on me that wasn't my fault, more work that I don't get paid for.  (I get paid piecework, not hourly)  And I left.  Just walked the hell out.

It was pretty awesome at first, not gonna lie.  I just sat at home and drank and watched The Price Is Right.  I hadn't not had a job since I was 14.  I could do whatever I wanted!  So many possibilities! 

I didn't do shit.  I just drank until my pancreas gave up.  Went to the hospital, got fixed up, waited a few weeks and back to normal drinking.  After drinking through my 7 year olds birthday (single dad) so i didn't shake in front of my parents and 2 more pancreatitis flares, I decided I had to do something.  I was going to die. 

I moved some stuff to my parents and tried to taper.  Yeah, that didn't work AT ALL.  Just weeks of misery until I'd give up and buy a bottle and finally feel better.  For a few hours.  I had to go to the next level. 

I showed up to rehab and blew a .24 and felt perfectly fine.  Walking, talking, hell I would've driven there without even thinking.  It makes me cringe with shame to think of all the times I thought I was fine and drove.  Thank God I never hurt anyone.  I just got lucky. 

Sorry this is so long, it felt nice to write it.  I'm 98 days sober today.  

Nice to meet you guys.",23

My family members are struggling hard with the state of the world and it feels like my own anxiety is just begging for the release that drinking brings. I don’t know what I’m looking for here...

Finally had my rock bottom moment. Or enough of one for a wake up call. I’ve been a few beers maybe a shot or 2 after work drinker for years. 

When COVID happened and I started working from home I found it so easy to grab an airplane bottle here or there, started lying to my wife, hiding shooters, making excuses to leave the house. Etc. Wife found a bunch of empty shooter bottles and here we are. I was probably up to about 10 drinks a day, some strong schnapps shooters and some beer or seltzer’s. 

I hate drinking. Have no idea why or how I would do this to myself and just figured I’d stop when I had enough. Alcoholism 101 right?? lol

So 12 hours in and I’m feeling ok. Some light shakes and BP is a little high but sugars are ok. I bought a BP monitor and a glucose tester and we’ll test every few hours today. Gonna go see my PCP in the morning, appointment is set. I know cold turkey is not the suggested way to do this but my wife his a recovering drinker, and knows the worst stuff to watch for.

I have been a casual drinker for 10 years now. I realized that I would associate drinking and getting drunk with having fun about 6 years ago. After that realization, I significantly stopped my drinking and I only drank in moderation. I started drinking casually at home with dinners about 1 year ago. That has turned into me drinking almost every night. I typically only drink wine or beer, but I could drink a whole bottle of wine or 2 by myself. I recently started having intense GERDS/acid reflux and I know it’s coming from the drinking. I don’t really get drunk though. I just drink a lot and I feel kind of normal. My tolerance has definitely increased. I started mixing sleeping pills or narcotics with my drinking on certain occasions so I could get a buzz. I haven’t drank anything in 2 days. I do have a little headache, but I’m mostly just really sad. I didn’t think I had a problem, until the acid reflux got bad. At that point I realized I’m drinking so much and it’s physically making me sick. I’m still young, so I believe the damage can be reversed if I start eating better and leave drinking behind. Does anyone have any advice for me? The idea of giving up drinking entirely scares me, but I can’t just drink in moderation, I always want more.

10 tips to make it happen that all really work and drive positive change to slow or reverse aging and to stop DRINKING:
1) Intermittent Fasting: Get to 16/8 and then aim for 18/6 and then 20/4. Eat clean fruits, veggies and protein in your window. Be smart with breaking your fast (nuts, eggs, bone broth, etc)
2) Yoga: 15–20 mins per day. Imperative. YouTube and your iPhone. No excuses.
3) Vitamix: Infinite fruit & Vegetable and protein powder combinations. Get a large Swell travel bottle and make them to go when you are on the run.
4) Lemons: One per day. Research it. Use that Vitamix. Massive health benefits. Chock full of vitamins and antioxidants ranking them among the healthiest fruits on the planet.
5) Ginger: Grate into club soda. Curb your inflammation enthusiasm. The primary bioactive component in ginger, a root that was originally found in China, is gingerol. The main benefit of gingerol, from a physical health perspective, is its demonstrable anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which are capable of helping prevent or fight off a wide variety of infections and threats to the human immune system.
6) CrossFit: Variable functional fitness incorporating elements from high-intensity interval training, Olympic weightlifting, plyometrics, powerlifting, gymnastics, mobility, calisthenics, strongman, and many other exercises. Join your local CrossFit gym. Also, Chalk Performance Training posts 4–5 great workouts daily for very reasonable annual fees for those that want to workout from home powered by the Wodify App. Keep moving and stop aging.
7) Floss, Brush, mouthwash: Dental hygiene is imperative with your engine (heart) only 8 inches away.
8) Nuts: Good fats, Magnesium & vitamin E, and protein. Nothing not to like here. Try them with avocado oil and pink Himalayan salt for the ultimate healthy combination that radiates magnificent deliciousness.
9) Back sleeping: Not easy but worth it. It helps to prevent back pain and can even reduce acid reflux and facial wrinkles. When you sleep on your back it can help to keep your head, neck and spine aligned and in a neutral position. Benefits to hips and internal organs are numerous.
10) Sugar is just plain bad for you: Avoid white sugar, corn syrup, and processed wheat at all costs. Get your sugar from fruit and natural honey. Excess sugar’s impact on obesity and diabetes is well documented, but one area that may surprise many men is how their taste for sugar can have a serious impact on their heart health.

How I Dealt,"I learned something this weekend, and I figured I would share with all my sober friends. (Promise this is drinking related, bear with me) 

Twice this weekend someone upset me because they didn’t want to upset someone else. I can’t believe this is a thing, and I can’t believe I’ve never noticed it- but my mind is a lot clearer these days! 

On Saturday night, my business partner brought me into a situation that I really didn’t need to be brought into. Normally I am fine being called “after hours” but I am on vacation this week, so it was kind of annoying. I asked her why she couldn’t just call our employee and get to the bottom of it, and she said “I didn’t want to aggravate him” 

I thought to myself “so you’re ok with irritating me instead?” and then of course just fixed the problem, as usual. 

Last night, my significant other went out with friends. I knew there would be a lot of drinking, but I asked him not to do shots because when he drinks liquor he keeps me up all night snoring etc. I asked that he stick to beers. Well, he didn’t. He drank liquor. He kept me up all night. This morning I asked why he couldn’t just oblige to my (what I consider) reasonable request, and he said “I didn’t want to be rude to the people buying shots” 

My mind went to “but you’re ok keeping me up and being rude to me, got it”

Well my friends, if sobriety has taught me anything, it’s that I need to put myself first to be successfully sober. It’s clear to me that I have made it easy for people in my life to upset me in lieu of others in theirs, but not anymore. I believe I used to just drink when people would aggravate me, or put too much on my plate, or disrespect me.. but I’m not going to allow it moving forward. 

So I have spoken to both my business partner and my significant other. 

I made it clear that I am not going to be “okay” with them aggravating me/being rude to me, to save grace with others. I think I did a good job at communicating and setting my new boundaries. I am really grateful that I was able to identify this potential “trigger” and I am actually excited to continue to stand up for myself when the situation warrants it. Another proud sober moment to add to the ever growing list!

That is one of the reasons I like yoga so much.  There is no mastering it.  There is only practicing it.  Life is like that.

Accomplishments along the way are certainly like that, but there is no stopping point when it comes to life, except, of course, at the very end.  Until then, though, there is always the chance to  improve.  Through constant improvement we can seek perfection.  It is possible but unlikely, which I guess is what drives us all here.  To keep striving for betterment and mastery in life.  As life keeps going, so to do our efforts.

I quit drinkin' 3 weeks ago. I didn't have any rock-bottom and my life wasn't necessarily revolving around my habit. But I noticed how, over time, I had been drinkin' consistently every day.   


During the beginning of Covid spreading in the United States, my mentality was to buy as much booze as I could and ""wait it out"". Over a couple months I began to feel a little... uneasy with how many bottles there were in my recycling every month and began to acknowledge that I was drinking about a six pack every night. That was fucked. I originally had never gotten hangovers in my life but the last couple months I just wasn't feeling so hot in the morning. Same typical optimism in the mornings- *I'll take a couple nights off, maybe I should think about quitting again*\- and was amazed how much my mind changed around 5-6 PM.  


I woke remotely and have long before the pandemic. Because of this I know my habit was a lot easier to manage being as that I just had to comb my hair before jumping onto a Zoom call but otherwise could feel foggy and slow most of the day. 

One thing that really annoys me with drinking so much damn beer was how late I would be up. I would start drinking around 8 or so and would consciously tell myself no more past 1AM but that meant I was going to bed until 2 at the earliest. Not to mention how fucked-up my sleep was because of going to bed every night hazy. 

Big part of this I know was that I couldn't go to the gym or do things I normally would in the Before Times. I was getting out of shape and losing mass quickly. I'm not a gym rat by any stretch but have consistently been a 3-4 times a week guys for years. Not having that exercise regiment in my life sincerely ate at me and it's too real how much my physical took a toll on my mental, and vice versa.

I woke up pretty close to a hangover 3 Saturdays ago. Said, ""fuck it"" and didn't buy a six pack that day. And the next day. And the next day. Found out that my gym had re-opened (albeit with masks and headcount limits and, iunno man the whole thing does kind of concern me slightly but not enough to dive back in, head-first). The timing could not have been anymore perfect: I've been waking up by 8AM every morning (my company is PST-based so I usually was waking up 5 minutes before 11AM on weekdays).   


Every morning I get myself good to go and get in and out of the gym by 9:30. I'm eating so much better and find myself so, so, so much more able to just do those damn things that only take 5 minutes. Dishes in the sink? I just do them. Cleaning up my apartment? It's enjoyable. I derive so much pleasure these last few weeks in how much I can get done in a day before a reasonable hour and getting to bed early so that I can get a head start the next morning.

One thing that helps me is spending time in the mornings in a custom Notion doc I've setup for writing down daily thoughts, keeping track of my finances and fitness, as well as notes on anything work-related. I could go on and on about the ways t's helped me think about the future of my career but that's an entirely different post, I think. But overall, it's that mindfulness that I'm after here. Keeping a document for myself has been crucial.

Among other musical leanings, I'm a vinyl DJ and am very serious about my musical curation. I was gigging around here in Philadelphia before everything shut down but, as always, have always spent a considerable amount of time spinning with myself in my apartment for fun and to take notes on what works with others, etc etc. And man, I would get pretty toasted on the weekends- and some weekdays, too- just sitting and cutting up records. My biggest concern from last time not drinkin' was that there was.a period where the things I did when fucked up just didn't interest me as much when I wasn't fucked up. That was really scary. But it went away. I can't necessarily say that my music or DJing has become more focused or clear without booze, because I honestly don't see a difference, other than the fact that I can enjoy these things in my life in a much more healthy way. 

Not for nothing but I got out the abacus and did the math and came to the very real conclusion that I was spending about 300 dollars a month on beer to get fucked up on every month. That's in pandemic times- factor in how much I was getting started at the bar 5-6 nights a week before coming home to drink even more and you can safely add about 200 dollars to that number. Aye, I'm fortunate to have a job where I could get away with that and not have to sweat too hard but jesus christ that's a lot of money. It's a lot of money. A lot.

I started this routine on Sunday mornings where I pick out one dozen records from my crates and just do a live, straight-to-tape, no-post-production in one-take. I don't pick any of them ahead of time, only after I hit record. It's a very strange thing for me, spinning in the morning, but it's something I always thought about doing when I was drunk. And that's the main thing, man- when I'm drunk I spend a lot of time considering things and these ""brilliant ideas"" that I should do and just write them down or compose these incomprehensible notes in my phone to follow up on later but- surprise!- never did. But I did on Sunday and I'm really glad that it happened. 

Last thing I want to touch on here is how I'm genuinely just more personable not being drunk every night. If my mom or my girlfriend or anyone calls after 8PM, it's a groan and an inconvenience and I seldom pick it up. As someone who has had parents who both in their very different ways have had extensive and destructive relationships with entirely too much beer in their life, I was always really aware of when I would sound fucked up. The answer to that was just to not pick up the phone. That obviously affected my relationships and just to be brief: I'm glad I don't have to have that moral measurement in my life anymore. 

Oh, my face looks better. I don't watch porn and jerk off daily when I'm not drunk (in fact I haven't turned on porn since I stopped drinking, what a coincidence, huh). I'm in a better place. I should probably take this peak of motivation that comes with these kinds of elevations and have that conversation with myself about my relationship with tobacco, too- but for now I'm pretty happy to say  don't think about beer anymore and my life is a lot more interesting and fulfilling because of it.

I really respect y'all and have always appreciated this sub, for years. Even when I was still under the spell. You all give me a lot of hope and I truly feel like this is one of the most compassionate places in the wasteland of misery that sometimes represents the internet. Thanks for all you share, and thanks for reading this novel, if you've even made it this far. Appreciate you all immensely.",144

2020-09-21 11:33:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ix2ona/one_year_today/,One Year Today,"Today marks one year since my last drink.

Both my father (30+ years, forget exactly) and my wife (5 years) are in sobriety. My mom asked me a few months ago how I would want to celebrate one year, and I told her I did not want to. Every year for my father and my wife we have a little celebration on the anniversary, but I am not interested in that. Honestly, the fact I shouldn't drink is just frustrating to me. I work as a professional in the outdoor industry, where post run/ride/climb beers are the norm. I am happy to be a sober athlete/guide. I am stoked to be an advocate for sober boating and climbing (drinking while participating in these activities is common, and there need to me more advocates for not whitewater boating while drinking. Alcohol has no responsible place on Class V whitewater). But really, it's also just a bummer to not be able to participate in what is a very universal part of the professional outdoor industry.

But still, I have stuck to the promise I made myself and my wife/future family one year ago. And each day, I continue to not drink. Even when my friends are packing my favorite brews on amazing whitewater adventures, I stick it out. I just don't feel like celebrating it. Because while I understand it is an accomplishment, and I am really happy that I am doing it, it doesn't feel like a celebratory day to me. Maybe the bad feelings of one year ago are still to fresh and in a few years I will want to celebrate my sobriety with my family. But not this year.  


Thanks for not drinking with me today, folks.",40

2020-09-21 11:09:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ix28p7/acts_of_kindness_aok_monday_walking_away_from_the/,Acts of Kindness (AoK) Monday - Walking away from the fight,"Hi everyone!

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we check in about any AoK that we have participated in, received, witnessed, or heard about during the week which have touched us in some way. It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game.

I've had two incidents this past week that have gotten me thinking about the nature of my involvement in conflicts. One was a situation where I walked away from a fight that someone was trying to have. I was setting up an AA meeting, and a woman there got really upset with me for... trying to set up the meeting. So I moved the meeting into the other meeting room and I told her that she'd be welcome to join us in there. I didn't argue back. I had another option. I could let it go and let her have that room, and we would still be able to have the meeting, so I let it go.

It's not pleasant to be yelled at for no real reason, but I've been in meetings with her before, and I know that she has some other things going on beyond having a drinking problem. She's sober, and she's sincere about working on her recovery, but she is where she is. It wasn't about me, and I didn't have to take it personally, so I didn't. 

I very strongly believe that recovery should be available to anyone who wants it, and that made it a lot easier to know what to do. Having a meeting that feels safe and accessible for anyone who wants to attend is the priority for me. Having that as a clear goal made it a lot easier to see that I needed to let it go. I set the meeting up in the other room, she joined us shortly before the meeting started, and there wasn't any further conflict. We were still able to have a meeting where everyone was able to feel comfortable attending, and because I let go of my ego and desire to ""be right,"" she was able to feel comfortable attending too. That's important to me, that's something that I feel good about.

On the other side of the coin, I had another experience this week with someone who I'm pretty used to having high conflict interactions with. I didn't realize how much I was contributing to the situation until they stepped back and didn't give me anything to argue with. It is a situation where I have not consistently walked away from the fight, and I have not let go of my desire to ""be right."" I'm still holding onto my ego, and I'm still trying to control the outcome, and so the conflict continues. Reflecting on it, I can see how much I've risen to take the bait. It's not something that I'm particularly proud of, but it's an AoK to myself to recognize that I can change. I can be done having the fight and walk away.

Anyway, that's me for this week. I hope that you all are doing well. Does anyone else have any AoK they'd like to share?",26

2020-09-21 10:57:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ix20gk/its_time/,It’s time.,"Hi everyone! I have been lurking in this sub for about a year now. Specifically on a Sunday after blacking out and needing to not feel so alone. 

This weekend was the same old story of me drinking too much, blacking out, and feeling extremely anxious/depressed/embarrassed the next day. I’m a girl in my early 20s, a social drinker and just never know how to stop. I get so caught up with all of the excitement with my friends and just keep going and want everyone to have a blast together. 

I have been in this trap for years now. Countless embarrassing stories and nights I’ll never remember. Last weekend was the same. I cried to my mom and said it was time, and then the hangxiety I was feeling went away and this weekend I did it again. When I talked to her about it, she pointed out that I said I would stop last weekend. 

I always tell myself “you’re young, all your friends do it, you don’t have a problem” and my friends tell me that I don’t have a problem. 

But here’s the thing — no matter what anyone says or thinks I DO have a problem. Not remembering one night a week every week is a problem. My problem may look different than others, but everyone’s problems are different in their own ways. Nobody can tell me if I do or do not have a problem. Because feeling terrible, depressed, and full of self-loathing every Sunday and Monday is not normal. It’s a problem for me. 

I just wanted to put this out here and I wanted to ask if anyone has had the feeling of wanting to quit every Sunday-Tuesday but by the time the weekend rolls around your emotions are gone and you think it’s fine. Any tips would be greatly appreciated!",5

This past week I felt I'd had enough and made a plan to not drink on the weekend.

I got through the weekend without drinking. The first one in a long long while but hopefully the first of many. A couple of things I noticed about it:

-Waking up not hungover rules. Actually getting a decent sleep to enjoy my days off was awesome.

-I was insanely productive around the house and I think I was okay with my kids but this leads into my next point

-I think I would usually start drinking as I became frustrated with my day whether it was some household chore that sucked or the kids being whiny. I think it dulled out my level of frustration or boredom and now I'm sort of left with trying to figure out how to deal with it like an adult. Its difficult though I'm sure not impossible but I feel pretty stupid for getting so angry about a whiny child or a toddler that won't sleep. Or the fact that come around noon on Saturday I'm standing in the kitchen thinking like ""somethings missing"". I'm sure this will all get easier with time its just new to me now I guess or I have no way of dealing with it.

-I used to make sure that I would drink lots of water before I drank to try and compensate and now I'm gonna have to make sure I actually drink water.

-I think my wife was happier with me this way this weekend. Like in general she just seemed happier or I was just not drunk and she's always this happy and I just never noticed.

One thing I'm for sure concerned about is the fact that I always drink in social situations and I hope they won't be my downfall. I'll have to make a plan for that. I don't want to outright avoid socializing but I know whether I visit family or friends or go out for dinner with anyone Im going to feel a pressure to drink, likely mostly from myself.

Its been super helpful to come back and look at my own posts and things people have commented and also to read others posts on here daily. This community is an amazing resource it seems whether you only drink a bit like me or its more than that. Thanks for being here.

Here's looking forward to another sober weekend coming up!

All seemed well the first few hours, but then my tv blew up with sparks, a bang and smoke... Okay, I was very happy with that tv, had it repaired in December, it had all I needed to plug in my consoles and pc, but hey I have another one from when it was broken in December, less plug ins, but the most important ones are working and the rest will have to be switched. No biggie, right? I can deal with this. And then I was sitting on the brand new couch and idiotic me spilled cola all over it. There were blankets on top but that didn't help.

Normally the urge of having a drink would have risen by now, but I just cleaned the couch as far as possible (it's still wet, so no idea how it will turn out), took my Ritalin because it was time and decided to just sit on a dry spot, sigh deeply and make this post. No urge. But ffs...

I'm not touching anything anymore today. Fuck dinner, the kitchen will catch fire probably. I'm just going to sit here very quietly...

 We vowed to quit drinking together. I've stayed strong and he broke after 4 days. After three weeks of him drinking from morning to night and screaming at me my other roommates and making my wife afraid and aggravated to be in her own home, I had to throw him out.
If I had been the old me we would of fought again. But sober me can handle a belligerent drunk with peace. I'm afraid it's only a matter of time that I get the call telling me he's dead or in prison. I lost a friend today.

So I have been an on again off again drinker, sometimes problematic, sometimes not (I know that's probably not the case, but it feels pretty controlled at times) but the consistent thing I've found over my few years of paying attention to my relationship with alcohol has been that I without a doubt feel my best when I abstain. I am not the type of person that can exhibit self control unless I do it drastically, this is drinking, diet, exercise, work, basically anything in my life.

So that brings me to last week, I had been telling myself to cut down or stop, but kept finding little excuses to keep going, and I kept telling myself to start counting calories and start working out again, and again kept finding excuses like a stressful moment or something to eat like crap, drink, and not move. Then something just clicked in my head midway through lunch last monday when I was planning another ""I'll start next week"" conversation with myself and I just said, ""fuck it, it starts now, it already has started"".

I threw away the unhealthy portions of my lunch and only ate the chicken and vegetables I had packed, said no to the after work beer I usually have with my coworkers (there is a keg in the garage at work), and have been eating low carb, Intermittent fasting, going for a long walk or lifting almost daily, and haven't had a drop of alcohol. This wasn't some big thought out thing, I just said ""I'm done now"" and I was done. I feel great, the combination of all of these changes has my body feeling like it hasn't in years and I can't get over the energy I have, I literally have to make myself stop doing chores at night so I can get to bed on time.

I know it isn't this easy for everyone, and I know that it will get harder when the novelty runs out and some stress reenters, but for now, I feel amazing. If you're thinking about making any of theses changes, do it, immediately, I wish I knew how good this would feel, I would have started all of this much sooner.",9

Alcohol has been a major part of my life for over 20 years.   I've had some absolutely wonderful times while drinking and some truly terrifying times too.  I've sat behind the wheel drunk, behind jail cell bars too.  My love affair with alcohol has led to an actual affair and it cost me my 18+ year career in the military.  I don't know if I'm a shitty person BECAUSE I drink, or if it's just magnified by it.  I know I've scarred my kids because of it.  

I don't want to be shitty anymore.  God has given me so much grace and so much mercy, and I keep pissing it away because I can't tolerate being alone in my own thoughts.  I just started tearing up writing that last sentence.

When I decided to leave the environment by that time there was nothing left of my soul, it had been completely and utterly destroyed. I'm 21 now, almost 22 and I don't feel human anymore and I'm disconnected from my emotions but at the same time I love and appreciate life even if I cant feel the full range of emotions anymore, anyway. I was and am completely alone and I've realised I must rely on my own strength and will power for me to survive.

I've always been trying to improve myself and be better everyday. I workout, eat healthy, I'm a university student and I'm going to therapy and psychiatrist for years because I want to be better but there is also a downside because I also used to use alcohol and other drugs to self medicate during the worst periods of my life. I've blacked out countless of times and was an alcoholic for awhile (there is a part of me that wants self destruct) but I managed to kick it without any help from anyone(or so I thought). 

I've been sober from alcohol for 5 months now but last night I blacked out when I was drinking with my friend. I dont  remember what happened but he kicked me out of his house or I was an idiot and decided to leave. I don't know if I threatened him or if I was being an asshole or whatever but I know it was bad.

I woke up today and I absolutely hate and feel disgusted with myself because no matter how much I try to better myself and live a good life, there is something in my core that is just broken with the centre being a black hole. I almost always feel empty inside even though objectively I know there is meaning in my life and things have been going good for me lately but I just cant feel it. I'm suffering from the trauma and abuse everyday one way or another and I'm in a lot pain and suffering in my mind especially when it comes to relationships with people and thats why when I blackout I might hurt someone even though I dont want to hurt anybody. I'm a pacifist. 

I have dreams and aspirations I know I have the ability and mindset to be successful, I want a family I want kids but this black hole inside of me sabatouges every good thing that comes into my life. Every day and night there is a never ending struggle for suicide for years. I can't take this anymore, I want to live but not like this and I'm starting to believe death is the only solution because I just want all of my suffering to end and maybe I can finally find some peace. I know for a fact if I had an a gun I would pull the trigger without a second thought. I dont want to hurt anyone else anymore with my actions and I know the people I have effected wont see this but I'm sorry for everything ive done and all the pain I've caused. That person wasnt the real me I hope you can understand that. I want to be a good person but when I drink and blackout I'm such an asshole and terrible to people. My actions completely contradict my own personal beliefs. Its everything I stand against. When I look at myself in the mirror I feel disgusted",3

I’ve been sober for extended periods before (90 days is currently my record), but somehow I always convince myself things will be different and I will be able to handle it. Then I have a drink, which leads to a three day bender, and my mental health declines as I get on the crazy rollercoaster of fun drunken giddiness but then waking up at 3am with anxiety and insomnia, only to hop back on the ride the next day at 3pm after painfully suffering through half the day without more booze in my system. But when I’m sober, I feel normal- no anxiety, no panic attacks. I feel actual joy and peace. I want that peace so badly right now. I love this community and appreciate all of your kindness and support. This is my first post here and the first time I’ve actually ever really opened up honestly to a group about my struggles with booze and the horrible effect it has on my mental health. I know the first couple of days are the toughest- my symptoms are often intense anxiety and trouble sleeping for days 1-3 of sobriety. Really hoping this experience calms down and I can find some peace. This go around, I’m initially committing to 90 days sober, but open to going sober indefinitely. It’s just not worth having alcohol in my life to feel this bad. Hugs to you all.",203

I’ve been drinking heavily for about 3 years now. Never going longer than a month sober, I would pound a minimum of 8-10 beers a day/night. When Covid hit, the lockdown only worsened the addiction - I’d go through a 750ml of vodka and a bottle of wine while working from home. 

Anyhow, I’ve been easing up off the drink for 2 months now with the help of a loving partner. While there have been occasional nights where I’m in excess, I genuinely felt proud that I was drinking in what seemed like a more normal, sustainable way. In retrospect this was just self-delusion, but I was objectively drinking less. 

Well, I’ve now been cold turkey, 100% sober since a sudden diagnosis of testicular cancer about 2 weeks ago. I have 9 weeks of chemo ahead of me, as well as a minor surgery. And potentially, a larger, scary one. 

I’m pretty fucking terrified and I have no idea what’s ahead of me, but I do know that IWNDWYT. Or tomorrow. Or ever again.

Except there's no way I would ever be the one telling it or so I thought. First off let me try to condense my drinking career into as few sentences as possible and commit to being open and honest about my drinking for probably the first time ever. AMA! (JK... unless you want to ofc) Anyway, I grew up where (and back when) getting drunk as a teenager was a rite of passage, right or wrong, I am a product of my environment. I moved out several years ago and... well I've tried but I just don't belong here, I miss my family, old friends and the comfort of being in an environment I understand and is familiar. English is not the native language here, despite that (working for a multinational) it hasn't affected my career though, outside of work I have limited social interactions but it was never a major big deal (I told myself) as I'm fairly introvert. so life ticked along and I thought I was doing OK. Except every time I'm happy, sad, stressed, tired, disappointed, anxious or bored (the list is almost limitless) I've paralyzed the sh1t out of myself. I am married, a mother with a successful career and on the surface should be super respectable. The last few years have been tough however and, frankly, it's all a facade.

My homesickness is difficult to solve because I have a lot keeping me here, a family who mostly grew up here and so are settled, I just have never felt that way. Before I veer into that excuse, let me throw you another one. My mother died 9 months ago and it floored me (unexpected and not alcohol related at all.) It certainly kicked up the self destruction a notch as I started to just care less and less. When I wasn't drunk, I was anxious or scared and felt so alone. Pity party, perhaps, but also the hardest time by miles that I've had in my adult life. Drink of course has made it all a ton worse. So anyway, over the last 9-10 years I'd give up for a few weeks here or there (look, no problem!) but it just got heavier each time I'd return, definitely so this last 2 years I'd say. Lost days, weekends start creeping up, getting sick all of a sudden which had never happened before. drinking at stupid times. But i'd look for how I was different of course. Those guys on reddit and 'the internet' have really hit rock bottom. I can learn to moderate. And hey at least I never drove drunk and got arrested. Can you tell what's coming? So yeah, that happened a few days ago. I'm devastated and so frightened. I don't ever want to drink again. I've said that before, probably a hundred times but this is just beyond anything I ever expected to happen and I am thoroughly ashamed. I want to go home and for anyone thinking that sounds like a geo cure, well I would agree if it hadn't also been on my mind for over 12 years already. I don't think it's the cause for my drinking (I know I need to work on that independently) but I need to look after myself at this point and I wonder if that isn't a good first step. First time I told anyone all of this. I know I've been stupid, but try to be kind, I guess I am looking for positive motivation and stories of success, maybe some perspectives on booze and death of a close family member and of booze and feeling displaced.

Just trying to figure out my life and was hoping maybe I could get a hand here. I'm 28 years old. I've been drinking pretty heavily since I was 14. I've slowed down quite a bit in the past 5 years but it's still to much and I feel I need to cut alcohol from my life completely. I have an amazing fiance and a wonderful 3 year old daughter and it isn't fair to them. I don't drink as much, but I don't really have a gray area. It's either sober or blacked out. I grew up watching my parents drunk 24/7 and I don't want to put my daughter through that nor do I want to risk my relationship.
Basically what I'm wondering is what the hell do you do sober? At parties, concerts, camping. All of these social events/activities where I would typically drink. Now I just don't? That seems so weird. Now that I'm actually writing this out it sounds pretty pathetic. But it's the truth. I feel like if I go down this path of sobriety and end up at a concert/camping or whatever, I'll just be miserable. I feel like instead of enjoying myself, all I'll be thinking is how nice it would be to have a drink. Obviously it's doable and plenty of people have done it before me. Just looking for a little guidance. 
I've thought about AA meetings but they seem to be centered around religion and that doesn't interest me at all.
Any input would be much appreciated.

This stil breaks my heart - now I've learned that the reason I have been basically excluded from our circle of friends is because apparently he goes out of his way to make sure I'm not invited. People were used to ask him to invite me to things, since he's always been the more social type out of the two of us, but now he just responds to them that he's not gonna invite me anywhere, because ""it's impossible to talk to me"" and ""I feel superior to everyone else"".  I've missed not only some parties or get-togethers, but also my good friend's birthday. I'm simply out.

I guess I was trying to get things back together and go moderate, but I can't, I just finished a whole bottle of wine yesterday - something I haven't been ABLE to do in months, which tells me that not only my appetite is growing, but also that my body adjusted to the poison again. I may have been able to control myself while with others, but I started sipping the alcohol again while I was alone.

I just can't do this anymore.

This morning, I chatted with my best friend from home, and we usually give mini updates about our lives, work, family, etc. I decided to tell him I quit drinking almost 3 months ago. Sharing this felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders...

Approximately 4 years ago, I almost ruined this friendship because of a particular night in which I drank way too much (in a situation in which I shouldn't have been drinking in the first place). Thankfully, nobody was hurt, and nothing was physically damaged that day, but our friendship was in the balance. The evening culminated with my friend telling me ""Florgini, I don't think I'm ever going to forgive you for this."" 

Almost a year went by without us communicating in any way, until a gathering with mutual friends brought us together. I'm blessed that this friend of mine is a more forgiving person than I deserved, because after that night a year later, he decided that our friendship was worth maintaining. 

During this morning's chat, he also shared that he's not drinking too much these days, and keeps it to special/social occasions. I expressed that I wish that was the case with me, but that I'm incapable of just having one drink, as he knows very well. 4 years after almost destroying this friendship that I cherish so greatly, I finally feel like I've made up for my past mistakes, and can move forward a better person.

It is so relieving to know I'm not alone in this battle. I will not drink again, I can't .I have to do this for her and my son. I can't wait to join you all on this journey. And remember we all struggle but we have each other.
 Also sorry my tablet is very slow so my grammar and spelling may be horrible lol.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

**Face the Resistance**

>“Resistance is the most toxic force on the planet. It is the root of more unhappiness than poverty, disease, and erectile dysfunction. To yield to Resistance deforms our spirit. It stunts us and makes us less than we are and were born to be… Any act that rejects immediate gratification in favor of long-term growth, health, or integrity. Or, expressed another way, any act that derives from our higher nature instead of our lower. Any of these will elicit Resistance… It’s a repelling force… Resistance will tell you anything to keep you from doing your work… Resistance is always lying and always full of shit.”  
>  
>\-Steven Pressfield

There is a constant ongoing battle with the Resistance. Unfortunately, it’s not as simple as taking it down for good. It comes in new forms every day. It comes in the form of a nagging brain to check email or text messages. It comes in the form of noise when you’re trying to concentrate the most. And the scarier, less apparent form of not being good enough.

Resistance is self-sabotage. It’s laziness. It’s the procrastination and delays we allow. It is the evil force that tries to derail us. That torturous and tempting presence that I have fallen for too many times to count.

The one thing you can be sure of with the Resistance is it becomes more pronounced the more important and meaningful something is to you. That doubt and fear you feel is the Resistance trying to pull you away. It’s the instrument you would like to learn, but the fear of playing in front of a group of strangers scares you away. It’s the book you’d like to write, but you feel you have nothing worthwhile to say. It’s quitting alcohol to live a better life, but you give in to “come on, it’s just one beer.” I think most, if not all, of us have heard that voice with more than just alcohol.

One of the biggest problems we face is our desperation to fit in. We go out of our way to choose work or focus on things in life that have no or far less meaning to us. We silence our inner voice because the nudge we get to pursue what has meaning does not fit in with social norms. So, we stick to the status quo.

But these things that scare us, scare us for a reason. And it’s because we care about it. Instead of heading the opposite way, we should go in the direction of our fear. That’s where the most reward can be found.

Think about all those instances we don’t lean into our fear. This is the Resistance at work against us. Whether it’s friendships that don’t bring mutual growth or jobs that cause anger and frustration because of our lack of care. When we stick with these things, we are settling because of familiarity. And the more we settle, the more this nagging voice pops up in our head.

It turns out alcohol is the perfect tool to silence this voice. I drank through my frustrations with my job. And I drank more to avoid the stress and pain I was creating. Instead, I chased shiny external things that I thought would bring happiness, but it brought more pain.

Much like alcohol, these shiny external things we pursue are a perfect way to give in to the Resistance. It’s the pursuit of objects, money, power, unnecessary knowledge, or beauty. None of these things will make us successful or happy. Viktor Frankl wrote this about how we should choose what to pursue:

>“Don’t aim at success - the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so at the unintended side-effect of one’s dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long run - in the long run, I say! - success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it.”

Alcohol and these externals are coping mechanisms. We drink because we hate how we spend our time. We buy junk to make ourselves feel better because we can’t stand the way we waste our lives.

I will be the first to admit I pursued money over anything meaningful. Money left my account as fast as it entered, spending it on useless junk and alcohol. I drank heavily because I hated the way I wasted my time in a non-meaningful way. This is a difficult negative habit loop to break. But this meant focusing my attention on the right things.

It’s about turning these negative habit loops into something that reflects the person we want to be. Using willpower to quit drinking does not work long-term. It’s really about using willpower to do something meaningful. That pursuit of meaning becomes the reason to avoid distraction and remain sober.

When I spend my time on something purposeful, I don’t think about alcohol. When I write, or learn something beneficial, or spend time with my family, these are not things that make me want to drink. I think about the activities that revolved around alcohol and a lot of them are things I don’t really enjoy. Alcohol did a damn good job of derailing me.

Most of us know what we want to do with our lives, but we’ve spent so much time silencing that voice inside of us. We make excuses why it’s reasonable for us *not* to show up and sit down at our respective easels.

It isn’t widely known that Winston Churchill was a prolific painter. In his darkest moods, he used painting to lift his spirits and finished more than 550 canvases in his lifetime. Churchill also wrote 43 books and even won the Nobel Prize for Literature. These were secondary to what he accomplished as a statesman in his brilliant lifetime, which is rivaled by few in the world’s history. This same person was the Prime Minister of the UK during World War II and once again four years later. And that doesn’t include his military service.

We don’t all have to quit our jobs to become painters, but at least sit down with that easel and paint the first canvas. Before we ruthlessly declare we can’t make money doing what we love, maybe we should try. Because our lack of pursuit has negative consequences to us. And more importantly, the lack of ability to make money isn’t an excuse to avoid showing up. That is the Resistance standing in your way. And it is depriving the world of something meaningful we can offer.

I would love to make all the money I would ever need from writing. It’s unlikely to happen, but I won’t ever stop because I love it too much. And frankly, it’s not the goal to become rich from writing. That would be futile because there are much easier paths to get rich. I may have moments of burnout, but it’s not enough to derail me and give in to the Resistance.

What is something meaningful that you allowed alcohol to replace? And how can you start putting a little bit of time into that work today?

Not drinking with you today in San Antonio.

I just can't stop ending up in the same circle. Can people who see this please remind me how sobriety is better?! How has it made your life better??

I'm a 21 year old female. I'm used to waking up every single day hungover, which is toxic. But since I'm young I haven't experienced any real diagnosed health issues yet. So that allows me in my mind to keep drinking. But I know in the future when I have a family I may get some kind of cancer or disease as a result of this amount of alcohol, every single night without fail. It makes me cry to think about how I could abandon my future children and partner as a result of how I'm living.

But drinking makes me feel better. It just does. I'm living at home, can't even go back to school because my parents won't let me yet. Have been going to therapy, therapy group, and a few AA meetings. I'm just always drunk every single night to offset my ADHD medication (which I need). I am just in a depressed lonely hole.

Don't we all have a hard time struggling EVERY SINGLE DAY? Especially with this drinking nonsense. I've read a great book (This Naked Mind) that helps me understand what this addiction is all about. I'm in the middle of reading another book (Quit Drinking Without Willpower by Allen Carr) that will hopefully show me the way to freedom.

I'm not expecting the information in these books to just fix everything. I absolutely know there's work involved. As a matter of fact I tried AA for almost two years.

Got a sponsor, read the ""big book"" and actually ended up despising it because of the people. Got through some of the hardest steps admitting to my sponsor all the wrong things I've done to other people in my life. After all that I still didn't feel any better. Couldn't wait to drink again.

So here we are. There are days when I just can't wait to get a drink. However, after reading This Naked Mind I went 3 full weeks without a single drop of alcohol. Went through a very bad bender right before that, but after, it was so easy not to drink or even think about it. I was working on a project for my son who was in Georgia with his grandparents. My wife was there too obviously.

I literally had all the free time I could have ever wanted to just get hammered and sit around doing nothing, but I didn't. I enjoyed being sober, thinking clearly, making good decisions, building a simple wooden rack so he could show off his toys on a display I built by hand. 

Was the display rack perfect in the end? HELL NO! Was it something I've never done by myself that served it's purpose? HELL YES! 

So my fellow drinkers, strugglers, lurkers (that only read and never post because that's totally me), am I hopeless? I honestly feel like I can do this. I think I can add that badge next to my username and it can be more than 2 days. I think I can read through these other posts and give something back. I think I can do this. This sub has been so much more inspirational than AA ever was. The stories I read are remarkable. I just want one of them to be mine.

New day one. (Somewhat long post)","I've been an alcoholic of varying degrees for about 6 years now, with recently being my rock bottom. It started getting really bad when I started my new job.

I'm a bartender by trade. About 3 months ago I was given this amazing opportunity to work for a new bar with an old friend of mine. He is a really far down the path type of drinker that doesn't want to stop. I should have known that this would eventually turn in to a problem. Oh boy it has. We started getting ""lunch"" before work and it was getting a tiny bit of food, and a lot of whiskey. 

The owner of my bar is also a problematic drinker, and encourages us to drink on the job (take shots with guests and stuff), I don't have to pay for any of it, because the owner just wants us to fucking do it. This past month my drinking has become completely out of control.

The times I don't drink are when I'm at home, but I work 5 days a week and about 65 hours a week. I'm at work so frequently, that I'm just able  to drink and drink and drink. I get home late enough that my family is always asleep, so I just am shitfaced all the time when I get off.

I lost my work shoes, I've pissed my pants before I made it to the bathroom, I've gotten blackout angry and said awful shit to good people. I never used to be this person, and I don't want to be this person. This lifestyle will kill me.

I fear for my health, I fear for my relationship, and I'm just sick and tired of being a garbage person.

I cannot leave this job due to the financial need, and lack of openings everywhere due to covid. But it is literally the worst environment to be an alcoholic in.

I look back now and remember so many things I did when I was drunk that I’m so ashamed of. I said extremely horrible things to people. I lost good friends because of what I said. I missed out on promising bonds that could have become good friendships. I tried so many times to stop, and I just couldn’t string together more than a few weeks sober at a time.

I couldn’t have one drink without an urge to keep going until I was drunk and asleep. The next day I would feel sick, hungover and ashamed of myself. My husband and I are juggling stressful careers and three little kids (1 with special needs) and our marriage is suffering. Thank you to this community. I never joined a program. No one other than my husband knows I had a problem and went sober. But I came here everyday this past year to remember why I went sober and get the encouragement I needed. Thank you everyone!

i've been sober for a while, been managing to eat fairly healthy, staying productive with school, yadda yadda yadda. regardless of all that i've lately been having these persistent emotional triggers where i really want to go back. i want to drink and experience that blunting/numbing and even euphoric effect, at least until shit goes sideways which it tended to do. 

i had a productive day today, i even managed to cook sweet and sour chicken and rice for dinner. still the urge is there like a throbbing headache and it just hurts ya know. it hurts to just feel this low and miss that cheap, dangerously thrilling $15 rush that would kill time otherwise spent hurting.

""there's nothing so bad that drinking couldn't make worse"". i believe that fully. it just doesn't do much to know that when these low points hit as hard as they do. shout-out to yall, coming here has been a big help lately.",6

It was so so embarrassing but I'm glad to be surrounded by coworkers and an employer who didn't judge but went out of their way to help me and not feel too upset or humiliated. This is my last relapse, I kept telling myself that a few drinks here and there are fine, but I always seem to spiral down after. 

I've been trying to get sober for years now and I'll do really good and then just completely spiral with drinking and something horrible will happen. I got a dui, went to jail, even cheated on my boyfriend while blacked out which is something I would never even think of doing normally. It's so fucked up. Like why can't I just stop the drinking when all these horrible things happen when I do. 

And now I almost lost 2 of my jobs and could have went back to jail for a long time if I had gotten caught. 

Anyways, kind of a rant but I feel like a lot of people around me don't understand how hard it is and they kind of don't get why I keep relapsing and getting myself into these incredibly stupid situations. 

I was advised to try AA meetings, and counseling. Do these things actually work for everyone? I really don't want to have to do those things but I have to make a bigger change on staying sober for good this time becuse obviously I can't do it on my own.

I just feel so ashamed of myself and upset with myself for making a fool of myself again. I'm lucky I didn't drive anymore that way and hurt someone or myself. 

Any advice would be appreciated :) thanks friends",3

Iv realized that this problem is not fun and games anymore, I fear about how much damage it has and will do to my health.

I am 25 now and have been drinking since iv been 18. I dont drink every day and when I do its on average 6 tall cans of beer or a good bottle of wine with a beer or two. I do not really enjoy having one or two because I always want more. But when I dont drink I dont crave it that much but always find an excuse when I am bored.

I am studying for a dream career , have a few good friends and am fortunate to have had an amazing youth filled with travel, women and excitement. Not all perfect but good, no regrets.

I plan to continue an exciting life but now looking back I start to realize all the hiking, exploring and fun in general was always accompanied with weed and alcohol. Alcohol is the primary problem.

Quitting drinking completely seems almost like the weaker option because I dont want to miss out out the positive aspects of drinking either. Social, cultural, and overall the feeling of it.. it does make me feel good.

I have so many questions but dont know what to ask. Sorry for the long post but I would appreciate some original advice besides 'finding other things you enjoy' or 'avoiding bars and parties'

I’ve said that I was going to take a break more times than I can count in the past 4 months but never felt like there was a “right” time. A few nights ago I woke up in the middle of the night unable to go back to sleep after having a few drinks on a weeknight. I started to think about all of the times I’ve gotten sick, blacked out, felt embarrassed/ashamed about my behavior, how much money I’ve spent, and overall how alcohol has not been alignment with my values.

Since stopping drinking all together my idea of happiness has changed to what made me happy when I was a child. Things I did for happiness as a kid like drawing, writing, reading. 

I've also noticed how sharp I am now after 2 months, my short term memory is amazing. I can remember details on a coffee mug or the colour of an elevator button. 

I'm also developing and having multiple hobbies, doing courses, exercising regularly.

I had 40+ days. Things were going well. Then yesterday smacked me upside the head. From the moment I woke up, I was anxious and ready to crawl out of my skin. I tried to hold it together, did all the things I’ve been practicing ... going minute by minute, playing the tape forward, listing all the things I’ve gained, reading posts here. But by 6pm, I was ready to tear my hair out. If I had been alone, I would have just gone to bed and been done with the day.

I’m so disappointed in myself, and although I’m completely dedicated to restarting this journey, I’m not sure what to do differently next time.

The biggest takeaway I have to date since I decided to stop drinking is this:  

I learned not to rush it and risk relapse. I didn’t put too many goals out there at the beginning; however, giving up smoking had to go hand in hand on the first day of no drinking.  I wanted to throw in weight loss too, as an immediate goal, seeing so many posts about that. I ate too much sugar for that to happen, as I increased consumption to stave off the cravings and gained weight. I’m ok with that, and know I will concentrate on weight loss when I’m ready. I’m pretty close to that as my knee and hip are painful, and I’m dreading getting into my jeans as cooler weather is coming.

I have rediscovered creating art. I was too busy using my right hand for drinking. Couldn’t drag out my supplies and clear a workspace, never mind clearing my head to get the creative juices flowing. Was just too numb.

Mood is so much better. The constant fear and dread is gone. Dare I say I’m happy?!Thoughts about drinking don’t go away, but I don’t act on them. I just change the channel in my head.

Coming up on day 60 feels like I’ve been at this for longer than that.  It’s crazy because not too long ago I felt like I just started, and was anxiously checking off each day.

I know the journey is different for all of us, but maybe someone can get a little nugget of hope and run with it if you are struggling.

I've been doing it for 11 years. It doesn't even bring me pleasure anymore. My entire family has a history of liver cancer, most not making it past 50. And I feel like I can't resist. The most success I had was 2 years ago when I found this Subreddit. I read all of your stories and it made me realize I've been poisoning myself. Preventing myself from being the best person I can be. I made it 24 days. My life greatly increased.

Then I got a bug bite on my arm. It turned into a giant red patch that started spreading with red lines coming off of it. I let it get bad for a week before going to the Dr. They were shocked I let it get that bad, being allergic to most antibiotics, I thought I was either going to lose my arm, or the vaccine was going to spread to my blood. 

I took the antibiotics they gave me, I had no negative reaction, It cured the infection! 

I used that as an excuse to celebrate, by bringing another infection back into my life. 

Alcohol. 

Since then, the longest break I've been able to stop drinking for is 7 days. 

Pretty much the same cycle I was in prior to. Except now its getting worse. 

Since the lock down. I've been drinking twice as much. 

What used to be a 6 pack on the weekends is now 2 12 packs throughout the week. 

I'm freaking out because of how crazy everybody is acting due to the upcoming election. 

And I'm stuck here at home with social media being where I get a majority of my interaction with people. 

I can't focus on anything anymore.

My anxiety is though the roof. 

I am walking away from everything else and actively not drinking for the next 14 days. If I do not stop now. I'm afraid I will at some point hit rock bottom. I will not let that happen. 

I will not drink with you today.

And I will check in with you all tomorrow as well. If I do not. 

The only way to quit drinking is to be honest, and active about it. 

Please hold me accountable.

And the reason for that is that I don't WANT to drink in moderation. I drink because I like the feeling of being drunk. And that's just not something that is sustainable anymore. I don't want it. I want to take better care of myself and to be more present in my life, for me, my husband, my son, and my dogs.  It's harder, because I HAD that, and I willingly threw it all away because I thought it'd been enough time that I could just drink socially again. Lies. 

I was sober for over 18 months, until falling off the wagon a little more than a year ago. And I can say with 100% certainty that, other than some increased social anxiety and awkwardness, my life was a million times better sober. I miss that feeling. I miss my eyes not looking dead in photos. I miss waking up and not being embarrassed about things I did or said the night before. I miss not structuring my life around when I could drink next.

I've tried countless times to sober up by coming on this sub, joining the discord, and other self help routines. I've also told my therapist I have issues (which I sometimes down play) with alcohol and weed on occasion. It made me very annoyed when she would say that I have an addiction. I think that up until this point I hadn't fully admitted I have a drug and alcohol problem. My biggest challenge is I'm the type who mainly gets plastered in group settings and it's horrible. Horrible because as I've gotten into my early 30s my friends don't hang out as much so we see each other every few of months. Unfortunately, without fail at least the last year I've gotten so drunk around them and I think it's getting old. If I ever bring it up, others will say ""you weren't that bad"" or ""it's not a big deal, everyone gets drunk like that sometimes"", but I feel like they're judging me and I've become *that* friend. 

The silver lining is that the last three times this happened I learned from them. They all happened 3+ months apart from eachother, which is pretty good, but three binges too many. Anyway this is what I learned from each:
1. I get emotional, political, and angry. I put myself in dangerous situations (coming home late from the city by myself).
2. I am a super lightweight and pound drinks without water or food.
3. (This time) I do have a problem and I want to stop drinking. I want to stop smoking weed. I've had enough. I don't ever want to be here again. I'm just so done.

I’m just posting because I feel very proud of myself right now. The last time I had relapsed, I went to breakfast with a friend while being 75 days sober. My alcoholic brain was screaming at me to not drink, but I ordered a mimosa anyway because my friend did (and she doesn’t know I am sober, so it was easy to just go for it). I then continued on to drink all day long, black out, drive home, and nurse a hangover and my intensified depression for days after. I didn’t even think to call my sponsor before I drank that time, and I just went into a shame spiral.

However, today I went to brunch with the same friend and another girl who I don’t particularly like very much. This other girl is quite the partier, so I was scared i wouldn’t be able to deal with discomfort again. But this time was different! I called my sponsor on the way to brunch. When i got there i didn’t mention anything about alcohol. They both got drinks, and I got a coffee instead. I didn’t even mention I don’t drink, I just blew through my discomfort and guess what?? I SURVIVED SOBER. I didn’t even feel tempted to drink at all. I had a good yummy breakfast, made it through awkward social conversation with someone who is basically a stranger, and I made it home. 

It’s so insane that with just a little practice and (gasp) asking for help/reassurance (my sponsor is a queen), it was so much easier to accept my sober true self and honor myself. 

I’m now contemplating taking a nap (much different than when I first relapsed and ended up passing out from drinking too much fully dressed on a fully made bed). I’m going to wake up and clean my apartment, so some yoga, read, and do laundry. 

I’m grateful to be sober today. I don’t always say that or feel that way, but I feel it today. Now tell me your sober wins from this last week! I want to be inspired. IWNDWYT ♥️",11

For me it’s been an easy choice every day to wake up and say “hell yes I want to spend today sober” because sobriety has actually given me everything that I was trying and failing to accomplish by getting drunk (having fun, creating meaningful relationships and memories). Sobriety has become my foundation for everything that I have built over the last 2000 days and for what I hope to build out of my today and tomorrows. This month I’m being approved for a promotion, I’m at a healthy weight, my mind is strong, and I’ve paid off over 15 thousand dollars of my debt, and get closer to my dream of home ownership every day. I wanted to share this milestone with this group that has helped me over the years not only to encourage others but to get encouragement from all of you so that I can continue to make it happen one day at a time.

So I'm 23M and have recently graduated college. During my years in college I was a real party animal and this led to me drinking a lot. Over the last 2 year I've tried to cut down on alcohol and I actually managed to limit the times I drink quite a lot. During lockdown I barely drank at all. But I was dumped in June and since then I've noticed an increase in my alcohol consumption. 

I probably drink like 2 times a week but when I do, I drink a lot. It's really frustrating but I just can't seem to pace myself cos I immediately wanna feel that buzz. The past two nights I drank a lot and I've been experiencing horrible anxiety when I'm hungover so I really really really wanna cut down. Also, people don't complain about it but looking back at my behavior when I'm drunk, it really makes me cringe sometimes.  

However, my friends are all heavy drinkers and we go out a lot to bars and we drink a lot. My friends all live in a big city that I'll be moving to very soon and I'll be moving in with one of them (she's luckily one of the less heavy drinkers) but I'm a bit scared because I am still unemployed so I won't have that much to do and I'm afraid I might spiral because some other friends will be unemployed, too. 

I really wanna cut down for multiple reasons but I'm afraid it will be really difficult for me, first of all because my friends drink a lot and second of all because I do really enjoy being drunk and I just can't seem to control myself once I start drinking. My father's a heavy drinker and it has put such a strain on our relationship so I know what I don't wanna become but I'm just scared that I won't manage to make these changes. 

Any experiences that people can share would be really welcome, thanks in advance.

EDIT: or any practical tips on how to go about this cutting back. My friends are going to party on Thursday but I've let them know I won't be going and I told them honestly that I want to cut back because the anxiety the day afterwards just isn't worth it anymore.",9

I started with the daily check ins a couple weeks ago and found that I made it 6 days with no alcohol. Then I drank. Then I was back on my regular pattern of sober-sober-binge. My breaking point was Friday night. I got absolutely wasted and screamed at my mom that I hate her and I want her out of my life forever. I don’t know why I did that. We lost my dad to suicide and listening to her cry when I told her that broke my heart. She told me I’m her best friend and if she doesn’t have me then she’s all alone. This is what drunk me does. 

Yesterday I spent some time journaling and wrote down all the goals I want to have. I want a healthier body, cleaner home, more time to express myself through music/art/writing. And drinking takes all of that from me.

At one point, a neighbor joined and we ended up talking about life and crazy stories until 1:30 in the morning when I caught my uber home. I slept in late but woke up feeling refreshed, got a cup of coffee, and went to the farmers market. I've already walked 5 miles today, gone grocery shopping, and tidied up my apartment. I had a great night last night with very little detriment to the next day. I feel like I got the best of both worlds. 

I'm not going to lie and I really wanted that first glass of wine. I wanted the hit of that first sip. But thinking about what it would have cost me today makes the price way too high. I'm so glad I didn't drink but I will be looking forward to my nap later today.

I know every recovery journey is a challenge for every person who is going through recovery. Making that choice is the hardest. Living that choice is the hardest. But, I did this 7 days before school started. In 2020. During Covid. As a single mom. Supporting a 12 year old who is learning online. With only the support of two good friends. My family will never know because they did not know it was a problem in the first place. They will see it as a weakness, not as an accomplishment. And, yes, that makes me sad. 

When people found out I am a single mom and a teacher, my drinking has not only been understood, it has been supported. Hell, I have had so many drinks bought for me because I am a teacher! My boyfriend says it is also because I am cute, lol. Someone commented and then deleted about me drinking and then going to get my son. My best choice? No! Do I condone it? No! Am I proud of it? Fuck no! Did it happen? Yes! Does it happen for many moms? Yes!

I justified it as my ""me"" time. And when I didn't get it, I was pissy. Now, I don't know what to do with my ""me"" time. In the mornings when I get up, I try to take an hour or 30 minutes with my coffee and my fb sober groups. I look at the days on my app and celebrate whatever day I am on. Today, it is day 40! I never wanted to drink this week, but I definitely did not love being sober. Everyone keeps asking me how I feel. Not great. I have slept the last two nights.

After my rant on Thursday about how early sobriety sucks (and it does), I went to the Urgent Care. I slept 3 hours! 3 hours and I am calling bullshit on my FitBit. I turned and looked at the alarm clock so many times, I don't think I slept at all. And the heartburn - OMG. My trick with essential oils (Peppermint and Digize) was not working. I had a 160 oz of water before I went to Urgent Care. That did jack shit. 

The first round of meds didn't help. They drew blood for labs. I am realizing sobriety is like childbirth. Everyone has a story and theirs is worse than the other persons. Someone online got me in a tizzy about it being my gall bladder, and I needed to go in. So I got increasingly nervous as I waited for the labs. Did I really fuck up my body with the drinking? They gave me a GI Cocktail (Maalox and Lidocaine). He told me to shoot it like a shot, and I said, ""I don't do those anymore, remember?"" Even that did not eliminate the burning. 

An hour and 1 IV later, I am being discharged. Labs are all normal (whew!) and I now have two new heartburn meds. Severe heartburn. I had to stop them. ""What about my sleep?"" After listening to her talk about my two meds, I realized no one knows what the fuck they are doing and they are spitballing the levels on these two meds to perhaps land on something that works. Well, fuck that! I started one med after being on the other. So, let's try the second med without the first one and see if that works. 

I slept from 9:30 to 8:00 on Friday night. I woke up with no heartburn. I felt so much better. Last night, I did the same thing. I slept from 9:47 to 6:30 with only 40 minutes of awake time. I am only taking one of the meds from now on. I can get up and I have my Miracle Morning. This last week, I wasn't waking up from the meds. I was so rushed to get ready it reminded me of my hangover mornings. I hated that feeling and it was still taking me hours to fall asleep. 

I finally feel like I might tackle my house. Okay - I'll put the clothes in the dryer and fold them. I'll make my bed. I'll wipe down the counters. I might run the Roomba. (The weirdest gift I have ever gotten from my mom. Okay - we don't talk - but I guess I needed a $300 vacuum.) 

I would say get sleep handled first if you are on a recovery journey. That has been the hardest thing for me to tackle in my recovery. And read Quit Like a Woman. Alcohol is not a substance anyone is supposed to be able to normally consume. It is a neurotoxin. You are not week for not being able to handle it. You are not a bad person for not being able to handle it. It is meant to addict you and fuck you up. That is what it does. I learned that during my awake time from 1:30 - 6:00 am Friday morning. 

And, I am starting to take the congratulations people are saying when they find out I am 40 days AF. I am a badass! (I still say I should have double the days!)

I ran before, it’s just that now when I run it’s less of a punishment riddled with GI issues and headaches fueled by the booze intake of the night before....It’s actually enjoyable. 

Anyways, it’s become part of the ritual each morning that just as I head for the door my 4 year old calls out that I forgot something as he runs over to give me a hug and kiss goodbye. This morning he was out in the backyard and he saw me heading for the driveway and as usual he called out “daddy, you forgot something!”

He made a run for the gate to unlock it and make his way out to me and when I saw this I quickly hid behind a tree so I could jump out to surprise him when he made his way beyond the fenced barrier. 

Only his tiny hands struggled to open the gate. 

In a sudden panic that he had missed the chance to say goodbye I watched as his eyes quickly welled up, his lips began trembling and tears started to roll down his face. Not a sound, just the pure innocent face of true heartbreak.

In that moment I witnessed what pain a simple absence of my presence could cause my child... in a strange out of body like experience I imagined I was looking down on my son from an afterlife, seeing first hand what kind of heartbreak it caused my son to think that I was gone without saying goodbye.

And in an instant I was reminded why I’m fighting to stay sober... despite how broken and worthless the voices in my mind keep telling me I am, the look on my sons face that made me realize that I could still be a hero in his eyes shook me to my core....

I snapped out of it, jumped out from behind the tree and yelled “hey, did you forget something?”

His tears instantly disappeared and he ran over to give me the sweetest hug and kiss, reminding me just why I’m in this fight... 

I know there are plenty of you struggling the same as me to get through this day. Some days are easy and some are just an impossible battle filled with depressing thoughts of self doubt that seem like things will never change... you’re not alone. 

Let’s believe in the fight... I hope everyone has a blessed and successful week in your quest to be  a better version of you. I’m right there with you✌🏼",1628

I've spent much less time this year drinking than previous years, if I had to guess, but back then it wasn't considered problem drinking since everyone was doing it.  However, in this past year I've moved states away with my wife and we've finally got our own land tucked away that we're living on and with everything the way it is with various lockdowns, we've found more time to indulge in drinking or smoking the days away.

She smokes, I drink, and it has really affected us in the past year.  We're no where near divorce or anything like, but pleading days of her being annoyed with me not having finished tasks around the house became more frequent.  I used to plan around drinking knowing that it would take me a day to recover with a normal hangover.  Then two days. Then three days.  Well I'm on day 4 and feel absolutely braindead and anxious right now.  I finally had to breakdown and call my mother (who is a recovering alcoholic) and explain how much I was freaking out the other night.  I had no idea that those ""hangovers"" I had been experiencing this past year weren't hangovers, but full on withdrawals.  

I'm sitting here thinking about the last time I did this, about 2 or so weeks ago.  I snapped back in three days, out hiking and laughing like myself, and now this week it's a completely different ball game.  This isn't the most concise post as my brain is still bouncing back, but I'll tell you, this may not seem like rock bottom to many people, but it's as rock bottom as I'm willing to get.  My wife's been out of town this weekend while I've been having panic attack after panic attack no matter what I do.  I'm sure her absence has only made it worse, but I've never felt anything like this in my life.

I wish I'd quit so many times prior to this, but I never thought it could be this bad.  I had night sweats and inability to sleep for one night, but this anxiety and impending dread feeling have been coming and going for 72 hours straight.  Today is better than yesterday, and yesterday was better than the day prior, but a brain on anxiety simply refuses to believe it's ever going to go away again.

As a young woman (23) I have often felt as if I am fighting against the norms of society and the media by rejecting alcohol. I'm pretty proud of myself! 

I finally feel as though I am reeping the fruit of the seeds I planted 150 days ago by ditching alcohol. 150 days ago I was buying a .75 of karkov every other day and doing nothing to better myself as a person. I was drinking just so I didn't have to be awake for life.

Now I am going to graduate college this semester. I am doing hardcore yoga most days of the week, meditating most days, and walking 3 miles a day. I am being productive every day. I am spending most days with my family and my baby nephews. My panic attacks are almost completely gone. 

Life isn't perfect. Stopping drinking didn't get rid of my GAD, panic disorder, ADHD, or sleeping problems BUT it gave me the ability to address my problems from a place of clarity and mindfulness. I can honestly say I'm happy. I enjoy every day. I love being awake for life again.

However while I've made the decision to get sober they still party alot (ages 31-38). Last night they invited me to a party but I declined and this morning I was supposed to go bike riding with one of them, but they are too hungover. 

I'm grateful I woke up sober and get to enjoy my bike ride. But part of me is a little bit lonely, and feels like I'm missing out. Not on the drinking just on the socialization.

I could say a million things about my Dad and his relationship with alcohol and me but that’s for a different post.

Anyway, my Dad and his friend were just basically praising me for the “cool things” I’ve done in my short 29 years. 6 years in the military, learning languages, living in cool places and doing awesome things. Skydiving, hiking, running marathons, pursuing a college degree, owning my own small business, having a family etc etc. And I looked at them and said “Yeah, I guess that all is pretty cool... too bad I have been drunk for most of it.” They laughed like it was actually funny, I laughed awkwardly... I said it wittily, but it hit me like a baseball bat to the gut. (But I still had a few more beers of course cuz apparently I needed to stew in this epiphany and also fuck up some more before realizing I can’t drink ever again if I want to save my own life)


But damn, How cool would it have been to experience those things sober. Not only remembering the experiences more clearly but actually enjoying them and even expanding on them. 
Many of those “good times” were ruined or at least tainted in one way or another by alcohol. Not to mention the list of all the shitty things that have happened and that I’ve done through my entire adult life due to alcohol is just as long. Relationship issues/divorce, NJPs and basically ending my Marine Corps career, outpatient treatments, anger management and mental health issues, self harm, suicidal ideation and attempts, I could go on and on and on. 

I know I can’t go back but I hope I have enough time left to do some more cool shit while sober ...  :)",5

I knew that he planned on drinking once they got here, and I also had planned on NOT drinking. They got here around 9:00PM, and it was only a matter of 10 minutes before my cousin was like, “Alright, let’s go pick up a bottle!” (Something that we used to do all the time). I told him that was I not drinking, and he persisted in the idea of us “just having a few”. But after numerous attempts, I’m happy to say that his efforts fell short, and that I didn’t give in.

Fast forward to Saturday afternoon. They invited me to hang out at the pool while they were waiting to check into their hotel room. Again, told myself and my cousin that I would not be drinking, but that I would chill with them. 

The pool ended up being super crowded, so they decided to go hang out at the bar. This was not what I expected when I made the decision to come here. I ended up having two beers, because I didn’t want to be that guy that wasn’t drinking anything. 

I then left back home after my two drinks. Ended up sharing a bottle of vodka between my two roommates and I. 

Now here I am 7:45 in the morning. Surprisingly not hungover. I thought I would feel more guilty about giving in, especially after having 13 days sober. But I think it’s important to remember that those 13 days didn’t go to waste. I simply had 13 days of being sober, and 1 day where I was not. What matters is what I do today, and today IWNDWYT.

Well, fast forward 6 months later, I was still drinking. It came to a head on labor day, when my new job gave me 2 days off in a row (that never happens in retail). I came home Saturday from work and started drinking to 'relax'. Sunday? Nothing but booze... started day drinking beer, then switched to vodka around 5pm cuz ""fuck it, I'm off tomorrow and I want to enjoy myself"". Then Monday came...

My wife went to run some errands in the morning, so I decided to hit the leftover vodka while she was out.... this was at 10am mind you. One drink can't hurt, right? One turned into 2, 2 turned into 3. And I was chugging them to try and finish before my wife got home.

That's when I realized I had a problem. Unfortunately, I have no desire to fix the problem right now. I know it's an issue, and yet I'm still depressed and pouty because I'm not going to be drinking beer and watching football today.

I stopped drinking 28 days ago and we did not have one social engagement of any kind during these last four weeks.  I did not have to say no to any offered drinks because there wasn’t anyone around to offer me one.

My elderly mother has always been ashamed of her introversion - she still feels guilty when she declines social engagements because she would rather spend time with herself.  We joked the other night that she is one of the few people to benefit from the pandemic insofar as it has prevented people from making the social invitations that she feels so guilty about declining.  Honestly I worry about her anxiety returning when things “go back to normal,” and then I think, well, what about you, Phil?  How are you going to react the next time you are in stressful room full of drunken friends or family?

shit's hard yo.

I had a great week! Last week I decided to try spreading my miles out to 5 days a week instead of my usual 4. I'm running (haha) into a problem with volume where I want to run more miles but my Saturday long runs are getting longer and longer. While I love a good long run, I have to ask myself if running 15 miles is really useful if one isn't training for a marathon or some other kind of long distance race. So this week I ran 5 (I actually still have to go out for this morning's  6 miler 👀 ) days a week and strength trained 2. I'm not sure how long I can keep up having no real rest days. I keep the strength training days pretty low key - not trying for PRs here and I have no strenght-centric goals either. It's just support to keep me a better/stronger/less injury prone runner. I that mentality helps because I go about it at a lower intensity which helps with burn out. If I find I do need a break then those days'll be the first to go - which is *fine*. Needing a break is *fine*.

How about you guys? Tell me how it went down below! Also, if you're interested in taking up the *brutally optimistic and aggressively affirming* mantle of Shape Up Sunday also let me know.

I see posts of people not being able to afford detox, and just in general, normal medical care, and it is just awful! We are pretty lucky here, it's not always easy to get, but there are options. I feel bad, and want to bring people here just to get what should be a basic human right :(

I hope this doesn't come across as offensive, as it's not meant that way....... I just keep thinking ""surely there are options that don't cost money.... or at least $1000's of dollars""

What about other countries?

It'd be good to get a little spreadsheet or something of what is available in different countries, or is there already something like that??

I've even gotten compliments from  my doctor(via video call) that I look like I'm doing better and my coworkers complimenting me on my skin.

I told my girlfriend. not the extent of it all, but that it was making me feel terrible physically and mentally, she doesn't drink at all so that's not really a biggie to her but it let's her know that I'm feeling serious about this. 

I also texted a few close friends, I told them a little more of the dirty details, heck some of those guys already knew more or less. 

I learned I need the support, they certainly can't be responsible for my actions but I know Id get questioned by them if they saw me take a drink, Ideally just the thought of that will stop me beforehand. 

my first day one went pretty well, couple months, my second one only about 2 weeks then I just lost it on a 4 day birthday bender. 

Still coming down from minor withdrawals, wasn't my worst bout of em at least though. Did feel terrible day 1, just kinda crappy today but I know I'll get some sleep at least, no sweats or shakes just some mild nausea stomach pains, and some bad GERD, been through much worse sad to say. 

I feel different having told people, it was good, even if not the whole of it, some of it I'm not sure if ever tell anyone but strangers online heh. 

But I'm here as midnight rolls through and starts my day 3.

I'm hopeful it will be my last day 3, I feel more motivated and having more support should help, but I can't slip back into my old ways. I can't moderate for shit, 1 drink makes we want 10 more, that leads to hair of the dog the next day and the cycle continues. 

Thanks for reading friends. Even nights where I was drinking this place helped. It's a constant motivation.

Being a gray area drinker (1/2 bottle to 3/4 wine most nights sometimes more) it’s not enough that people would ever think there’s a problem, I never get sloppy drunk, black out but it’s always on my mind. I watch the clock for happy hour daily and I use wine as my reward for getting through the day. Not to mention the “mommy wine” culture. It’s practically ingrained! I can’t tell you how many times I have tried to take weekdays off, or only drink 1 glass, Hahahaha. Always back to daily. So I think the struggle for me is that no one is like yes you need to quit, instead they are like you don’t have a problem. I often then think ok maybe they are right.

2020-09-20 00:28:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/iw7bjb/five_years/,Five Years,"Relatively new lurker to this sub, and I’m here out loud to mark the date on the public square, so to speak.  Nothing singularly miraculous in my recovery story or strategy, nor unique in my (long) trip to the bottom (with an express ticket to crash and burn land for the last leg) that ultimately lead to my getting back in control.  But turn around things did. 

5 years ago Friday the only reason I lived to see Saturday was that I was sufficiently drunk and high enough to think I had an extra night at the campsite I had rented for a final four day bender to top them all. After thoroughly planing out my offing myself in the woods, of course - note written, shotgun loaded and all.  That fateful miscalculation lead to a DWI (praise be to the Flying Spaghetti Monster that I didn’t hurt anyone else), and a two week detox in the county jail under suicide watch. Having been recently fired from my job, divorced for the second time, and my two youngish kids having moved a day’s car ride away, I was at a solid zero out of three on my own secret big three winning at life scorecard.  My Big Three rule, for the curious: You’re winning at life if you love what you do, love where you live, and love who you’re with. 3 out of 3 is wildly lucky, but usually tenuous; 2 is perfectly excellent, so shut your mouth if you're going to actually complain about whatever it is you think you don't have enough of - just go do one small thing today to help you get it instead. 

In October 2015, having not too much left to lose and zero plan for getting out of my hole, I put myself (intentionally) through a hard core state run rehab inpatient program that was more of a jail diversion/last ditch effort kind of joint than the club-esque rehab experiences I’d seen both my parents go through in my teens. Then on to a few months of lots and lots of outpatient help (talk it out people, talk it out, be honest, it helps). Got my license back and my foot in the door as a delivery driver for a farm to table food service company I’d long since admired - and only wished I’d had the opportunity (or balls) to try  time and time again on my long, trafficy, snarly commutes of yore.  Prior life I was 20 years into a suit and tie type career that had its share of great moments and colleagues, but was slowly killing my soul.  Drinking my way through that and my failing (second) marriage didn’t help, of course, but I’d drank my way pretty successfully through the first marriage and through a bunch of upwardly oriented professional positions. Plus by the end it was nowhere close to me just wanting to drink, or even remotely fun. I was sure I’d die if I stopped and die if I continued if nothing else intervened. Most other people I cared about had stopped trying to help or didn’t know how or I’d kicked them off my radar. At any rate, today I’m still at the farmy food gig with a whole lot of responsibility on my shoulders and running a decent piece of the action there. It’s not all unicorns and rainbows, especially in a pandemic, but I think we’re going to make it and I love everything about how I’m able to contribute to that. I live in a perfect for me converted old place out in the gorgeous countryside, and my commute is along a riverside road instead of a three lane highway.  Winter is knocking today, but there’s six cords of wood coming this week and I might treat myself to a 4x4 this season because I’ve been able to put extra money in the bank. I’m flying out to see my kids next weekend, and though I haven’t seen them since July (see COVID, above) they were with me for six straight weeks this summer. They both learned from me and saw more of what I’m really about and who I want to be than they ever have and that meant a lot to everyone. As for my relationships, I’d not looked for anything serious for 3-4 years until I could get my own shit squared away. It took as many to finally feel on top of my game emotionally and physically to consider myself presentable and present enough to give it another go. In the meantime, I’m in a perfectly wild mostly sexual arrangement whose details would burn off both your ears. There are a few new women poking around my edges, but I’m in no rush to add complexity. 

So the updated 2020 big three score is a solid (and not in a bad way complicated) 2-point-something on this fine Saturday night. As I said in the opener, nothing miraculous or even particularly lucky to my getting back on my feet. I did however, by being sober and keeping at it, give myself the tools and time to make my own luck. With a clear head, I’ve been able to focus on doing (mostly) the right things and have kept myself in the game. Good things have been coming in little and big ways ever since I got sober, whether I knew it or not - try to learn to recognize yours please. It can be hard to see them through the wreckage of whatever got or gets you to your turnaround point. For me, there was a metric fuckton of blame and shame and self-doubt as I wobbled around on my new recovery legs.  It’s still there of course, but mostly stays in the background these days. I’ve processed most of it to my internal satisfaction, and am much more mature and measured in my ability to deal with the stuff I’ll never be able to - or that other people in my life will never ever get over, much less understand.  It still takes a little practice being nice to myself, but that’s one of the bigger takeaways I’d pass along as a tidbit of wisdom I’ve picked up along the way.  

Thanks to everyone here that posts their stories, hopes, day ones, day 1000s, fuck ups, and success stories. I take away something good from all of them. Peace",17

First let me say that I couldn't have done it without the support of this community. This is a bit of a monologue about where I'm at right now...

These 8 months have been... insane. I've been so thankful actually to have made it this far through COVID without picking up a box of wine. And on top of that, four months ago, I moved across the country to start a new job, make new friends, and essentially get the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to start over with a clean slate.

Staying sober has gotten to the point where it's comfortable... if as complicated as ever. There's still that voice once in a while that speaks up and waxes about how 'maybe one day' I'll be able to drink with 'moderation.' I get through it by being strong in the moment and believing in myself enough to say that I'll be able to get through the next one. But fortunately I'm still fresh enough that walking through the wine aisle in the grocery store on my way to produce gives me a splitting headache at the thought of another sip.

I met this guy a month ago, and let's just say that he's the kind of person who's worth not fucking things up. I met him when I was 6 1/2 months into sobriety and still half-wondering if maybe I should focus more on my recovery and not my social life. But one date led to another, and here I am a month later, and I really like him.

Of course drinking came up; I mean no two people can make small talk for five minutes without discussing it. But I gave him the classic line ""I started drinking too much for my own good; not a lot at all, really, just to the point where I was craving a couple beers or a glass of wine every night so I decided to give it up."" This is horse shit of course. 

So now I'm wondering- when do I tell this guy about who I really am? *An addict who's not currently an alcoholic.* The part of me who took a chance on the relationship is the same part of me who believes that I can run 1,500 miles away from my past and arrive a changed person who'll never have to account for it. It's the same part of me that looked him in the eyes, delivered that lie above, and has since then demurred quietly at any mention of drugs or alcohol. 

I know I fucked up by lying, both directly and by omission, and that no one here will have a magic word that'll make everything perfect and picturesque. But I also know I'm not alone, and someone's been here before. What did you do?

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Ladies and Gents, I am back for round 2 of hosting DCI. I look forward to sharing a few things that I have been working through over the past several months. Hopefully you will find something helpful in this as well.

**The Dream of Flight**

>“We learn much by tribulation, and by adversity our hearts are made better.”  
>  
>\-Bishop Wright (father of Wilbur and Orville Wright)

Wilbur and Orville Wright were so fascinated by the idea of flying that even while operating their Dayton, Ohio bicycle shop, they spent a lot of their time in the intense study of flight.

They devoured any books and papers they could on how birds accomplished flight and those written by aspiring aviators at the time. They also corresponded directly with one such person, who had some limited success in building his own glider. Wilbur sketched ideas and built models out of cardboard boxes to show off to his family and friends.

They kept at this for about 4 years, until finally, in 1900, Wilbur and Orville Wright took a man carrying glider they had built in their bicycle shop to the Outer Banks of North Carolina. It was at Kitty Hawk and Kill Devil Hills that a dream took hold.

Their first trip to Kitty Hawk was a remarkable success. Wilbur recorded multiple 300 to 400-foot flights at speeds up to 30 miles per hour. Returning back to Ohio with glee, the brothers spent a year redesigning their glider with improvements.

The next year, their trip back to Kitty Hawk was an extreme disappointment.

Their first day of trials was full of mishaps. After a few days of adjustments, the glider performed as it did the previous year, but that was short-lived. A few days later, larger problems arose, and Wilbur crashed as a result. He escaped with only minor injuries, but Wilbur would declare on the trip back to Ohio, “Not in a thousand years would man ever fly.”

They had spent 5 years in this pursuit of flying. It seemed like it was all for nothing. Wilbur was as discouraged as ever, and it would have been reasonable for the brothers to give up. But resolve replaced discouragement in the matter of days.

A year later, in 1902, they took a newly designed glider back to Kitty Hawk with better than satisfactory results. And in 1903, they had a completely redesigned Flyer with a motor and propellers. At Kill Devil Hills, they flew for over half a mile with their longest flight recorded of 59 seconds. This was an astonishing thing at the time and would become the headline of many major newspapers around the country.

In the 4 years since taking their first glider to Kitty Hawk, they endured multiple disappointments and public ridicule and indifference over their actions. One of their assistants at Kill Devil Hills, John T. Daniels, would comment, “It wasn’t luck that made them fly; it was hard work and common sense; they put their whole heart and soul and all their energy into an idea and they had the faith.”

This would not be the end of their problems. But the adversity they experienced strengthened and prepared them for what was to come in the next 5 years.

The story culminates with one of the most beautiful moments 10 years from the time they took their first glider to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Wilbur and Orville had never flown together – not even once. Because of the danger, they never wanted to chance that at least one of them would be alive to carry on the work should a fatal crash happen.

In 1910, with Orville at the controls, Wilbur climbed in as his passenger and they took flight. “It seemed their way of saying they had accomplished all they had set out to do and so at last saw no reason to postpone any longer the thrill of flight,” as McCullough wrote.

On that same day, Bishop Wright, who had never been in one of his sons’ flyers, sat beside Orville with the crowd cheering him on. By this time, Wilbur had set a world record with a continuous flight over 2 hours and 20 minutes. For a man who never lost faith in his sons and helped in any way he could, the six minutes Bishop Wright was in the air had to be one of the greatest and proudest moments of his life.

These two moments happened because of how devoted these two people were to their dream. Wilbur and Orville had many chances to give up. There were years of painful moments. They endured ridicule and scorn. They had multiple crashes. Many failed attempts. And even in the darkest times, they never let go of their dream. They always had the courage to keep going. To keep their head down and not pay attention to those other voices.

Seneca once wrote, “I judge you unfortunate because you have never lived through misfortune. You have passed through life without an opponent - no one can ever know what you are capable of, not even you.”

It’s too easy to give in to fear and sit on the sideline wondering what could have been. To let our avoidance of misfortune dictate our use of an easier path. It takes courage to fail and keep standing up. It takes courage to let verbal scorn roll off our backs. And it absolutely takes courage to quit drinking and to find meaning in something other than what is inside of a bottle.

Our fear paralyzes us to the point of inaction if we let it. That’s all courage is – it’s taking action. No matter what anyone says about you, you are doing something to improve your life today – that is action. That’s why quitting alcohol is this superpower. You are doing this when others around you are too afraid to do the same.

Today, think about some other ways you can apply taking action. In what other areas can you stare into the face of adversity and keep working like Wilbur and Orville?

Not drinking with you today in San Antonio.

Just wanted to celebrate with you and give encouragement to anyone out there in the depths of despair, sobriety is out there, you can find freedom. I don’t know what finally clicked for me, I was a real piece of work in the end. I didn’t give a shit about anything, including my own life. I prayed to die, just for the pain to stop. One of the last bottles of vodka I bought, my hands were shaking so bad I couldn’t enter my PIN number. I wasn’t playing little games anymore where I would quit here and there. I couldn’t stop. I avoided eye contact with myself in mirrors, I was so fucking disgusting. I feel sick to my stomach thinking about how I felt back then. I was just a sack of skin filled with vodka pretending to be alive. Sometimes I think I’ve pretended most of my life. It feels good to just let the real words and feelings out. Things aren’t perfect now, but they are real. My brain is clear. I am present. I am sober. I am becoming who I was meant to be all along. I am finally free. And I hope for anyone out there struggling that you know a better life is closer than you think. It does get better. Even when you think you can’t possibly quit. You can. What you seek is seeking you. Here’s to another day sober. Thanks everyone.",64

2020-09-19 22:01:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/iw5awk/maybe_some_day_down_the_road/,"Maybe, some day, down the road?","I posted a current photo of myself on Facebook today, noting that it was me on Day 27 of no alcohol (and down 14 pounds). I did not exactly say, “I am a drunk and I am in recovery,” but still it was the first time any of my Facebook friends had heard of my intention not to drink for some period of time at least.

A friend posted, “you need a beer,” and I posted in reply to him, “maybe, some day, down the road.” 

And I keep thinking about that.

In my 40’s I was a craft beer nut, and I loved it.  I got to know all the styles, including the odder Belgian ones (sour ales, wild yeast ales, lambic).  I collected specialty beer glasses, looked forward to special editions being released, the whole thing.

That was back when I was a functioning alcoholic, before my tolerance got too high.  And I am thinking today about how/when that changed.  

I moved from stalking the beer store shelves, looking for something new and intriguing, to just running in and grabbing a couple six packs of the same high alcohol content IPA (7.2 %) that I would always get, much of which I would drink that night.

My drinking moved from a hobby to a drug fix.

I found myself wondering today if after some long period of sobriety (maybe, some day, down the road) I might be able to return to that curious and not yet alcoholic Phil who loved to try new and crazy beers and did not fall asleep on the couch every night.  

And I just don’t think so.  

It’s a little sad, but I think that I would chew up my reset lower booze tolerance in about a week, and be right back where I was within a fortnight.

It’s OK.  It was fun while it lasted.  And a large part of being sober is being cool with letting stuff go.

Happy sober Saturday night to all of you.",68

I don’t drink every day neither do I have the urge to. It’s only when I drink though that I create all the problems that I have in my life. When I drink 1 beer I have the urge/craving to drink another and another and another...until something bad happens. I’m done with the Russian roulette. I went to AA for the first time today and it felt great I even was able to share a little bit of my story briefly. Afterwords someone who was a little older than I came up to me and told me how he had the sane problem as me! Whenever he drank he couldn’t help but drink more until something bad happened. I’m hopeful looking forward to the future I just hope I can keep this same attitude it usually doesn’t last I need it to stick this time. Maybe AA will do that for me.,26

I knew it was gonna be a blow out so I told my one cousin and my friends I had to work. It was a lie, I just said that basically cause I know there was gonna be heavy drinking and cocaine going around. I told my self maybe ill just go and tell my friends im not drinking but the more I thought about it I guess I just said its probably better i dont go.  I've been having fomo i guess so I texted my other cousin to see if he wanted to do something just play some Xbox or something hang out but he said he was hungover and prolly just gonna go out again with his buddies. So i stopped by my parents house and my gf and my dad and I ended up going to dinner, the whole time I was kind of having fomo it was a nice dinner food was good. I went to order a guiness I said out loud to my dad and gf maybe ill just have one and asked if my dad was gonna get a drink he said no, and said maybe you should chill to. And I did nobody drank dinner was nice like I said but I felt like something was missing. I'm happy I didn't drink ive been feeling good but I guess I feel like i was missing the social part more and seeing my buddies im happy I didn't go because its still fresh from not drinking. But I kind of wish I could have gone and just stuck to it i cut my self short i guess cause I just didn't want the temptation period. Anyway just a rant I know im doing what's right ill feel good tomorrow and I'm sure these feelings will pass. Been reading this naked mind and it touches on exactly this, and its true im not really craving the booze. Even at dinner I think I just felt like maybe I can have one and im sure I could with that company but I'm.happy I didnt. Iwndwyt.

Quite quickly I realised this was going to be a piss up. People had byo’d their own drinks to drink during the ceremony, after the ceremony there was a fridge and cooler stuffed with drinks and when these ran out there was an open bar. Within an hour or so almost everybody was drunk and my brain was trying to justify how one drink wouldn’t hurt, I’d still be less drunk than everyone there, I deserve it for being a month sober, I could keep it at one. I did not have that drink and I ended up leaving early but I still managed to talk to my partners friends and had really nice conversations I can actually remember rather saying something inappropriate and embarrassing myself.

Well, as the post says, my partner just drove home from town after he'd been drinking.  We live about 30 minutes outside of town, all along back windy roads.  I've expressed to him time and time again how much that bothers/ scares me- I had a boyfriend die in a car accident 6 years ago, so it's a super specific fear of mine.  I just don't know what to do.  I've looked into Al-Anon meetings, but I just don't really feel like I fit in over there, having been someone who abused drugs/alcohol for so long.  Which makes it hard for me to know what to say- just last year, I was a person making terrible decisions while under the influence, so I get it.  But anytime I've expressed my concern to him about this kind of thing, he's made it clear to me he sees zero issues with his drinking.  For background, he drinks almost every day, at least a couple of cocktails.  On the weekends it's common that he's getting drunk both days. He doesn't usually cause problems when drunk, just the usual loud and (to me) a little annoying.  I don't know what I'm looking for here, I guess I just needed a place to put this out there to people who are also sober- I do not have any sober people in my life.  Thanks for listening.",2

So this morning I was flying home after the work trip from hell. The whole week I had 3 other people with me in one house (our owners elected to get an air bnb instead of hotel rooms for cost purposes). So even after work I was around as these guys drank fucking constantly. I sat on my laptop in my room planning my next day’s work as they blasted music and continued to drink more and more, treating this week as a week being 19, not working towards our own multi million dollar units we run. It also threw off my daily routine and diet I was just getting down and was starting to really love here back home. They drove down there, I flew (I spent out of my own pocket because my gut told me they would just be road trip drinking the whole 10 hours, and they did). 

So this morning, after a week from hell, a week out of my comfort zone, a week of white knuckling, I get dropped off at the airport. TSA is backed up, I’m surrounded by screaming children, and the absolute dogshit diet I’ve had to endure the past week is kicking my stomach’s ass. I catch my first flight, and then get to my hour and a half layover. All the healthy places aren’t open, but there’s a Pizza Hut open, fuck it. My diet has already been shit and I just need some food. So I sit down at the Pizza Hut, quickly order some food, and the lady goes “and to drink? We *do* have a full bar, sir”. 

I chuckled and didn’t even realize it, but I said “no thank you, ma’am. I actually don’t drink. But I’ll take a coke or Pepsi, whichever you have”. 

And as she walked off I *felt* the win. I felt the win of overcoming the whole week, I felt my neck and shoulders that had been clenched the whole last week naturally relax, I felt that deep breath that you don’t even mean to but it’s so satisfying. I felt genuine joy. 

Ladies and gentlemen, if you’re struggling or having a tough go of it today.....it’s worth it to keep fighting. You CAN do it. You might not feel that win right now, you might not feel it today, this weekend, or this upcoming week. It might be when your family tells you how proud they are of you, or when you pay off that debt, or fix that relationship and get that second chance. Hell, It might be in the most random moment in an airport eating shitty processed food talking to a stranger. But eventually you will, and when you do....you’ll enjoy it so much. Why? 

Because you fucking deserve it, and have earned it. 

Keep Fighting

I hope you're all well.

I'm approaching day 13. Which for me will be the furthest I've been sober in many years. A few months back I reached day 12 and fell off the wagon. 

It's not so much about the counter that my concerns lie. I feel like I'm on a good path right now and I don't want it to end. I felt something was different this time in terms of sobriety sticking. I'm just petrified by the idea of relapsing and losing all I've gained in the past 10 days. I can see my future and the person I can become if I stay on the road of sobriety. I don't want to lose that. Can anyone relate? I'm just worried I'll fall off. I feel like I need a plan to make sure it never happens. I'm still getting urges to drink and frankly I'm not sure if I'm using will power or if I've really changed in wanting to drink. Anyway. Things are positive at the moment just wanted to let that out.

It's been a good day I started watercolor painting this evening for the first time. Loved it. Also made a short film in the afternoon! Feeling positive. 

Goodnight people

I have a question for those of you who've been doing this for a while. What techniques or tasks or tools or whatever, do you recommend for people in the early days of sobriety? What do you think it's useful for people to try or think about when everything is new?  


I've seen people talk about ""running the tape forward"" which seems like it's reasonably self-explanatory (imagine what it'll be like in an hour/three hours/eight hours if I drink - is that right?). Are there other things like that you use?

  
For context: I'm 19 or so days into this endeavor. I'm also in my first few weeks of grad school, so trying to keep up with all my classes and coursework is keeping me busy, but every now and then the overwhelm just crashes over me and I'm not sure what to do.",3

When I had a chance, I played the tape forward. Sure, that beer would have done exciting things in my brain but it would have opened the door. I have to drive home, I'm not even sure if i would buy another beer today... but the door would be opened a crack, and that's all my addictive drive needs to seep in. Maybe a week, maybe a month, but there would have been another excuse for a craft beer... then another, and another, and at some point I'm back to active addiction.

I had over six lbs of sludge in my guts and was days away from going septic and dying.   I spent almost 2 weeks in the hospital total and am now on a soft diet for god knows how long.  It was the absolute most painful and worst experience of my life.  Hydro morphine didn’t even help with the pain. I’ve now lost 28 lbs in 13 days and my pancreas pain is ripping me apart and will continue for about 4 month they estimate.

I got some solid sleep last night, woke up at 6:00 a.m., and actually wanted to get out of bed. I got a lot done around the house and had some great conversations with the family. 

I wouldn't say the last 10 days have been easy, but they've not been quite as awful as I thought they would be, mostly because I have felt so terrible that I couldn't even summon the energy to want to drink. Today I'm happy. I feel healthier. The weather is gorgeous. I'm in a good mood for the first time in I don't know how long, and I am massively triggered because of it. 

Past attempts have taught me that this is my true danger zone. I get a few days or weeks down, I start feeling a lot better, and that is my cue to go right back to it. I have been using all of the tools available to me to talk myself down. I do not want to go back to drinking. I do not want to go back to feeling the way I felt just a few weeks ago or even a few days ago. I feel good, and I want to keep it that way.

I just needed to vent, I think, get this out in the open. It feels funny to be wishing I felt worse, but alcoholism has turned everything upside down for me. Just knowing that your support is here is a blessing. I may even try to check out the chat room later if it gets really bad.

I can get through this. I can fight it. I can move past it. I know I can because I've been reading comments and posts from so many of you here who have already done it. I didn't think I was going to be able to say this but I'm going to because I NEED to -- IWNDWYT. Fuck me.",19

I drank heavily and embarrassingly through the duration of lockdown. The one sort of ""light"" was a guy I started talking to who lives in another country but with whom I have a ton in common and found very easy to talk to. This lowkey flirtation honestly carried me through the summer. Today I found out for sure that he has a partner he did not mention. I did the thing you aren't supposed to do and googled her, compared myself to her, and automatically felt so pathetic. I could have had that kind of life of excellence and love and promise, I once had it, but then I became an addict. And I lost the best years of my life to it. Normally I'd go to the market and buy alcohol right now, or I'd find someone to go out with and drink until I'd blackout, but I guess I'm going to stay sober. I guess getting drunk until blacking out, and waking up alone and filled with anxiety and regret and depression would be worse. At least now I can start to build a life I can be proud enough to let someone into someday, I just feel like whoever I'll meet won't be the same. It won't be young love. I will be settling. It will be scarred and less full of that feeling of possibility. I don't know. But IWNDWYT.

I don’t drink every day but I have been drinking heavily since Dec 2017. There would be days where I would drink throughout the day but then two or three days would go by before I drank again. At one point, I went 5 days drinking but again, there would be a two to three days break before I picked it back up again. 

Since COVID-19 hit, I realized my intake was starting to increase a lot more & I would drink to blackout to assist with my insomnia. Vodka, wine, beer, you name it. I was so good at sneaking behind my partner’s back that it was terrible. So I decided to quit cold turkey after my hangover on Wed 9/16 without consulting a doctor. I didn’t know I needed to do that cause this is my first time & I didn’t research it first so that was really naive & ignorant on my part. I could’ve hurt myself & brought my family extreme pain. So I am extremely thankful that my symptoms have just been really mild. After the hangover, I experienced night sweats & tremors only.

currently 7 months sober. I have been dealing with some guilt lately. I've started dreaming about a girl I have mistreated. She loved me 100% and I simply used her to feel better about myself.

I am happy for her.  

I still feel guilty about what I have done. But there is nothing I can do about it. I simply have to accept it and go on with my life. Stopping drinking has helped me to accept things. At least I am now mature enough to accept this and to move forward.

Life has a lot of trying moments - and when you're a binge drinker due to emotional distress of any sort, saying no constantly weighs on you alone. 

Within the last 25 days, I've had financial struggles, a Covid scare for my grandmother, regular life stresses that feel more intense because of the other stress I'm already dealing with. I've played DD, served alcohol to others (party), and spent time around those drinking. I chose to get sober in 2020 and that alone is ridiculous - but if I can get sober this year, then I can truly achieve anything. 

So here I am, 25 days sober.  I haven't given in to that dreadful liquid that turns me into a person I don't even recognize anymore.  I'm proving to myself every day that I am much stronger than I realize.

What's interesting is that once I did have a few drinks I found I didn't like the feeling.  In a way maybe this slip up wasn't all bad.  Comparing the past 4 days to last night is enlightening.

We are shorthanded, at times overwhelmed. Yesterday I just had it with everyone. I looked to put people straight and get in their face- get them to stop fucking with me. (Long story short- interim boss is disingenuous. She decided we were to go to a funeral of a guy who died in our department. Didn't ask, just said we're going. I felt she overstepped and told her so in harsh terms. She denied ever saying we had to go, and was really bitchy, halfway apologized and said ""Take it or leave it."" thus ending the argument. I tossed in some barbs but at that point she was closed off.) 

So I got home and the guilt set in. I'm a guy and felt bad that I had let loose on a woman. Apologized to her. Kept turning over the conversation in my mind, like a dog with a bone. Things aren't going to be the same for a while, at least until the next scandal sets in.  

Slept poorly last night, and just before waking up had the drinking dream many of you have experienced. The gist of mine was that I drank to allay the feelings- and being here on Stopdrinking, resetting my badge. Vividly saw the smiley faced ""1"".

I'd get trashed one night, be hungover and not drink the next day, start feeling better the day after and then I'd either drink that night or the following night, rinse repeat.  I was overweight, anxious, working in a shit job in a city where I could barely afford rent.  My life seemed stagnant and small back then, I tried everything to make it better (workout, eat healthier, therapy, etc.) except quitting drinking because I didn't identify as an alcoholic.  In college, I was caught drinking whiskey in the commons and had to take an alcohol education class.  There was a portion of that class that identified symptoms of alcoholism, and I remember thinking ""this is stupid, I do all these things and I'm not an alcoholic, and everyone in college is drinking the same way I am.""  Well, I was wrong.  Reflecting back, I was one of the few people who drank the way I did.  I thought everyone else was drinking to get obliterated just like I was, now I realize that I was the super drunk guy at the bar/party and I was just too smashed to realize how far gone I was compared with everyone else.  I thought going to grad school and becoming a professional would iron out my drinking habit, but my drinking only got worse with time.

&#x200B;

I've told the story of how I got sober on here a lot, it helps me remember why I still don't drink after +1300 days, especially when the question of moderation starts bouncing around my head.  Long story short, I had a string of dark benders that sent me to rock bottom, made me realize that I'm an alcoholic, and I was lucky/determined enough to stick with not drinking for a first year and half when sobriety was still an active struggle.  

&#x200B;

When I was still drinking, I remember wanting to be married, to be fit, and to make a good living.  I remember thinking how far off I was from achieving those goals and that my life in that state wasn't positioned to give me the future I wanted.  I am now three years, nine months and nineteen days sober, and I am so grateful to share that I am engaged to a kind, generous, beautiful woman (who wouldn't have given me the time of day if I was still drinking).  I also found my baseline fitness and no longer have to eat like a saint to maintain my weight, and I found a job in a new city that gives me a good living.  I am 100% confident that none of these things would have happened if I was still drinking.  I am so grateful for the moment of humility that caused me to give up alcohol, and the seed of that moment has grown into a beautiful life that I never would have thought possible for myself.  I wish for you all to live the life you dream for yourself.  Quitting drinking may not be the only obstacle between now and then, but I guarantee that it will put you on a path where that life is possible.  Best of luck, stay strong, and IWNDWYT.",143

Moderation doesn't work for me, that's for sure, it's a slippery slide from one drink to cheap box wine and forgetting if everyone had a bath last night. It's a cycle I've been through a lot of times, with a week or two sober in between.

I'm not a bad drunk, I play silly games and generally take care of business, and I always seem to bounce back the next day and catch up everything I let slide.

I drink when I'm stressed, and when I'm depressed. But I have three kids so I'm always stressed, and I've been through some stuff with my ex wife who has Borderline Personality Disorder which leaves me pretty prone to depression.

I need a place I can talk about it, count the days, and try stay strong.

So I'm here, and it's day one, and look it's already 4 pm so that's almost one down. The tricky bit will be in a week when I start feeling okay again, not scared anymore.

(17 year old male) So after being super addicted, like couldn’t get through a morning without a couple hits (like 12) of my pen I was able to get sober around thx giving and lasted until beginning of quarentine. Well went back into it cuz I was lonely and depressed but only did it at night but still was addicted and then went to the mental hospital after a fight w my parents about it and came back with a new mindset. It was exactly what I needed and since June 23rd I’ve been sober and blessed. Now I’ve been working out consistently and started a working out instagram and this caused people to ask for advice and there’s this one stoner who asked me to help him lift. Today I was with him and he gave me a ride instead of biking because it was leg day and biking uphill after leg day is hell. He drove me home and on the way picked up a girl who was going to buy him alcohol and in the past if I fell off it was because I had a drink and I was super tempted to ask for one even though he is supportive of my sobriety and he wouldn’t let me. Then he picked up more of his stoner friends and I remebered why I stopped. They looked skinny and unhealthy while I’m decently big and strong and much healthier. They were only talking about drugs which I hated. I got so bored of just talking about weed. They were talking about how they don’t have money and shit and I been able to save up over $7000 thx to my parents not letting me have access because they knew I would spend that shit on drugs, I just keep working at my job and they save for me. I’m motivated and started a business and been working out I can bench 225 for reps at 165 lbs. I’m proud of how far I’ve gone and I’m proud I didn’t do anything I would regret but that temptation still haunts me.

They didn't actually have a drink section, but as I placed my order they had some drinks available as add-ons. They had sprite, coke for $2.50 or something reasonable. The last option was ""sweet tea, y'all"" for $9. They sell family size dinners so I thought FUCK YES load me UP with that sweet tea! I clicked it excitedly and finalized everything.

But after I finished it I couldn't help but wonder. I joked to my partner that it'd better be plenty of sweet tea for $9. He thought that sounded unreasonable, so I thought it'd be a good idea to check the restaurant's menu directly to be safe. There it was. ""Sweet tea, y'all"" a mixed drink. They didn't even have normal sweet tea on the DoorDash menu, just the mixed drink. It wasn't labeled as alcoholic, either. 

I called the restaurant and they removed it from my order, sending me a normal sweet tea for free. I'm grateful that they were so chill about it. But what the actual fuck? I can't even order take-out without double checking that maybe something I'm buying has alcohol? I'm actually super pissed and wanted to share so this doesn't happen to anyone else.

I wanted to take a picture! Obviously I didn’t, but I gotta tell you: compared to the neon toxic yellow and black sludge it was like a gift-wrapped present in the toilet.

How have you guys dealt with self validating your choices when you don’t have significant people in your life to share your milestones with?

""Ah come on man, I prefer you when you've had a drink""

He's a good guy and I think it was mostly meant in jest (luckily I don't have a bad drunk personality). But part of why I was drinking so much was because of social anxiety and to loosen me up in social situations (often ending up drinking a whole bottle of rum). 

It stung a little bit at the time. In a weird way supporting the idea that I should drink for people to enjoy my company. I of course know that's ridiculous and I've not taken it to heart. 

But wondering if anyone else has similar experiences. Or even the opposite?

 ""When did you lose control over alcohol"".  I was never in control. I've never had a ""healthy"" relationship with alcohol. There were times when I was able to moderate but it was fucking hard and the negative thoughts were still there. Strong and Hateful. I have two beautiful children.

I would sneak bottle pulls during the day and refill it on the sly, I would sneak bottles out back to my shed and drink there, drink 2 or 3 beers for every 1 she thought I was having... plus all the other countless times she knew something was up but couldn't put her finger on it. She was right to be suspicious.

My problem is that even though I haven't had a drink in 6 mos, being accused of it still freaks me out and puts me on edge. I think ""what are the circumstances here? How bad does this look? What was I doing that made her think this?"" Like, most recently I was cleaning around the liquor cabinet (I know I know.. temptation. It actually fuels my desire not to drink to have the challenge so we keep it) and she noticed one of the bottles had been moved. I explained that I was cleaning and I must have moved it but the circumstances so happened to be that I was home alone, and I found out later the battery in the security camera we have in the house that has that area in view had a dead battery. Not a good look... Thank goodness I have truth on my side but I'm sure she can see it on my face that I still go into a small panic.

I know the best thing to do is to avoid incriminating situations, but every once in awhile they're unavoidable (this one was TOTALLY avoidable I just didn't think it through). Regardless, I've been doing really good and have been kind of proud of myself for sticking with it, but being accused is pretty demoralizing. I know I deserve it, and it will take time for her to get past it, but it still sucks. 

I'm wondering... how do you guys deal with it?",6
2020-09-18 18:26:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ivg2rv/thoughts_on_my_first_birthday/,Thoughts on my first birthday,"Well, it's been one seriously shit trip around the sun but here I am.

I'm often told in meetings that I'm so lucky to have seen the writing on the wall and nipped my rapidly developing problem in the bud at such an early stage in my life. That's true, and in itself I'm grateful for that.

What's also true is that nobody comes to the rooms because their life's going great, and I walked into that first meeting an utterly broken man and it took me until about a month ago to pick up the pieces. And I deeply resent that I had to lose what I did in order to come to my senses and truly understand that I needed to change.

I swear I had an out of body experience in that meeting, a moment of pure ""fuck me, I'm really in an AA meeting. I'm a cautionary tale at 24"".
Don't be put off if you have that moment. As time progressed it felt more and more normal, and eventually meetings became a place of refuge for me on the hardest days (even if I was the youngest in the room by 15 years).

Somewhere along the line in my short but intense drinking career, the booze became a place for me to hide from my emotions. And somewhere during my formative years I conflated stoicism with shoving things down and took the latter to be a virtue. Doesn't take a genius to realise the two of those together were a bomb waiting to go off in my life.

I didn't act like a lunatic, hurt myself, hurt the people I love, and damage relationships every time I drank, but every time that happened I had been drinking.

I tried taking breaks and cutting down many times, it never worked, I'd end up where I left off sooner or later.
Every. Single. Time.
In the end, I realised my only option was to say ""You know what? Fuck this, never again""

I'm afraid I don't have any great advice, I was fortunate enough to make this decision before any serious physical dependency sank its teeth into me so I've got by with being a stubborn little psychopath.

Between a brutal breakup and all the joys of this pandemic the year has been a real struggle for me without my favourite emotional crutch.
But I'm a soldier and I love a good fight, it's fucking mega.

Here's to all the sober years to come. IWNDWYT.",9

I want so badly to pull myself together again and be the best version of myself that I can be. Sorry for the rant.,"This is my (22F) first official post on this subreddit and also my first official post on reddit ever.  Usually I just scroll through reading what other people post and comment, but I feel burdened and overwhelmed from the pressure I have been under to hide my drinking, while simultaneously keeping up with all my responsibilities.  I have an extensive family history of alcoholism, however, this forewarning has not done much to keep me from following suit.

I went to rehab when I was 18 for reasons entirely unrelated to alcohol.  However, since then I have picked up the habit in an attempt to abstain from other vices.  Obviously this was a mistake, but at the time I was really desperate and didn't know how to handle cravings, temptations, desires, etc.  I left rehab AMA and so was understandably unprepared.  I just wanted to start university and get my life back together.

I am on track to graduate this fall with two degrees, I recently had a paper published in journal, I am on my university's debate team, I have a 3.8 GPA, and I am preparing to take the GRE in a week for grad school applications.  With this said, my entire experience at university has been plagued with binge drinking; this included occasionally going out with my coworkers for a drink after work, but mostly drinking alone in my dorm room.  None of my academic friends and peers know about my drinking as it is something I am pretty ashamed of.  I put in significant effort towards maintaining the facade of an ideal, poster-child student.  This could not be farther from the truth.

Last summer was especially bad.  I got a job bussing tables at a bar that was located in a part of town with a bar on every corner.  I started drinking every night and would drive home drunk--something I am especially ashamed of now.  It got to the point where I passed out on the sidewalk outside of a bar, thankfully someone called my mom and told her to come pick me up.  In October, I had a seizure after a night out for seemingly no reason at all, but even this was not enough for me to stop.

In February of this year I went out with some of my roommates and someone spiked my drink.  Fortunately, the friends I was with really took care of me but it was quite traumatizing, nonetheless.  This event changed things for me--it was as if, for the first time, I saw my situation with complete clarity.  The event acted as an aversion tactic; the night after my drink was spiked I was violently sick.  Not only did the thought of drinking make me nauseous, but it made me feel unsafe drinking.  So, I decided to completely stop.

For the first couple weeks, I really managed to get myself together.  Around March we were kicked out of the dorms due to Covid, so I moved back in with my mom.  Being in quarantine was a less than ideal time to try to get sober.  I quickly felt isolated and lost.  For the first time I was not going to work, class, or hanging out with my friends.  I had so much empty time that I didn't know what to do with, so I started drinking again.

Now, it is September.  I moved back into the dorms and found myself back at square one--drinking all day, everyday.  I always tell myself I will have one or two beers, but then I have another, and another, and then finally resort to stashes of vodka I have hidden.  I decided that I wanted to stop drinking again as things always seem to rapidly become unmanageable and out of control.  All I think about is drinking from the moment I wake up.  I feel like a fraud.

Today is my third day sober.  I want so badly to pull myself together again and be the best version of myself that I can be.  Sorry for the rant.",83

2020-09-18 16:38:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ive3dk/just_venting/,Just venting,"I've been partying for the last 10 years. Now that I've stopped drinking (2 months) and stopped smoking cannabis (4 days) I feel this massive sadness. I stopped drinking last August 2019, but have had a few weeks here and there where I'd drink because I just wasn't ready to give it up. I'm sure this feeling of despair is because I substituted my drinking with smoking so I haven't been able to feel my emotions in so long. I just don't comprehend what I'm feeling. I feel so sad. I don't know how else to describe it. I don't want to do anything. I've been crying throughout the day since Tuesday. Just a tangle of emotions.

&#x200B;

I know this is the direction I want and I'm thankful for this part of my journey; that at least I'm feeling something. But it sucks. Not much more to it.

&#x200B;

I started therapy at the end of June and by now we've started to really get into the meat of my childhood traumas. I can now see why I chose to numb myself so much. My mom was verbally abusive throughout my childhood and for the longest time, I didn't think it really affected me. When I finally moved out of her house to my dad's, I finally felt at peace...I thought. I was explosive at times and ruined quite a few relationships and friendships because of it, but never realized how much I was running away from myself.

&#x200B;

I began partying more by age 21 and it really took off from there. I remember at age 22 having the thought that I didn't want to drink one night, since I noticed I'd been drinking a lot in the evenings and even going to some of my night classes drunk. I was toward the end of college and kinda not giving a fuck. But I didn't want to drink one evening and realized I couldn't not drink because I wanted to too much. I thought, ""that's a problem for future me"". At this period in time, my grandparents were dying too. They both died within 6 months of each other. They were my mom's parents and after they died, she got sober. But not really, now that I look at it. She still smokes cannabis all of the time. I've got nothing against cannabis, I really like it, but to me there's something wrong with not being sober ever.

&#x200B;

Anyway, here I am. Future me. Dealing with this problem. I'm really glad I am. I've never felt more authentic to myself. But I feel so sad. I realize I'm really early on in this journey. I put off stopping cannabis same as I put off stopping drinking. Anyway....all this to say is I'm sad and I know I just have to weather this storm for now.

&#x200B;

In conclusion, I'm reaching out here because if there's anything I've learned from this community, it's to rely on your sober community. And later on I'm going to volunteer to get out of my head. I'm glad for that. But for now I'm sad and I get to feel that for once. And it sucks...

&#x200B;

One last thing: I know how important community is in the sober journey but this has absolutely been the hardest piece for me. Because of the trauma I endured, I am extremely guarded and suspicious of others. This makes it incredibly hard to be approachable and open up to others. I've realized that anytime I do open up to someone, I want to cry immediately. It feels like it doesn't take much to make me cry in simple conversations. I plan to bring this up with my therapist because it pains me to feel so isolated and struggle to connect with others. I do have some friends but many of them are no longer in my life because of their drinking habits. I just feel sort of lost. I take solace in the fact that I'm learning who I actually am and what it means to be genuine to my truest self.",7

We normally drink together when we game. I was sitting there with my ice water itching to pour a glass of something almost the entire time.  Something felt off, like I wasn't in the 'zone' with them, I was not getting the full comradery effect.

For context, my wife had a 10 hour day so I cleaned the kitchen, cooked a steak, and bought her a bottle of wine while at the store.  I poured her a glass (because she can moderate and I can't) and I just kept eyeballing the mostly full bottle on the counter.  Sitting at my computer I was CONSTANTLY battling the urge to drink.  After an hour of this constant itch to go pour myself a glass and 'relax with the friends and wife' I vocalized how I was struggling and my wife got up, poured out her glass, and the bottle without me even asking.  After that the urge almost vanished.  

We identified that if it is in the house, I am going to obsess about it.  And if we don't have it in the house, I do not crave it so much.  My wife is wonderful and said she'd rather not drink at home if it's going to be easier for me and that she can have a drink if we go out to dinner, which won't be any time soon due to COVID.   She is amazing and I am lucky she is in my life to help me through this.  

I am already sick and tired of the cravings. I woke up mad today and the only reason I can think of why, is because I denied myself alcohol last night.  Like that part of my brain is pissed it didn't get what it wanted and now I am just in a bad mood.  I hate it.

I enjoy doing so much, and unfortunately that does include drinking.. However, the list of what I can do ends immediately if I add alcohol to the mix.

Can I exercise and be creative?  Yes.  Can I be creative and go for a drive?  Yes.  Can I enjoy a show/movie and exercise?  Yes.  Can I be around my friends and loved ones while being creative?  Yes.  Can I share myself more completely while being with friends and loved ones?  Yes.

The moment I try and add drinking into that mix, the answer drops to a hard ""No"", and only the addiction fights for a ""But..!""  Sure, drinking and drawing can be fun, and yeah watching a show while drinking has it's moments.. But I remember my significant other asking me questions about when I was watching one of her favorite shows on my own and she asked about a peak plot twist, and I was past out before it got to it, and I had to fib around it.  Because of my drinking.  It eats at me, to this day, and it was around 2 years ago when I was in the peak of my problem.  I hate how it makes me feel, and I hate that I let it continue as long as I did.

I write these things out because when the cravings get a bit much, the more time I separate from myself and the drink, I'm able to bring myself back to why I decided to leave that part of me behind to begin with.  It's a broken, twisted cycle and I resign myself from it, at least for today.

I've been cooking more, just because I have the energy and time. Yesterday I thought, you know, I'd love to cook a steak, have a baked potato, that sounds delicious. It was around 4 pm (danger zone for habitual thoughts). Walked to the store, thinking about cooking the steak, eating the steak, and about halfway to the store, I suddenly was thinking about the bottles of wine I always drank with steak. Then I really started thinking about it, and before I stepped in the store I was freaking tf out. Everything felt dangerous, I could see the wine in my head, I could see the empty bottles, I could remember viscerally all the steak dinners that have ended drunk. This was a mental war with myself. Do not buy wine, you are not drinking wine tonight, you are NOT buying wine - but I was really struggling. 

So on the spot, I said, nope, no steak. Rushed through the store grabbing a few things, booked it to the check out and split. Went home with no steak but also no wine. Yesterday was a true fight, and I didn't even see it coming. 

Lesson for me: Do not go to the store at 4 PM with a plan to buy food that I always got drunk with. That's asking for it. I'll get there eventually, some day in the future, but not yet. Man, yesterday was a real fight but I did it.",187

So that was that. It hasn’t been terribly hard for me to not drink, and now, almost two years later, I am craving that place you go when you drink. Nothing quite gets you there like a bottle of wine after the kids go to sleep. Dry mouth, stained teeth, and a fuzzy head. Why after all this time am I now craving a sip of wine?

It’s time to face my demons, admit my problem, forgive myself, and join a supportive community.

Here I am, a 40-year old executive in the non-profit world, in a fulfilling romantic relationship, with a large network of friends and family — but I’ve turned to alcohol as a means to extinguish anxiety and unhappiness. I know I’m not alone in that.

Over the past few years, however, alcohol has begun to increase my anxiety; it leaves me shameful and depleted, and my go-to solution has been to drink more. Some days, I pour a glass of wine before starting work, just so that I can alleviate the guilt felt over the previous day’s drinks.

That may have happened today.

Actually, that did happen today.

But I’m tired of this pattern. I want to change. I know that I can muster up the wherewithal to overcome my addiction, but I also know I’ll need support and help. (Hence, my move from long-time Reddit lurker to poster!)

I have so much more to say — like how tired I am of refilling bottles to prevent my partner seeing how much I’ve drank (although he probably knows!) — but I’ll end for now. Thanks for reading, and for helping me to feel less alone in this struggle.",128

That's not my sobriety date, but it was the last moment I refused to acknowledge that my alcoholism was a problem. During the time between then and today's date of that year, I was very confused. I drifted in and out of meetings. I read books about alcoholism. I bought whiskey and put it away for ""emergencies.""

Trouble is, when you're an alcoholic like me, every goddamn day is an emergency. Or, if not an emergency, a celebration. I drank because I wanted things to change to my liking. Other times, I drank because I was afraid of change. For me, there was never any difficulty finding a reason to get drunk.

But today, I can say that the reasons to get sober are many. I don't have to hide the amount of my drinking anymore. I don't have to refill the decanter from a hidden stash, because the falling level would draw my wife's suspicion. I don't have to worry, when we go to the beach for a week, about finding a place to hide my empties. If I am really lucky, my two kids will not remember a time when Daddy often drove them around town drunk. 

Most of all, I am allowed to live in the present tense. I can dwell in a world and among people who don't always behave the way I think they should. I can forgive them. And some days, I have to. God knows, if I had been drinking in 2020, it might've killed me.

I lurk a lot in this sub, and I read often of people who are wary of AA. For me, it was the God thing. I didn't like religion, and didn't like people who practiced it. Even if they called it ""spirituality."" Having said that, I could see early on that the meetings were helping me. And so I made some mental concessions that allowed me to keep going without abandoning all my beliefs. The biggest one of which was acknowledging that if there is no God, then it sure as hell ain't me. The higher power can be abstract and that's fine. I spent a lot of time overthinking it and when I look back, it really just set me back. 

I am sober today in large part today through talking to people, in person, at meetings. But I know from reading this sub, that's not the only way. Do what works. Don't sweat the slip-ups. And stay in the moment. When I get bent out of shape about something, I often ask my self, Am I doing perfectly okay at this moment? The answer is almost always yes. The world may end tomorrow, but we can at least not drink today. That's what I'll be doing. And I wish you all the same.",42

There was a point where I would run 7 miles in a day just so I could drink the six pack after work. I still gained weight, but not as much as I would have. 

For the last 2 years I have been drinking hard seltzers instead of beer. I am 17 days alcohol free, but it is Friday, and Fridays are hard. 

As it turns out, I do the same things whether I am drinking or not. The difference is whether or not I want to wake up with a hangover. Regular non-alcoholic seltzers are such a good placebo for me. I normally just drink water and coffee, so it feels like a treat. That and the (cashew milk) ice cream I bought (which is also rare for me) and my weekend is set to be lit. 

I am trying not to change my diet for the first 2 months. I want to see if I can eat what I want and still struggle less with my weight because I am not drinking. That will be a huge motivation for me. I love snacks, and I have been very strict about them because I had no wiggle room for extra calories. I think I would be happy to trade drinking for french fries. 

This is the longest I have been without alcohol in 20 years.",17

The first few weeks were easy. The better sleep and reduced anxiety made up for the lost taste and sense of comfort my daily half bottle of wine gave me.

 Last week, my partner ended up in the hospital. I used the stress of  the event to justify ""just one glass"" of wine. Now, a week later, I must admit that I've had a glass of wine every day. Last night I drank half a bottle of wine and now I am lying awake in the middle of the night feeling sorry for myself and posting on Reddit. I feel like I'm right back where I was a month ago, anxious, dehydrated and sleep deprived.

The past few months it's been a struggle to stay focused on work tasks, or even sit through an entire TV show.  Today, I was able to get in the zone on a complex problem at work and watch 3 shows on Netflix.

Post work cravings hit hard, but didn't cave.  Had a crazy nightmare where my dog ran away.  I even woke up and checked that he was still by my bed... he was.

Today and the rest of the weekend are going to be a major challenge. So I'm going to need a plan.  So far I've got:

* Long run.  Either at a favorite park or a new route I've been meaning to try.
* Making sparkling water.  SO does home brewing. We have brewer's kegs/kegerator.  Fun fact: if you just squeeze like 20 limes into a few gallons of water and carbonate it you can have sparkling water on draft.
* Writing code; not for work.  I've been meaning to start a side project to learn some lesser know web APIs and do little write ups about them.
* Walking doggo.
* Cleaning the house.  I could probably fill my whole weekend with this one alone.
* Go for a walk with a friend.  I got two friends in the neighborhood who I haven't seen in a few months.  Bonus points neither one of them drink. 
* Read a book in the backyard.  Weather should great for throwing down a blanket and relaxing.
* Call mom.  She's a talker.  So that should be good for a couple of hours.
* Post morning updates to SD.

The way I'm approaching this is that none of these MUST be done.  I just need options. And if I do happen to tick a bunch of these the list it's going to be a pretty epic sober weekend.",7

I don't think I'll be happy about it tomorrow if I drink.  But I don't really care about that as much as I want to drink right now.  The desire is raging.  Sorry, this is probably a downer.

Thank you all for your wise comments and I really appreciate discussing with each of you.

I ordered a pizza and that's now tethering me to home, so I can't leave to go get wine.  As I lie here the raging desire has mostly passed into tiredness.  I'm able to tell that my brain still feels a little raw at 6 days and has barely started to heal.  Wine now seems like a disaster for my brain.  Like a low blow to a staggering bloody fighter, the last thing I need.  I think it's crying out a last gasp for something it feels like it's missing and is afraid it won't get on time.  But it's actually so hurt from it.  I'm truly surprised that I'm not gonna drink after this mental spasm/episode but I'm so glad it passed.  Thank you all.  IWNDWYT.",14

I am lonely and really, really hurting for affectionate human contact. I’m usually an independent introvert so it’s taken a while for me to get the point where I am craving a night out in a big group. 

I’m also craving a drink. For the social aspect.

I work in a veterinary ER and we’ve been busier than ever with the shut down. My work-life balance is getting worse and worse because I have nothing else to do aside from be at work and relationships with coworkers and management is making me stressed. I’m also trying to advance my career and obtain a specialty certification in emergency medicine. There’s a big aspect of it that relies on team cooperation for me to succeed and my team is not very supportive. It’s also intense intellectually and I’m lacking in motivation. 

I’m craving a drink. Because I’m stressed.

I’ve done a lot of work on myself during the shutdown. I’m starting to backslide on a lot of things because I am just. So. Tired. 

I’m craving a drink. Because I’m almost out of fucks to give. 

But I’m not ready to let go of everything I’ve worked for. I’m ready to make healthier choices by reaching out to my friends. To work on saying “no” to staying late and picking up more shifts. To get back into exercising and eating more healthy foods because it feels really good. Maybe I’ll pick up a new hobby or get back to an old one.

I think that's enough of a wake up call.","Got my second DUI a few days ago.  I was about six months shy of the ten year mark from my first DUI, so it'll likely still count as my second (in my state, after ten years a second DUI is usually treated as a first).  I'm not really sure what I want to say here.  I just keep telling myself that enough is enough.  This has got to be my final wake up call, and I've had so many over the years.

I feel extremely fortunate that no one was injured and there was no damage or anything like that when I was arrested.  I've already hired a DUI attorney, and now I guess I just have to wait and see what happens.  I'm planning on going to AA meetings as soon as possible (my attorney thinks it will look good to the court too) and I want to get a sponsor and dive full in to working the steps.

Like I said, all I can think to myself is enough is enough.  I want to be one of you guys who posts here celebrating a year, two years, five years, etc.  I want to be able to do that too.

Anyway, thanks for listening.",54

2020-09-17 15:14:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/iuq94w/how_have_5_whole_months_passed/,How have 5 whole months passed?,"My journey into sobriety didn't begin well. 

For months I said I was going to quit, steeled myself in the morning to go into work and not stop in to see Kathy at the shop next door after. Sometimes I actually succeeded, for 2 or 3 days. Then a day would come and pass how it would pass - and by the end of it I'd found some reason, some incident, some justification to go home with a bottle. 

Of course I told myself I wouldn't drink it all that night. No, this time, I said, I would just drink some and save it for the next time I felt this way. How I believed I had the capacity for moderation is laughable now, but in the moment I had to believe it was true. I couldn't really give up drinking forever, right? 

Then it got darker and a short time would pass and that whole bottle was gone, the itch to acquire another was growing. Another order for food I couldn't afford to be buying was on its way and I was hoping the Dasher found my apartment so I didn't have to try and go down the stairs and find them. The spiral that was my evening had begun, and it would end whenever and wherever I happened to pass out. 

I don't know how I lived like that, I hated who I was, the things I said and did, I hated waking up. 

I didn't get out of the 3-5 days clean cycle until I was laid off - on my birthday. I was heartbroken then, I loved my job I thought. I was angry that the entire restaurant industry was toppling right as I was leading a kitchen and sharing my experiences. I expressed that anger and disappointment by drinking heavily for 5 evenings and then... I stopped. 1 day turned into 3 days turned in 7. A week has turned into 5 months. I did the math last night, because I stopped keeping track. 

It hasn't been easy, the pink cloud only lasts so long, and I've spent many painful hours with myself. I thought about nothing but drinking on the hour every hour for weeks. But, ever so slowly, that voice in the back of my head has changed the subject. 

I stopped being angry that the world has changed and my hopes for my career had to change because of it and started another. I've been studying to become a web developer, and happily have found I love the curriculum and the challenges that come with it. I love constantly learning new things, new tricks and time savers, and I absolutely love helping people learn with me. I'm excited to be in a career field that, hopefully, will mean my coworkers aren't all chronically late, lazy or uninterested.

My relationship has never been better, and I find myself excited for the slow evenings spent binging Netflix on the couch with some triskets instead of thinking about how I could sneak the idea of a drink in. I've been blessed with a partner who really loves me, who's kind and encouraging, and tough when he has to be. I knew that before, but I didn't appreciate it as I should have. I try to every chance I get. 

Life is far from perfect, there's a lot to rebuild, there are things to be dealt with. And they will be, or they are being dealt with, slowly. But I am so grateful for my sobriety, for this sub full of all of you kind, wonderful people and the posts I've read that, even when I didn't comment on them, helped me. Being able to pull up a whole group of people that know how I feel in my palm right when I needed it most has gotten me through many a craving. So thank you guys. 

If you're still struggling, that's okay, keep fighting. It gets better. It still sucks, sometimes, but just KNOW that those moments pass. This sub will be here for you like it has been for me ♥",39

There is the occasional twinge of ""Oh, a drink this evening sounds fun"" or something, but the nagging and snagging feeling of ""missing out"" isn't so much there right now.  Being able to sleep in on my day off because I want to without worrying is awesome.

Had a good session with my therapist the other day.  I mentioned that I felt bad for even having these cravings and these urges, however halfway through he kinda urged me to mention all the positive things I've done this year(weight loss, mostly sober, job progress, etc), and after putting them on the board he said ""See?  All this, from a birds eye view, is positive.  You've done some amazing things this year, during a pandemic, and that's big.""  And it's true.  I gotta embrace that.

I struggle with my ego a lot, like ""Not drinking shouldn't be a monument"", ""It's only a few days, who gives a shit"", ""Why is any of this a big deal, this isn't something I should be bragging about or whatever"", but that's so self defeating and would just- most likely- thrust me back into old destructive patterns of self defeating.

I've also largely fought against these impulses alone, keeping it hidden from my family well for so long, and when they did ""catch"" me being drunk, it was only a handful of times, not realizing how often drunk I was.  But reading these stories, and going through the self help books and realizing just how often, and let's be real- uncreative, these invasive thoughts plague folks(I'll just drink on weekends, I'll only drink socially, I'll just drink beer/wine and not hard liquor, just a few days a week!, I've earned it I've been good for a few days, etc) it's a weird sense of comradery.

Tomorrow makes day 10 of being back on the wagon after a mostly successful year, and to many more days after it.  Really appreciative of this forum, and the community it brings.

I was watching all of the wonderful Annie Grace podcasts and reading all of the encouraging posts here about how much healthier peoples' lives are now without alcohol, about how they exercise more and eat right; their newfound positive outlooks on life.

I was wondering if there is anyone else who struggles with this: There is a part of me, a dark and self-destructive part of me, that occasionally does not want to be well, does not want to live in a yoga studio or go jogging in the suburbs. This propensity towards extreme and even dangerous situations has not only been destructive for me; it's also led me to my current profession, it's helped me create and understand people others might not. I do not want to drink, I do not think I will ever get what I want in life if I continue to drink, I cannot have ""just one drink"", but I am more afraid of this ""fuck it, this is always how it's going to be, self-destruction is in my DNA, it got my entire family you see, the world is against me and falling apart, might as well grab some beer"", I'm more afraid of this dark seductive undertow that can strike without warning, or as the result of some major trauma or crisis, I'm more afraid of it than abstaining while going out with friends. I know I can say no in the latter situation. It's the destructive drinking alone, the saying ""this is a part of me, I'm not the type who exercises daily and organizes things compulsively and makes plans. I'm a fuck up, and there's a part of me that likes that""

&#x200B;

First off, I work in child care and for a long time I thought I was growing to hate my job. It turns out it’s not my job that I hate, it was doing it hungover that was the issue. Hangovers and 3 year olds will make anyone miserable.

Thinking about this made me realize another thing. I get sick when I eat gluten or dairy, so I gave them up years ago when I first realized that was the issue. My reaction to those two things is nothing compared to the days of sickness that hangovers caused. It’s crazy to think how easily I gave up foods that were making me sick, but how long it took me to think about giving up alcohol that was making me far more sick.

I've done outpatient more times than I care to admit. Two DUI's, one that resulted in a month long stint in jail, a divorce, losing more friends to my substances than I care to admit, thousands and thousands of dollars, car accidents, etc. and so on, for over twenty years. So yesterday I said no more. 

My doc put me on naltrexone to help with relapse cravings, I've started looking into more outpatient therapy again, and I am going to focus on me and my kids, but for once I will put myself first.

I feel amazing since I stopped! I feel like I've gotten so much time back now that I'm not waking up with a hangover or too drunk to be productive. My partner and I did this together simply by saying, ""let's not bring anymore alcohol into the house"". Not having it in the house at all was much more manageable than having it there and just trying to limit ourselves. 



Now that the 30 days are up, we've said we can go back to drinking some, but I never want to be the way I was. I don't think I can trust myself to have liquor in the house anymore, maybe just one bottle of wine to share occasionally. Or I might try to keep my streak going until the end of the year.

I got cancer and it caused a lot of stress with finances and stuff, he started drinking to deal with the stress and it wasn’t long before he was drinking at 8 am at work everyday and becoming depressed and suicidal over it. I avoided him most nights so we didn’t fight and I was so scared he would get alcohol poisoning or commit suicide which he talked about all the time. I became a wreck and hid and cried and fantasized about him stopping drinking and us getting back to happy, we’ve been together 20 years. Well on his birthday 10 days before our 20th anniversary, I went to my grand sons birthday party out of town, when I returned that evening he was not here, was drinking somewhere but said he would head home soon. 2 hours went by we all tried calling and got no answer so we went looking for him, a regular occurrence, I was so afraid I left him tons of messages and texts, I found him with another woman at the lake sitting in her truck, my son shortly after, he said she is an herbal addiction counselor and was helping him, turned out not true but he hasn’t slept with her yet but wanted to. We hadn’t had sex for like 4 months because of the drinking. It hurt me so bad all I did was cry for a week right in front of him so the following weekend he was going to drink himself to death it was a rough one. He had drank for 3 days straight non stop was twitching u name it I was so afraid I called his parents to come help, my son was so afraid he would die he called the cops and husband as just sitting in his truck drinking in our back yard and he got a dui, his mom was mad at me and she bailed him out of jail and 4 days later he went to detox, had a bad seizure and hasn’t spoken much to me in a month. Now he is going to jail losing his license and hates me over it. Should I divorce and move on? I love him so much it hurts but he doesn’t know if he wants to come back.

I can absolutely say that this is the longest I have gone without drinking since high school.  Feels amazing!  I love this!  

While in high school, I also developed another addiction....smokeless tobacco.

I spent good 17 years as a regular ""dipper"".  The last few years before I quit were like the last few years have been with drinking.  I had cans stashed all over the place.  I was dipping every chance I got and thought I was hiding it far better than I actually was.

I don't remember the exact date anymore, but it was around this time of year 13 years ago that my 2 year old son found a ""spit bottle"" in the car (I had it stashed under the seat and forgot to throw it out).  Needless to say, my wife was NOT pleased.  I made a decision that day to stop dipping....and went cold turkey.  I have not dipped or consumed nicotine of ANY kind since that day 13 years ago.

There have been instances along the way where I get the voice in my head saying it would be fine to just buy 1 can.  There have been instances where I really wanted to just have 1 dip.  In all of those, I have been able to be truthful with myself in knowing that if I chose to have 1, it would eventually end up with a full-blown, all day, everyday habit again.  So, if I chose the 1, I knew I was actually choosing far more than that.  In each of those times, I chose NOT to go back to the habit.

My ability to go dip-free for 13 years gives me tremendous hope that I can do the same for drinking.  I would love to just have a beer on Sunday evening after cutting the grass, sure!  But I know it won't end there.  I know myself well enough to know that I cannot just choose 1....if I make that choice, I am deciding to go back to the way it was....an awful habit that I dont want to go back to for TONS of reasons!  

So for today....I am making the choice to stick with being sober.  I don't want to go back to the way I was.  DEFINTELY not for today!!!

I’ve realized how many time’s I’ve missed out (even though I was physically there) being blackout mode around loved ones, at special events etc.   I can’t believe my partner has stuck through all this after so many failed attempts and broken promises.

On a nightly basis, at least one shady thing I did when boozing tends to creep in and make me realize what a piece of shit I’ve been. You can suppress everything with booze, but it’s going to come creeping back eventually. However, even with the “I’m a piece of shit” night terrors, I’m still sleeping better than I did when I was pouring myself into bed after basically passing out at the dinner table. 

I also have this other series of thoughts gnawing away at me.  Will I ever be “normal”?  Am I really an alcoholic? Could I ever just go and socially have A drink?!  Does everyone who finds out I’ve stopped drinking think I’m an alcoholic?!

Well I’m off to my Irish /Catholic/passive agressive parents house for a visit.  I’ve already explained I’m taking a break from the booze... we will see what type of pressure and shame await. 

Thanks to everyone in this group for being a sounding board this last two months and for however long I need it to get my shit together. ✌🏽

There are STILL 3 bottles in the cabinet that were there when I quit. My spouse is a normal drinker. I would have thrown them out if it were just me but she likes to have the occasional cocktail. The funny part to me is that I had convinced myself that I was constantly buying bottles for both of us. Turns out, it was just me. 

I know that the existence of alcohol around the house doesn't work for everyone, but for me those still half full bottles are something that I am proud of. They are my trophies for surviving my addiction. Eventually she will finish the bottles and the last bottles that I ever purchase will be thrown out. I am excited to do that, but I am enjoying seeing them simply sitting there in the mean time - my trophies.

The truth is, I have a bunch of mixed feelings and honestly feel like I needed a fresh start. My whole year in “sobriety” was filled with a lot of white knuckling it, watching others drink with envy, trying other methods of self medicating such a marijuana and Xanax and basically just sucking at life while trying to cope with severe anxiety. I was proud of myself for not consuming alcohol during that time but now I realize that I wasn’t exactly sober.

Rewind to a week ago from today and I decided that I was ‘ok’ to start drinking again. After all, I went over a year without it so clearly I can moderate and control my consumption, right?...well...as you can guess, that’s a big fat dose of NOPE!

Over the last week I’ve drank almost everyday, hid my alcohol from my family, convinced everyone that I was cured and it was ok for me to drink on “occasion” again, told my husband and parents that they didn’t need to worry if I had a glass of wine at dinner, I slept like shit, felt shaky in the mornings and just flat out disgusting. The worst part is that I could basically see myself falling down the rabbit hole at a crazy fast rate.

Waking up in the middle of last night with the alcohol leaving my system, I realized that the past week has brought a bit of clarity to things that didn’t dawn on me before my first stint in sobriety. I noticed that the warm buzzed feeling that I longed for lasts about 15 minutes and then transitions into feeling gross and is always followed by an immediate headache. I’ve realized how good I’ve actually felt for the past year without putting poison into my body and how much better I slept. I noticed that drinking makes me manic and although it’s a nice bandaid for my anxiety, it comes back with a vengeance in the morning. I’ve also noticed that I suck as a mom and a wife when I’m drinking and I want to be better than that. And hey! Alcohol actually tastes like shit too.

So here we go again, day 1. I’m grateful for looking at drinking with a different set of eyes that I didn’t have when I first got sober. Life is tough but alcohol can only briefly numb the pain and then it’s back to reality. Learning coping skills and finding hobbies are what I’m going to focus on this time around and actually sticking to it without trying to numb out in other ways.

“Cheers” to my last day 1!",61

I have needed to quit drinking for several years, felt it in my bones that I was bloody well going to quit right after last Christmas, and after several tries I am on Day 25.

My older brother has been sober for 8 years.  He hit a very hard rock bottom and has recovered to such an extent that he is an inspiration.  We talk often and it’s been very helpful but he is consistent in his encouragement that I should go to AA meetings, which remain key to his own recovery.  We had not spoken for several days before we caught up by phone last night and there was some judgement in his tone when we talked about the fact that I have still not gone to an AA meeting (at least one of the online versions).

I am not a joiner and I am a stubborn SOB, and I want to do this alone - and with the support of this online community, because you folks are awesome and amazing. 

I did try AA, although I admit my toe was not in the pool water for very long:  I signed into one online AA meeting about two weeks ago, had an immediate negative reaction, dropped off, and I have never tried again.

So, what’s my problem?

I want a life separate from alcohol, and I sometimes feel that AA members are as hooked to talking about drinking in recovery as they were hooked to the booze itself before they quit.  Alcohol is still there in their lives.  It’s like the guy who divorces his wife “to get away from her” and then spends all his time grousing about her, fighting over custody, stalking her online and harassing her friends.  His life still revolves around her.

When I divorce myself from alcohol I mean it.  I want to move to another state, burn the wedding photographs, change my name, start dating again, and move fucking on.

There are always multiple paths through any life situation and the AA path does not feel right to me.  

I hope that I am not kidding myself by thinking I can do this without AA.  But I quit because alcohol was hurting me. The gout, the early morning anxiety attacks, the dermatitis, the bloating and digestive problems, the cycle of elation and then crushing depression and fatigue, and that horrible realization that I was always the drunkest person in the room (which made me just another hamster on alcohol’s wheel) - I don’t want that anymore.  I want to get back to the Philip who runs and works out and reads books and just fucking does non-booze things, even if he now is a crabby 57-year old. 

End of rant.  

This app really does help and I know that I am not “doing it alone” as long as I stay connected here.  While I am looking for some advice and feedback about whether I can quit without relying on AA, I also guess that I have pretty much spelled out that I intend to quit without AA, anyway.  

Writing this post has been an interesting journey in itself.

I love a challenge.  And I mean no disrespect to any of my fellow alcoholics whose paths include (and whose recovery benefits from) AA.  The goal is to live without alcohol and I don’t care if you get there by adopting a kangaroo and commuting to work on a pogo stick.

I am not drinking with any of you lovely people today. Stay strong.",57

I’ve written the below list of things caused by my drinking that I never again want to experience, so I can read it when I get temptations. I’m sure many of you can relate to some of these! 

**Things I never again want to experience:**

* Feeling sick and nauseous all the time
* Getting out of bed in the morning feeling more tired than when I got in the night before
* Constant diarrhoea – and on occasion not making it to the toilet quite in time and shitting my pants 
* Farts that smell so bad they could be considered a nuclear weapon 
* Vomiting, and then panicking when there’s blood in my vomit
* Constant anxiety 
* The sheer hell that is withdrawals
* Having a bloated face and bad skin
* Putting on weight, even when not eating that much, just from the alcohol calories
* Wasting days recovering from binges
* Weekends that flash by in a haze of alcohol
* Not performing well at work
* Worrying about being over the limit to drive
* Seeing the sheer amount of money I spend on alcohol, and knowing that the money could be much better spent (or saved)
* Rotating the supermarkets/off licences I go to to buy drink, as I don’t want the cashiers to recognise me and know I’m an alcoholic
* Constantly trying to think up ways to make it look normal that I’m buying a bottle of wine at 10.30am on a Tuesday morning, like also buying a birthday card so the cashier/other people in the store will think it’s a present
* The sheer exhaustion of trying to hide my drinking from my family, and the constant worry that they’ll find out how bad things have gotten
* Cancelling plans with my friends to drink in my bedroom alone
* The feelings of impending doom 
* Feeling so ashamed of myself
* Finding empty bottles in my room that I’d forgotten about
* Stealing some of my Dads whiskey/brothers beer – and then worrying that they’ll see before I have a chance to replace them 
* Random throbbing pains throughout my body
* Random bruises on my arms/legs
* Not having enough confidence to go on dates because I don’t look my best, then complaining constantly that I’ll be single forever
* Neglecting my personal hygiene – falling asleep without brushing my teeth, letting my hair get greasy because I’m too tired/ lazy to wash it etc.
* Getting random bursts of anger for no reason 
* Sweating and shaking

A box of beers commemorating Liverpool Football Club winning the league arrived on Tuesday. (A present for my father which I ordered before stopping drinking). 

Since the box arrived, a little voice in my head has starting talking to me. Kind of like the symbiote in Venom, saying things like: “you’re going to drink at some point, why not have a few drinks on the weekend? Hisssssssss”

There’s a line at the end of This Naked Mind which says something like: “until you lose the desire to drink, you will never be able to quit successfully”. (That’s not an exact quote). Well folks, I was getting pretty worried that my desire had come back. That I’d forgotten the truth about alcohol. That I’d soon be blackout drunk and more miserable than ever. 

I managed to get to bed sober on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, I was listening to a chess podcast. It was an interview with [Tom Murphy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Murphy_(chess_player)) who is a famous street chess player.

During the podcast, Tom was asked about his addictions and how he overcame them. In response he said: “you have to find something you love more than the demon itself”. For Tom that was chess. I don’t know what that is for me, but for some reason this quote (and may not be an exact quote) helped me get through yesterday.

So yeah, I don’t know where I’m going with this but I guess I’m checking in to say I’m going to try folks. Going to try and silence this voice somehow, someway. Going to try and shake this desire off. Going to keep going.

All I know is - I wouldn’t trade my sobriety for any of the bullshit I was doing before. No more hangovers, no more shame on shame on shame, no more putting myself in extremely dangerous and damaging situations, and no more causing harm toward the people I love. Thankful for my ancestors, AA, and my fam/homies - always holding me down and giving me love when I felt so hopeless. I’m beyond blessed to be alive AND sober. I truly never would’ve imagined I could live this way. I feel closer to myself now than I’ve ever felt in adulthood. Halfway through my first year. Much love light n peace to everyone ♥️

Me and the wife had a call with one of our friends last night (more her friend than mine but previously any excuse to drink amiright). I stayed around chatting for an hour or so, had a brew and some water, then made my excuses and went and watched some tv in bed. They stayed up for a fair bit longer and from the looks of it my wife had 2 bottles of wine.

She just rolled over and groggily asked for a pint of juice, sounding rough as a badgers arse.

Even though when I went up last night I had  a slight fear of missing out, I do not envy feeling like that this morning.

A curse because I'm up at 2am unable to sleep with thousands of thoughts racing through my head and nothing to shut them up. 


A blessing because I can actually process, organize, and remember my thoughts for the first time. No I'm not sleeping, but I'm not drinking either. I don't want to. I want to feel this pain. I need to to let it go. Alcohol never made it better, just forgotten for awhile. Time to grow.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding  what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily  commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to  inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender  or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a  sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*.  It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes  impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person  can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again.  And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not  drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that  they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and  participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at  /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed  introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.  You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning Sobernauts!

How's everyone doing this Thursday? Well, I've got good news, and bad news...

The good news is I'm still sober, yay!

The bad news is that I left the house this morning without doing the DCI. Waaaah! So the post I spent hours working on last night is at home on my home computer :-(

Anyway, I know you lot are the forgiving type, so I'll try to get over it. And it'll still be there for tomorrow's DCI. 

So what to talk about? Mmm, I think I'll just leave you with a funny quote I like on we shouldn't drink:

Almost 2 AM here where I am at because I could not sleep despite taking melatnonin. 

About 3 years or so ago, I adopted a lifestyle of going out and binge drinking every weekend like a lot of people in their 20s in the city life do. Average was anywhere from 8 to 12 drinks varying from beers to white claws, sometimes it was vodka but not hard liquor that often. When lockdowns hit, I had drinks at home (6 beers to sometimes 10) on weekends. At times Thursdays too but that was like 3 beers max.

Decided at some point in August or September or so to quit. **Work has been unbelievably stressful.**

Past weekend, went to friend's birthday on a Saturday and was not well hydrated. Had 5 beers (like large glasses) and then came home and had 8 cans of white claws. 2 left at first but I brought a 6 pack at the nearby store.

Wake up Sunday, got a headache and the need to vomit but thought it was a hangover.

Monday till now, headache continues. Migraine type almost. Whenever I feel sexually aroused or horny to where I masturbate, it really takes over and gives me pain.

Did wake up today and felt my body temperature was higher than I liked, like I was warm. No way to measure fever since hard to get a thermometer at nearby pharmacies, they are all out.

Yesterday seemed fine but today at night, it hit and recently I threw up. I swear just a couple hours ago I hear hallucinations and noises.

Worst part is despite taking melatonin tonight, I feel restless and cannot sleep.

I am debating now if I go to the hospital or what....

Like what do I need to experience on my end before I think it is time to see the doc.

My city is hard hit by COVID-19 so hospitals are likely full.",5

It feels pretty lonely dealing with this journey. My SO is supportive, but I don’t think she really gets why I suddenly stopped drinking last week. I got really good at managing being drunk, and many people didn’t even know I was abusing alcohol. 

On my Day 1, I posted here that I didn’t know what to do with myself from 8-10pm without alcohol. Someone here said “read posts on r/stopdrinking!” I thought that was funny, but didn’t realize how solid that advice was. 

Getting to the end of my day, and reviewing all of your days’ experiences is incredibly helpful - and a reminder that I’m not alone in this.

I’ve been consistently thinking of how and when I’m going to drink. I expressed all of this to her. She validated my concerns and behaviors and elevated them to the realm of seeking treatment, and actually revealed she’s in recovery from alcohol use. I felt relieved, honestly, and I haven’t had a drink since Monday. But tonight, I started feeling off.. I had a fever, slight headache, restlessness, rapid heartbeat, and sensitivity to touch. Obviously, in the middle of a pandemic, I’m freaked out. I’ve had COVID-19 already with 90% certainty — I have antibodies, have had smell / taste issues since early April. It could be this, but I’m wondering if I could be having withdrawal symptoms. I had 1 drink to “test my theory,” and I felt better within 20 minutes.. fever went own and my body evened out.

Normally in the past when I have a bad day I am quick to get out of my sober mind, but going through a bad day sober is... so different.","Normally when I have a bad day, it goes something like- drinking copious amounts of wine, either with friends or by myself, and rehashing whatever put me in a bad place, over and over again, either with my friends in person, or if by myself- on the phone with a friend, googling something pertaining to the issue, etc. 

Followed by a host of other poor decisions- probably smoking some cigarettes, eating poorly, texting someone I shouldn't, right before passing out for the night. Then in the morning, stuck with 1. a hangover 2. anxiety about what i did/said the night before 3. the issue that led to be the bad place to begin with and 4. a day of work or life hungover. 

&#x200B;

Today I had a bad day, and decided to take a long bath, watch some netflix and then facetimed my 8 year old niece, who always gets me out of a bad mood instantly. At some point this evening, I was talking with my mom and all of a sudden remembered what a bad mood I was in before. 

The difference is so stark. Whenever I would drink after being put in a bad mood, I just dug the hole for my bad mood to get worse and worse through the means of alcohol. But my sober mind, allows my mind to drift off in other areas, and move on. 

This feels so simple... and normal. But so new for me. Heres to more bad sober days.

2020-09-16 20:21:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/iu8ddb/does_it_get_better/,Does it get better?,"Hi All, 

I’m 26. Just need to get some things off my mind. 

Lately I’ve been feeling depressed and lost. I joined AA over a year ago. Had 8 months, relapsed, and now I have 7 months. 

I’ve been going through some stressful things. My grandmother had a stroke a couple weeks ago and has dementia. She is now in a rehab facility. But I cannot visit due to COVID. It’s killing me knowing she is there alone and is probably confused as to why we are not going to see her. It makes me so deeply sad. 

I recently started therapy with a drug/alcohol counselor who also specializes in trauma. She is truly great and is helping me to process some things from my childhood that I buried deep inside. But with that comes a lot of painful memories. 

Sober doesn’t feel too good right now. Everyday I’m fighting not to pick up a drink. I find myself trying to rationalize that I don’t have a problem so I can pick up. When logically I know I do...or I wouldn’t have ended up in AA. 

I’m angry, I’m sad, I’m scared. 

I miss in-person meetings. While I’m grateful for Zoom it’s not the same as in-person fellowship. 

A part of me just wants to crack open a bottle of wine for some temporary relief from everything I’m feeling. But I know that’s not a solution. I keep on thinking, “Do I want to be sober if it feels this shitty?” 

Can anyone else relate/offer any advice? I really appreciate it.",8

A little back story, my wife and I have been trying really hard to get my son to stay in his own bed all night.  For the last week, this has consisted of me laying on the floor next to his bed holding his hand from about 1-4 am and not getting much sleep.  So last night, my wife got out of work early.  She got home and was exhausted from being on her feet all day, so she turned on desperate housewives or some show she likes to unwind.  I complain and ask if we can agree on something, and she just tells me she’ll take care of my son and I can go downstairs and play video games or take a nap or just do whatever the hell I want to do for the night because she is grateful for my sobriety and all my sacrifices and everything I’ve done around the house the last 4 months.  

In the past, I would have gone downstairs and smashed a six pack or more, probably in secret.  Then, I would have either passed out or waited for my wife to be asleep before I came up.  But I honestly didn’t even think about drinking until I came back upstairs and gave my wife a thank you kiss.  Just a simple kiss that showed myself how far I’ve come.  4 months ago I would never have given her a kiss,  because I would have been scared of her smelling alcohol on my breath, or hearing me slur my words.  I just am so grateful for my sobriety and I know my wife is too.  

I remember when I would hear sober people say I’ve never been happier, I always thought, “Alright, whatever you say.  Tell yourself whatever you need to.”  I now know what they mean, with these little moments that I wouldn’t have had 4 months ago, I have truly never been happier.  If anyone who reads this is struggling, just know it gets easier and little victories like this are what keeps me and many others sober!  IWNDWYT",18

I've had two instances in the past two days where I let it out in unimportant conversations. Once to my skype spanish tutor when she said she liked beer and I replied ""A mi me gusta cervezas pero ya no bebo."" - I like beer but I don't drink anymore. And in a random conversation when asked my opinion on a programming language I replied that ""after a few beers I might rant about Go's lack of generics but I don't drink anymore, so Go gets the job done."" 

I realized these were the first times I made a casual statement about not drinking as opposed to the serious declaration of being an alcoholic and the evasive ""no thanks"" or ""I'm not drinking tonight"" when offered a drink. This got me thinking, for others x-drinkers when the reality of not drinking became just another part of their identity that could or could not come up. 

At what point in your sobriety did it become a somewhat innocuous affectation which could passively come out in a conversation?",13

While I know alcohol isn’t necessary to celebrate something or be happy, not opening up some champagne feels a little like the loss of a ritual. 

I’m proud of how far I’ve come, both in my education and in my awareness of addiction. I’m celebrating both of those, I just wish it felt a little bit more celebratory than like a loss.

2020-09-16 17:11:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/iu4ulx/a_day_in_the_shamefilled_life/,A Day In The Shame-filled Life,"I wrote this as a comment reply to a post I made earlier but thought other people could relate to it too. 


219 days ago, I was drinking a 6 pack of white claws a night during my shift at my at-home job. I’d then position the box in the fridge to be just like it was the night before. I’d pray all morning while my SO was getting ready for work the she wouldn’t move or look in the box... effectively figuring out how drunk I was on the clock. The bliss that followed hearing that lock tumbler knowing I’d gotten away with my little scham again is something I wouldnt wish on anybody. I’d then proceed to drive to the store to replenish what I had drank. Then I’d get itchy and take out what was gone the night before so the exact amount was left in the box. After 1 of those I’d have another... and then another.. and another. I was DJ Khalid incarnate. “Well I can just say I had one after work (to account for the now missing one from the original amount from the night before)... that’s ok, right? I’m a man and paying the bills.... why shouldn’t I have a beer after work?” 20 minutes later, the box is empty and the beast is awakened. 

Now I’m walking back out to my car heading straight back to the store for more beer. This time, however, I grab a box of wine. You know the ones, the little ones that have 3 servings per box. By the grace of multiple entities, I’d get back home with my score. First, the wine. I’d proceed to chug that box within a few minutes. I’d done this countless times. I expected the rush of oblivion that was to come minutes later. I then pulled out the cans from the white claw box as I did earlier and stashed them away in my hiding spots... my precious. “Ok *hicc* it’s 930am... she hicc gets home at 330pm.... ** hicc** I can drink un*hicc*... I can drink until 11 before I need to sleep this off a little.” But no, Of course the allure of the secret stash was too much. It was mine. I deserved it. I then chugged down 3 more white claws as the world around me span. This is it. This moment..... oblivion. 

The ringing of my phone alarm is my next clear memory. She’ll be home soon.... crap I’m still wasted. Ok ok, don’t panic.... we can go disc golfing at the park right before she leaves. I gather my things and head our the door. My first stop is the corner store. 2 24oz tall boys and a large Gatorade. Yeah, that’ll do the trick. By now it’s 4 pm and she’s calling me. I put on the best sober voice (I think) I have and answer. She’s not happy. I know she can hear my slurs but I’m oblivious to myself. I’ll be home in a few hours... I mean golf takes a few hours anyways. I throw my first few shots and get to the second tee box. Secluded in the forests now, I grab my prize. The hiss of the 24oz modelo especial echos in my memory. The smell of the malt etched in my brain. The crisp taste sends me off again..... this bliss is not something (once again) I’d wish on anyone but in that moment I’d wish FOR everyone. I stumble my way through the forest for a few hours. By the time I’m finished with my first beer I hardly care about what I’m doing. The second 24oz goes down as fast as the first. I hardly know who I am as I approach the 16th tee.... my beer drank what seems like ages ago. The only thought in my head is, “what I’m I buying on my way home tonight. How can I hide this beer smell long enough so she won’t know.” 

I drive drunk to the store on the way home. Not the corner store, but the same grocer from this morning. They sell my precious box wine. I can stash 3 of those in my golf bag. My ticket to oblivion has been stamped. My secret to get past the SO tsa is still unfounded. She’ll never find them.... it’s too easy. I play the role perfectly when I get home. Say a quick hello and go straight for the shower. 30 minutes of sitting and letting the water rush over me. 30 minutes of guilt, shame, bliss, laughter, sorrow... I’ve thrown up twice but she won’t know. I put the fan on and was quiet. 

Next is the balcony, yes I can watch tv on the iPad out here until I start work. Oh it’s too perfect. 3 hours of hell knowing my precious wine is inside but I can not take that ride yet. It’s not fair. I work hard. I deserve a drink. Who is she to tell me I can have a drink? Regardless, boarding time for oblivion is set and I have to wait in agony as the time passes slowly. I feel the hangover creeping in...

No... NO THIS IS NOT FAIR. 

I go back inside to the office where my computer is set up for work... where my precious is lying in wait. Before I know what I’m doing, I’ve already cracked the first seal on a box of the wine. Half of the box is gone in an instant.... I’ve smooth talked my way into Pre-boarding. Suckers... do I look like active military? 

Finally it’s time to get work started. I’m balancing between bliss and agony. She comes in to tell me good night. I’m used to this disapproving look dawned on her face. She tries to kiss me but I won’t let her near my lips. She can’t smell my breath. My secret must be kept. She gives a muffled sigh as she shuts the door behind her. click that’s it.... the sweet sweet sound that signals the final preparations for our flight to oblivion. I’m already finishing the opened wine from earlier. I have the next one hiding behind my desk within arms reach. Ha, I’m so cleaver. 

My work is done, sloppily. My voice giving obvious slurs on the phone to customers. I’m finally finished with my tasks and it’s the slow period in the night. 

This is it, we’ve began our initial decent into oblivion. Please bring all chairs to their upright and locked positions. 

The second box and now the third box of wine have long been finished. I’m stumbling through the house thinking I’m being clever. Thinking I’m quiet as a mouse. I go to the fridge and grab all of the white claws left from earlier, this time not even caring if the box is moved or altered. It’s 6am now. 

Those entities from earlier have friends because somehow the morning has been quiet. Everything has ran without a hitch. I down all but one of my beers. I’m floating in a sea of guiltily bliss as i hear my SO get ready for work. Have I been here before? Why is this place so familiar? She doesn’t even say goodbye this morning, but that doesn’t matter. I hear the sound I’ve been waiting for all morning. 

*click*

 the tumbler on the lock engages and the final beer is opened. I’m stepping off the jetway into the arrivals area of the airport. Oblivion is just as hellaciously beautiful as I remember it. I down this beer as fast as it was opened. My alarm not set for later. Nothing in the world matters besides this moment. Stepping out into oblivion. The cycle to continue again upon awakening. The feedback loop rounding again for another go. My flight back to guilty, shame filled existence is already boarding and I am first in line.

Idk, I felt like sharing a day in my life before I decided enough was enough. My flight wouldn’t crash land until 15 days later, however I’m grateful it did. I’m grateful I survived the wreckage, because many people are not so lucky. I get to sit on my balcony and write this experience to strangers on the internet to relate to.

Cheers.",43

Since that time i have noticed everyone looks at me and acts different towards me. The most recent was we were invited to a bonfire and i showed up and i had just bought a new Yeti thermos bottle and i filled it with raspberry sweet tea to drink that night and i noticed when i came back from the bathroom my bottle had been moved and was not how i had left it. i was later told that my cousin had opened it and sniffed it to make sure i wasn't drinking. I understand why people would think that but it just kinda rubbed me the wrong way. I also have people as soon as i sit down they start asking me how many days its been and then make jokes about how ""when you don't drink when you wake up is the best your gonna feel all day."" has anyone else dealt with this or anything similar?",3

Also I think, for me going 2 weeks is MUCH harder. I don't know why, but it's such an endurance test.

  I used to be much worse.  I drank daily and it was a reason for everything. I would put up my own little defenses around it. Id have to hand my wallet to my wife when I got home from work. ... I tried SO many things.   
  I really didn't like the idea of AA either. First of all, some people are terrified of speaking in public. Other people just aren't going to commit to scheduled meetings (wink). 

  I used to have a problem with the religious factor. One of the steps is go give yourself to Christ. Since we live in a Christian society, I don't think many people realize what it would be like if they were asked to give their lives to Mohammed. I mean just the suggestion must turn away a LOT of people, and there's another person with fewer options for help.    
  However, after going I found that it's full of caring, good people. They'll acknowledge that very problem and tell you that it's b.s. and point out that 'Hey, don't feel guilty to use religion to your own benefit and throw it away.'.  I thought that was cool. 

  I guess my main problem with it was humbling yourself THAT much. 

  I guess I do like the fact that you have to express yourself though. I think us humans are just balls of expression. If you've ever had the experience where it was hard to say something... you know how powerful expression, and the stifling of it can be.",1

I feel awesome. I’ve definitely gotten past the feeling that not drinking is “taking something away”. I still (re: my first post here) don’t know if I’ll never drink again, but I know I don’t want to drink in the foreseeable future. 

These past 6 months have been awesome: I’ve met my fitness goals and needed to set new ones (25 push ups with good form at a time here I come!); I’ve started a masters program and am killing it; I’ve adjusted to working remotely and training a new employee remotely; I’ve moved to a whole new city and started exploring it. 

But these Covid times have probably made not drinking unusually easy what with the lack of big social events. The fall and winter are going to be slightly more challenging, but I’m actually excited to see how it goes. I’m going to turn 25 in October, and my parents will be visiting and no doubt want a booze-related celebration. 

Holidays in general I haven’t had to get through sober yet. I’m not worried about being tempted to drink, my issue has always been more with stopping once I start than starting in the first place. But in my family it’s pretty much an expectation to drink at gatherings, so I’m expecting to have to deal with some confused reactions at least. Luckily the holidays will be split with my boyfriend’s family, who are very light drinkers (eg one glass of champagne on New Years, if that). His sister is law is also pregnant (and due on Christmas!) so I’ll have a definite sober buddy. 

But even with the pre-stress of potentially having to explain myself, I’ve realized I’m looking forward to all these events so much more than I would be if I were still drinking. I’m not planning how much it’s acceptable for me to drink at the event, planning how much I consequently need to pregame, planning my transportation, etc. 

Luckily my life was never really derailed by drinking, but I feel like I’ve definitely shifted gears from “just getting along” to “killing it”. I’m excited for fall and seeing how many pumpkin slice lattes will fit into my previous booze money/calorie budget 👻",7

  My story and I'll keep it short.  I was a functioning alcoholic until I wasn't, for almost 20 years. The last 5 of those I was trying to get sober. I finally lost my darling love, my apartment, my job, my cat, and was living on the streets of New York for two months. We're talking cardboard box, shelters, jail, the whole nine yards. 

  I finally had a lizard brain, ""you're gonna fuckin die if you keep this up"" moment and checked myself into an inpatient rehab facility in Harlem. I stayed for 60 days, dove in headfirst, and it honestly saved my life. I did therapy, participated in groups, NA and AA meetings, got my weight up, started to get mentally sound and started to bulk up and be serious about sobriety.

  Cut to over a year later, daily AA meetings, a couple of slips, but I had a year sober.  I decided to move back home to Los Angeles and restart my life. Get back into what I was trying to do before I became an alcoholic and addict. My dreams were going to be fulfilled, and I would be sober doing so.

  Now I have an apartment. I'm unemployed, and I'm working hard to find work during Covid. But heartbreak, regret for the past, our goddamn nazi prez, the pandemic, police murdering citizens, you name it, it was affecting me. So I started to drink. I go 4 days sober, then I drink. I'm only drinking wine and beer, but I know it's a matter of time until whisky and harder substances come back into my life.

  So, does anyone have some suggestions to help me with sobriety and sticking with it? I will do SMART recovery and AA meetings, but I need accountability. And this sub does that ten fold. You folks have helped me on countless days and nights. Good luck out there, much love, and thanks for reading.",2

I have a history of (at various stages of my life) anorexia, bulimia, EDNOS, food obsession. When she asked if I would be willing to go into inpatient or outpatient treatment for eating disorders, I almost burst into tears saying I would be unwilling for someone else to be in charge of my food/what I ate. I really don't mind being in a position where I cannot drink, where my surroundings prevent me from drinking. But I need to be in charge of my food.

&#x200B;

I'm also someone who drank somewhat heavily for the last 10 years -- to the exclusion of food. In a way, it was in order for me not to eat -- which I know doesn't make sense, alcohol has all sorts of calories. But it's not like disorders make sense.

I (34 y/o M) have always been a heavy drinker. I moved to a big city from a small town and started working in the entertainment industry at 20. Binge drinking was seen as the norm and I was always the youngest, so I did my best to keep up with everyone. I worked my way up in the industry and had a great job by the time I was in my mid-20s. I had opportunities and offers to go do my own projects that would have been amazing and fun and a huge boost to my career. I could never fully commit to these projects, I was always afraid of leading something big, so I'd get drunk and let the ideas slowly die off. I made a lot of people upset and hurt them because I never kept my end up the bargain.

After a few more years, I decided to up and leave. I was tired of working so many hours and I craved a more normal life. I went back near where I grew up and started a new life. I got very lucky and fell into a totally new industry and I thrived. Even if I was binge drinking, I'd show up to work and bust my ass and I moved up quickly. I got into an abusive relationship that caused an uptick in my drinking. Then I took a job where I traveled a ton and was alone in a hotel room for days on end, it wasn't healthy. After four years of gas-lighting and abuse from my ex-partner, I left. I found myself on the floor of a friend's one bedroom apartment while trying to negotiate a divorce settlement, you drink even more during that.

After a few months, I felt better and was drinking far less and actually taking care of myself. Going to the gym all the time, following a healthy diet, etc. Then I met my current girlfriend and things have been so good ever since. We drink, but we kept it to a reasonable amount. Then the pandemic hit. I'm trapped in my house working from home, I can't go to the gym (which had become such a therapeutic practice for me), the news cycle has been relentless and pulls me deeper into depression, I'm on the west coast so I haven't been able to go outside for the last three weeks due to the smokey air. 

At the beginning of quarantine, my drinking was way up. Over the last month, I had begun drinking a heavy amount every day. Sneaking out to the liquor store for another bottle of vodka and drinking not to feel anything. Over the past week or two, my anxiety has been sky high and I have felt awful. I started reading about the warning signs of alcohol liver disease and I became terrified. Yesterday was the first day I didn't have a drink in months. I feel hopeful, I feel scared, I feel like I don't want to kill myself with alcohol.

Thanks for reading. Here's to hoping that I can take this day by day and get healthy again.",4

2020-09-16 10:46:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/itwx44/a_long_story_of_my_270_day_journey_thoughts_on/,A long story of my 270 day journey - thoughts on healing what alcohol used to protect,"My journey with alcohol was one that was intertwined with my own insecurities. For my whole life, I had been the ugly duckling - a chubby, frizzy-haired, glasses-wearing girl who loved books and didn't know how to dance. I was a classic nerd, introverted and unable to fit in. In high school, that hurt and rejected little girl lost a lot of weight, started shopping at the ""right"" stores, and made a group of friends. When I got to college, I was consumed with my trajectory of becoming the ""cool girl."" Alcohol was the perfect way to do that. From frat parties my freshman year to black-outs at the bars my senior year, drinking made me fun, cool, and connected to my friends. I drank to fit in, to be fun, to have the courage to ask my crushes out on dates, basically to bypass the insecurities and hurts of my past. What I didn't realize at the time is that I was acting from a place of insecurity that whole time - my lonely inner child, wounded by rejection, had become obsessed with validation as a way to heal my insecurities. And the thing is, *it worked.* It only worked temporarily, and every time I drank to feel included the repercussions grew more and more serious. However, the insidious thing about alcohol is that it DOES protect us, in it's own fucked up way - it helps us scoot right past all those tricky insecurities and fears for just a moment, and that brief moment feels great. 

After college, I drank less and less frequently, but whenever I was nervous or anxious to impress someone I was with, I always drank too much, blacked out, and caused problems. Last December, I went back to my college town for the first time in 2 years. Some younger friends of mine took me out to a bar, and I *promised* myself I wouldn't black out, wouldn't return to the out-of-control party girl that I had tried to grow away from. I was better than that now, I told myself. However, when I unexpectedly ran into an ex-boyfriend and another former crush, the sadness and the anxiety of that moment took me right back to alcohol. I went right back to my college-level of drinking to deal with those negative emotions. Of course, I blacked out. I also said and did some things I regret deeply, which almost ruined a relationship with a close friend. 

The next day was the day I stopped drinking. I was forced to confront the ways I was using alcohol to cope in unhealthy ways, and I realized that although I had changed since college, my relationship with alcohol had not changed one bit. It was still a way for me to undercut anxiety and insecurity instead of dealing with those feelings myself. 

I'm 25 now, and I've been sober for the better part of a year (270 days!). The first few months of sobriety honestly weren't hard for me, because I wasn't physically addicted to alcohol, more psychologically dependent. Even when the pandemic hit, I never wanted to drink. That's because the negative emotions I experienced during that time *weren't the ones I medicated with alcohol.* Without alcohol (and with the help of a therapist), I've addressed a lot of the feelings of worthlessness, insecurity, and the need for validation from others that were at the source of my drinking. I'm really proud of my inner work, and I'm even more proud I've done it without alcohol. Alcohol itself wasn't the source of the problem, it was just an unhealthy way to protect and care for the real problem - my own insecurities. 

The whole truth of allllllll this really only hit me last weekend. It was a friend's birthday, and several of us went out to an outdoor dinner at a very fancy restaurant. I was really anxious to make a good impression on my friend's boyfriend, since they just started dating and it's important to her that we get along. I also didn't know some of the other people there and really wanted to make friends. So, I got dressed up for the dinner, put on my best shoes, and pumped myself up with some music, but I was still *so* anxious when I arrived. Would they all like me? Was my outfit too dressy? Not dressy enough? Did I look fat? What would I talk to them about? What if they didn't like me? 

Throughout the whole dinner, I was shocked by how badly I wanted to drink. I kept thinking that if I could just have a cool glass of wine, like everyone else at the table, I would be funnier, happier, less awkward. If I got a little buzz it would be easier for me to flirt with the cute guy I was talking to! If only I had a drink, *I wouldn't be myself*, my insecurities told me, I would be a different, better, cooler person, one that people would actually like and find attractive.  

I was confronted by the exact negative feelings that alcohol used to protect me from - the insecurity and anxiety that alcohol used to take away. Alcohol, for all its evils, does serve to protect our deepest, darkest, hurt parts of ourselves. It does this by numbing our feelings, not letting us see the bad things in our lives, making us feel loved and sexy and enough. The first step in fixing this is to stop drinking. However, that's not enough. We have to become our own protectors, to start caring for the parts of ourselves that we previously medicated with alcohol. 

That night, I did not have a drink. I'm still sober, and I'm finally starting to realize where my alcohol abuse came from. I've finally realized that just because I haven't had a drink in 270 days doesn't mean I'm anywhere close to where I want to be - I still have to do the difficult, uphill work of learning the coping skills and self-care mechanisms that I replaced with alcohol for years. I'm still proud of myself for my sobriety, but I feel like I'm just at the bottom of this mountain. It's humbling, but it's gratifying to have this sense of clarity. 

Anyways, this is a very long post that I spent a few hours typing up over the course of a morning. I'm not sure if this will be helpful to anyone here, but it felt at least a little bit helpful for me to type up and think through. This sub has helped me immensely to get on the path of sobriety and to stay on it, so I thought I would share my story here in the hopes that it helps even one person. 

I won't be drinking today - I hope you join me. Thank you all so much.",7

I immediately shut them down, but they keep recurring. I estimate about every 20 minutes. 

I woke up, read the morning meditation and daily reflection, prayed, had coffee and played some of my phone game, did yoga, walked my dog, had breakfast, and thought through what I need to get done today. So typical things. But constant interruption with ""maybe I should go get whiskey we  the store opens"", etc. 

I keep repeating that:
.I'm so close to 30 days and I want to hit that really badly

.playing the tape forward of what would happen if I did drink vs. If I dont, which speaks for itself

.there's not even any real stress or anxiety to relieve right now, the urge today I think is being provoked by boredom, and there are many other, better ways to cope with boredom than by drinking


So that's where I am. I'm hoping getting it out like this will help relieve the cravings.

I’ve been sober for about 3 and a half months after 5-8 years of heavy drinking and attempting to quit. This is the longest I’ve been sober. Recently, I’ve been having dreams where I’m with my parents and am hiding drinks/drinking in the background of the dream. 

The strongest emotion I feel during this dream and right when I wake up is that “at some point in the last 3 months I’ve drank alcohol so my streak is a lie” 

I’ve had this dream twice this week which is the first time it’s occurred back to back. It’s very demoralizing and depressing to wake up and feel like I haven’t been sober long. It makes me feel like giving up the streak and drinking again.


Has anyone else gone through this?

This Naked Mind taught me how to be free of alcohol. I don't miss it, I don't feel deprived, it's hard to believe it actually worked sometimes. There have been a few times in the last 100 days that I've craved the disassociation that comes with alcohol, but instead of giving in to the temptation I acknowledge the feeling and actively find a healthy alternative. (a podcast, exercise, meditation, a bath, singing along to musicals....)

If you are struggling with getting past those first 30 days, I highly recommend This Naked Mind. It opened my mind to the fact that alcohol is ethanol. It is literally used as fuel for vehicles. My body does not deserve to be poisoned with ethanol. My body loves me, and deserves to be treated with love and gratitude. She kept me alive through so many reckless blackouts. I'm so grateful that she hung on until my brain caught up.

I started drinking when I was in my teens. Grew up around drinkers, my single mother had no problem with me coming out from my bedroom for a refill. A coping mechanism for the billions of things going on in my own little bubble.

Over the years I've worked on those billion little things, they're not issues for me anymore.

But now I'm at a point where I'll go for a week without drinking, start eating better & working out more, and then I'll ""crash"".

Nothing huge, I'll just pick up a 4-pack and drink them over the course of the night while I relax.

Sometimes I've let it get the better of me & done this a couple of times a week. Go for my 1 hour of permitted outdoor time, come home via the liquor store with a 4-pack and ease into the night. I live in Melbourne, Australia. We're in one of the strictest and longest lockdowns because of COVID. What else am I going to do with my time.

Every time I do it I regret it.

I don't get drunk. I wake up the next day feeling worse than I should. But I can't help but give in to temptation.

I've started writing in my journal about it, trying to figure out what's going on. I think to myself ""it's OK to treat yourself. Everything in moderation. You're doing this once a week, not every day"".

I know that for things like exercise & diet that absolute abstinence don't work. It's healthy to do the right thing most of the time & allow yourself to have that snack every now and then. Take a rest. But this doesn't feel like it should be part of that mindset.

So I go a few days and think things are looking up. Then the cravings start. Not particularly for alcohol, but for disconnection. I'm not particularly stressed or looking to escape anything in particular. I'm sure there's probably something, but I've got a good job and life. I do it to just slow things down a bit.

Meditation has started to play a part in my morning routines but I don't know if this is where this is heading. Am I supposed to just meditate my life away?

I guess I just can't tell if I'm being too harsh on myself & creating some sort of psychosomatic response or if this is the result of years of alcohol use & abuse.

How do I break the habit? I like the taste when I start, but I can't simply have just one. I used to buy a bottle (better value for money) until I realised I was drinking a full glass of straight scotch (no mixer or ice) in a night.

I weened myself right off it a while ago, I forget why or how, but now my limit is the 4-pack I buy myself. It's pre-mixed (so less alcohol) and I can only abuse the 4-pack. But now I'm also addicted to the sugar hit it gives.

I know it's a response to something and that I should work on that. I also know life isn't ever perfect and there will be another trigger. It's not the trigger that bothers me, I can handle that. What I don't know how to handle is me just giving in to it.

How do I kick this? Do I replace it another, better, habit? Do I convince myself to meditate instead?

I know it's going to be hard and I kind of like the challenge. I just don't know where to start & the best way to succeed at this.

&#x200B;

Note: I've only just read the rules, and must admit that I've finished my 4-pack. But tomorrow I'd be back on the ""everything is fine, you've got this"" train and wouldn't think about it again until next week. I've thought about this post, this conversation, this process, so many times before. So I'm posting this anyway. Got to start somewhere.",4

* Not romanticizing/fantasizing or thinking of moderation (there is no moderation for me - it's only getting drunk, and the effect is so compromised/short-lived due to my high tolerance)
* Remembering that every time I did drink again (after stopping) I always regretted it and always immediately became desperate/determined to stop again
* Remembering that drinking always made me feel shit for days
* Non-alcoholic sparkling wine

Unless I'm happy, or sad, or angry, or excited, or frustrated . . . 😂. It really can be like that, I will find an excuse to get fucked up.  I've never been the still waters run deep type of guy, and though I'd like to be considered a nuanced person, my emotional states seem to physically live millimeters below my skin and they manifest quickly and forcefully for the good AND the bad.  Drinking is a very easy way to dull this volatility.  My conundrum right now is that I can't enter confrontations and arguments without getting terribly worked up.  I have to talk to my boss about my need for more support and compensation, and I can't even do so in my head without welling up and clenching my fists.  My points aren't unreasonable and my boss is understanding, but I feel indignation and anger that I have to defend them in the first place and I can't simply state these things even into a mirror without my blood rushing so fast I can hear a waterfall in my head.  So I feel powerless, helpless, and defeated.

But I don't drink and IWNDWYT.  I've been sober before, and I know that mental control of myself is hard won.  Drinking will not make these problems better. It will only make me forget and not hurt for a bit.  And I will never be rich, successful, a good father, a good husband, a good friend by forgetting and not being willing to let it hurt sometimes.  Good luck everybody, try not to fuck up, I'm told its worth it 👍😜😂",11

I’m incredibly thankful for this sub and community. Great to see like minded people from around the world supporting people’s journey through sobriety.

I’ve been sober just over a year and I had some helpful tips for those thinking about starting the journey or those that recently started.

So... one of the most difficult things about my relationship with alcohol was that I wasn’t the traditional “alcoholic” you see in the movies that wakes up late, takes a swig of the bottle of vodka on the nightstand and begins their day.

I was a drunk. Through and through. That bottle of vodka never existed because I would’ve finished it the night before.

As someone that didn’t have a “daily drinking” problem, it was tough for me to realize how far gone i was. I could go a couple weeks without drinking (usually a break from the most recent incident) until I tricked myself into thinking I could handle it. This would lead to 1 beer, 2, .... 12 and a couple mixed drinks. 

My problem was once I got started, I couldn’t stop and those around me that preached moderation simply didn’t get it.

I made the decision to stop drinking for a year. The prospect of committing to “forever sobriety” was a scary thing to think about. I was scared of letting myself down, my girlfriend that has supported me through the journey, etc. but I can at least make it a year right?

Once I got that ball rolling, I haven’t looked back.

Things that helped me:
1. Journal of my worst memories drunk. These are my North Star when I begin to “forget” just how low my lows were.
2. Alternative drinks! I keep a fridge stocked with Le Croix (passion fruit is my jam) and a coozie. When I’m out (rarely, but my profession sometimes requires it), I’m a club soda and lime kinda guy.
3. Overcoming the obstacle. If you’re someone that drinks are certain functions (family gatherings, work events, etc) the first time you’re sober sally is going to feel off. Push through the discomfort. It’s 1000% easier the next time around.
4. Find an ally. I was blessed to have an uncle that had gone through this journey and could be a non-judge mental soundboard for my thoughts. Similar to this community.
5. Realizing the difference between friends and drinking buddies. Drinking buddies see your decision as a trial of their life choices and begin to get insecure. If they get you to drink again it validates their choices. Misery LOVES company.

Last, don’t apologize for your issue with alcohol once you’ve decided to not drink. People allergic to peanut butter don’t apologize for not eating a PB&J.

Hope this helps someone out there struggling. Take the leap!",85

This morning, I was walking home from my morning gym session, it was around 8am. 

Today is garbage collecting day, so all bags are on the sidewalks ready to be picked up. As I walk down the street I notice a bag of recyclables full of beer cans, nothing else but beer cans. A huge bag, 80L. An instense feeling of sadness hit me. I used to bring out that kind of garbage bag. All the cans were the same brand, except a few. In my garbage bag, these few different cans meant that I had been to my usual shop around the corner and bought my usual dozen of cans of my preferred brand, but that day they didn't have enough left, so i'd complete the amount with another beer brand. I remembered the shame I felt when I had to put it on the sidewalk, imagining what people would think by walking past it. Maybe they wouldn't think this is only a few days worth of beer, maybe they'd think that bag was filled slowly over several weeks, right? In the morning, I'd look out the window to make sure it had been picked up, because I didn't want to have to stare at it for another week every time i walked out. It made me remember the struggle, the darkness that filled my drinking days, when every day my top priority was to make sure I had enough beer to spend the evening drinking. Those were dark days. I felt so sorry for what that person is going through, I felt so sorry for what I made myself go through.

It was a strong reminder of what I don't want to get back to. Life currently isn't easy, i'm struggling a lot for all different kinds of reasons, but I know for sure that i'm better off without the booze.
 I'm thankful for this community, which plays a huge role in my commitment to not drink, day after day.

I'm almost 2 years sober and for most of this second year I've been really content and happy with my choice. I don't need booze to have a good time or to relax. I thought I had it together.

But the last few days, the old Booze Goblin in my head has come back. Saying things like ""You only drank because of your ex, now he's gone you can be normal"" and ""One will be so refreshing and then we can stop"". I've started to think about when the right time would be to have a drink, and to create ""rules"" for myself so I can drink ""sensibly"" and only when I allow myself to.

But I don't want to moderate. Moderating is harder than not drinking. And I don't want to be hungover, ever again. I know if I pick up again then that will be inevitable.

I think I'm going to come back and lurk around this sub like I used to. If anyone has any advice I'd love to hear it. :)",86

I've never thought of myself as an alcoholic, since I've gone months or a year on a break when I was getting out of hand. Keep it to one night a week and weekends. The problem is I mainly binge drink. For me, with drinking comes cigarettes, overeating, general over indulgence.

Last year I went camping with some friends and one of the guys in the group just never drank. When asking how that was, he was explaining how it's a huge part of what most people do and talk about. Since then I've certainly noticed how often it's talked about and the center of activity. It's almost a personal and group identity. It's been gnawing at me ever since. 

Now I'm 35, 300 lbs, high blood pressure, and my doctor tells me it's time to either take high blood pressure seriously and change my lifestyle, or realize a lifetime of medication and potential health problems. All of my medical visits for the past 5 years have been related to heartburn, gastro issues. I'll get on a good self care path, but drinking always seems to be the catalyst to returning to all of the bad stuff.

I don't want to be on medication, have a stroke, feel like crap. I'm not worried about losing friends when stopping for good, I'm mainly worried that it's been so much of my personality. My favorite hobby for as long as I can remember had been drinking. Nights out at bars, drunkin concerts, day drinking.

So the last drink and smoke I had was 5 days ago. Took myself to the ER due to terrible stomach pains. Luckily nothing major, just mostly putting garbage into my body for so long my insides were fighting it off. 

So I'm prepared to make drinking something I used to do. I've got a small group of good friends that'll be fine with the change, and no SO or children. I just feel like there will be a hole in my personality that I'll have to figure out.

It's been good to read around on this subreddit to see that I'm not alone in the struggle.",9

Ever since my life has forever transformed.

Awareness is key to life. Being present in the moment is what allows you to keep balance of everything. To gain inner peace you must realize the strength to become who you are meant to be has and always will be in you. Let go of your ego, gain confidence in yourself, and know you can do anything.

Im proud to say i have not played a video game in a month, ive completely updated my moms house for her. The house looks cleaner and more organized than its ever been in over the last 7 years. Getting my car sold and fixing the car i got wrecked that started all of this. 

Ive always been spiritual but lately that has transformed into something entirely new. Its almost as if the universe has been pushing me and guiding me over the last 6 weeks. Random urges and desires to do things ive never really done or had no reason to only to have something happen that just... Idk the amount of coincidences that are themed to very large moments in my life is mind boggling. Im just trying to pay attention and listen now with no judgement or expectations... But seriously wtf is going on....",23

Kind of /s but not really..... If anyone can name the show that I quoted, (the post title if you didnt notice.....) you are my internet hero for the day!!! 

Also TL;DR just ramblings of a recovering alcoholic, might be worth a read if your bored, might not, I don't know your life.

So I was sitting at my desk (which I FINALLY FINISHED BUILDING(after 6 months)), dilegently working on my Account 410 homework (advanced accounting) and I had a piphany (yes I know it's epiphany). I took a moment to think about where the fuck I have been in my life. While in the grand scheme of things I haven't really been anywhere. Just.... More emotionally where I've been with my life, and that's all over the place. 

When I started college I moved from a small podunk town (52 student graduating class) to a full blown university!!! I was in shock how diverse this booming metropolis of a town was (it really wasn't). But to little ole me it was. Up to this point in my alcoholic career I had only drank twice and got drunk once. And when you go away to college and you're not a responsible young adult like I was, (I really wasn't) you are in full charge of yourself! Meaning I could do what ever the FUCK I wanted.

So naturally I did what all small town kids do when they move to the big city (it wasn't) I joined a fraternity!! (Side bar: highly recommend it for the experience, highly discoursge it for the alcohol consumption.... Because there is a lot.....) This was truly a fantastic experience, and I wouldn't change it for the world!! It also helped me down the path to my realization that I AM an alcoholic. It runs in my family, I can't control it. Once I start I don't stop, so I just don't start!

This emotional journey I went on started my freshman year and continued for 8 short (maybe long?) years. August 29th 2009 - May 30th 2017 was the time of my alcohol induced stupor. I learned a lot, did a lot, got 2 DUIs, had an ankle bracelet, violated my probation, spent a FUCK LOAD of money, and really don't have much to show for it. ( Except 50k in student debt) In June of 2015 I was kicked out of college for bad grades. (I can't believe it took them that long, I was on academic probation for like 4.5 years.....)

AAAAAAAAANYWAY, I didn't take this hint that being kicked out of school was a direct result of my alcoholism, because how could it right? I went the ENTIRE month of February (obviously I picked the shortest month of the year) 2015 without alcohol! So I was clearly not an alcoholic!!!
But alas.... That fateful night of May 30th 2017 happened..... It started like every night had that month since school was out. Get out of work at 5, grab a 6 pack of coors light bottles or a 9 pack of aluminum pints depending on who I was meeting, and head to the local shit hole golf course! (Yeah I know a frat guy who golfs.... Sue me....) Only this night was like any other night, because my ole friend fireball decided to show up with one of my buddies!

Y'all know how it works.... Have a few beers, get loose on the course, start playing good and decide a shot or two would help even more! Well.... That day I decided not to eat any food!!! BINGO!!! WE HAVE THE PERFECT COMBO FOR THE BLACK-OUT MONSTER TO COME OUT AND PLAY!!!!

SOOOOOOO yeah I blacked the fuck out. Don't remember leaving the golf course, but supposedly my buddy drove me to another buddy's apartment and they told me I wasn't driving anywhere. Well at some point they gave me my keys so I could get something out of my car, and apparently I just left. Well..... I came out of the black-out slamming on the breaks and sliding through an intersection. I don't actually remember hitting the tree, but I fucked my car RIGHT up. 

I truthfully don't know how I didn't get MORE injured. I had a scrape on my wrist and a light ding on my head.... THAT WAS IT. The car was fucking mangled, I mean the entire passenger side wheel, hub and all, was just fucking gone. 

Thank god for modern engineering....

Sooooo I called 911 told them I was in an accident, and the cop showed up.

Blah. Blah. Blah. Handcuffs, get in the back seat do you know your rights yada yada yada. 

So, there I was, a mid 20s college student starting recovery court. From the start the judge looked at me and said ""you will not be able to cheat this system, if you do, you will make mistakes and you will get caught"". I knew, even before this point, that I needed to do this. I needed sobriety. I fucked up bad, and I didn't deserve the right to drink anymore. I was real fuckin lucky no one died, and I know this. 

And to anyone that wants to berate me for drinking and driving yeah I know it's fuckin bad, I did it, it's over. Getting mad at a stranger on the internet isn't worth the fucking headache. 

Aaaaaanyway I saw this new found sobriety as a means to an end. I had been taking college classes at my local community college, but I was just retaking classes to get my GPA back up. I decided that now was the time to get my shit together and do something more meaningful with my life! 
Once I got sober I continued taking classes.... Only this time I was ready. My first semester sober I made the dean's list (3.0 cumulative GPA for the semester) and eventually was accepted back into my 4 year college!!

So now here I am, 3 years 3 months 17 days later, I'm working on my bachelor's in accounting, I'm planning a wedding, I have a roof over my head that I've worked my ass off to make my own, and I'm sitting at a desk I made.

The moral of this long stupid ass story is, alcoholism doesn't give a fuck who you are. It's not biased and it's not merciful. It will fuck you up, it will hurt you, and it WILL hurt those close to you.

You may be down and you may be out..... just keep your head up, stay sober  and keep fighting!!!

Please just do me a favor internet stranger, stay sober. Do it for me, some dumb-ass-golf-playing frat boy, please. Stay sober because someone out there loves you for you. And I need you to be sober too, because I read the stories on this sub very often, and the help keep me grounded, they help remind me why I do what I do. 

And last but certainly not least, you deserve to be treated like the fucking king or queen you are!!!!! So stay strong, stay sober, and remember you're not along in your fight!!!

Well I'm happy to report after reading alot of very insightful comments I feel back on track again. I made it to six months (today) and as of yesterday I got rid of the cigarettes and am going to stop using them as a means to get some chemical alteration in my brain. I realised how picking up smoking again made me think about drinking and feel closer to something I know is no longer sustainable. (like keeping a toxic ex's texts and reading them from time to time) This is just my own personal experience and not a dig at anyone else. 

Thanks for keeping me sane!",122

I've started seeing a therapist and a Psychiatrist, and got on an SSRI. I largely drank to deal with anxiety/depression. My obsession with alcohol is gone. I don't want to drink. I don't even really think about it anymore, and when I do it's like ""A beer would be refreshing,"" but that thought is immediately followed by, ""Yeah, but we're not just gonna drink one, are we?"" And that's it.

I work weird hours, 7am-5:30pm, and 5:30pm-4 am. My shift swings every two weeks. I can't make a lot of meetings and also get the things done that I need to do like grocery shopping and chores around the house. I feel stretched thin, and honestly making meetings and phone calls is stressing me out more than anything right now. I don't feel like it's helping. And guys keep telling me that I need to make more meetings and that I need to get into the middle of the group not the edge of it. I feel guilty for wanting to get 8 hours of sleep when I'm on night shift instead of making a meeting, or for wanting to go home and wind down. 

Guys use this trick question a lot, ""Did you drink an hour a day?"" And it's like yeah, I did, but I was also only sleeping 5-6 hours and I drank at home. My life is 1000% better than it was 6 months ago. I guess I wanted to see if there were any sober folks who feel fulfilled and like they don't need a program?  I feel like I've made insane progress and I don't feel like that came from going to meetings.  I feel like it was the brutal honesty and connecting to a higher power. 

I'd love your thoughts",8

He quietly understood and went to his league night.  I sobbed while eating a half  assed taco. Then ordered Uber eats (an apple fritter the size of my head and a brownie cheesecake slice) and turned on a Jenny Slate special. Felt guilty and regretted ordering it as soon as I did but I guess not as regrettable as a bottle of wine. 

I hope everyone is holding on tonight. Hopeful when I read about everyone's growth.

I can only clean a house so many times or walk the dog so many times before it just feels pointless. I finally have a good life and the one person I want to share it with doesn’t really care.

I know that not drinking is good for me. I feel better than I’ve had in years. I just don’t think I will care what’s good or bad for me if my wife leaves.

It was a mess, I was a mess. I'm only on day 6 and this isn't my first rodeo so, I still get pangs to say screw it all and get wasted again. But I know that will only end in misery as always.

I'm 32 and the time has come my friends, the time has come.

I hope this to be the first sober year of my adult life.

Outside is alcohol related incidences we basically don’t fight AT ALL.

Unfortunately I don’t have a happy “everything is perfect” sorry to tell. I’ve been feeling pretty terrible the last couple weeks with anxiety, severe fatigue and frequent headaches. After speaking with my counsellor I went to see my family doctor, primarily due to the anxiety, in hopes of finding some relief.

What I actually found was some concerning bloodwork. I don’t know how concerning yet as I haven’t had my follow up with my doctor, but I show some signs of kidney disease and also have very low HDL cholesterol, putting me at a high risk for heart disease. My father died of heart disease at 44, so as scared as I am so glad to know I’m high risk so I can be more proactive in taking care of myself. 

Obviously none of this is good news but I’m so grateful that I got sober and took the time to see my doctor and be honest about my health. At least now I know there is something wrong so I can start getting the help I need. I’ve got a lot of life left to live.

I’m having the opposite problem. When I was drinking I was able to communicate and think of the words I needed immediately, but now that I’m 2 weeks sober, I’m finding my brain hitting road blocks regularly, and I struggle to think of the right terms to use.

Has anyone else had this problem? Is this my brain trying to restructure its pathways or what?",4

I'm applying this to my hobbies, sobriety, and my new career goal. For the love of god if I stopped because I was bad at certain things I'd be bad at them for... forever I suppose? My favorite hobby is powerlifting. I'm just a bench presser these days. If I quit when I was doing it ""badly"" I would've never progressed or been able to set state records or be ranked top 20 for the year. My current professional goal is to become a welder. I suck right now. Like bad. I guess I'm in the ""badly"" state of skill level right now as a welder. But ""the things worth doing are worth doing always"" I got to this point by doing sobriety ""badly"". I sucked at first. Boy the number of day ones I endured.. relapse after relapse for a long time there I didn't see a way out. I thought this was me. There is light at the end of the tunnel. I had to start somewhere and I started by doing sobriety ""badly"" I wouldn't be where I am today if I didn't at least start by doing things ""badly"". IWNDWYT",22

*It took me over 10 years to quit. I found some paperwork from 10 years ago that I was going to submit to a doctor (but never did) where I listed I needed help quitting alcohol. I tried to quit by white-knuckling it a few times, but that never stuck. I had to readjust how I completely saw alcohol in my life - from a treat, a promise, something I deserved, something I needed - to what it truly was in my life: something that hurt my body, mind, and soul. Overall, it was making me sick and boring. Once I got onboard with that way of thinking, I could stay sober because I didn't need alcohol, I was choosing a better path.

*Work with an addiction therapist if you can. If you can afford therapy, and find someone you click with, you can get a lot of work done.

*Utilize podcasts and quit lit and online groups. I recommend Recovery Elevator podcast, Recovery Happy Hour, Quit Like A Woman, The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober, and This Naked Mind.

*You're going to have a ""witching hour"" when you'd normally start drinking. Find some way to fill this time, especially in your early weeks. I was constantly walking when I got home from work to stay busy. I also re-arranged my house, closet, etc. Other times I would just curl up in bed. 

*I wasn't the heaviest drinker, but I had some withdrawal symptoms. I couldn't sleep well for a LONG time, I was really itchy, and I was always thirsty. Try to eat healthy to help your body heal. Take some B vitamins.

*You're going to get a sweet tooth. That's ok. 

*You won't lose weight magically - or at least, I didn't. However, being sober allowed me to lose the 25 lbs I'd packed on over the years and start up a new biking / running / yoga routine. Make physical exercise part of your plan. 

*Your 1sts will be hard in social situations - first Christmas, Thanksgiving, 4th of July - people tend to drink at any get together. It's ok to not explain why you're not drinking, and it's also ok to come up with a little lie (medication, early morning, whatever). I always bring my own non-alcoholic beverages to gatherings and keep an NA drink in my hand so no one can offer me one!

*Some people will be disappointed that you've stopped drinking. My MIL was upset she lost her ""happy hour"" buddies. It's annoying to get this reaction from people, because people don't quit alcohol because they're having a great time with it, and that should be obvious. The people who are pissed about you not drinking tend to either have alcohol issues themselves or are controlling or both.

*It's easy to look back and say ""oh my god, why didn't I quit sooner!!"" Stop that thinking. You can't change what happened, the best time is now. 

*You're still you - I am sorta a nihilistic person. I was worried that drinking was part of my ""edge."" Nope, I can still be a total weirdo with a misanthropic bent while not completely obliterating my body with alcohol every day! Hate other people, not yourself (joking!).

*On that subject - you will have feelings that you'd been suppressing with alcohol. Interestingly, I had a lot of rage and anger that was fueled by alcohol, and once I stopped drinking, I could be a lot more level headed about my feelings towards some of my family. I was able to not get so ruffled by them. That's a big win.

That's about it. I can't say that quitting drinking fixed my life and made it perfect, but I am so much healthier, less anxious, less depressed, and more in control of my actions. I feel like I now have the ability to do all those things I talked about doing when drinking. It feels like I've got a  2nd chance. Just keep trying, even if it takes a long time to stick or if you relapse, and don't beat yourself up!",107

My wife slept at a friend’s house Wednesday night because I was drunk. I texted my boss Thursday after being drunk on wine during teletherapy that morning that I plan on going to rehab. He ask for more specifics on whether I was requesting a leave of absence, quitting my position or what, and I told him I would like to keep working and attend outpatient treatment. He sounded supportive but said I couldn’t work until I get a note from the treatment center stating it was okay for me to work while in treatment. I reached out to a highly regarded outpatient program Friday, and I’m talking to the intake specialist tomorrow. I’m so anxious today. I want to go back to work, but I think it will be hard to look my boss in the face. I’m anxious about starting treatment and what it will entail. I’ve been sitting at home with nothing to do the past couple days with just my thoughts. I’m just really anxious right now.

On the plus side, I thought since Thursday morning that I called my boss and cussed him out while in a blackout state Wednesday night. I must have dreamed that or something because I checked my phone records yesterday and I didn’t have any outbound calls to him that night.

In almost every picture I either had a drink in my hand or was tipsy or whatever already. It was kind of gut wrenching to see. I am thankful for those times and that I experienced them but I'm so much more thankful for this new chapter of my life. I cut off friendships that were toxic to me, I've realized how much of a bad influence I was on others or how easily influenced I was by others, I have become closer with those who bring positivity to my life, I have become stronger mentally/emotionally/and physically, and I feel like I can finally enjoy moments sober and with a clear head. It really puts things into perspective. I realize how much I didn't want to think about or face things. Although it can be overwhelming at times, I'm so thankful for being able to soberly feel my emotions and try to process them and now I know I definitely would benefit from a therapist. Not from a drink.

On a side note, one of my biggest things I'm the most excited for, is when I have my own kids and I can experience and remember every moment with them and be there for them whenever they need me. And my friends and family also. I want to finally be able to help everyone out like they've always helped me. Oh, you need a ride to the airport to catch your 5 am flight? I gotchu. Oh, you need help jumping your car because it broke down? I gotchu. Oh, you need me to give you a ride home because you drank too much? I gotchu. Don't drive. I'm on my way. :)

2020-09-15 14:15:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/iteb1d/365_days/,365 days,"One year ago today, I had my last sip of alcohol. I didn’t know it at the time, as I hadn’t planned to quit drinking. I thought I would never quit. The thought was too terrifying. All I knew is that I was completely miserable, and I had started to realize that alcohol was the cause of my misery. I drank because I was unhappy, but alcohol is what was making me so unhappy. “A hollowed out shell of a person.” That’s how I always thought of myself. I had tried to quit drinking, or moderate several times with no success. This time, something just clicked. I knew I never wanted to feel that way ever again. 

In the past year, I’ve learned what kind of person I am and what I’m capable of without alcohol to mask myself. Here’s what I’ve learned:

      - I can still be fun without booze!
      - Alcohol didn’t really do anything to ease my social anxiety.
      - I can get myself up every morning and go to the gym. 
      - I don’t need alcohol to fall asleep and I sleep better. 
      - I don’t need a drink because my kids were misbehaved or I had a rough day. 
      - I can actually go to a concert (pre-Covid 😭) and remember the entire show. 
      - There are a lot of hours in the weekend when you’re not wasting them lying on a couch because you’re hungover. 
      - I can feel and appreciate my emotions when I’m not drinking to numb them. 
      - I can be a more patient mother and wife without booze. 
     

After one year without alcohol, I can confidently say I am not a hollowed out shell of a person; there’s actually a lot of substance to me! Quitting alcohol is one of the hardest things I’ve ever done, but it does get easier. I can now see that life is too beautiful and precious to waste on alcohol.

That’s not it for me. I don’t drink to have fun, at this point I drink to numb everything and when I don’t my brain is on overdrive. Overthinking, anxiety and sad thoughts. 

Yeah I usually try doing fun things while drinking but the thing I’ve discovered trying to drink less is that it isn’t just that I drink to have fun. I drink because I’m scared about my head and thoughts without the escape. 

I like the numb which I feel like a lot of drinkers do but I’m actually getting more anxious about not being numb, about thinking and dealing with my head. 

Part of me thinks therapy and a project to keep myself busy would be a good step forward but I just thought someone could relate to how I’m feeling. Not drinking today or during the week and trying to master my moving mind.",4

I'm not proud of that, as I'd hoped to prepare my own food and spend less money, but I figure it's better than a relapse, and I'm only on day three.

I think I made it to the other side,"Last week the stuggle was real. I started to get those familiar feelings that crop up for me around the 3-4 month mark. This is usually the time when the novelty of sobriety wears off and all of the immediate health benefits have set in. 

I started to get those whispers about giving up. I started eating poorly and skipping my workouts, which normally precedes a relapse. Once those thoughts creep in, it's really hard to stop them. They persist and get louder each day. Usually, the only way to stop them is to give in and drink.

This time I stayed strong and didn't give in, even though I wanted to. After a rough weekend, I woke up on Monday and felt better. I was refreshed and the voices had quieted. 

Today it's even better. I feel a renewed strength to stay sober, so I wanted to post to make my commitment public. 

It's crazy how these thoughts appear. The first 3 months of sobriety were a breeze and I had very little temptation. Month 4 was a different story. 

I guess my message is to stick with it when it gets hard, because it will. You don't have to drink even when it feels hopeless and pointless. It will end, but sometimes you have to wait it out. That's hard to do.

As great as it is to have other people on similar journeys, I can't help but have some worry about this not being my last ""day one"" as I see many of us struggling with it.  Starting over is so prevalent with this disease (I can only speak for myself in that this is a disease for me).


I saw another post about not getting to the ""good stuff"" by starting over again and again and again and again.  

I want the good stuff.  I also want to drink.  But my desire for the good stuff is starting to outweigh the desire to stop feeling.

One day at a time.  One way or another, I will have a final ""day one"" or just a final day.  I would very much rather have that be my decision.  Decided with a clear mind and a full spirit.


Thank you all for you stories and know that I am struggling, but that I am also succeeding.

I'm going to try to keep it somewhat condensed but I have a lot on my mind haha. FYI after writing it all out I did NOT keep it condensed in the slightest.

&#x200B;

I've lurked in this sub for years. I've only ever really commented once or twice and almost positive I've never actually posted. This is mainly due to the fact that I've never felt I fit in here and honestly don't even know if I do now but, fuck it, let's see.

Now, I know I fit in somewhat because I definitely have a drinking problem. However, I haven't quit drinking for good (yet at least) so I don't know if I truly belong.

So I've been drinking for about 15 years now. My relationship with alcohol has progressively gotten worse. I started drinking it college. I was a heavy drinker there but it rarely caused any problems. I did get thrown in a drunk tank once but that's because I decided to go to Wisconsin for a giant Halloween party a couple months after my first time drinking. I obviously over did it and luckily the cops just tossed me in a drunk tank and gave me a ticket rather than arresting me. However, besides that, my drinking in college was just pretty normal college drinking. I didn't have much of a problem. I transferred to a school back home after my first year and a half at college (for non drinking related reasons) and at that point I barely drank. I actually preferred smoking weed. The next few years were pretty uneventful when it comes to drinking. If I drank I usually just smoked a bunch and had a couple beers.

Fast forward a few years to when I was in my early 20s when I started drinking a lot more heavily. For one, I started hanging out with new friends that were bigger drinkers themselves. Plus I learned that I was a hell of a lot less awkward when drinking. Years later I found out I was just treating my anxiety that I didn't know about with alcohol.

By the time I was 23 I was drinking a ton. Always out partying or at a bar somewhere. Drinking 3 nights a week at the minimum. Blacking out more often than not. Driving while drinking and/or blacked out. I was a fucking mess. I got lucky a few times getting pulled over and not getting a DUI. So I became more and more confident and got to the point where I didn't even care what I was drinking, I would just drive. I thought I was invincible.

On Halloween of 2012 I finally got a DUI. Apparently Halloween is just bad news for me haha. I split a handle of Beam with a friend at a party. Don't remember most of the night. Apparently I snuck out and tried to drive about 25 mins away to another friends house. They didn't even invite me, I just kinda told them I'm coming over and just started driving. Got pulled over after pulling into White Castle a few blocks away from original party. Apparently I pulled in, ordered food, then just left without picking up said food. So I was immediately pulled over. Got arrested. Blew a .26 back at the station. Who knows what I was at when I got arrested. Fucking scary to think about though.

The DUI was a expensive as fuck as I'm sure a lot of you know. It was needed though and it stopped me from drinking and driving any more. However, it didn't stop the drinking. I actually drank more I think because I couldn't drive and my friends could drive my drunk ass around. So the drinking only got worse.

I started dating my now wife in 2014. I cut back my drinking a ton. We actually drank a lot together but I had something to be happy about and wanted to remember my nights so I controlled my drinking pretty well at first. Of course as things progressed I got back into my shitty drinking ways. My main problem with drinking is I'm a binge drinker. Once I get it into my head that I want to get drunk there's no stopping me. I can drink and drink and drink and just keep going til I pass out. I rarely throw up and if I did it only sobered me up or at least that's how it felt haha.

We got married on Halloween of 2015. So I finally had a good Halloween where I didn't do anything stupid haha. Things were starting to look up. Of course, that was not the last of my problems. I embarrassed the fuck out of myself and my wife at a wedding the following year. A wedding I was standing in. It was horrible. That relationship never truly healed. That's a whole god damn story in itself though.

My wife and I argued about my drinking for a long time. It got really bad when she was pregnant with our daughter in 2017. I wasn't drinking much but when I did I went fucking overboard. I went out drinking with a buddy one night when I didn't have a phone and got shitfaced all night. My wife was freaking the fuck out cause she told me to stay home and I didn't. She was very pregnant and very scared. You'd think that would be the final nail in the coffin. Of course not.

A couple weeks later we went to a wedding and I basically did the same thing. We got a hotel for the night before and the night of the wedding. I got absolutely demolished the night before and stayed out til like 5am. I was passed out somewhere and my wife was freaking out. That next day was a fucking mess. I actually didn't drink at the wedding thank god. My wife would have killed me if I did. So at least I was somewhat smart there but at that point it was too late. There was no making up for what I did the night before. She told me to quit drinking or she's leaving me. Now she's said this a few times but this time I truly believed her. So I quit.

I didn't drink until my daughter was born. I actually only started drinking again because my wife did and she asked me to drink with her. I was doing really well though. Actually counting my drinks and being smart about it. Of course that didn't last and things got really bad. Not just with my drinking though but in our marriage in general.

It wasn't until April of 2019 that I found out I have anxiety. Now, I've been treated for it before but the therapist I had didn't actually tell me what was wrong. He just put me on Prozac and it worked. But since I didn't actually know what the problem was I didn't realize how much the Prozac was helping. So for a year before this I was not taking my meds and was a fucking nightmare but I didn't even see how bad it was. My poor fucking wife did. Things were so bad and I'm forever grateful she didn't leave my ass. Anyway, in April my wife forces me to go to a new therapist and he explains that I have anxiety and explains how it affects my life. He puts me back on Prozac and I swear to God it was the most eye opening experience I've ever had. I finally was realizing why I drank like I did and why I used alcohol as a crutch for years.

Things finally started looking up. I had quit drinking because I was losing weight. I was up to 373 when I was off my meds so I quit drinking and started eating right. Things were going great. I was losing weight. My relationship was improving. Things are finally looking up.

Then 4th of July rolls around and I go to my buddy's bday/4th party he throws every year since his bday is on the 4th. He is a few years younger than me and still lives with his parents. They're cool though and always throw a hell of a party. But since it's a 4th party as well there's tons of family there. Since I was dieting I actually strongly considered not drinking at the party at all. My friends are all big smokers and I could have easily just smoked and enjoyed some food and fireworks. Sounds great right? Nope. I thought all week about it and decided to drink. And since I decided to drink I got super fucking pumped about drinking and started drinking at like 10am. The party was at fucking 3pm. I was annihilated by the time I got there. Starting doing shots that were offered to me right when I got there. Hard liquor is never good for me. I blacked out and don't remember anything until I got kicked out. I barely remember that. I found out later I was yelling and swearing at all his family. Then got kicked out. Then while waiting for a ride I fell and broke their ping pong table. At this point I had to wait in the driveway in shame while my mom came to pick us up. We get dropped of at home and my wife decides to go stay at her mom's for the night. I wake up around midnight and and trying to piece everything together. I have no idea where my wife is or what the fuck really happened. I decide to message a friend that actually quit drinking on the 4th 5 years prior. I get some advice and decide to quit drinking.

Of course I don't actually quit. However, things have vastly improved. I rarely drink and when I do I make sure I don't buy more than 6 beers. If I grab a 12 pack I'm drinking them all and I'm blacking out 100% of the time. I found if I drink 6 or less I'm pretty good. However, this only works when I'm at home. If we go out with friends and there's alcohol to go around I don't think I would be able to handle myself.

Fast forward to quarantine. I drank at home quite a bit during quarantine with my wife. But it was all very controlled because I only buy what I want to drink. Things really went well with drinking for the first time in years. Then my wife got pregnant again and she had to quit. Got drunk one night by myself which my wife hates cause she can't stand me drunk when she's sober. I promised her if she'd take me to get more beer I'd quit drinking through the rest of the pregnancy. She agreed. I've only drank once since then, on the day of our gender reveal my wife said I could drink if we found out we were having another girl since that's what we both wanted and she only wanted happy drinking. That was June 27th. I have only had one beer since then but never actually gotten drunk.

Now I'm at a crossroads. I honestly don't know if I ever want to start drinking again. Hell, writing out all the dumb shit (and that definitely wasn't all of it, just the major shit) I wonder why I would ever want to drink again. I love waking up refreshed and spending the day with my daughter. I love remembering every moment I get with her. There's so many reasons not to go back. But right now it's easy to not drink. The wife is pregnant and won't let me cause I said I wouldn't. Plus I can't go do anything due to Covid. So not drinking is easy. Plus I've gotten back into smoking finally after all these years. I'd much rather wind down with a bowl than a beer after a long day. But I worry about the future. When my wife isn't pregnant will we start drinking together again? What happens when we go out (if we ever can) again? haha. Now I have a better understanding of why I drink and how to control it but I fear for being at a party and letting my binging get the best of me. I know it's probably for the best if I just quit. Especially after writing this all out. But I feel by the time that comes I'll forget. I'll try to drink thinking I can control it and fuck up yet again. As it is, I still get cravings but when I wake up the next day after not drinking I'm always so glad I did and wonder why I even wanted to in the first place. So who knows.

My god that was fucking long. So if you stuck around, thanks haha. But that's why I feel I don't necessarily fit in here. I have not officially quit drinking even though I don't drink currently. IDK. So many fucking thoughts go through my head when I think about never drinking again. I don't know if I can actually do this forever.

TLDR: my entire fucking drinking life story and me trying to decide if I ever want to drink again once life goes back to ""normal.""",3

Nothing bad happened, everyone seemed to have a good time. But I hate that I was fairly drunk most evenings, and sneaking off to slam drinks during the day to stave off a hangover. 

Everyone is far too polite to say anything. But I had fantasized, truly fantasized, about being sober for a family gathering like this. And yet another one where I wasn't. It may be a year before I get a chance again. 

I will not drink today. Or this week. But I really, really don't want to drink at the next family gathering... I don't know why I suddenly forgot how important that was to me.

I used to just binge drink in college but over the past 4 years it's gotten really bad. I'm up to about 10 IPAs a day and usually a bottle of whiskey. I'm waking up today to the crushing anxiety I know we all know about. What did I say or do when I blacked out, how did I embarrass myself again, who did I make uncomfortable. I have a girl friend and we are in different cities rn due to covid and I cheated on her last night because I drank to much and lost my self control. I'm disgusted by this person I've allowed myself to become. Blowing hundreds of dollars a week to drink myself into an early grave. I don't exercise anymore, I hardly am able to even take care of myself. I've gotten sober a few times over the past couple years, even got up to 37 days once after I tried to kill myself after a massive bender. My withdrawals are always pretty bad.. Shaking, insomnia, can't eat and then there's the extreme depression and mood swings that come with it. I know the first few days are the worst and after a week I start to even out, but this 1st day is always the hardest. At this point I'm in tears because I've never actually written down anything about my addiction and it's pretty damn scary reading this and putting myself out here like this.

So I'm 36 and my hearing is as equal to a 80 year old.. I finally had enough and went to the Dr and they did some blood work and said I should get an MRI of my brain (which I am having done today....).. First thing I think of is oh shit they're going to know how much I've been drinking and for how many years.. Then I think oh shit.. I'm going to realize how much I've been drinking and for how long and actually see the damage it's done to me.

I got my blood work done and only thing that was off was my rheumatoid factor was 23 when it should be below 14.. There's no way I have rheumatoid factor as I am a long distance runner and run marathons and have no muscle or joint pains.. Then I look at other causes that could cause this and liver cirrhosis was one of them.. I don't think I have that as I am 36 and have no other symptoms.. but obviously I'm scared yet terrified it could be.

Has anyone else had similar tests done? I am beside myself and obviously thinking the worst.

The most fucked up thing is I am hoping I have something more seriously wrong with me rather than it being my fault from drinking.

The saddest part is if all of this is cause of my drinking I have a hard time justifying why bother stopping if I fucked up this bad already :'(

I didn't want to mention it here, but I still have to.  I'm still very ashamed and mad at myself for wasting away a good chunk of my 30s on booze.  I'm only barely a month off the poison and I now see clearly what I had right in front of my eyes.  The real me is not the person watching the clock like an eagle to see 5:00 appear so I could open a beer.  The real me is not the person laying on the sofa at 8:00, six beers in, without energy to do anything but keep on boozing.  The real me is not the person waking up in sweat at 2:00am swearing I would not drink the next day.  The real me is not the person who decides at 9:00am that I will in fact drink so that the voice in my head will shut the F up about it.

I'm not that person.  The alcohol whispered lies to my ears and I believed them.  The real me loves life and is starting to love himself too.  The real me loves spending time in the evening with my daughter.  The real me loves waking up fresh in the morning and ready for the day.  The real me loves remembering what I watched on my Netflix show the last night.  The real me loves being able to play competitive video games at night with full coordination (as competitive as a 40 years old father can be vs 18 years old kids!)

I'm looking forward to the second half of the game of life.  I will play better, be better.  Don't get me wrong, it is not easy.  I'm still in the first steps of this whole sobriety thing.  But I will stay strong and finish strong.  When the final whistle blows, I'll be able to take one last look back at my life with pride.  IWNDWYT

All I can think is how nice getting drunk in the sun would be right now. I'm trying to imagine what exactly it is that I hope to gain from it but I can't. Yet the urge to day drink is raging. It's almost like my addiction invents reasons for me to drink and plants them in the form of tiny seeds in my mind. They spout and suddenly I have this idea that today I should drink. I mean what would I even do. Stop working obviously. Spend more money. Walk the streets. Maybe meet strangers. Most probably feel crap tomorrow. I can't understand why I feel like it's such a good time to be out in the sun drinking. I'm having this wtf am I moment. I see you guys at like 2 years in and still saying you have these kind of days/moments. It just makes me feel so confused. I changed my number 6 days ago and ghosted basically everyone I knew in an act of desperation to get sober off a binge. Now I miss my friends and my toxic life. On the other hand. I've been doing well with my work life. I'm getting more jobs and finally seeing the horizon which is me being able to clear my debt and maybe even make my bills on time next month. Hopefully even save a little. Also been eating and training better. It's not all doom and gloom. I don't know though guys this is the second day running and the cravings have been through the roof. I don't know if I can keep this up for much longer. Hopefully I'll come to my senses soon. Until then I'm couch bound, taking the afternoon off work and just allowing myself to be.

I was sober for several months, which was the longest stretch in my adult life by a mile.  And then sometime during quarantine I started up again and it continued for several months until last week.  It was not quite as frequent as it was before (which was every damn day), but it was still almost every day.  Same story as before, wife and kids go to bed, I'd drink a bunch of whiskey, not be at my best, but still get up in the morning for work, blah blah blah.  

Looking back, I am not entirely sure why I started up again like that.  Quarantine was/is stressful, and we have two small children, but neither my wife nor I lost our jobs or had any financial pressures.  I suppose it was some kind of escape from the uncertainty of everything, but I know that's just a silly excuse.  

In any event, last week I decided to try again and give it another honest effort, and it's going really well so far.  That effort includes checking in here with you fine people as often as possible.  I am a little mad at myself given how I could have 7+ months behind me right now, but I am not going to dwell.  This most important thing this sub has taught me is to look forward and focus on the benefits of sobriety and to not beat yourself up over mistakes of the past.  

Anyways, I am glad to be back in the fold.  Thanks to everyone, IWNDWYT:)",36

Tbh I'd given up.  Everyday I'd promise myself: ""Today's the day!"" But, every night the Thirst would get me, and time would pass. The more I reflected on what drinking had taken from me, the more depression consumed me, the more I drank. I'm sure my cycle was all too common. I could barely keep food down, so much vomiting, my insides hurt everyday. But, I just kept drinking. 
One of my old party buddies died suddenly, he was 43. Looking at him in the casket, his children, and family sobbing, I knew I'd be next. 
That was when this journey began, it's not been perfect, I've made mistakes. Each time I slip up, I start again. But, I never see it as a failure, just another chance to get it right. 
I've been sober almost 3 years.

Always beer, and I started mostly because I was already addicted to weed and wanted to stop smoking weed. I know, stupid,
but i didn’t know better at 18.

I got used to the two beers in the evening and i started to drink a third and it got more and more. I also started smoking weed again and here i am, 24 years of age, drinking beer every single evening and also smoking weed in most of my free time, addicted to both.

I knew i had a problem for several years now but it got clearer and clearer to me and i have to finally quit. I have a job but I’m far away from the work i could actually deliver if I had my life together.

I spend way too much money on this shit, my friends and family became second priority and altogheter i’m absolutely not the person I want to be. The addiction made me a manipulative person, which i despise. I don’t do sports anymore (used to do sport every day when i was younger), i became unhealthy (no engery, gained weight, stomach problems because of all the beer), i don’t have my finances under controll and no ambition for the future.

But deep down, i know that’s not me. I know i’m not this person, i really don’t like what i have become since abusing alcohol and weed. It’s time to face my many many problems.

I have been a lurker on this sub and learned a hell of a lot about our problem before deciding to quit myself. I love this sub and the people. And i’m finally ready to join the sober-journey!! Alcohol and weed cold turkey, here i come.

(a long one!),"  ""I would rather go through life sober, believing myself and alcoholic, than go through life drunk, pretending that I was not""

My last drink was September 14th 2019. It was my husbands 40th birthday party. I had decided the week before to stop drinking again, but I was finding it really challenging to not drink at this party. I took a glass of champagne, and then another. As I was half way through the glass I just remember looking at it, and thinking… “No. I don’t want this” and I put it down and went to get a soda water. I stayed at the party for a further 6 hours, dancing into the small hours while children fell asleep on couches all around. I felt free and wonderful.

I suppose I have been an alcoholic forever. My first memories of drinking are of drinking to excess. I didn’t like the taste of alcohol, although I think I knew I was supposed to, but that release, the feeling of getting out of your own head (by getting off your head), was just what teenaged me thought I needed. Those first few drinking experiences, hidden from parents and other adults, with my friends in the woods, on the beach, near where I lived, were a form of rebellion against the very civilised, structured, and ordered drinking that I saw my parents do it home. My parents both drank regularly then, but never to visible adverse effect, and always good wine, from bottles, and they drank out of wineglasses. There were conversations about the virtue of this bottle over that bottle, and I have always known that one drank red wine out of one kind of glass, but white wine from another.

By contrast, the drinking I did with my friends, was to get drunk. Or at least, that is what I now understand was my own aim. We would mix whatever small quantities of stolen liquor we could get from our parents cabinets, top it up with a beer or two, shake it, and then swig it out of whatever old soda bottle we had handy. Absolutely disgusting. But very effective. I think I probably had blackouts even then, of course it hard now to remember how much of it is just me forgetting, because it was now so long ago, but I definitely remember at least once waking up the next morning and knowing there was something that I had forgotten that happen the night before. I also remember looking at my friends, and seeing how hangover they were, and being unbelievably thankful that I didn’t feel the same way.

I now curse that strong head and strong stomach that I had when I was younger, I think perhaps if I had received the same physical after-effects as everyone else upon overindulgence, maybe things would have been different, but perhaps not.

I had an amazing childhood. My parents are loving, kind, academic, snobby about their own taste while at the same time accepting of other people’s differences. My father, outgoing, social, endlessly imaginative, would weave these wild stories that would keep me enthralled. My mother, more reserved, less flamboyantly intelligent, but actually probably smarter, did all kinds of arts and crafts activities with me, we were constantly creating, and she taught me to look at everything, to be interested in everything, to find something to think about every time I open my eyes. I now see that although this upbringing was remarkable, it was also exhausting. And something that I was happy to use alcohol or pot to occasionally escape from. I didn’t drink or smoke every week as a teen – I didn’t have access to it, and I was busy doing other things. But when I did it, I DID it.

Another thing to note, an essential part of my life, was my sister. Born when I was nearly 3, she had an undiagnosed, and undiagnosable, muscular weakness which kept her non-verbal and in a wheelchair her whole life. Growing up, I accepted her differences without question. I was different from you, you were different from him, so course she was different from me. Obviously. As I got older, I began to see that this was not so obvious to everybody else, and I pitied them for their own lack of understanding. As she grew older the muscles on her body, especially in her lungs, did not keep pace with the rest of her growth. She was in and out of hospital with chest infections, pneumonia, sinus problems… She died at home, in her sleep, just before her 12th birthday. I was 14.

I had some bad months, naturally, after her death. My parents and I made what was actually quite an easy decision, to have me go to boarding school in the UK. Boarding school had always been an idea floated around, my parents liked the idea that I would have “a British education”, but I had not wanted to leave her. She and I were very close, and I could not imagine being without her, or how she would have felt being without me. I have always tried to be a positive person, and so I was able to see, even through my grief, that her death had in a way set me free, and I was now able to make a choice for myself. I chose to go to England. Subsequently, I have wondered whether this was the moment when my father’s own struggles with alcohol became unmanageable, but I am wise enough not to feel guilt over this hypothetical, potential, unknowable, idea.

I have always been social, outgoing, dare I say it, funny, and so on one hand I knew I didn’t “need to drink”, but there was something about the way drinking made me feel. It made me reckless, uncaring, even a bit cruel, things that I absolutely am not. There was a sort of crazy freedom in being someone else, and people liked that person I was when I was drinking. I was always in the centre of a group of people, egging other people on to drink to excess, or engage in stupid behaviour. When I was drunk, or drinking, I could do all the things I loved to do with abandon – dance, sing, talk loudly, be flirty, dirty, and indiscreet. This was a feature of my drinking until the day I stopped. 

At the same time, I was a good student, always getting high marks, always handing my work in on time, always volunteering, seeking out new opportunities to do internships, or to make a little bit of extra money by helping out here and there. I traveled widely, meeting all kinds of people wherever I went, making contacts, connections, and I have been very good at using these connections to build a very interesting life myself. This has continued to this day - professionally, I can say that I have done very well for myself. I have a diverse and interesting career, enacting the professional values I have come to honour in my own work, which continues to excite me.

Personally I’ve also been very lucky. I’ve had numerous bad experiences (the usual alcohol related thefts, robberies, assaults and rapes) but somehow I always managed to tidy them away in my brain. After a number of okay to terrible relationships in my 20s, when I was 30 I met a man... Very quickly we realised it was serious. Within about three months he had cancelled his return ticket home so he could stay and see what was going to develop between us. We were living together a few months later, he moved into the shared house I was living in, and then after we had been together for a year we moved together into a smaller house just the two of us. He proposed on Boxing Day after we’d been together 2 and ½ years, and were married the following summer. By August 2013 we had a baby boy, and his sister was born February 2016. Both children are healthy, happy, curious, beautiful, engaging and altogether wonderful little beings. My husband and I have our share of ups and downs, with the downs being a little more apparent in the last couple of years, but overall have a very loving solid committed relationship that is fulfilling mentally and emotionally and socially.

Throughout the 20 years I have been living in Asia I have been drinking frequently, No one has ever thought I have a problem – I blend in well with both the local and expatriate communities I live in, I don’t think my drinking is noticeable to other people the way it has been noticeable to me. But notice it I have. 

I have, on numerous occasions, blacked out when drinking, only to ‘come to’ to find myself engaged in some kind of sex act. To find out that I have been driving. I once ‘came to’ to find myself on a different Thai Island than the one I had started partying on. I have forgotten countless indiscretions, secrets, exchanges. I have made promises and not remembered them, I have broken hearts, relationships, promises and my own values. And I didn’t care. I hardly remembered about these experiences until I began working the steps, and dug deep into my memories. Once I was chatting to the police, having been stopped driving drunk. I managed to talk my way out of any consequence, as I always have. 

Part of this, of course, is because of my father. My father was also the absolute best at talking his way out of any problem or trouble. I learned that at his knee. I think I first realised my father was an alcoholic when I was already living in Asia. Although I remember him being anxious to make sure he made it to the liquor store before it shut, or choosing a restaurant that had a bar attached, or hiding wine in his coffee mug… but those recollections and understandings came later.

I came to Asia when I was 20, and settled in a large ramshackle house. In 2002 my father came to visit me. I think the house had five bedrooms, and I was sharing it with three other people, two of whom were English teachers and so had unusual hours, including teaching at night, whereas myself and another had more regular office hours. The consequence of this was there always seemed to be somebody awake, drinking, having a party. It was an excellently fun time. We were all earning enough money to be social and have what we consider to be “a grown-up life”, but not learning so much that we had to try and be responsible, or worry about savings. My father stayed with us for two weeks, and after he left I went into his room and found bottles of alcohol in the cupboard. Empty bottles. I remember staring at them and thinking “why?” In this house of all places, why would you need to hide your alcohol consumption? I realised later, that he was already in the habit of hiding his consumption, and it didn’t occur to him to drink openly as much as he wanted.

My mother was very worried about him, although I was living far away, and wasn’t aware of everything, I know that she took at least one year long sabbatical to the UK during this time, as a way to try and emphasise to him the seriousness of his condition. And, of course, the way it was affecting her. I don’t have the timeline straight, it doesn’t seem to me, right now, to be worth the painful picking through my mother’s memories, to find out exactly what happened when, and my father is no longer here to ask, but basically between 2005 and 2012 my father ceased to be any sort of functioning alcoholic, and became one with the bottle. He was placed on medical leave from his job in 2012, and he had at least two accidents with his car before then, and he stopped driving – I have no idea how he managed to avoid trouble with the police. In 2013, just before I gave birth to my first child, my father went, semi-involuntarily, to a residential rehab facility. He came out of the treatment centre, and literally must have gone directly into a bar, before missing his flight to Paris, where I was waiting to have the baby, until he finally managed to get on a flight, with some crazy lie about storms and delayed flights et cetera et cetera, and arrived in Paris, disheveled, and drunk.

Although I was devastated, I was also about to have a baby, and obviously that’s where my focus was. My uncles came from the UK to Paris to pick my father up, and taken back to the UK, where they managed to sober up, and so began a period of everyone trying to talk to him. It is a long, common, and boring story. My mother left him, they had to sell the family house I grew up in, and when I brought my second baby to Canada to meet my father in 2016 I was desperately worried. I begged him to go back to rehab (he had gone again to a different centre in 2015), but he refused. He was yellowing and clearly very very sick. He died, alone, 6 weeks later, two days before my son’s third birthday.

I am angry about that. I am angry that he was an alcoholic, that he refused to receive, or listen to, or accept, help. I am angry that he died before my children could really know him, I am so sad that they will never hear his magical stories, that he will not be able to introduce them to classical music, poetry, two of the things that I hold so dear to my own life. And I try to turn this anger into a drive to ensure that my life wont follow the same trajectory.

It was around this time, the time of my father’s death, when I started to think about my own alcohol consumption in a serious way. I had stopped drinking just after I got married, because I knew we wanted to start trying for a baby. I didn’t drink throughout my pregnancy, nor for the first six months while I was exclusively breastfeeding. It was the same for my second pregnancy and early months breastfeeding, although by the time I had my daughter, new research had come out to indicate that having wine while breastfeeding, a glass or two, and not every day, was not detrimental. And so I would, on occasion, do that. I had not found it difficult to stop, nor to moderate while I was breastfeeding, but I had a few months between weaning the first and getting pregnant with the second when I saw how easy was to drink. The big change for me, was that now I experienced what hangover was.

I think this feeling of being hung over, is what has directly led me to my sobriety today. It was because I realised that I was ruining my weekends, and it was getting to the point where I was going to have to take time off work if I drank in the week, and I thought I can do this anymore. Also, of course, I was not always able to remember everything about the night. My blackouts were increasingly extensive, and getting worse. Also, arguments. Arguments with my husband, and even though my complaints may have been valid, I managed to blow it all up, by becoming incomprehensible, or overemotional, or mean. Also, being irrational and cross with the children, no patience left at all. Turning into something I hated, not the mother I aspired to be. Also, day drinking. Fucking Mommy Wine Culture. This idea that raising children is difficult, we are asked to do so much, to take on so much of the emotional workload for families, as well as having thriving professional and social lives, and instead of trying to actively dismantle Patriarchal institutions which limit our ability to be equal participants in life, hey, just have a drink. It is so dangerous. And yet, I embraced it. How much fun to get together with girlfriends, drink wine, gossip/bitch/complain about our work/children/husbands, and still be spending the day with the children, and still be at home by 7 o’clock to put the kids to bed. So what if we were drunk. So what if we were driving. Just so dangerous.

Those were the realisations. Hangovers, blackouts, arguments, anger, day drinking… That is more than enough.

I realise that I have, always, in addition to having real friends that I actually like and value, made and developed friendships with other alcoholics, or users, to support my own habits, to make me feel better about my own drinking, and I would seek them out when I wanted to feel enabled, because I knew they would not judge me, for turning up to their house, with a bottle of wine.

Honest reflection that has happened in the last 365 days has revealed things to me which indicated that I did indeed have a problem, apart from hangovers, although some of them, for many reasons, I was seemingly unable to see. For example, no matter how many times I would say “I will ensure I have three alcohol free days this week”, I was very rarely able to manage that. Or, I would say to myself, “I will go and have three drinks but no more”. I was very rarely able to manage that either. Or, I would say, “I can have a glass of wine with dinner, but only wine, and only with dinner”. Ha. Or, I would say “one alcoholic drink, one soda water, one alcoholic drink, one soda water”. And I would wake up with a hangover.

I have been able to go for long periods of time without drinking. Pregnancies, breastfeeding, I did Buddhist Lent which is three months once, and twice before this time, I have stopped. But both times, after feeling so much better, I thought that maybe now I would understand how to moderate, how to drink like a normal person. But although after each time I started drinking again, I might manage a week or two, or a month even, of “normal” drinking, pretty soon I would find myself, much drunker than I meant to be, driving home (!!!), at 10 PM.

I saw how alcohol killed my father. When I first told my husband, and some other friends that I was in alcoholic their first response was to look at me blankly. They, like me, had thought an Alcoholic was someone who drank every day without fail, Someone who was failing in their life, someone who everyone agreed was an alcoholic. I think for so many of us, we have a fixed idea of what an alcoholic is. And that idea does not look like me. That idea is not healthy, successful, engaging, functional… That idea is something further down the path. But what I have said to my husband and my friend is that I am on that path. If I don’t stop now, that is what will happen to me. I will not suddenly magically overnight gain the ability to moderate. I will not suddenly magically overnight be able to have a normal relationship with alcohol. Because I am an alcoholic. One can note that I have come to this realisation before complete rack and ruin. Wonderful. Well done me. But that does not change the fact that am an alcoholic.

When you drink to excess without meaning to, when you put yourself and your children and your friends into dangerous situations because of your drinking, when you choose friendships and social situations based on how much you think you can get away with drinking, when you are not in control… That’s when you know you’re in alcoholic.

Stopping drinking for a while was an obvious thing for me to do, and it felt good. But then I began to wonder “when can I start drinking again”. And that’s when I began to delve into AA literature, because I thought “what the fuck is wrong with me”. I know what this is. I have seen what this is. I saw how it killed my father, how it killed my friend. I do not want this life for me, my husband, my mother, for my children, for my friends and the only way I can do that, the only way I can see to have the life I want to have, is if I stay sober. It is only though talking with other alcoholics that I came to realize how normal, how predictable, how boring this all was. 

People told me AA works. People say it’s simple but it isn’t easy. People say the elevator to sobriety is broken take the steps. People say if you aren’t working on your recovery then your relapse is working on you. Okay then. Here I am.

I have attended at least 1 meeting every week for the last year. I have a sponsor and I have worked the steps. I have made inventory and amends. I pray and meditate and seek conscious contact with my Higher Power. The complete transformation that I have achieved in my life is miraculous, but it is not a miracle. It is the result of my own hard work, commitment to the steps of AA and the fellowship of the women and men in AA. 

Today my life is good. Being sober has not changed the challenges and joys of living a full and active life. But it has made me better able to participate in it. It has ensured I have turned up when I was supposed to, to support those who needed it, to remember all the joys of my kids in the last year… And it means that when the worry of Covid struck, and the inevitable problems have cropped up at work, or the micro tragedies of life have happened… I have been able to withstand the waves. To breathe through the pain. To keep my side of the road clean. To see my part. To make good and conscious decisions on what to do. I have been able to apologise when I need to, and to avoid bad situations. My sobriety has made me a better person and a better friend. A better wife and a better mother. 

In the interest of full disclosure… I should acknowledge that some of my friendships with those who still drink heavily have weakened as our friendships did not withstand the distance I put on them as I stopped going out to bars. My marriage struggled as I gained sobriety – my husband being dragged along on a journey he had not asked for and sometimes he just wanted his freewheeling happy and carefree wife back – a lot of talking and some therapy were very useful. Some days were difficult without the ease of a glass of wine for that instant fix. But I have developed new coping strategies. I have realized I can sing and dance on tables and be flirty and dirty – in appropriate ways – completely sober. And my husband and I have a happy and healthy marriage – one that we both actively work on and contribute to.

But overall? My life is immeasurably better, and my future is strong and bright.

My name is multiformed, and am an alcoholic. And today I have 365 days of continuous sobriety.",55

Fast forward to today I am pretty sure that ulcer has been back for at least a year and I haven't taken aspirin or any pain relievers but guess what I have done..drank a shit ton of wine and coffee. The pain goes away when I'm drinking wine but comes back like a mother after. I'm laying here now with pain searing all the way through to my back. I'm scared to take prilosec because they told me its so bad for you but I guess I'm not too scared to drink myself to death with a bleeding ulcer.

You don't drink too much
You enjoy wine in social situations why deprive yourself
You don't have a problem 
Having a 1/2 bottle of wine a night is not that much 

I've also gone into a fib 6 years ago and had to have my heart stopped and restarted from throwing up from drinking two bottles of wine at a retirement dinner (not mine) I was told that I should stop drinking but instead I just make sure I don't throw up.

We may be a world apart, but  we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily  commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to  inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a  sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*.  It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes  impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person  can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again.  And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not  drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that  they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and  participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at  /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed  introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.  You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning Sobernauts!

How’s everybody doing today?

So every day this week, I said I wanted to share something with you that this community has given to me over the years. 

Today’s something: the type of person who has a problem with alcohol. 

So we all have the image: the drunk sitting on the park bench, daytime drinking. The person who’s lost their home, their job, and  family because they can’t control their drinking. And while those  stereotypes do exist, they do not categorize the majority of people who have a problem with alcohol. 

Catherine Gray in The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober explodes some of the myths we have about problem drinkers. That we are all somehow  stupid, weak, losers with a hedonistic and addictive personality to  boot. However she says that the reality is quite different. 

Alcoholics tend to be big earners with successful careers. Studies have also shown that: “people with higher IQs booze more.” In addition,  Annie Grace says: “the personality traits most exhibited by alcoholics,  are actually positive things; including openness to experience, extrovertism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and neuroticism.” 

And as to addictive personalities, Annie Grace shows who the real villain of the piece is: “We protect alcohol by blaming addiction on a  person’s personality rather than on the addictive nature of alcohol.”  Catherine Grey also calls bullsh\*t on the hedonism: “the strongest  predictor of whether someone will become addicted to alcohol, is a  traumatic childhood.”

This community backs all of that up. I see successful professionals, parents, and upstanding members of our communities. None of us are  losers (far from it), and none of us were destined to have a problem  with alcohol based on our personalities. For whatever reason, we needed  to self-medicate, and we just happen to live in a world where a  dangerous and addictive drug is legal. 

I also see people taking responsibility for their actions and  supporting each other in the most wonderful and non-judgmental way. I’ve  seen some of the most beautiful examples of humanity here. I’ve seen  parents wanting to be better mothers and fathers to their children, and  people with over 10,000 days reach out to help someone who can’t even  manage a few hours. I do not wish to suggest that our alcohol issues  have not caused damage to those we love, only to say that none of us   envisioned being this way. 

If that’s the type of people who have a problem with alcohol, then I’m truly in the best of company.

All it led to was an underwhelming experience of being drunk again, wicked bad hangovers(worse than before) and almost all of my health gainz going down the toilet. Wasted waste of time. 

I've been back on track for a couple days now. I need to get back to where I was. Mad as hell at myself that I would just decide to fuck it up. Could be farther by now, but mistakes have been made.

One recent, unexpected consequence (thought/feeling?) that has occurred for me is this feeling of intense fear of alcohol. I had a nightmare that I unknowingly drank an alcoholic beverage and subsequently came totally unraveled (went on a bender, lost my job/relationship, etc). I woke up totally shaken and it had me feeling thrown off the remainder of the weekend. I spent 2 days feeling terrified of alcohol and then because of the stress, I also craved it pretty intensely. 

Although the cravings were a bit strong, I wasn’t actually anywhere near drinking thankfully. It was just the strongest craving I’ve had since I stopped (I’ve had basically no cravings). Since I quit, I have felt nothing but empowered and in control. This feeling of fear of alcohol came completely out of left field. Ive never felt afraid of alcohol, even at my lowest of lows. I never blamed alcohol, I blamed my choices. I have felt fearful of myself on alcohol, but never the alcohol itself. I’ve had dreams of drinking before (since I’ve been sober), and I’ve woken up a bit confused but without any lasting feelings of fear or worry. I don’t find feeling fearful is particularly helpful in remaining sober. If anything, it’s occupying more brain space and producing completely unnecessary anxiety. After reading the Naked Mind, I have learned to be a bit kinder to myself for my history of choosing a substance that is so addicting, so perhaps developing a fear of the stuff is the next stage of my recovery journey?  Has anyone else developed a tremendous fear of alcohol while sober? Tips for working through it?

I won't get into details, but there was a short period of optimism, a glimmer of hope that we would have more time with her, before her shocking end. I can't stop thinking about my poor girl, panting and scared beyond belief, waiting for help that never came as I slept soundly down the hall.I'm stuck in that endless feedback loop of ""could have/should have/would have"" and it's wrecking me.

The grief feels like a parasite. I feel like I'm carrying around this ugly, oozing, pulsing creature that's hollowed me out. I'm embarrassed to say that I've lost people very close to me, people I've loved and cherished, but this is the first time I've felt truly gutted. Much of my career has been spent working from home, so I've shared almost every waking moment of the past few years with this dog by my side. Struggling with fertility, every negative pregnancy test left me weeping while she comforted me with her big warm head. And during the darkest times, when I was crying and chugging directly from the bottle and dozing off only to jolt awake and drink some more, she was patiently wrapped around me, the only living being on earth who knew the destructive pain I was in. She saw me, this pathetic raw wound of a person that was poisoning herself into oblivion, and she fucking loved me anyway.

A dog trainer told me that canines know every nuance of your scent and that being drunk is alarming to them, because you no longer smell the way you're ""supposed"" to. I know how totally absurd this sounds, but one of the aspects of sobriety I was secretly proud of is that my dog once again smelled me the way she used to before I fell down the bottle. These past 130 days she got to experience me as the person who pulled her out of the kennel all those years ago, not the drunk I became.

I guess I'm posting this because many of you know astounding, crippling, all-encompassing grief, and you know how alluring it seems to pour some alcohol on that pain. I want a glass (okay, a bottle) of whiskey so bad I can taste it. And I don't care about my well being, my future, or my health right now. But what I do care about is this my memory of this dog. And when I play the tape forward, I realize that the grief you experience when you lose something meaningful is a testament to that person/animal/thing. So by drinking, I'm dishonoring the pain I owe it to her to fully experience. She deserves for me to remember these first few agonizing days with clarity. She deserves for me to cycle through the feelings the way they're presenting themselves. And she deserves for this mourning to be purely about her, and her beautiful spirit and her soft warm belly and her gentle brown eyes and how the world is a worse place without her, and not about me relapsing. 

Besides a time machine, there's nothing I want more than to drink with you today. But for Junebug, IWNDWYT.",16

This incident brought up a lot of old memories about my dad's drinking habits and accidents he has been in due to drinking (he is a functional alcoholic). Growing up I really thought alcohol was a norm at family events and get togethers, or ever just going out to dinner. I've always had a mixed relationship with alcohol, my dad, his dad, my great grandma and grandpa were all alcoholics. I've been drinking since I was in 8th grade.. it really hadn't hit me till my boyfriend proposed to me and the thought of having a family with him made my thoughts of alcohol really emotional to the point that I don't even want to have alcohol in the house. Not only did it affect me but my boyfriend as well, he wants to be sober too after his first DWI. Alcoholism and substance abuse also runs in his family. I guess I've never thought of becoming sober until now.. why am I having such a hard time giving it up when all it's done is brought trauma and anxiety to my life? How can I give it up without the thought that I will miss it? 
Sorry for such a long post, guess I kind of needed to vent. I don't have anyone sober in my family.

Edited to add 
I keep saying boyfriend but I said yes when he proposed, so we are officially engaged and hopefully we can continue to stay sober together. We'll take it day by day. 🙂",7

How many of you watched *I'm Thinking of Ending Things* over the weekend? Yes? You too? Well I'm sure we'll have decided what it was about and what we think of it after it's had about 2.5 years to roll around in our heads. Meanwhile, what else are you reading and watching and tuning into in whatever way?

I have to admit, I'm not keeping up with the journaling well. Already. The Stoicism stuff is depressing. The part I started in is all about turning your back on pleasure and extra things in life and living simply, like, in preparation for hard days. To steel yourself for bad times that might lay ahead. I can't help but keep thinking ""aren't **these** the bad times right here right now?"" It's good stuff, I know, but I'm not engaging well with it. 

I've also given up journaling along with Ross Gay's *Book of Delights*.  Waiting to read it until I had my journal ready was making it a slow go and I decided to just plow through. 

Over the weekend I read a novel called *The Jetsetters*. This thing was rather like a lowbrow literary but emotionally sophisticated episode of cheesy 70s TV show *Love Boat*. I haven't bothered to search this, but I'm betting I'm not the only ""reviewer"" to use that low hanging fruit of an analogy. So high art it was not. But you know what? I fucking loved it. I absolutely devoured that shit. It was EXACTLY what I needed and I'm looking forward to checking out more of this author's work. And bonus points for having an alcoholic character that is not too awful much of a cliche. I could really relate >!when he was struggling horribly to recall what the product even was that he told his venture capital firm to invest every cent in whilst in a blackout. I mean, I've never done that exact thing. But I've had important conversations in blackouts and tried to hide from the other party that that was the case and just tried to pretend as best I can that I'm acting now or doing what was decided in said conversation, wishing desperately that some shred of memory would come to me. Scouring my brain for it, and there's just nothing. What misery that was.!< That part was relatable and made me feel great about leaving all that behind me.

This sobriety thing is terrifying, but I think I'm finally ready. I think...

Started smoking pot at age 15 and was an almost instant all day smoker until I switched to booze when I was in my early 20s and actively tried to switch because my friends seemed to have so much fun with it. It was godawful and I remember having to make a concerted effort to stand the taste and I unfortunately succeeded.

It was only a matter of a year or so when I went from daily smoking to daily drinking. It was great until it wasn't and then I remember when I turned 30 I didn't want that life anymore. I had gone from the fun loving social party girl to the person who dreaded social engagements so I could get home to drink alone and not have to worry about driving. 

Thinking over the last two decades I truly think the longest I've been sober from any substances has been 3 or 4 days. For 20 years. The last decade being alcohol. I've lately been averaging just over a pint of hard liquor a night (sometimes with wine or beer). I know covid has escalated this.

I have a lucrative career with hobbies, friends, family, homeowner, etc and I think I've successfully hid the extent of it from everyone, but who knows if anyone picks up on it. 

I've had some very real and very scary moments because of alcohol. I hide booze in my car and pour it in pop cans to drink to have a buzz before I get home (the guilt of this is horrendous). I hide booze in the house to keep the edge off all night. I have become the master of feigning memory of events and conversations that I have zero recollection of and I am not unfamiliar with nursing one hell of a puking hangover before walking into the boardroom. I have to wear a significant amount of makeup everyday to hide the bags under my eyes, parched skin, and perma-red face (please tell me the red face goes away in time....???)

I live everyday to get to the end of the workday to start the drinking and I've realized I'm just plain miserable. Life doesn't have any joy in it outside of drinking and there isn't even any joy left in that anymore. 

I'm terrified because I don't know who I am sober. I've never been sober in my life that I remember. But I want to figure out who sober me can be. I'm so freaking fortunate to not have hit a rock bottom of sorts (yet) and that I still have a career and relationships (as superficial as they may be currently). I can only imagine how much better life could maybe be if I wasn't drunk every night. I think it's time to find out.

If I can make it 4 days, it will have been the longest I've been clean since I was 15. 

It's Day 1 and I'm forcing myself to go to bed early and write this post for accountability. I feel nauseous and have a headache, and have that slight low blood sugar feel, but I'm otherwise okay.

Thank you to all of you for being an inspiration. I really hope to join you all living a sober life. I really really do.

That's not really what this post is about though. I felt the need to express how hard this is, to anyone who might see it, so that I know I'm not suffering alone. The urge to cry and scream and numb it all with a bottle of whiskey is very strong. So overwhelmingly strong that it utterly terrifies me that this monster is what I'm trying to beat. It's like piling another hundred pounds on my back while also carrying the stress, anxiety, depression and loneliness I endure every day. The little devil on my shoulder who said he was helping me through my mental issues was lying to me, and he has been growing bigger each night I drank with him. Now he is so large he threatens to be the final weight that crushes me to death, whether I take another drink or not.

My serology and vitamin panels came back great, I saw those mid last week. This morning I went in to catch up on vaccines and my Dr pulled up my biochemistry test results which only came in today.

With the amount of red on the screen I did not need to hear him tell me something was wrong. He was gently concerned about if I drink much, if I have much abdominal pain. I said of course not, I only drink occasionally, and only with friends. Like that makes it better! Surely binge drinking is okay if its only once, twice, three times a week? 

But it isnt okay, and I think that I've been questioning if it is for a couple months now. The last two times I've hung out with friends (in our social bubble) I ended up blacking out. Its just embarassing. And I know I can get straight up mean. Im so concerned that I can ruin some very good friendships because I can't stay aware of what I'm saying. And I'm absolutely using alcohol to self medicate anxiety about making a fool of myself in front of my friends! How ironic is that.

But now this liver panel showing high scores of liver damage is also a wake up call. I dont want to slowly suicide myself into a painful death like this. This is a struggle of self destruction and self worthlessness that I need to address in a healthier way. I need to stop wasting my life and my money away because I'm too depressed to be present. My boyfriend and I spent 500 dollars on alcohol alone in the past 4 weeks. Plus add in expenses of food delivery because I'm too drunk to cook or drive, thats $1000+ in one month. Not to mention as well the affect THAT has had on my weight, 95kg as of this morning. 

I guess I wanted to post to admit to myself that I have a problem, that I CAN fix it, that other people have and can do it! And that I need to hold myself accountable. I know my family will not support me in becoming sober. I've seen my mother drink 1L of bourbon in on night and go out the next day for 2 more bottles. I dont want that to be my future.

I was engaged. A while ago.  I should be married. I should have a family.  I should have a house and a husband. Instead, I have a roommate and 2 dogs(nothing wrong with that, I know).

I tell myself I don’t have a problem because I haven’t been arrested or hospitalized so I must be fine. But I know the truth is that I have a problem and it’s not healthy. How do I fight the voice in my head that tells me to “just try moderation again” even when I know where that leads?

Thanks for the support guys. It’s an amazing community here and I’m so inspired by all of you and I’m praying that I can really stick with it this time.",21

...HOW?!

I'm 33, have been drinking too much for the last 10 years, devolving into weeklong binges over the past 5. My body aches when I withdraw. I'll throw up for a couple \_days\_ when withdrawing after even a 3 day binge. I've been trying to quit for about 2 years, more seriously since about last October (when I actually got diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and AUD, got medication -- including Naltrexone, started seeing a GP/psychologist and a therapist, keeping a record of my drinking, etc.)

But I'm ready to start fresh (as you can see from my flair). And ready to keep at it. And if I fall again, that's okay -- but I hope I don't, because this time I can read SD every day (so glad I discovered this place!), hear from all of you, commiserate, and get inspired.

The greatest thing I've learned from reading posts here is the concept of ""playing it forward"". What will happen if I take that one drink? HOW SHOULD I KNOW, I'VE NEVER TAKEN A DRINK BEFORE 🙄of course I know what will happen.

Now to keep my so-far healthy liver happy, and keep treating my body right, and enjoying the time I have to appreciate and explore this world.

It’s the day I finally commit to the idea that - for me - there is no difference between 2 drinks or 20. Because each time, without fail, the former leads to the latter. I have been drinking unhealthily since I was 17 years old. To my intense shame and horror, my history includes drunk driving, self harm, unsafe sex, non-consensual sex, stitches, bruises, bedwetting, sickness, memory problems (even sober) and the degradation of friendships, acquaintances, and even my relationship with my husband. And the fucked up thing is that none of these have yet convinced me to quit. I’ve never even told a soul about most of it.

Every time I look at the scars on my body, I’m reminded of the toll I have taken on my life. So why do I keep going back, time and again? I am NOT a casual drinker. And I go through weeks or even months of sobriety with false confidence that “this time I can definitely have just a few.” But that’s never the case. And that will never be me.

When things are safer, I look forward to perhaps even joining AA and sharing this journey with some fellow humans. But in the meantime, thank you r/stopdrinking for this forum.

It all started when my (23M) girlfriend (23F) moved back in with her parents for the duration of quarantine. She visits maybe once a month. Quarantine has also left me unemployed, with absolutely nothing to do. I've worked from home for the past year, but even still, my work has teetered to a halt.  


At the start of quarantine, I started drinking casually with my roommate. It seemed like a fun way to pass the time. We would get a bit bevved and play some videogames or card games together. For a while that's all it was. He's a bit of a mixologist so he would make us some fancy drinks, and we'd sip away while playing the game of the week.  


Lately it's gotten bad. It's gotten worse and worse as the situation has gone on. It went from a drink every other day to a drink every day, and then multiple. I'm at the point where, if left unsupervised, I'll be drinking four shots of 101 proof or six shots of 96 proof a day. All I want to do is wake up, get drunk, and fall back asleep again. Everything else has stopped interesting me. I've even bought and hid alcohol just to get drunk during the day. I don't know how to stop.  


Any advice would be appreciated. I'm young and new to drinking and haven't dealt with something like this before. I am genuinely at a loss of how to stop. And I do want to *stop.* I'm not interested in just control. I've gained 15 pounds solely from the alcohol and I'm worried about my health.

Maybe it’s because the bulk of it was in 2020. Quitting drinking was the best decisions I ever made. I am trying to remain vigilant and not get too cocky, but I hardly EVER think about drinking anymore. It really feels like that chapter of my life is officially over. I do see myself maintaining some not-so-great eating habits and binging on video games too often, so it’s not like all of the work is done, but at least getting the work done is possible now that the Lying Poison from Hell has been exorcized from my life.

Thank you SD! I don’t post here very often anymore, but I love to jump into the comments from time to time, especially for folks who are newly sober. And I still read here every day. The wisdom, insight, accountability, and community were central to getting me sober. 

Times are hard right now with US politics, covid, etc. I can only imagine  how much harder it is for people who are still stuck in their addictions. Addiction really is the root of so many problems and it is a truly tragic state for people to be in. My heart breaks for those that can’t find their way out just yet.

Earlier this year, I was able to abstain for 50 days. Things were good-- somehow I managed to convince myself that alcohol wasn't a problem for me anymore-- that I could control my drinking.

Boy, was I wrong. I've fallen back into my old habits. Right now, I'm having a moment of clarity following a low point: I went on a bender this weekend.

That was Saturday night and into the early hours of Sunday. Then Sunday Funday, because why not? I feel like shit.. Alcohol makes me stupid and forgetful. I feel like my short-term memory is shot. It's sucking away my joy and making it hard to enjoy life. My depression is worse. I can't lose weight. I'm terrified. I've been drinking almost everyday, and this weekend I finished almost a whole handle on my own. The fact that I'm not dead from alcohol poisoning is insane.

Today, I started re-reading This Naked Mind and realized how I had *totally* fallen back into the crazy cycle that is alcohol addiction. I'm tired of the dependence and the fear. I'm only 25. I know if I continue like this, I'm going to drink myself to death. 

I also suffer from chronic pain thanks to endometriosis. I feel like I've been using my pain as an excuse to drink-- and the catch is that alcohol worsens my condition by causing inflammation as well as increased estrogen production. I drink to kill the pain, and then wake up with a flare-up and a hangover. (More pain! Time to get my booze on!)

Sorry for the ramble, and thanks for reading. I guess I just had to share because I'm constantly surrounded by people who drink, and who will take my sobriety as an affront to them. My best friends drink, my parents and siblings drink, my grandmother is a borderline alcoholic... So, like, any sort of solidarity is hard to find. I could use a few sober companions-- hence, me joining this sub. Any advice or words of encouragement would be extremely helpful. (Or anecdotes of how quitting has made your life better would be nice, too!)",6

For you all out there struggling with alcohol, it gets better, it is a massive struggle but I am happy that I was referred here so I can surround myself around others who are fighting that good fight. I'm in a country right now, I'm originally from the US, that really enables alcoholism and I've been very alone with my sobriety, isolated with my partner mostly. 

I'm rooting for all of you, sobriety is worth it, even if you lose all of your social connections for it. Trauma and dysfunction, particularly depression, psych med side effects and peer pressure in Japan got me to drink till I got drunk in college. 

Being drunk then for the first time made me feel belonging in a culture that I admired, and belonging among my college peers. It took the pain away, that was the only thing then that took the pain away. 

This was very significant for me then as someone with asperger's/high functioning autism who was struggling to come to terms with some heavy truths about my life then. I paid a heavy price for chasing that belonging that booze gave in that single moment, steep and heavy prices in a very short amount of time. 

I am happy that I am no longer trapped in that cycle. Isolation and sobriety is far better for me than chasing that false sense of belonging as I drowned myself in those bottles.",33

I'm in my mid 20s and for the past six months I've been drinking more than I normally have in the past few years.

On the weekends I'd usually binge drink basically Friday until Sunday night. 

I've been feeling pretty crummy recently and realized I need to stop drinking if I want to get healthy. The issue is I was/am afraid of withdrawing badly. Saturday and Sunday I decided to only have two beers each day, and both nights I wake up covered in sweat and having extremely vivid nightmares. Today, I've been having random hot flashes with cold sweats.

I guess my question is would having only a beer or two still make me withdraw since I'm used to drinking quite a bit more?

Something very strange happened a couple of days ago. I had a very stressful and intense interaction with my wife and toddler. 

My past self would have been rage and running for escape. However this time was different. I cried. Not just a small tear like I have done with a film, but a full on sob. 

Felt so f***ing good and liberating. What made it even better was the ability to calmly sit and process my emotion afterwards. Something I haven’t done in as many years as I can remember. 

Fast forward to today and my interactions with my family feel on a whole new level. The beauty of love and laughter is shining through and each day feels better than the last. 

Sorry for the feels, but I never knew these changes would come. I see now the life I’ve left behind is one I never want to return to. Raw emotions are for the win.

Also let's not forget about the anxious feelings we'd get after a weekend rager wondering what dumb stuff we did or said, and how much money we wasted. Instead, we're just killing it on a Monday, whether it's at work, relaxing on vacation (probably a staycation given the pandemic), or simply lounging around. 

If you all are feeling restless and not sure what to do with the new free time you've acquired by being sober, load it up with things that you love to do. Stack events/projects/goals closely together so you can see how much you can accomplish within a short amount of time. Once you impress yourself with how much you did, it actually becomes addicting. We can use our addicting habits to make ourselves better. Have a great week everyone.",8

This is my first post on this subreddit, and I wanted to introduce myself/share. 

I decided to attempt to stop drinking Jan of 2019, I’ve had two relapses since then and at the moment I have 208 days without a drink. 

Two years ago, I did not think this was possible. So I have to say I am truly grateful of the decision I made. I know it’s still early, but I feel good about this and my ability to keep this up. 

A hiccup I’ve for sure had was that a few months ago, during a check-up with my specialist, he offered me a prescription for Xanax to help manage my anxiety, and I took it. Since then I’ve definitely abused it. I get my one prescription every month since about June. It’s a 30 day supply that I go through in about 10-14 days. (.5 strength). Once I run out of it, I leave it alone, I don’t attempt to get more, but I do feel guilty about this. 

I’ve also found myself trying to throw myself into women. I’ve definitely gotten myself on cloud 9 with relationships, and then in the pits when it didn’t workout, just to seek out another prospective relationship. I find myself chasing the high of validation, intimacy, and desire, and when I can get it, it feels amazing. But when I can’t get it, I find that I will feel more down than normal, or I will be constantly checking my phone to see where I can find it. 

I’m still not drinking, but I definitely find myself trying to replace the addiction and I’m trying to curb that as best as possible, but it’s almost like playing game of whack - a - mole.  But I definitely have not had a drop of Alcohol since mid-Feb, which is definitely my longest streak, and I don’t intend to break it.",3

The usual anxiety is rising up, planning for my ""Weekend"" starting drinks on Tuesday, starting at 4 when I'm off(5 o'clock somewhere, right?), and I'm just telling myself ""No"".  It just sucks to be beholden to something, it feels like I'm still subjugated to the substance even when I'm not having it.  It's like ""Well, if I'm thinking about it so much, why not just give in?  Enjoy yourself!""

But that's the poison talking.  That's the habit talking.  That's fear of change talking.  I went 5 months this year without a drink, and mostly successfully without the rest of the year(like a day or two of drinking every other week or so), which is really good for me.  But I'm looking to abstain fully.. Just kinda sucks.  Mental sneaky bargains like ""Oh, I'll be able to drink in a week, and THEN cold turkey..!"" But it's all a ruse.  A sneaky, addiction ruse.

I saw the other day that I had passed the 900 days mark which is not something I ever thought would be possible. A few years ago I hit an all time low and came pretty close to ending things. Thankfully I didn’t. I realised that my drinking was helping to send me into that abyss so reached out to a local clinic who helped me stop.

I would love to say it changed my life but I am in an unusual situation, I suffer from quite severe depression. I’m unable to take any medication and found that meditation, counselling etc just doesn’t really work for me. Everyday is a bit of a struggle. I have a solid amount of self loathing along with a bit of a feeling that day to day stuff just isn’t for me. 

Although this sounds bleak there’s a reason I’m mentioning it. I’ve seen a few people on here in the past who give up drinking and then wonder why things don’t improve. I’m one of those people. My life didn’t suddenly take an upturn, I’m still overweight, still unhealthy and still hate myself. There are other deeper things going on that stopping drinking hasn’t fixed for me. However I’m am acutely aware that if I had not stopped drinking I wouldn’t be here for my wife and family anymore. Stopping has given me more time to sort myself out (even if that’s a slow process).

It’s absolutely 100% worth it, keep it up everyone and thanks for all the support👍

I started eating better and went for a run. I made it 1.5 miles , almost threw up and walked home. That was at the start of June! I’m now down 20lbs and just ran my first 10k.

Been drinking pretty hard, almost every day for the past 10 years.  At least 8 units per day, on the weekends often more.

I noticed that when I use the restroom while I'm drinking/on a bender, my poop is usually somewhat normal.  When I slow way down or don't drink at all, I have to go 4-5 times a day and it's yellow, painful diarrhea.  This is made worse if I eat a lot of roughage like romaine lettuce, tomatoes, etc.  I can always see the roughage in the bile, too.  And it stains the toilet yellow.

Is this going to stop any time soon, or is there anything I can do to mitigate it?  I cannot currently see my doctor, so hopefully this is somewhat common..?

We're not really drinking buddies per se, because we do a bunch of things other than drink, but we have tended to drink sometimes and go at it.

Just the usual talking too much, poor coordination, repeating myself, blegh. I really hate that version of myself. That night pretty much sucked. Fortunately I didn't do anything too stupid or anything to upset anyone. The next morning I woke up super hungover and had to sleep in pretty late to recover. Well that was really lame - I could have gotten up and went for an early morning hike or just hung around the fire but nope - stuck in my tent praying for my headache to disappear.   
I decided that morning I didn't want to go back to drinking. I reset my badge and did not drink that day. What a better night it was! My buddies had a beer(maybe two) but no one was drinking heavily. We had a bunch of great conversations, cooked, and hung out around the fire. I can remember it all. It's amazing how much more fun that night was than the night before! Actually experiencing something and connecting with your friends is so much better than having a blurred experience for a few hours that you don't really remember. The difference was so drastic - drinking really sucks and it doesn't make your experiences better. I'm very motivated to not start drinking again with this recent example of how drinking actually plays out in my life.

Day 7, gotta say no drinking feels pretty good. Aside from not feeling shitty, tired, etc..I think what’s even better is not having that cloud of guilt constantly over my head and trying to put all the pieces back together the morning after.

-I’m grateful for waking up on time and energize. 
-I’m grateful for getting my kids up on time too, making them a healthy breakfast and setting them up for virtual school without any technical difficulties(well that last part I thank Comcast for, thank you Comcast).
-I’m grateful for this support group which has me thinking that it’s time to take my butt back to AA meetings.

I had blood tests done, they all came back normal except for b12 and vitamin c which I’m supplementing. I’m relatively healthy, in my 30s, I do yoga and walk and some other light training since my energy is so low. 

My psych said it could be the Zoloft I’m on but the dose is very low that she said she would be surprised. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Is this normal? I was a heavy binge drinker on the weekends(3-6 bottles of wine) I’ll probably go back to the doctor but wanted to see if anyone else can relate or has experience being otherwise healthy but super exhausted in early sobriety.

Of course a big number of sober days is amazing. I used to beat myself up every reset without really noticing the big progress I’m making, and how it gets a little easier each time. I used to have half a bottle of wine every day for 10 years, and couldn’t imagine ever changing. It was a lot on my small frame and I was seeing symptoms of alcohol abuse. Last month half the days were sober days, but I was beating myself up about the bad half. Last week I had a drink at dinner with my family, and I felt bad about it, but it was the only drink I had all week. It made me feel gross and hardened my resolve.  Just because you’re at 0 again, does not mean all progress is lost! I’m proud of the progress I’ve made so far, and am excited to progress further.

By the end of today I will be 3 years sober. I kind of forgot that I was approaching this milestone. 

I like to say a massive thank you to everyone in this community, you're all amazing. I dont really comment, but I lurk, and I see all tbe progress you make. Its pretty inspiring. 

Id also like to put out there why we stop drinking. My sobriety came up with my mum and brother, and one of his mates. My mum and brother, and most other members of my family, don't get it. 

My brothers mate ""R"" was very supportive and amazed that I've been dry for so long. She knew before I quit I used to work in a brewery, and homebrew my own. I was the beer guy, I had the beard for it and everything. Still do. 

Alot of people, and myself, expected me to lose weight. After seeing everyones amazing before and after pics I looking forward to being less round. But food is a vice for me. No drinking, smoking, or drugs, I gotta have something right? 

I remember when I first quit id allow myself some extra snacks or more takeaway etc. Because hey, im not having beer calories on top of this. So i was justifying eating shittier. 

I feel like there's a lot of pressure from society to have to justify why you don't drink. People expect some epiphany or in my case, something dark to have happened. Which upset me, because some people I used to call mates thought I had it in me to do something fucked up, and make me never drink again. 

But the truth is you dont need to justify it. No matter what you say some people won't get it. All you gotta do is take it a day at a time. 

Anyway welcome to my Ted talk, im rambling. Think ill treat myself to something to celebrate later tonight. 

Thank you stop drinking,  IWNDWYT",23

I felt fine...not drunk...so of course I hid the bottle.  Then I recognized that was a problem so I nonchalantly brought it out and camouflaged it with other bottles.

I responded, ""well neuroplasticity is real, and the body is a living thing that can heal itself."" This friend \[a heavy drinker\] was like ""no way man, shit fucks you up permanently.""

However bad I messed up my wife would stick to me. A couple of months back I confessed that I would drink behind her back and how difficult it was for me to control the amount I drank. She was incredibly supportive and really got my back. I now cut out drinking completely for a while so I get back in the driver's seat.  With her sticking to me it was so much easier...

Now I feel incredibly lucky to be married to such an amazing woman. I mean she is not only the love of my life (we started dating at school and been together for over 11 years now) but also a great mother and loving spouse.

Being open about my situation and me trying to change things for the better has also really had a great impact on our relationship and she appreciates the effort I put into this so much. So I am just really grateful to have her. I don't know where I would now be without her help.

I dyed my hair pink and blue, got a heap of piercings and tattoos, as well as new clothes (I looked super fucking hot actually, in retrospect) and went clubbing every single night. I kissed men I didn't like, had some really regrettable blackout sex that I still feel guilty and gross about, drank more, and eventually I met said ex in a nightclub and told him I was engaged to a new guy and thriving. Told him our whole relationship was a joke and he wasn't shit to me and never was. (Shock horror - I was not engaged, I cared very much about him still and was a sad hurt little 18 year old with a bruised ego) and basically partied it out for a few months until I felt 'better' enough to focus on other shit.

And I'm noticing similar patterns now, in my breakup with alcohol. Trying to lose my beer weight, getting a heap of tattoos and gettin' my hair did, trying to separate myself from shit alcoholic me, I guess? Only this time I'm not having grim sex with strangers, or kissing sweaty men twice my age in nightclubs, and trying to convince myself I'm okay.


 I'm definitely not okay. But I'm okay with that.

Turns out the decade of drinking was just the problem on top of the crippling anxiety and depression that lurked untreated for years. I thought maybe alcohol was the cause of all my problems, and while it definitely tripled the load, I'm now left with cold hard mental illness that I have no idea how to cope with. I'm a little bit exhausted. 

The hypochondria has come back in full force, this month alone I've been convinced I had covid, breast cancer, cervical cancer, hiv, you name it I've worried about it. I can't leave a room without being convinced my coworkers are talking about how much they hate me. I'm convinced I'm getting fired even though all of my colleagues have assured me there's no way. I worry about the future constantly. I worry blackout demons from six years ago are gonna come back and send me to jail. I'm just always worried.

But I'm not waking up under parked cars, or covered in sand and salt water even though I don't live near a beach, with vague ideas I was coming on to men I'd met in bars while drinking alone the night before. I don't have to worry about any of that kind of stuff, and it really is a gift. I haven't tested my best friends limits of love for me in about four months, or fallen asleep on the kitchen floor while eating my housemates block of cheese out of the wrapping . All those little things that make you fucking hate yourself more every day, I don't have to add to that list.

But I've felt fuckin' terrible, none the less.
So today, to try and tone down the gut wrenching anxiety and guilt, I started watching interviews and YouTube videos about recovering alcoholics, and stumbled across Steve-O's YouTube channel. I'd kind of forgotten he existed as I haven't watched jackass in like ten years... But Holy fuck was I surprised to see he'd cleaned up. 

He's got some really interesting videos about his problems with drugs and booze, and some really fucking raw footage of him hallucinating people, or just being a total fucking piece of shit.  And seeing him now, he looks peaceful, and he's really come to terms with who he was, and is excited about his sobriety. And it made me really hopeful? I mean, if Steve-o can do it? Surely I can try a little longer?

I'm gonna save up for a doctor's appointment and hopefully get some meds to calm my nutcase brain down. Being sober is great, but I need to get this anxiety under control of I'm gonna stay that way, cuz if there's been any temptation the past four months, it's been when I get so anxious I just need it all to go away. And one day I'll slip, I fear. 

This was such a fuckin ramble I apologize, I just needed to clear the kitty litter hahaha.

Stay strong friends. Iwndwyt.",25

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we check in about any AoK that we have participated in, received, witnessed, or heard about during the week which have touched us in some way. It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game.

One of the things that I enjoy about sobriety is hearing people tell their stories of addiction and recovery. It's endlessly interesting to me. I couldn't even tell you the number of times that I've heard someone start off by saying that their story isn't all that interesting, and then they spend twenty minutes talking about all sorts of stuff, and you know it’s only the tip of the iceberg.

This week's AoK is kinda like that. Jocelynn James, a woman in Alabama who was arrested 16 times for drug and theft charges, is coming up on eight years of sobriety. A month ago she [donated one of her kidneys](https://www.fox5ny.com/news/she-saved-my-life-police-officer-receives-life-saving-transplant-from-woman-he-put-in-jail-8-years-ago) to Terrell Potter, a former police officer who arrested her multiple times. She's grateful today for his positive intervention in her life, and when she heard that he was in need of a kidney donation, she demonstrated her gratitude by giving him one of hers.

It was an incredible AoK for James to donate her kidney to someone she could have harbored ill feelings towards. It sounds like Potter's interactions with her were compassionate. She said that he helped her get sober and turn her life around. I know that in my own life, there were people who were in the right place at the right time who were instrumental in helping me along the path to sobriety. I can see having that kind of gratitude although, I gotta admit, the list of people I'd give a kidney to is pretty small.

It's still one of those stories that makes me proud to be an alcoholic in recovery. My addiction took me some dark places, but as a fortune cookie once told me, ""He who has not tasted the bitter cannot understand the sweet."" Recovery is possible. My past doesn't have to define my future. I can be a kind person today.

Anyway, that's me for this week. How's everyone else doing, any AoK's (or internal organs) you'd like to share?",44

I recently celebrated four years sober. It's been a weird, long road and I'm happier with my life than I ever could imagine I would be if I were drinking.

Today, I had a really awful exchange with my best friend, now former best friend. He and his wife and child have been in hyper strict quarantine due to the virus, so communication between us has been stilted and inconsistent. 

We have been on rocky ground for a while, he has no other friends and put a ton of pressure on me to be there for him constantly to the point where I finally had to tell him tonight we needed to not talk for a while. I mentioned that I was upset he forgot my sobriety date but that I also wanted him to know I appreciated his involvement in the early part of my recovery. Birthdays tend to bring out that gratitude and the fact that he didn't remember stung. However, it's also part of my recovery not to dwell on stuff like that, so at the time I let it slide.

But he clapped back at me saying that I haven't cared about anything going on in his life for months so why should he care about what's going on in mine. Regardless of the fact that I vehemently disagree with that, I texted or called him on all his important days since quarantine, it just..... really hurt. He has every right to say that, and I really want to let it roll off my back, but I'm having considerable trouble letting that go. 

If it was my bellybutton, I wouldn't care. If it was my anniversary, I really wouldn't be bothered if he said that (and my wife and I were married in his backyard). But he KNOWS how important my sobriety is to me, and that was such a low blow.... I just feel like I want to cut him out and be done with him.

I really appreciate you reading this far, I know it's a lot of ""why me"" and ingratitude for the friends I DO have. Its genuinely been a really tough couple weeks and I guess I haven't been good about acknowledging what I do have in my life.

Again, thanks for reading and, despite everything, IWNDWYT, friend.",13

I found only painfully dismissive attitudes from those I felt closest too, those I thought would be understanding though our friendship I found only invalidating behaviour. Next I sought out remedy’s through my doctors, sadly having developed a strong introverted shell that I used to hold things together coupled with a serious substance abuse problem that made accurate diagnosis next to impossible. 
 
I became emotionally distanced from everything,
Refusing to deal with the smallest emotions, turning to the only remedy that gave me the smallest moments of relief from what would soon engulf me, my mental health was degrading faster than I could keep up with so I found stronger things to numb the empty ache that was eating away at the very shell I so proudly erected..

Then one day it collapsed, with the only measure of support I had left I fell too.

I became an animal true in both thought and form,  never thinking about the future or those around me. My pain had engulfed me to a point that I no longer knew the difference between anger or love it was the same, peace was chaos and joy was pain that I could not confront...

So I ran,

When I could not run anymore I fell further to a point that I thought would be the end.

Some how in that dark pit I found the strength to stand again, the strength to survive again.
I had almost given up on all things, the reason of that moment, where it came from or how it came to me still isn’t within my grasp.
What ever it is, I keep on living knowing that the pain I live with is something that I may never defeat, so I live with it.

I’m almost six months sober and living some of the better days of my life, I’m not where I want to be, but I’m happy I am not where I use to be.

I’m a 24 year old female in college who has messed it up multiple times because of drinking. I want to move on but I’m having a hard time. I had blood tests done the other day because I had a urine test for my birth control and it stated that I had a tiny bit of blood in my urine. I was concerned and had tests done. So the end result was that I had elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin. I am concerned that I will cause myself health problems. I’ve been evaluated by psychologists and a specialist. 
I got a DUI recently after never having an encounter with law enforcement and was arrested for almost a day. I could have killed someone, and I think about that a lot. I have to spend 4 days in in-home incarceration for an aggravated DUI due to a .22 BAC. I totaled my car and a parked bmw... I’m paying a lot for a lawyer. So anyway, I am looking to have someone scare some sense into me. I basically ruined my relationship of 5 1/2 years and moved back in with my mom, whom is frustrated with me and my behavior. She tries to help as she works at a hospital and sees this stuff from young people but it’s not doing much for me. I try and hide it from her but it usually doesn’t work. I have no car, so I take lyfts to work and school almost daily and it adds up.

I immedietly knew this was an opportunity I didn't want to pass up. I've thought about quitting drinking for years and have always been too scared to even try. But I decided to do it. I had mild withdrawal symptoms - night sweats and a persistent, mild headache. Those are gone now and I feel incredible with 13 days AF.

I went to a meeting for the first time today, via Zoom. Everyone was extremely kind of welcoming. But I'm a grey area drinker and their stories were darker than mine. I kind of want to write out why I think I need to quit and hear if other people agree that it sounds like a problem. I know, if it feels like a problem, it probably is. I don't know if I'm an alcoholic and I'm not particularly afraid of that label, I just don't know if it fits.

I can moderate my drinking if I make a concerted effort. I've been dieting this summer and have successfully started to go 1-3 days without drinking during the week. Even one beer makes it hard to get up in the morning, makes me tired, and often make me feel depressed, grumpy and hopeless. On the weekends I might have three pintsor a few glasses of wine, if I'm just staying in with my husband.

When I go out with friends, or if I'm outside of my kind of safe moderate-drinking routine, it's a coin toss as to whether I will get more drunk than I meant to and wake up with a wretched hangover. The day before my birthday this spring some friends gave me a half-gallon of strong margaritas. I started drinking them at 4pm and I remember sitting down on the couch at like 8 and thinking I am DRUNK. It was unpleasant and unplanned. People could tell I was drunk while I texted them. The next day - my 33rd birthday - I almost puked while on a Zoom call with my new internship supervisor during a training. I must have looked like hell. I couldn't enjoy my birthday dinner because I was still so hungover. 

The past decade is littered with unintentional binges like that. The past few years, it only happens a few times a year. I'm susceptible to it when I travel, so that every time I've gone back to see my friends in a city I moved away from I've gotten too drunk, acted obnoxious, made a fool of myself, and spent precious vacation time hungover. I got too drunk at my parents' Thanksgiving party two years in a row and blacked out in front of my high school friends, who weren't drinking. I made out with two different guys at my friend’s wedding (one of my most embarrassing memories).

I regularly binge drank in college, so it seems like I started out hard and have gotten ""better"" as I've grown up. I've blacked out only a few times. I got pulled over while driving drunk twice but never gotten an DUI, miraculously. 

Through all this, I've always had a daily beer habit. For at least a decade, I drank beer every single day. This past week and a half is the longest I've gone without. (Thus the withdrawal symptoms, I guess). If that hangover I had on my birthday could be my last hangover ever - that would be incredible. 

I KNOW if I continue to drink ""moderately"" I will experience a hangover like that again. I also can imagine some scenarios - like if I ever divorced and was left alone - where I would potentially go way off the deep end. I could lose my grip, my carefully cultivated control, and start to drink more and more, until I'm firmly on the other side of this ""gray area."" 

I quit smoking cigarettes when I was 26 and it was one of the hardest things I've ever done, and I know that if I smoke a single cigarette, I will be right back to a pack a day and have to fight that fight all over again. I never though I'd be thinking of a beer in the same category, but I think it fits. If I break my current sober streak, that could be the drink that leads me down a dark path.

For now, I'm going to take it one day at a time and continue to enjoy this peaceful feeling of newfound sobriety. Thanks for giving me space to type all this out. (some edits for readability)",18

No eating, smashing as many beers and cigarettes as possible, the inevitable vomiting at some point, keep going, then pass out.

He made the choice this time, so we are hoping he will take it seriously and this will be the time that he finally beats this for good.    


My ex is going to keep me posted. I've been through a lot, dealing with this for over a year and it's his turn to take the reins and be my son's advocate/contact, etc. I have to stay out of it for my own mental health, and I also can't let myself fall for it again. I cant have anything to do with my son until I see longterm sobriety and a willingness to apologise for how much damage he has done to everyone who loves him. But I know he is alive, he is safe, and he is getting help, and as a mother that is literally the best thing I can hope for right now.    


Thank you to all of  the amazing people here who have offered so much genuine support and comfort. It never fails to touch my heart, how it's the people who are struggling the most who offer the most genuine concern and support to others who are suffering. I love you all! Wherever you are in your fight, whatever you are fighting, I am praying for you all! I have never been prouder in my life to say  I WILL NOT DRINK WITH YOU TODAY!",13

So I feel obliged to make a post while I’m feeling okay. It’s been a nice lazy Sunday. I ran some errands, took a nap, did a few chores, I’m now writing this on a park bench in the middle of a brisk stroll. The rest of Jojo Rabbit is waiting for me at home. Fun little movie.

I don’t feel spectacular by any means. There is a quiet undercurrent of worry and doubt lurking in the back of my head. The hollow man syndrome is alive and well. I worry that I’m a blank slate, too depressed to try and do fun things, or create hobbies of substance. But today my presence in the moment is stronger than the worry. I’m hoping this is a trend.

Last night I had the strongest craving I’ve had since I started this streak. I wanted the buzz so badly, just to feel something different. I played it forward, I read a few posts on here, I thought about all the times in the past that I would drink myself sick trying to be rid of this same feeling, but I was so deep in the habit that it gave me no relief. I didn’t want to go back there. I don’t.

I decided to binge sugar instead. On the way I stopped at my part time job to visit my buddy there. It’s been a while so we walked around the property and had your standard fare catch up chats. I was engaged in the conversation and experience, and it was lovely. I felt the familiar longing nostalgia this place gives me, but like now, the present moment overshadowed the negative feelings.

I wasnt tempted at all the rest of the night. The whole thing created a sort of dissonance within me. If i could be feeling these wretched cravings and longing for escape, and at the same have a nice time with a friend and be animated and cheerful, maybe these negative feelings can not consume me. Maybe as powerless as I feel over my mental health, it only has the power that I give it. Maybe I am not defined by the suffering I experience. 

Even now as I sit on this bench, I feel the desire for drugs and alcohol, but it doesn’t torment me. I feel the guilt of not engaging in any hobbies and recreational interests, just puttering the day away, but not intensely. I feel the worry that I will never be a person of substance, that I may never have someone, but it doesnt matter. I am who I am.

My existence does not need justification. My life does not need constant intense euphoria to be enjoyable. I don’t need deep knowledge or impressive talents to have value. Damn, this post got away from me. Ramblin ass. IWNDWYT ✨ 🔥",70

But for last 4 to 5 months I drink every Thursday with my wife and on Saturday’s when playing golf.  It’s gotten to the point I’m almost drinking a 12 pack.  It makes me feel terrible almost always, depressed and anxious and just sick.  I say things I regret, have been known to drive ( I get really down on myself for this as I should), late to work and get out of touch with my family.  I just think it’s time to walk away from it.

With that said I know the shame and guilt I have now will subside somewhat by Thursday and I will be telling myself it’s okay to drink, that this time I can keep it under control, or I that I don’t want to lose how much fun me and my wife have when drinking together, then the golf, been awhile since i played without drinking I’m scared I want enjoy it and talk myself into drinking.  I’m nervous I will miss my favorite bar or place I like.  I’m just nervous and scared that I won’t be able to do it or will give back in, I know it is what’s best for me.

One additional shitty side effect for me is, it would drive me to drink much more than I used to. Which would be a feedback loop for both drugs. I stopped the SSRIs (working with a Dr) and that curbed my desire to drink.

Maybe I can have a normal relationship with alcohol at some point, sans SSRIs. (I wouldn't bet on it.) If I do have a normal relationship, it won't be anytime soon, and normal to what? 

I feel like it took a couple months at least for my brain to get back to normal. Don't want to go back to that.

I went out for dinner with the Mrs and stupidly ordered a corona out of habit. I was trying to convince myself that on the way home from dinner I'll just grab 1 x 6pack of beer on the way home and that will do me for the weekend. 

I was internally battling with myself whether I was making the right decision to swing by the bottle shop on the way home the whole time I was out trying to enjoy a nice night out with my partner. It was pretty exhausting. My partner encouraged me not to have any more and that helped me not get the extra 6 beers on the way home. 

When I got home I reminded myself that in the past 14 days I have only had one beer which is a huge improvement instead of consuming countless beers over a weekend and not being able to leave the bed for most of it.

So even though I slipped up, I'm still happy that I'm trying my hardest to reduce and completely stop.

I was staying at a trusted friend's house for a few days in an effort to stay sober. Today I went back to my apartment to start living real life again. My roommate agreed to have an alcohol free home after he finished the booze he already had and said that he probably wouldn't have any left by now.

Event 1: My roommate isn't home, but I notice he still has three beers and a bottle of vermouth left over. I was a little rattled, but handled it. I remembered that my one job for today was to not drink, so I closed the fridge and forgot about it.

Event 2: I found a fifth of vodka in my room tucked under a bunch of things. It was 80% full. I had no idea I had any left. I picked it up, walked to the toilet, plugged my nose and watched triumphantly (and somewhat longingly) as I poured what would have been a massive drunk away. I even had the sick thought of lapping it up from the toilet water in the split second before I flushed (alcoholism... what a disease).

Event 3: I got a call from my firm's secretary saying that someone had left a gift for me at the office. I was so excited that I walked from my apartment (I live about two blocks away) and went to do some work and get the gift. I could use a pick me up! Turns out it was from my friend who just moved cities. She works at a brewery. In the box I found TONS of locally brewed craft beer. Come on. Like there was enough in there for 2 days of drunk. I immediately went to the bin across the street and threw the package in.

I like to think I'm a pretty tough dude, but I'm on the brink of tears right now. Three trials in two hours. But I did not drink. Hold onto your higher power friends... because there's a lower power that's gonna hit you in ways you didn't even begin to imagine. IWNDWYT

See title, but here is how I put it to a friend who has been supporting me. 

“Getting sober from addiction sucks so much fucking ass. I have such a ridiculous urge to drink right now.

But so far I’m fighting that urge successfully. 

I will not be a statistic. A good buddy of many years that I game online with (and have met in person once) served as an Artillery Officer in Afghanistan several years ago. One of his childhood friends, who he grew up with, *and* served in active combat areas with, is currently on his sixth or seventh hospitalization. They are both in their early 30s. My buddy looked his friend in the eyes face to face last Monday(ish) and his friend couldn’t even remember him. My buddy told me he “already has his eulogy prepared”. Rest in Peace Ross. I don’t look down on you, but I won’t be like you either. I will not be another statistic.

Thanks for reading. I’m hopeful and excited to reach day 7! (Just applied for my badge a few minutes before posting this).

Anyone else go through this? When did they end?,"Hi all!  Admittedly this has been a tough week stress-wise.  However, I’m having daily thoughts that I could just go buy a bottle.

These thoughts are different from cravings.  There is no physical or emotional association to them.  It’s just a passing thought a few times a day that tonight I could pop a bottle of vodka.

Anyone else deal with this?  I know I’m not far into sobriety, but I really didn’t have these thoughts in the past month and a half.  I had physical or emotional cravings, sure. They stopped after a couple of weeks for the most part.  But this detached feeling that I should drink tonight is a totally new one for me.

Ideas?  Do these go away?  Is this normal after the initial physical cravings pass?",6

2020-09-13 15:00:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/is4cgk/day_1_again_but_feeling_good_about_it/,"Day 1 again, but feeling good about it","(Sorry for the essay, this is primarily for me but I felt that sharing it with y'all would solidify it somehow).

I decided to stop drinking at the beginning of July, primarily because my mental health wasn't great and I knew alcohol wasn't helping. I wasn't a crazy drinker - I was drinking a craft beer or 2 (or 3) most days of the week, more on weekends, but I wasn't getting blacked-out, was able to keep up with my responsibilities, had no real negative effects on my relationships, etc. That being said, I didn't like waking up feeling groggy and bloated on my weekends, and I didn't like the way that so many of my thoughts were centered around deciding when/where to buy beers from, doing mental calculations of when I'd have to buy beer again if I drank x beers a night, constantly going back and forth on whether I should drink on a particular night, etc. I also have a family history of alcoholism so it's something I've always kind of been concerned about.

I made it to 51 days, I believe (need to update my day tracker on here). It was nice, I was sleeping better, and my brain felt more peaceful generally, but I think I was subconsciously disappointed that all my problems didn't ""magically"" improve after I stopped drinking.

My boyfriend and I went to visit friends we hadn't seen in a very long time and I decided I wanted to drink with them. I don't ""regret"" drinking with them, overall it was a fun time, and nothing ""bad"" happened (no black-outs, no throwing up, no debilitating hangovers) but I briefly felt extremely anxious the next day (hangxiety is real), and I am a little bummed out that I can't clearly remember everything we talked about when drunk. 

After we got back about a week ago I stopped drinking again, and then last night I felt compelled (for whatever reason) to drink again. I had a few cocktails - it was fine, but I felt a little irritable while under the influence, and I realized that alcohol just isn't going to do what I want it to - which is to make me feel the great feelings/have the great times that I nostalgically associate with alcohol. It just made me feel kind of weird and shitty, and whatever momentary jubilation I experience when I drink it isn't worth the bleh feeling I have when that dissipates. I think it's hard because everyone around me drinks (no judgment to them) and it ""seems"" fine for them (I also feel like a bit of a killjoy for not drinking, even though they're all supportive of my choice to not drink). But I know that I just don't really like it anymore.

So here we are at day 1 again. I feel like having had these experiences over the last few weeks has helped me to reaffirm that I really don't need/want alcohol in my life. I found a great NA beer (shoutout to Athletic Brewing) to satiate my craft beer cravings (I do legitimately really enjoy the taste of craft beer and am really interested in the brewing process as a whole, alcohol aside). The next time my boyfriend and I take a trip or attend an event (covid permitting) I'm going to make a point of not drinking. I suspect that a lot of the nostalgia I associate with alcohol is actually associated with spending time/connecting with friends, not the alcohol itself.

Sorry for the long-ass rambling story, just wanted to articulate this all in one place. IWNDWYT!",3

I've tried the route of ""quitting,"" feeling like I was giving up a fun part of my life, like I just ""couldn't"" drink. It went fine for a while, but I relapsed and felt like I could control it for a while because everyone else was drinking and I needed to drink to have fun with others.

This time I decided I just don't want to drink. I'm sick of feeling like it's limiting me physically from doing what I used to do. I gained 80lbs in 3 years. I stopped loving life. I'm ready to break that cycle and live my life, fully present. It feels different this time because I guess I just have no desire to be drunk and putting my life and my feelings on pause. 

For all the feminist ladies on this sub, Quit Like a Woman by Holly Whitaker really helped put this in perspective for me. I didn't want to go the AA route, but I didn't need to.

Anyways I just thought I'd share, as I've been waffling for a while on this sub and trying to figure out how to make it work. Maybe this will give someone some perspective or hope.

2020-09-13 14:35:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/is3u15/the_last_straw/,The last straw,"About a year ago, I got super drunk on an insignificant Friday night and fell on my face while drinking from a stainless steel straw. I chipped a tooth on that straw, it pierced my lip, and I scraped myself up pretty bad on the sidewalk. I was also aware it could have been worse. Rather than swear off booze right away, I swore off those straws, which my husband and I went on to jokingly refer to as ""murder straws"".

I felt (it still gets me sometimes) so much shame over that incident. By that time I was used to my husband having to clean me up and put me to bed, but this one really hit me in the vanity. There's no hiding a swollen lip with a 1/2"" puncture wound at work on Monday, and I had to go to my dentist of 10+ years (having very carefully crafted my story: just enough of the truth, with some little lies woven in). The ""murder straw"" inside joke was such a silly little defense mechanism, trying to protect myself from the truth of the harm I was doing to myself and the people I love.

The other day, I grabbed my husband's glass to casually steal a sip of seltzer and he sort of automatically joked to watch out for the murder straw... I responded without even thinking ""It turns out they're not so dangerous when I'm not fall-down-drunk!""

I think that was the first time I acknowledged out loud what I knew all along about that incident. Not covering it up with a lie (like I was walking my dog and she lunged for a cat, or I tripped on uneven pavement) or a joke (like the stabby tendencies of normal kitchen implements, or just how clumsy I am), and not pretending it didn't happen.

And, god, just hearing it out loud in my own voice... I laughed and laughed. I laughed way too hard. I'm smiling and chuckling now writing this and thinking back on it. Not even that it's a funny joke, but the laughter came from such a relief to have finally named it. It's joy bubbling over from the delicious sense of being free.

IWNDWYT, and I will drink seltzer and iced coffee from a reusable straw like I'm invincible!!! (I mean, within reason of course 😜)",60

2020-09-13 13:47:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/is2uki/rebirthing_pains/,Rebirthing Pains,"From the Netflix food-porn series *Chef’s Table* I learned a few years ago of a Japanese cuisine called *kaiseki*: an ordered multi-course meal with certain fixed elements and certain opportunities for variation. As one chef from the series puts it: “Everything has to be connected to one another and there has to be a flow.” “It’s really very melodic,” says another. It is the best metaphor I’ve tripped over for thinking about what it’s like to hit rock bottom. It’s not a single event, but a whole sequence of themed servings of disaster, which follow predictable enough patterns, but to which we all bring our own raw ingredients.

A lot of us, I’m sure, didn’t develop drug problems because we were happy, hopeful, well-supported, trauma-free individuals. I remember learning from school prevention programs and from pop-psych hearsay about all the personality traits and life events that can predispose you to drug abuse, and though I checked a lot of those boxes, I never really thought they applied to me. Even as my alcohol use and my experimentation with other drugs ticked up, I still thought of them as more or less unrelated to everything I had been told all my life made me vulnerable to substance abuse.

Four months into sobriety, I’m dealing with what feels like too much: all those things that might have steered me toward drugs are unresolved; I added to them a whole bunch of new problems with my substance abuse; I seem to have really aggressive PAWS, which I think is interacting in nasty ways with a post-viral syndrome I’ve had for a few years; I’m going into the sixth year of a PhD program I’m less and less confident that I’ll finish; and the whole world is going to shit—my state’s on fire, the pandemic is raging, and historically speaking it looks like we’re in 1938.

This whole complex of problems is giving me a temptation I’m sure I’m not the first addict to entertain: I just want to be born again, to rebuild from nothing, to declare Day One. I may actually be in a fair position to do so.

My family has always been crazy and I was already losing friends before I moved 2,500 miles away for graduate school. I talk less and less with what friends I had back home, I stopped hearing from my mother a few months ago and my father about two years ago, and I haven’t made many solid friendships where I am now.

My career path doesn’t look so great at the moment either. Life has thrown pile after pile of shit at me since I started this program. I busted my ass—or at least had frequent enough fits of intense motivation—from the time I was eighteen until I was twenty-five to get here, but I’m finding it hard to find confidence in or excitement for my dissertation. This new recession looks like it’ll further hollow out the job market that never fully recovered from the Great Recession. And because of what the virus did to me and what I may have done to myself with my substance abuse, I’m not sure I’ll ever again have the mental energy to do my work.

It sounds ridiculous, even childish, but part of me really just wants to save money for the next few months, rush through the dissertation without any intention of staying in academia, move to a new state, delete all my social media, change my name and number, and find a new community where I can uproot everything I think might have made me like this in the first place.

I said above that I never thought any of the warning signs of substance abuse applied to me. Ugly family history? Their problem, not mine. Childhood sexual abuse? I’m over it. Difficulty fitting in? I don’t need anyone anyway. One of my problems, perhaps my major problem, is, I think, that *I’ve never thought any rules applied to me*. And for about the first quarter century of my life, they really seemed not to. I could shoplift without getting caught. I didn’t have to push myself in anything because I was smart. I kept strange hours because in the dead of night I did my best work. I didn’t need a religion or a philosophy or even advice because I had all the answers. I could be an asshole because even if I didn’t fit in I could still draw people to me. I didn’t have to work through any problems because I thought I could shrug them all off.

I think that version of myself is finally dead now. I—if there’s even a thing left here to call “I”—want to try life again the other way: sleep at night and wake in the morning, take care of my body, act like an adult, do what I’m told, lay a foundation, find a god or a purpose, work through my problems, cage my pride and throw away the key—you get the idea.

But for the present I’m in hell, or purgatory, hell-lite. My brain itself feels like it hurts. I’ve never had such uncontrollable, horrific thoughts. I have to swat away suicidal ideation like it’s a bat that got in my house. I can be patient (from Latin, *patior*, “to suffer”) as long as I feel like the after-dinner mint of this shit meal is a second chance at life, a rebirth, but most days I am scared I had one chance at life that some combination of pain and sloth and stubbornness made me fuck up beyond repair.",14

I could write a novel about my weekend but I’ll keep it short. Rented a house with 13 friends that turned into a party house and I stayed sober. And I had an amazing time. Luckily no one was really sloppy drunk and everyone respected my choice to not drink. I had genuine, slap happy moments with my sister that we haven’t had since we were kids. 

I had some serious self pity moments to myself. I went and hung out with my cat in my room alone at some points (yes I bring my cat on trips with me) but at no point did I consider drinking. So no this isn’t easy, but it’s worth it and I know it’ll get easier with time.

 I have tried before, 6 months on my own and then a couple years later I went like 3 or 4 months while attending AA meetings. I was never forced. I thought about waiting for a DUI and then my family would maybe take it more seriously and ... perhaps treat me better? I don't know what the thinking was. 

 Either way I am just sick of not having control. Thinking to myself ""I won't drink tonight."" every night and failing at it.   
 I also would SWEAR that everything hangs in the balance here. I used to be creative and energetic and it all seems to go away when I'm drowning in alcohol, and then if I can get myself away for a bit it'll come back.   
 Many of the AA people I met had the experience of being in some type of limbo, before cutting the cord to the bottle and then they saw absolution. I want that. Even if I don't get it, there's one more reason to do this. I was inspired by this thread.   


 Maybe I can inspire.

But I wanted to share incase it helps anyone else keep on track, as it is me, though I take no joy or pleasure in what happened.


My grandfather was 73. He had been drinking for almost his entire life, having caught the addiction from his father who passed from overdose too. Towards the end he had to continue to drink. Alcohol made him incontinent, he had bed sores, he couldn't stand or eat much. But without alcohol, even when medicated, his mind would begin to unravel and it was clear that while we thought he had slowly declined with age, he had rapidly declined, and we had attributed it to the alcohol. It covered us up to the fact that, when he wasn't plastered, he still didn't know where he was or what was happening. 


He spent his final weeks presumably dry in a hospital. He called or texted us on days he was more lucid to complain about ""directors being given alcohol, but not him"" as he believed his doctors were both actors and wardens who were trying to hoard ""his"" alcohol. He switched between delusions that he was in prison, and on a film set. 


He had a brain scan, because this all started to become apparent after being hospitalised and unable to drink- though medicated for withdrawls. It confirmed that alcohol had, in brutal terms, destroyed the majority of his brain, and he would not be returning to us in any form. 



I want to share this for anyone considering drinking today. While it wasnt just one drink that made him the way he was, we all know that one drink never ends there. No matter what stage of your addiction you are in, if you're a new comer or experience renal failure, you still have a chance to not end up like my grand father. 


You will not be able to drink yourself to death with ease, your final weeks and days will most likely be sober and filled with pain and fear. It is not an easy way out. It is not a death anyone would choose if they witnessed it.


I hope everyone stays safe, IWNDWYT.",18

2020-09-13 10:59:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/irzprm/rough_patch/,Rough Patch,"I am going through one of the roughest patches I've had in sobriety in several months. I am literally at work right now and all I want to do is drink. I am the only one in the office and while part of my day is spent interacting with patients and other staff, a lot of it is paperwork which I do alone. We have also been swamped for the past few weeks and now I am finally getting a breather as I am getting caught up on work which is leading to a lot of wandering thoughts.

I know part of the issue is I am so close to getting out of a bad living situation. I just got an increase in work hours to 7 hours a day and once I hit 8 hours, I will have the financial stability to get my own place and move away from someone I shouldn't be around. It's like I'm so close to freedom that I think I may subconsciously going ""if you do relapse, it's only until you move out and then we'll get sober again.""

I know that voice only ever just wants me to drink and that getting sober will be harder if I do relapse and give in but right now it hurts to fight. This is one of those times when relapse feels less like defeat and more like relief.

I am still fighting because I need to break the cycle but it just hurts to do it right now because while I know it will only be a temporary relief, if I relapse, it will still be a small break from what is going on in my life.

I know I just need to hold on a little longer and these cravings will pass and I'll feel stronger again but it's just difficult when you are actively in that headspace, you know.

I hope everyone else is doing better but if you're battling cravings real bad right now, trust me, I feel you.",6

Two decades later, plenty of googling “do I drink to much”, and living in the grey area where functionally alcoholism lives, I knew it had to stop. My health and personhood was at stake. 

I would get motivated and flirt with sobriety, only to have the crisp white or dark red woo me back, negotiating with myself that I did not have a problem. Convincing myself many moms drink a bottle a day. I had the t-shirt to prove it- “I run for wine.” 

I am not sure exactly what happened but after the pandemic hit, I am a nurse in a hospital, I went into survival mode and after the first few weeks of continued steady routine nightly drinking, I just stopped. And here I am, 131 days. I think the pandemic saved me.",16

It was great to see everyone and nobody was pushy about me not drinking, but it was definitely the most challenging setting I've been in in a while. These were the people that made drinking fun. Not the in-too-deep crowd I used to stay up for 3 days with, these were the ones that I'd share really good wine with over fancy bread and lots of beautifully cooked food. We'd get drunk, but it was nice, warm, friendly, safe feeling drunk.

I wanted that feeling so bad again. The restaurant was a really nice place with a really great wine list and everyone else was getting merry and savouring the good booze and amazing food. I felt sad not to be able to join in the splitting of various bottles, but I played the tape forwards and realised that if I had a drink, everyone else would head home in a couple hours and get on with their afternoon whilst I would find the next nearest bar and continue, alone, until I was staggering home with a box of fried food and no money left wondering where the day had gone.

After that, it became easy. I had a fancy artisanal cola and still got to enjoy the amazing bread, meats, dessert and scintillating conversion. It was great to catch up with these people, who seemed to like me just as much when I'm not full of wine, and I left feeling proud of myself.",16

Today is two years since I decided to stop actively killing myself. It’s almost a year from when I started treating my anxiety. It’s a month since I started therapy. 

Two years ago I woke up early feeling like absolute garbage, knowing I had to get through my shitty job, knowing I had a doctors appointment to talk about a safe way to stop drinking, knowing I couldn’t go home after work because I’d drink. It was the most scared I’ve ever been in my 24 years. It was the first time I had to deal with my emotions instead of ignoring them for another day. 

You all gave me hope. You offered suggestions, you told your stories, you reminded me I could actually do this. 

Right now I’m snuggled in bed with my puppies and husband. I’m able to get a nice coffee, enjoy my morning. I get to go into my dream job later today. I get to feel happy and loved today. And everyday. Because YOU were here for me when I didn’t know where to even begin. 

I wouldn’t be here without every single one of you unknowingly being here for me. To whoever sees this- I hope you have the best day, remember to be nice to yourself, and keep kicking ass :)",172

Why. Why can't I just not buy alcohol. I just have to *not buy it*. If it's never available, I can't drink it. So all I have to do is simply not bring it into the house.
I think I need a support system. Which means I need to tell someone other than my husband. How do I deal with that shame? I have to have someone else to regularly talk to because it's tearing him up inside being my only support.

She is concerned I might have developed bipolar disorder. She wants me to see a psychiatrist ASAP. I looked up the symptoms, and they do look frighteningly like how I've been doing lately.

Two of the risk factors are:

* Periods of high stress (yes, I have had this recently, above and beyond normal 2020 stress)
* Drug or alcohol abuse (not currently, but yeah, that's why I'm here)

And of course since it is 2020, the year of stress, I can't get any appointments for quite a while, and now I'm worried. My doctors suggested an intensive outpatient program, but 1) they're booked up, and 2) I'm supposed to start a new job soon, so I don't have 2 weeks to devote to nothing but therapy and group sessions.  And of course, since I'm changing jobs, that also means I'm temporarily without health insurance. 

All of this is really making me want to drink. I've been awake since 1am and there is a bottle of whiskey in a cabinet and it is tempting. My husband keeps it and I have been fine with it because I don't like whiskey, but now it's calling to me. I may have to ask him to hide it when he wakes up.

Last night, blacked out, I sleep walked and pissed on the floor of my apartment hallway, my roommate told me to my utter disbelief this morning.

I've tried to quit longterm before, and went three weeks without any booze this year. I'm not the kind of person that drinks all day, every day. Hell, I go weeks without having a drink, but when I do I binge like there's no tomorrow. I'm terrible at managing stress and I'm an insomniac. When the pressure builds week after week I give in to the momentary relief of alcohol, and then suffer even worse than before.

So I'm starting sobriety today, but I'm scared. I'm scared that the awkward sensitive person I've tried to bury all of these years with booze will come back. I'm scared I won't sleep. I'm scared that my already introverted tendencies will take over and I will have no social life whatsoever. I'm scared of all these things, but more scared of alcohol. I know there is no way forward in my life without quitting, which scares me the most.",4

I am currently in therapy and go to gym 5-6 a week however going through these emotional rollcoasters lately is very draining. These are triggers where I have wanted to drink or get shitfaced however my willpower currently is me not drinking anytime soon. I am too committed to my soberity.

I've been feeling really positive and happy most days. And then I go and fuck it up.


Anyway, I think I'm going to stay away from social situations for a while. It's just too risky for me in the early days. The urges are too strong. And after a month or two I'm going to tell my friends I still need to not be around people who are drinking for a while. I'm gonna explain to my friends what's going on and why I won't be around for a while of course. I know that if they really care about me they'll be supportive. This is hard.

One day, about a month ago, I bought my first can of beer. I don't know why I did it. 1 can became 2 cans, and yesterday I drank 2 cans in rapid succession, drove to get something and hit a car on the parking lot. Not a big hit, just some paint. But the guy saw I had been drinking and called the cops.
I was of course positive on alcohol and had to hand over my drivers license for 15 days. I will need to go to court. 

I waited until today (just now) to tell my wife when the kidss were not home. She hadn't seen this coming and went completely quiet. Now she went over to her parents. I don't know what will happen next. I'm devastated. I am sure this drinking restart is over, I 'luckily' have been caught before physical addiction set in and I'm forced to not drink now.

I have had trouble with alcoholism in the past, and it got significantly worse in lockdown and now is significantly worse again because I've been the target of a really cruel online bullying/harassment campaign. There are people writing blog posts mocking me, etc. I've been drinking a lot because I don't want to feel the pain and shame of it, and I'm also really, really angry that ""friends"" won't stand up for me. I don't have a lot of support. I live alone in a foreign country. I feel like everybody hates me. 

Last night I had a big blow out online, and as I usually do, on social media. I have a large following and it was embarrassing. I know I have to start day one today. I want to stay at home, eat food (in recent days, since the abuse started getting worse, I've been eating maybe just one slice of bread or one egg per day), and spend time on SD and read about what comes next. I know in the past when I've detoxed being off social media has been essential, so I've done that too. Honestly I don't want to talk to or see anyone for the next few days at least. 

However, I promised a friend a few days ago that I would help him with a complex job application in English, today. I also am volunteering on an unpaid project, and it's due. I've also committed to reading an acquaintance's PhD dissertation. The first friend has been good to me, I guess, and has struggled with longterm unemployment. He hasn't stood up for me publicly but he has let me talk about it and acknowledged how serious the online abuse is. None of these assignments are paid and I don't have a full-time job. I'm supposed to go with my friend to help him with his job application at a pub today. He doesn't have any money so I always pay. I just want to stay inside. I feel very bad cancelling because he really wants the job. I don't know what to do. I just know that if I say ""just one more day"" (of drinking/paying) I might lose this desire. I feel like I'm always taking care of other people, paying for other people, when I don't have an income, and not ever taking care of myself.

I can imagine a better future for my children who would’ve suffered from being stuck in the toxic environment created by bitterness and contempt. I can even hope that my former partner finds happiness.

We may be a world apart, but  we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding  what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily  commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to  inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender  or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a  sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*.  It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes  impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person  can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again.  And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not  drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that  they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and  participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at  /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed  introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.  You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hello there! 

Welcome to another sober Sunday! Good lord, waking up fresh never gets old, eh? It’s my first time doing the DCI, so go easy on me. Oh who am I kidding; of course you will. Never was there a more accepting bunch of wonderfully supportive people. I am truly honored to be hosting this week. 

So every day, I want to talk about something this community has given to me over the years. And for my first post, I want to talk about fragility and the fallacy of your “number”. 

When I first starting coming here, I couldn’t make 24 hours without a drink. I’d see people with days, months, years, and even decades under their belt, and just couldn’t see myself doing the same. But gradually, I  was able to string some days together, which turned into weeks, and some of those even turned into months. But I still consider my sobriety a fragile thing. 

Case in point, when I volunteered at the beginning of August for the DCI after getting 30 days in the bag, I was given this exact date in September, and I immediately thought: “Well, there’s no way you’re gonna make that, but try anyway.” 

So I made it. But if I feel like this, where do I get off hosting? I’ll be honest: I heard it’s a great way to stay sober! But it’s also because of something that someone once said to me on here. 

On (yet another) day one of mine, I wrote under a post celebrating a 365 day milestone, something like: “Congratulations, I can only dream of achieving what you have.” The poster immediately commented back: “The  only difference between you and me is that I’ve managed to string a bunch of day ones together. IWNDWYT” On their day to celebrate, that person reminded me of their fragility, and gave me hope I could get stronger in my own. 

So I wanted to show you my fragility today for the same reason. You  might be on your first day one, I’m on my 74th, and there’s another guy somewhere about to have his 500th. But other than that, there isn’t that much difference between us. It definitely gets easier, but every day, we all get up and fight the same fight. 

Here’s to another day one Sobernauts. IWNDWYT.",132

2020-09-13 01:31:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/irsjt0/learning_to_walk_story_long/,"Learning to Walk (Story, Long)","I can't sleep again. I've been trying to reconnect with hobbies I had and one of them is writing, so  I wrote something about me and my Dad. This story is a little bit about drinking, a lot about relationships. It's about 1,300 words so if you aren't up for it, there's your warning.

~~~~~~~~

After my hospitalization in 2014, it took a while before I was ready to reconnect with my Dad. None of it was his fault, of course. Not really. In order to make sense of things, one needs perspective, which comes with time and distance. But it’s not enough. To the untrained eye a blueprint is a complicated series of lines and arrows and ticks. To an architect, it’s a building yet to take shape. All that to say, without the skills and experience to understand my relationship with Dad, I was left with an incomplete picture of who he is.

My Dad and I, like many if not most fathers and sons, have more in common than I would have ever imagined growing up. I have his gift to solve problems, one I don’t think he appreciates in himself - not enough, anyway. I have his moodiness in crowds, his stubbornness. I have his intelligence. I have his alcoholism.

As I grew enough to accept that my problems were mine - not to project cruelty onto a person when my own anxieties were at fault, I came to realize that Dad had done everything he could. Like every parent, he wasn’t blessed with perfect knowledge of how to communicate with his family. And I wasn’t blessed with a perfect memory. I forgot about all the times he tucked me in, tickled me and played with me, replacing those memories with sterner ones. He worked himself on the road for long, long hours, trips away from home that I couldn’t appreciate were painful to him but necessary to support his family. Painful because he missed us. He gave his health and so much of his precious time to keep us fed and clothed and happy.

The way I chose to reconnect with Dad was to join him in his hobbies. He’s an outdoorsman, a hunter and fisherman. It’s where he finds his peace. I had moved back in with my parents at that point, so making time to spend with him was easy. I felt guilty for how I had so poorly perceived him for so long. Truthfully, guilt made it easy to accept his invitations to come shooting with him, or go cut wood for the wood stove.

I’d hunted a little as a kid, which just meant we went camping with Dad, rode in the truck through winding forestry roads, and sometimes shot a grouse with a pellet gun or a .22 rifle. I hadn’t kept up the tradition, and in truth I have always had mixed feelings about it. Hunting is a popular, maybe even foundational tradition in our family. Generations of hunters and outdoorsmen. At times, I was too squeamish for the task. At other times, I was simply disinterested, or didn’t want to spend my weekend out in the freezing wilderness at 5AM, bleary eyed and bored.

As a young man I chose to try again. I practiced shooting with Dad, though I’ve never been any good at it and I’m still not a crack shot. I liked the 20 gauge shotgun he had bought for my Mom years ago. It was light and easy. Point and shoot. Eventually, hunting season came. In Canada, days are still very long when the season arrives in September. Hunting is best done at dawn and dusk, so to hunt one must be up before the dawn: 4:30 AM.

Shift workers might laugh. So what? That’s normal. It isn’t for me. It was a struggle just to force my eyes awake, stumble into the kitchen, and make an instant coffee for the road. I was usually hung over when Dad and I hunted, because I was usually hung over for about half a day at minimum, seven days a week. We climbed into the truck and drove into the mountains, outpacing the eager September sunrise.

We got where we wanted to be, along a secluded clear cut. We could sweep its perimeter slowly, hoping to catch a deer as it roused from its bed in the clearing. At this elevation it was cold and the ground was frosty. Big white flecks of ice clung to the fat blades of grass, still green from summertime.

I slung the rifle Dad gave me over my shoulder and walked over to meet him. He turned quickly and hushed me. I was confused. I scanned around but couldn’t see anything warranting a shush. He told me I had to walk quieter. Walk quieter? I had never thought about the volume of how I walked. How could I walk quietly in these big, heavy hunting boots? I couldn’t even flex my heel in them. He showed me quickly: heel to toe, a nice gentle roll each footfall. I tried it out and found it a little tricky, but I noticed how much quieter I was. The frosty grass gave way with little sound as I tenderly rolled my foot over it.

The problem was that now, I dedicated all my attention to walking quietly. I walked too slow to keep up with Dad, and truth be told I was watching my feet as much as I watched for deer. Eventually, my steps grew steadier, quicker, and more natural. Eventually, I hardly thought about how I walked when I hunted. Slowly roll from heel to toe.

We didn’t find anything that day. I went hunting with my Dad a lot over the next year, and we didn’t have much success. Not for lack of trying, though. At some points I enjoyed myself, and at others I found it trying. In the end, I’m not really cut out for it. I’m actually trying to be vegetarian most days now. In some ways I miss the time spent with Dad. I should spend more time with him. However, that time wasn’t fruitless, even if we rarely had a successful hunt. I love my Dad. I can say that without any trace of doubt or guilt now. I can go home for a barbeque just because I want to.


After the hospital, I managed to stay sober for all of about three weeks. I slipped back into drinking daily, and while the quantities waxed and waned, I was never able to stop for longer than a week or so at a time. Each time I started again, it became harder to quit. Quitting felt worse, and my tolerance grew and grew until I was drinking double what would have once left me blacked out. It took a long time for me to build the courage and resolve to seek help again. I’m feeling optimistic this time. I never felt that before.

I still can’t sleep. I couldn’t as a little boy and I can’t now, especially as I’m detoxing. When I can’t sleep and I don’t drink, I walk. I’ve become reacquainted with the night, listening to its sounds and taking in the dusky air as the earth cools it and feeds it moisture. The quiet rhythm of nature is very soothing to me. However briefly, it wipes away my distress. Tonight as I listened, I noticed a new sound. Me. I heard each scuff of my shoes on the sidewalk as I stepped clumsily and lazily. All the pebbles I knocked on the road. I stopped for a while by the creek, then began walking again. One step at a time, slow roll from heel to toe. Soon I'd found my stride. I could hear every footstep of the woman across the street, not privy to my new game. I couldn't hear my own almost at all.

It’s slow at first. It takes all your attention just to keep going. Eventually, your steps grow steadier. Eventually, you hardly have to think about it at all. Of course, there will be missteps. Of course, you may still trip, stumble - even fall. Once you've learned how, you don't forget. You can always get back up and try again.",5

Its very hard not to turn to alcohol with everything going on. Covid has changed our lives, I can't go outside walking because of the wildfire smoke &  mixed with everyday stresses with work & family its harder than ever to fight the depression. 

I have struggled with substance abuse my whole life & am committed to not become the person I was up until 10 months ago. 

I have been on reddit on other pages but have never posted here before, but I just felt like sharing a little bit of my story as its a struggle these days to stay on track & not fall to my worst vices. 

Just know that each and everyone of us is worth sticking to it & being our best selves.

When I took the long walk through the church foyer, I was scared shitless. 

I looked at the sign to the left of the door and made sure I was in the right spot. 

Last night I decided I need other people to help me. If I don't find outside support, I will die. Not might. Will. And soon. 

I don't know what rules I broke. I don't know anything about the rules. I just googled men's support alcoholics, found a ten am meeting. 

I was late, because thirty minutes before I was still halfnhalfing it. Then committed, jumped in the shower to mitigate liquor smell, and went there. 

So when I opened the door, three or four faces looked up. For a millisecond I was worried that I broke a rule, that I should have been invited, bit they looked up because someone was already talking. 

What happened next were very candid and emotional stories, some of triumph, some as matter of fact but looking for advice, and some that I think we're designed for the new, sweaty, red-faced obviously hungover guy slumped on the corner (me). 

I don't know if I broke any rules. They let me exit when I wanted to without a word. I'll go next Saturday and see what happens.

I feel like that should be enough to pull me through but reading ""DIFFICULTY BREATHING"" warnings enough on weather websites and in the news has \*surprise\* made it kind of difficult to breathe?

My dream guy had a temperament that included yelling at me a breaking everything in spite. When he added 
Methamphetamine it was fuel to the fire. I left him.
Once again I was alone. Without hesitation, I drank. I drank more than I ever had . I was fortunate I never got around the wrong people.I had a good job so I was functioning.  Payed my rent and car payment . Independent and drinking in my free time. Pretty well out of control. I lived  a few years alone this way 
 Low and behold. I met my husband . We were both drinking like fools. Well he became the Father of my only child. He was way more temperamental,  that's putting it very lightly. He was a monster . I lived being verbally abused for almost 20 years. I did stay sober when my son was growing up. He was verbally abused also . Of course there were happy times, the anger and abuse out weight them .I had to get a restraining order.  Then I got a divorce. Here I am 10 years later . I stayed independent , paid my bills. As of recent I quit my job 2 years ago. Started driving ride share, making not even half the income I was used to . So much happend , I was just in a bad place . I visited the mental hospital, even jail. Staying with my ex husband was a desperate bad place to end up. He got his revenge on me. I was stuck because it wasn't just me ,I had my 12 year old blind dog, and my 20 year old  parrot she's  been with me all the 20 years. He's still with me , my sweet dog died . I met a new man I warned him but he still jumped into my mess of a life. Me my dog and my parrote listened to him and got the hell out of the monsters den. I started off with a relationship with this older man , who was homeless  but you couldn't tell . His wife had died of cancer. Now the first time in my life I was homeless. We slept in my car for 3 weeks ,,when we ran out of money for a motel. We are still living together but as friends. No surprise he was temperamental and in need of control  . This is the best part of this long story. I put a stop to the abuse! Then I quit drinking ! I feel strong about not allowing myself to be abused. Maybe after all the all the pain , I free of the reason I drank .I believe so . I'm still working through so things but I'm sober! Whoa long long post. It feels good to share my life . If you read this . Thank you. Thank you , Thank you. I love to hear your input. Here we are staying sober together.  Our best lifes.!💜",3

In my journey, I experienced some bad things in sobriety and so I try not to think of sobriety as a place where things get better. I mean, they do get better but when I stopped drinking, I thought I might perhaps never again experience certain types of pain and suffering.

I’d rather be here than back there. My sobriety is not about feeling happier or having it easier... it’s a choice to live. It’s the ability to have a family. The ability to make a difference in the lives of others. The ability to give my life meaning.

I still feel anxiety, panic, fear, depression, and pain. But most of the time, it doesn’t really matter. My feelings don’t rule me anymore. I’ll forever understand the person who drinks to quiet their thoughts and their feelings because that was me and I’ll forever feel somewhat saddened that they haven’t found their way to something better.

Things do get better. I suppose in a much more meaningful way than I ever expected.

When I started this journey, I was wracked with fear and anxiety, mourning a future I was never going to be a part of again: beers with my friends, cocktails on chilly nights, those Devil May care day drinking extravaganzas that I had convinced myself were so much fun. I was afraid my creativity would stagnate, my enthusiasm for life In general would deteriorate to a kind of murky paste of disquiet and lethargy, but I couldn’t have been more wrong. It feels like for the first time in fifteen years I’m actually *living*— doing things because I want to, cause I enjoy them, not because when they’re done I can numb myself, tune out, r e l a x, or I need to be buzzed up to. I feel like I had to drink to live with myself, to fit in, to have a card that reads at the time clock of our culture that often normalizes a crippling addiction to a alcohol. A substance which more of than not, intellectually and emotionally desiccates people to the point where they’re fleetingly pursuing a high which only ever happens once. Drinking will never be as fun as it was the first time you did it, and quitting today will be the first step in getting your life back. It’s work, but with that work comes peace and a sense of purpose I had convinced myself could only be ascertained after reaching the bottom of a bottle. All those things you think won’t be the same are a lie. Hanging out with the people you love will still be fun, because that’s how it’s supposed to be. You weren’t enjoying that time with them because you were drinking, but because they love you, and it’s fun to be around them. Don’t worry about all that, believe me— your friends will still love you, your partners will love you more, and hell, you just might find out you love yourself a little bit too.

It's day 2 of deciding to go sober (for life?!) It's not the first time I've tried, I actually have no idea how many times I've tried, and failed, but I hope this one goes well. I've never had anyone around going through the same thing to talk to so I hope coming on here will help? 

I had an awful night the other night, a last straw kind of night. (I don't know if talking about your drunken mishaps is allowed on here? Don't really see anyone posting about it but can't find anything about it in the rules...) And just feel the need to get it off my chest. I didn't even mean to go out drinking, I literally went into town to do some shopping and drop something off at my boyfriend's work, instead when I dropped it off I stayed for a drink, and once I've had one I can't seem to say no to another. I hadn't eaten anything yet that day, I was meant to go home to feed my dogs and cat, and instead I stayed out drinking until the night and got absolutely smashed. Not out of the ordinary, but this night was particularly bad, and I have no idea how I managed to get home. I know I got the train, but the only memory I have is sitting at a bus stop, talking to some random man, trying to convince him to go for a drink with me. Why on earth was I trying to convince a strange man I met at a bus stop to go for a drink? Pretty sure he agreed and I stumbled round for awhile, then remembered I was meant to be going home, I assume. What if he decided to take advantage of my blind drunkenness? I can't even remember if he did! I'm such a fucking idiot.
Anyways, spent the following day continuously throwing up and practically convulsing from shakes. Completely wasted my time off work. And to top it off I bent my boyfriend's headphones somehow, I know that's only tiny but I feel like a twat.

The time has come once again to try and quit. I'm already having the thoughts of wanting to drink now I'm not hungover anymore. And my coworkers are wanting to go out for pizza and I have no idea what to tell them when I order a soft drink, no one at my work can know about my problem. Just feeling generally really shit about myself (pity party, I'm sorry)
Hope talking to some like minded people will help, and thanks if you read this far lol",3

For people that can control their drinking, I enjoy making the best beer I can for them to enjoy responsibly. I hope I can become a sort of role model to others in the industry too at some point to prove you don't have to pound a ton of booze to be in the industry. It's all about making people smile.

They were probably grabbing drinks for everybody and left one. The weight and coldness caught me off guard. Nobody else was inside. For a fleeting moment, I imagined downing it. I could've had it consumed within seconds. I also imagined the other 12 that I would have, the puking, the hangover, the guilt, the sadness, less enjoyment with my kids and wife, and being 6 feet under before 40. This all happened within a matter of a few seconds. Then, I turned the the door, walked outside, asked who forgot their drink inside, and left it with the girls (turned out to be an extra/mistake).

I'm a brand new dad and due to some great things that happened to me (with work) next to becoming a new dad I decided to celebrate with a friend. We went to the casino, won a bunch of cash, drank a bit too much to celebrate.

Came home and my wife wasn't too happy (we'd already been having communication issues the past few weeks leading up to this date, postpartum and learning how to be a father weren't helping that either).

She left to my parents (700 km by train) and I continued drinking in shame. I asked doctors for help, institutions, etc, everyone said no or there is a waiting list of up to 3 weeks. Nationalised semi-private insurance fucking sucks.

I somehow got myself sober and then I drove 1400 km (700 km there and 700 km back) to pick up my wife and newborn. She knew I was coming and everyone supports us.

I've been pretty low mood all week, it's the weekend and  I have a bunch of work I needed to get done. I work from home because I'm self-employed.

I smoked a little weed, and I have to say that has really helped increase my mood to the point where I can actually start to get stuff done.

It's amazing how nice it is to have a little smoke when there is no alcohol involved, it feels stimulating and productive.

I'm too minds about ethanol though. I'm glad I gave up, and will do so until my health is remarkably better and I've lost the extra weight I'm carrying around.

I'm really not sure if I'll go back to the stuff or not, but recently I've been following this amazing dude and his YouTube channel: Fit Recovery : [fit-recovery.com](https://fit-recovery.com) and there he outlines how we need to start with our biological state with diet and supplements, then psychological, etc. etc. to transcend alcohol.

I have to say I do agree with that way of thinking, it's not about not being able to have something but it's about replacing the alcohol with good habits: sports, new hobbies, family time. It's important to focus on what we do want from life.

Anyway, this is becoming a bit of a rant, I just really needed somewhere to vent.

I return to this article a few times a week, maybe more on certain parts depending on the situation. I identify with so much of it that it’s like I wrote it myself. 
My favorite section is on the absence of decisions after choosing sobriety:

4. Relish the absence of decisions:

 ‘Part of the stress of drinking (yes, drinking is stressful), and the stress of attempting to “moderate” (for those with an addiction to alcohol) is the constant fucking decisions, the constant, anxiety-ridden “Will I or won’t I? When? How much? Where will I buy it? Perhaps if I just drink light beer, wine and soda? How will I hide it?…” etc., etc., and on and fucking on... My mantra, during the early days was no decisions to make. Do not allow yourself to even consider it. The thoughts might come, but don’t put any energy into them, let them pass you by, just as trains pass a station. Just keep telling yourself that the only necessary decision has been made. That you can relax now and do other things. It’s difficult in the beginning, but it works. Just don’t go there. Keep it simple. You’ve chosen not to. Decision made. No room for negotiations.’",24

Now Day 3 feel better as far as head but body is still week and lower belly is still uncomfortable. wondering if people had issues with stomach after stopping. A bit scared especially since everything was perfect 1 month and a half ago. I have extreme anxiety that I messed myself up. Any support would be nice. But the good thing is I will never binge again. This is not for me anymore! I will stay strong for my life and to be happy :)",4

One I totally overdid it and got myself into shitty situations and I ultimately decided I don’t need this in my life. Before this I had been drinking, on average, 4 to 6 tall boys or a bottle of wine at least on the daily for years. More than that on “special occasions” like, you know, a weekend. It’s been going great. Dreams were wild but I was sleeping better and more restfully. It’s like something in my mind just clicked and I don’t want it. I am not having issues with cravings. I’ve had some mood swings but really it’s been going wonderfully. Until today. I suddenly have massive anxiety. I have a variety of diagnosed anxiety disorders I’ve dealt with my whole life (hence the booze probably) and one of the best things about the past week was that I wasn’t having anxiety, at all. I felt so calm, even when my mood would swing I could get it under control so easily. It was wonderful. It’s like a week of anxiety hit me all at once. Along with a massive headache from hell.

Of course, there are other things that make me feel good that I love — my partner, eating a delicious meal, watching TV. But I can’t say those things ALWAYS pull me out of a dark spot like running. 

Now the entire west coast is on fire and I can’t go outside, and as someone with asthma I feel super congested and shitty and not into the idea of doing something like a HIIT session indoors.

2020-09-12 11:25:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/irek0u/compounding_sobriety/,Compounding sobriety,"Today is four weeks AF for me and I’ve been amazed by the noticeable improvements in mood, mental clarify, and productivity. I woke up this morning thinking about an analogy I could use to explain why I made this decision to other people who drink or are trying to give it up. I wanted to share it here and see if it rings true for anyone else.

Remember those middle school math “story problems”? It was just another problem to solve but you also had to dig the relevant details out of a paragraph and then do the calculations. I always liked them for some reason. One that stands out to me is the one where Johnny/Susie is asked if they would rather have $10,000 today or $0.01 today and for that amount to double daily for a month. The obvious teenage answer was to take the money and run... who wants a penny today, two pennies tomorrow, etc? But when you crunch the numbers, you find that by days 28, 29, and 30 you’re getting millions of dollars each day, and a monthly total of over $10 million. 

I see parallels to sobriety in this. When my brain tells me to just go grab a 12 pack and unwind, that’s the $10,000 offer. It seems like a great thing and almost stupid to pass it up. But only once you start seeing the compounding interest add up after successive weeks/months of sobriety do you realize how much more you’re getting than with a daily/bingy drinking habit. I’m going to keep collecting those pennies and trust my interest will keep compounding.

Have a great weekend everyone.",18

I’ve been to lots of parties and other potentially triggering events since I quit drinking but a rave is like 10 hours long and I feel like the culture is so enmeshed in the act of getting fucked up. I brought two redbulls with me and half a pack of cigs. Everyone I came with was drinking and on molly and I thought I’d feel awkward but I actually didn’t feel weird at all. I was the most confident in myself I’d ever been at a show and didn’t feel the need to blackout. Part of me missed that ritual at the very beginning of the night but as soon as things got going I realized I could be present and still feel alive. Plus I got to drive us home while they were coming down off everything and I was still in a good mood, and now I’m waking up at 8am feeling like the day after isn’t wasted because I don’t feel like a zombie.

What used to feel natural to me now just felt off, like putting on your old favorite shirt and finding it didn’t fit right anymore. 

If there are any other relapsers out there kicking themselves, we didn’t undo all of our progress. Every sober day, consecutive or not, moves us farther away from the people we used to be who didn’t even try. For me, relapsing made me realize that even if I wanted to, I can’t make my old way of life work for me again. I’ve come too far.

I’ll go out, get drunk, wake up with an awful hangover and a messy kitchen, and I’ll say “that’s it, I’m done”.

On day three, I’m mostly back to normal; the brain fog has faded, I’m back to eating appropriately, and I’m gaining momentum on the work and projects I left for dead when I decided to drink the other day.  But, at some point during that day, after I’ve accomplished some tasks and I’m starting to feel good about not letting my life completely fall apart, I begin to hear a  gentle voice in the back of my mind saying “it would be nice to go out for a drink and socialize and watch a game tonight” or “what a beautiful day to sit on a patio and have a drink”.

Today an old friend is coming and visiting me for the day, he's never been to my home town and all I ever joke about is how theres nothing to do but drink (its an old English town thats only thriving industry is the numerous bars). I told him i have decided to stop but i still want to show him around and introduce him to some of my other friends. And that means going in a pub. 

Im not ready to tell the rest of my friends yet. When i said our town is heaving with pubs i mean its really ingrained in our culture. They would take it lightly and so i want to wait until i can show them how long i have lasted and how much further I can go!

The reason for the post though is that im scared I'll get there and smell the alcohol stained carpet and feel my decision to stop was too rash. That I'll feel silly for quitting. ""A few drinks a weekend isnt enough to be worried about"" is what my heads been whispering all yesterday. I had to have an operation earlier this year, at 23 years old, one im sure i could of avoided if i didn't drink.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

**Holy shit, SD - what a week this has been!!!**  Did anybody get the license plate number on that truck?!??

You did?  Good!  Someone needs to report that crazy person.  What's it say?  

 ***SLNTSRN***

*Ohhhh* ..... that was *my* truck. 

Well this is fantastically awkward. 

(a phrase that sums me up quite nicely)

&#x200B;

😇😈

&#x200B;

Congratulations on having survived this week's Daily Check-In: SilentSiren Edition!  You can tell your friends and family  you survived the insanity, swearing, tirades, bad puns, poop talk, embracing the suck, feeling all the feels... and hopefully felt the love and even learned something new along the way.     

One member described this week as: *""I laughed, I cried, I.... I'm, uh - I seem to be missing my wallet.  DAMMIT!!""*   

&#x200B;

There are no words to describe what an incredible experience hosting this week has been.   If you scroll through the posts each day, you get an idea of what goes on here, and what makes this place like a virtual home or second family to so many of us.  Now, imagine all that love and support filling your inbox.  I've been reading your messages all week, and **you guys are amazing**.  So much love and concern for one another, so much courage ... this has been, hands-down, one of the most emotional and incredible experiences of my sobriety journey. Thank you for opening up and sharing yourselves with me, and for allowing me to share a little bit of myself with you.  🧡💜

&#x200B;

*Speaking of which:  how would YOU like to host the DCI for a week?   Come on down, the water's fine - I promise I didn't pee in it!   If you've got at least 30 days or more of sobriety and are interested in hosting, please let me or* u/SaintHomer *know.  We'd love to have you!!*    

&#x200B;

\------

Okay, okay - it's been a crazy week.  Let's have a little fun, shall we? 

Think of a famous movie quote - any movie, any quote (try to keep it something fairly recognizable if you can, for sake of the game.).  Switch out one or more of the words so it relates to sobriety or not drinking, or anything like that.   I'll go first and provide a few examples.  

&#x200B;

* *Mean Girls:* ""Gretchen, stop trying to make 'drunk' happen.  It's \*NOT\* going to happen."" 
* *Scarface:* ""Say hello to my little frappuccino"" 
* *The Princess Bride:*  (to Alcohol) - ""Hello.  My name is \_\_\_\_.  You killed my spirit. Prepare to die.""  (thanks u/SunshineyAF for this one!)
* *Finding Nemo:*   ""Just keep drinking (coffee), just keep drinking (coffee)...""

&#x200B;

Okay, it's your turn!  Just mention the movie your quote is from, followed with your sobriety or non-drinking-modified quote.  Show me whatcha got!

&#x200B;

Thanks again, SD family.  Hope you have a fantastic weekend!!

I am a chronic relapser, never being able to string together more than a few months at a time before going back out.

I suffer from chronic anxiety. Sometimes I can stretches of time where it is totally manageable, and then there are times when my entire world  is consumed with fear and panic. I feel like I can’t breathe, like my heart is going to explode. I feel like I’m floating above my body, looking at myself from the outside in. I lie in bed, unable to sleep, praying that the racing thoughts will go away. It is a fear unlike any I have known. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. 

I have been medicated with just about everything under the sun. Nothing seems to help, except....you know what I’m going to say. 

Alcohol relieves my symptoms quickly and effectively, but of course because I self medicate, I have to be drinking constantly and inevitably I end up ruining my life with the drinking and find myself unable to live with it or without it. Benzos also help, but I have yet to find a doctor who will prescribe them to me because of my history.

Has anyone been through this? I feel like I’m at the jumping off point. I just can’t live like this anymore, either totally miserable while drinking, or totally miserable without drinking.",11

I also had a crush on her since she was older. It just makes me realize how much time has passed, and think about my own mortality. I miss the past a little bit too. No one seems to care as much as I do though. But maybe it’s because my family is all religious and they think she’s in heaven right now.

This is my 3rd Friday night sober. I was an exclusively weekend drinker so fridays are particularly hard. I felt that old twinge all day today while working of “at least it’s Friday and I can get wasted tonight” and truthfully I could. I even thought about it earlier. But I don’t really want to. I made a list of 12 things I want to get done this weekend (mostly all work related) and I know that if I drank tonight, none of them would get done! 
I finished work and went for a 5 kilometre jog in the park, right after a storm had come through. The park is lovely and smells amazing right  after a storm. I made myself a nice pasta dinner and now I’m going to read and watch a movie. 
I know for a fact that I am going to finish sober September (and mark the longest I’ve gone without alcohol in 5 years) and my post September goal is to last through the US elections without alcohol (definitely need help with that! Lol) 
Anyway people, it’s nice to share this with all of you and I hope someone struggling this evening reads this and knows it can be done, it’s not always hard, and being sober on a Friday night can be damn relaxing and enjoyable 😀",15

Now I've gone back to uni and live with someone else who drinks to excess like myself, it's clearly a recipe for disaster. I messed up last night, really bad. But its okay. Today I won't and I'm proud of it. 

I need to accept it's fine to mess up, make mistakes and have those bad nights. As long as I am aware of the consequences and know I am strong enough to say no again. That's all that matters. 

Being sober is the best feeling in the world, and everytime I drink I realise it more and more. It's not worth it, it's a temporary feeling and turns out to be a permanent problem.

I will beat this, with every fibre of my being. It may take me weeks, months or years. But life is beautiful and I will be okay. We will all be okay.",7

2020-09-11 20:43:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ir2w83/decided_to_drink_during_my_birthday_vacation_this/,Decided to drink during my birthday vacation this week,"Before I left for our trip, I hit 200 days. For a about a week leading up to the vacation, I was toying with the idea of having a glass of wine or two with dinner each night to see what it would be like. Wine had always been my beverage of choice and what I would crave when the cravings hit over the last 200 days. We were heading to the Disney parks for the week and it’s currently Food and Wine Fest in Epcot, which just sounded so delicious and fun.

On the first night when we arrived in town, I ordered a glass of Chardonnay with dinner. I was surprised at how much it tasted like alcohol instead of the fruity and buttery flavors I remembered.  I actually didn’t care for it too much which felt strange because it was a brand that I used to really enjoy.

The next day, we did Epcot all day. Each country had a different wine, beer or cocktail that you could try. It was so hot all day, all I wanted to drink was water but I did try some of the food. That night, we ate dinner in Mexico in Epcot. I ordered a glass of Malbec with my meal and really liked it. One glass was more than enough and I was content after the meal (normally I would have had at least one or two more glasses).

On the third night, we were tired from the day at Magic Kingdom and ordered pizza and soda delivery to our hotel.

The 4th night was my birthday dinner. Since we were at an Italian restaurant, I wanted a glass of Chianti. The server talked my wife and I into getting a bottle saying that we could take whatever we didn’t finish with us. We each had about 1.5-2 glasses from the bottle. Unlike the other night when I’d felt content with the one glass, I felt buzzed and anxious. I didn’t like the way I felt. I guess, in the past, I would normally glide right past this feeling by drowning it with more wine. At the end of dinner, there was still about 1 glass of wine left in the bottle and I told my wife that I didn’t want to take it with us because I didn’t want to be tempted to drink it later that night or the next night.

The last night, I opted for soda. We got home from the trip tonight and I requested a badge reset. I feel like the last few days were very enlightening and I don’t regret my decision to give it a try. I think I had romanticized the wine so much in my head before the trip and it was interesting that actually drinking it wasn’t as fun as I’d remembered. 

My 200 days of sobriety before this little experiment were pretty darn good. There were lots of tough days and a ton of anxiety, but waking up sober every morning made it worth it. But there have been some times lately where I was at a restaurant or in a social setting and observing others enjoying a glass of wine. I would watch them and be so jealous. The wine looked so good. Now I know that I really have nothing to be jealous about. Instead, I’ll enjoy my meal, the company I’m with and revel in the experience. 💕💫",83

For the last 3+ years I’ve been in a volatile, unhealthy, and unsustainable relationship. Despite intense feelings of love for one another, we both hurt each other a lot and had no real future together. Yet we could not seem to let each other go. Every time we fought or “broke up” (almost always while I was drunk and angry/impulsive) we’d just come running back for more, the passion would reignite, then rinse and repeat on this destructive and toxic cycle.

I’ve known this deep down a long time, but in the past I would always drink it away to numb it, to distract from it...everything but actually deal with the situation.

Getting sober and making positive changes in my life over the last 6 months (i.e., learning how to actually FEEL my feelings) has led to a lot of honest reflection. It brought me to today, when we finally faced it head on like people who care about each other. We acknowledged how much we’re hurting ourselves by staying in this, and together agreed to let each other go our separate ways.

My heart feels broken, but now that I’m out from under the haze of alcohol I know this is the only way forward.

By uttering this into the universe, I’m hoping to actually be able to appreciate this pain of letting go as a gift to myself in celebration of 6 months. I’m trying to tell myself I deserve it.

Headaches, fatigue, sinus issues, feeling dizzy, foggy thinking, nausea - the wildfire smoke really reminds me of that feeling when you wake up from a heavy night of drinking, hungover and still feeling buzzed. I can barely focus on work. I can't believe I ever willingly made my body feel this way, just to have 20 minutes of a dopamine buzz. 

Wish I could say the smoke would vanish after a day or two, like a hangover, but I think we're probably facing another month of this here in California. As much as it sucks to be experiencing this, I'm still glad that I'm sober in dealing with it. IWNDWYT",14

Today marks 2 things to me.... it's my 25th day, so my 24th not waking hungover, wanting to die, searching for a drink to take the edge off, the day after I said enough is enough after finishing my 2nd bottle by 5pm and refusing to go out and get a 3rd..... It wasn't a pleasant morning, but it was the first step to here. My sober streak prior to this one (start 29/6/20) I had 23 hangover free days before saying fuck it! I didn't jump straight back into daily drinking, but it only took about a week, the first day I tried to 'enjoy' just one bottle of wine, woke up thinking I feel ok, let's do it again, woke up feeling like shit, had 2 bottles, woke up feeling like hell, went a few days without then back into it... most of us know how it goes! So I'm sooo happy I've surpassed that, I'm not leaping tall buildings, but very grateful for a clear head, being able to look my kids in the eye & just feeling more at peace with myself.

It also marks 15 months since I last did an inpatient detox..... as a frequent flyer they refused to take me until I found a rehab also, which took months, months of drinking and hating it, just waiting, wondering if I'd die before I got in. Well that was my last sober streak of note... around 6 months, I'm not sure exactly when I started up again, but it was around the xmas period. I felt great, but in rehab, you live in a bubble, and despite what I thought I weren't prepared for the real world. But I did learn a lot. I also learnt that I can do sober & happy & all the other positives it brings.

I am feeling a lot more confident in myself, and ready to start tweaking my life to enjoy sobriety again.... I think until now I was nervous of relapsing so too scared to really be proactive and move forward.I know my triggers and weaknesses - I'm sure more will appear, but I have to start living instead of waiting to fall.

I can't explain my gratitude in finding this sub.... You all have literally saved my life! I'm not going anywhere, and I'm not going to become complacent, but I am going to start to explore all my opportunities, without being dragged down by a toxic liquid that stole so much from me!

Sober on friends!

For those who haven’t watched it’s about a group of older woman who go to Napa Valley. I found the movie very triggering it wasn’t the wine it’s self it was all the woman laughing and drinking together. I decided right then I was going to drink again on a trip with my friends. 

Then I thought about it more I realized that alcohol always does look fun in movies and that I have had fun while drinking. But if I were to go on a trip and drink. The next week I would be hungover and anxious. I also thought about all my health issues and how I shouldn’t drink. I’m glad I watched the movie on my way down. Because now I’m in my favourite city which I love to drink in and I have no urges. I already thought about while watching that movie. I decided to drink in the future and talked my self out of it.

""If this is what I have to deal with, then fuck it""

Years earlier he had volunteered to be a fire captain, so had a flashlight and knowledge.  His story (on NPR) was carefully told. The pivotal point: two strong nudges from invisible forces. Do this. And he did.  The first led him to a downward stairway, not the one he had intended to take; the second not to follow the insistant heavy-set woman, who said there was no way to go down. He heard a voice on the other side of the stairwell wall and squeezed through a space by doorframe. Looking back into the stairwell, he saw the people he had been leading down the stairs follow the heavy-set woman up the stairs they had just come down. He and the man he rescued did the seemingly impossible, continuing down 80 flights of stairs, through rubble, leaving the building minutes before it collapsed. All those who had gone up were lost.  I think of the still small voice within and how easily it is vanquished by louder voices.  It has authority. It has a strong, clear direction. And it is so often ignored.

Long time lurker but I found this page after I decided to quit drinking last July and wanted to share my experience.

I always knew that I drank fairly heavily.  It started after I got back from Afghanistan in 2014 when I just thought to myself that I was blowing off some steam and just making up for lost time when I couldn't drink for 9 months.  6 years later I found myself going through about a half gallon of cheap whiskey every 3 days on top of drinking tall boys of beer.  I never drank at work or when I had to perform any duties however once I was on my free time, I couldn't even make it from the parking lot to my apartment without downing a 24 ounce can or two of beer.  

Last July I went to the doctors for a blood test which I had been putting off for years.  My wife and I are trying to have a baby so I started going back to the doctors for any tests which I need.  2 weeks after my blood test I received my results.  My doctor was shocked to see that my AST and ALT levels which measure fatty enzymes in my liver were elevated well above 400.  The cut off is 40 so that means that my levels were 10 times higher than normal.  Of course, as with any health screening, I down played my drinking to ""casually,"" meaning 1-3 drinks a week.  That was the moment that I decided to stop drinking.

I can honestly say that with motivation and determination I was able to abstain from alcohol which I am still doing to this day.  After not drinking for a month I went back into the doctors for another blood test and an ultrasound for my liver.  Last week my doctor told me that as a result my AST and ALT levels dropped  back down into normal range in the 30's and that my liver didn't show any signs of cirrhosis or scarring.  Other panels on my blood screening also dropped as a result of quitting drinking.  I was motivated to keep off the alcohol before getting tested again, but the positive results are what's keeping me from not drinking.  

Thank you for reading and I wish everyone the best of luck and to keep staying positive.",3

Reflecting on my last sober stint, I see that I still missed alcohol. Even as happy as my sober life was, there was still the sense that something was missing, to reward myself or during social events. I know that's a lie, and i want to change that pattern of thinking.

I’ve been drinking heavily since I was 18 years old (I’m 31 now). I have been drinking less than before over the past few years due to getting out of the restaurant industry and also meeting my fiancé who is a “normal” drinker- he only has a beer or two here and there. However, I was still drinking way too much and massively looked forward to drinking entire bottles of wine to myself on both Friday and Saturday nights. I also hung out with old friends from the restaurant scene this summer, and blacked out both times. I promised my fiancé this would never happen again, as it really disappoints him and I end up terrorizing him when I am blacked out. He is so patient and kind and does not deserve that. Low and behold, I went out with a friend this past Saturday and blacked out AGAIN. Clearly I do not know my limits and cannot control my drinking. I woke up feeling SO sick and wasted a whole Sunday laying around and traveling to and from the bathroom to throw up. Not only that- it turns out I walked home by myself for 30 minutes in a town I just recently moved into. I apparently showed up at home at 1 am with my hands bleeding. I do not remember a single second of the walk. I terrified my fiancé, and the next day he told me I could’ve been raped, kidnapped, or had fallen into the street in traffic. This time, I know I have to change. I don’t know what my plans are, if I am going to take a long break or stay sober forever. For now I’ll take it one day at a time. So thankful for this community, you guys are my inspiration and motivation. I will not drink with you today.",46

I had a dependency on marijuana for about 2 years, and I managed to quit that about 3 months ago. However, I think I’ve just replaced that habit with drinking. I drink anywhere from 3-10 “shots” worth of rum or vodka daily. It started out with just wine, but now I’m here.

I recognize the problem, and I know I have a substance abuse issue just generally, but I don’t know what to do. I’m hoping this sub can help a bit.

Should I just cut cold turkey? Or should I taper off?",2

Have done periods of not drinking but tend to eventually slip back into drinking most evenings (several pints of ale or GnTs, or a bottle of wine). Have also had periods of extremely heavy/abusive drinking, most notably 2010-2013. 

2014: ALT 29, GLT 80

In Feb I got bloods done and as far as I'm aware everything else was acceptable except for my ALT and GGT - at least that's the only thing my doctor's talking to me about.

Feb: ALT 102, GLT 162

Since mid-Feb I've stopped drinking altogether and haven't even had much OTC (one painkiller and 2 antihistamines). I also gave up caffeine over lockdown for anxiety reasons.

Had ALT and GGT measured in June when I was in A&E for something else and they had both dropped, though were still not normal. 

June: ALT 42, GLT 103

But then had more bloods taken last week and now my enzymes are higher than what they were in February!! 

Sep: ALT 141, GLT 168

To say I was alarmed and angry is an understatement. 

GP thought I'd been drinking *more* over lockdown but the only thing I have done is put some weight on and eaten more convenience foods. And that's not changed that much since June, when my figures had dropped slightly. So I'm pretty shocked.

Getting an Ultrasound and full screen done by mid next month. 

However I'm really struggling with my mental health right now (feeling pretty worthless and like I've failed / fucked up my life indefinitely). 

Doc has prescribed me anti depressants because it's been pretty overwhelming but I've not taken any because I don't want to burden my liver if I don't have to.

I don't have any inclination to drink at all but I was hoping you guys might have words of understanding or positive stories that might help.",5

YES, in fact today, 9/11 is the 19th anniversary of my last one.","And so maybe worth noting and retelling...  It was 9/11/01 I had been sober for thirteen years and had not had a craving in a long time, things were going good. I had cleared the wreckage of my past to some degree, gotten a couple of promotions and had an office with  a window in lower Manhattan.

Heard the first hit, saw the second from 24th floor as we were watching the first building burn.  Fireball, shockwave, the whole thing. The smoke got sucked in by HVAC set off my building's fire alarms and they said ""get out.""

The streets were filled with people trying to move out of the area, silent for the most part - except for every siren in the world converging - and the people who stopped to watch the jumpers, screaming.  I made a conscious decision not to watch, remember saying to myself 'you don't want to see this' and am continually grateful I did.  

The streets there are pretty narrow and were filled with people moving away and then, off to the side, there was this hole in the wall bar, door open, neon in the window, dark inside - just the kind of place I had done some of my drinking - and in an instant I felt the ghost hand on my sleeve tugging me towards that open door and the escape it promised inside.  I knew that hand well, it had guided me into any  number of bars, liquor stores, drug dealers and other sketchy situations in the past.

An AA slogan hit home, ""one foot in front of the other"",  and I did, one step, two, three and quickly I and the crowd were beyond, and I was safe.  ""Holy shit""  it was a day of holy shits.

And then, fifteen years later on 9/11 I'm in the prison AA meeting I volunteered at telling this story and this guy, I'll call him Tim, shared ""nine eleven was the day I picked up - I had a year sober I went to the liquor store - and that's why I'm here...""  Some months later drugs, alcohol, and anger combined and someone died.   He's still inside, not getting out anytime soon.   That was another holy shit moment....",900

Definitely a wild ride of emotions but worth it. But I’ve been feeling a little off the last couple of weeks and I don’t know why. I don’t want to drink. I’m terrified of drinking actually. Last night I had a dream I drank. In my dream it was like someone else was controlling me. I reached for the glass of wine with old finesse but in my head alarm bells were ringing and I was screaming fuck no. I downed the glass and the shot of bourbon next to it (random I know, but this is a dream so who the hell knows) and immediately woke up in a panic. It took me a few minutes to calm down and remember I was safe, that was my old life and I never have to go back there if I don’t want to. 

If I don’t want to drink why am I feeling like this? It’s not that I don’t have cravings. A pumpkin beer in the fall sounds great. But I know where that will quickly lead and my nerves can’t take a trip back down that rabbit hole. 

I have been slacking on my running routine, which could be the cause of this slump. It almost feels like I’m stuck? Like nothing is happening. It’s a little depressing. After typing that out I’m realizing that nothing happening may be a good thing for a period of time, and maybe my sick brain is just used to chaos. And when there is no chaos, I inherently think something is not right?

It hit! As I was walking home there is a liquor store that I use to go to, I however walked across the road from the alcohol store and didn't even look at it. Once I got home I opened a bottle of NA cider and honestly it really helped with my cravings! I basically sculled the first bottle like there was no tomorrow and felt a bit guilty however triple checked it was definitely 0% alcohol before I took a sip. 

I hope this advice helps someone today/tonight because a part of me really wanted to just go buy anything and I thought about it and said no! Tomorrow is 2 weeks of being sober so not today!

Yesterday I played the tape forward and pictured waking up now and the expected memory gap. Whether or not I acted out at all is irrelevant (I usually didn't....I just didn't know one way or the other). The sheer fact I would be sitting here wondering would be increasing my anxiety.

When I was in the trenches, trying to decide, I came here and read a few responses to my messages and that helped too.  I have to say coming here and resetting my flair was a deterrent also, so you all helped keep me honest.

My last drink was 6 August 2018, and I currently live in a state where recreational marijuana use is legal. I’ve never really gotten high before, but I’ve given marijuana a try a few times — it’s nice, but, at the end of the day, I could take it or leave it. 

But, the thought of “is using marijuana at odds with my sobriety?” is something I can’t quite shake. My relationship with marijuana — at this very nascent point — does not, in any way, resemble what my relationship with alcohol was like, but I’m curious in others’ opinions. Does anyone have firsthand experience with this?

Thanks, all! Last thing I want to do is affect my sobriety, but it has been fun to, once a month, get a little high with friends while we’re playing Twilight Imperium! I can’t decide how I feel about it. Apologies if this is in any way triggering.",6

I owe everyone here an enormous debt of gratitude, especially those of you who moderate and help maintain this as the warm, palpable community it is today. I fully intend to contribute with more writing in the future.

But today I have a question I wanted to pose to the group:

I have been reading vigorously the recommendations here and elsewhere — first, Annie Grace, then David Carr, Caroline Knapp, and now Pete Hamill. For me, the most compelling approach has been Annie Grace’s suggestion to reverse the love affair with alcohol, to view it instead as an unpleasant chemical substance, to harbor animosity toward and wariness of ethanol. To call it a drug, rather than our society‘s euphemism “drugs and alcohol.”

With that said, I don’t wish for a world in which we impose prohibition on others and I’m happy for all those people who enjoy occasional drinks as a means to celebrate achievements and holidays. My spouse is one of those people, and her relationship with alcohol is almost always healthy and positive. For me, the most difficult component of abstinence continues to be the times when she wants to be alone with me and have a glass of wine or beer. To celebrate a promotion at work, or something as simple as us getting the kids to sleep early. Declining, and pouring myself a sparkling water instead, means that she won’t open the bottle of prosecco by herself, or continue to keep cold beers around for when she cooks on the grill (something rare and romantic for us). 

Basically, my decision to abstain seems to do collateral damage, it removes a simple pleasure that for her is not unhealthy or dangerous. She could drink alone, but I can see that is not enjoyable for her. She is supportive of my decision to abstain, but I feel guilty and, worse than the guilt, sadness when I see her choose water or nothing at all.

The question I wanted to ask is does anyone have experience or guidance that might help me better handle this situation?

Thanks in advance.",1

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

&#x200B;

So….I know you can’t see me, but I’m pointing my thumbs inwardly toward myself right now - and THIS Siren had a “shit just got real” moment at the gas station recently.

I’d been messaging with a friend whom I hadn’t seen in a long time.  We’d been having a great conversation in the weeks or so prior - but in the last few days they’d been acting distant, which was unlike them.  In the course of our conversation, a couple of details in what they’d said didn’t match up - and it suddenly hit me: *they were blowing me off.*  It wasn’t a bold lie, just a little white lie, perhaps - but a lie nonetheless - and in that moment of realization, I was fucking *pissed*.

Now I’d like to be extremely clear on something: I’m not so 'holier than thou' or above judgment when it comes to lying.  I’ve lied many times in my life …. but particularly in sobriety, I’m making a point to be honest not only with others, but also with myself. It’s critical to my success as a non-drinker and to the relationships I create and maintain. In this scenario: because I’d been going out of my way to be available for this person, and not only were they *not* responding in kind but also *lying* to me about it, I felt very betrayed and very hurt.

So I’m standing there in the middle of the gas station, phone in hand, staring at the screen and thinking “this is *fucking bullshit*""  - tears sprang to my eyes but I wouldn’t cry…instead, my face flushed with heat and my chest tightened.  Now, I felt anger.  (Mind you, this is all happening in the span of a few seconds)  I spotted the bottles of travel-sized liquor by the register and thought “to hell with this, I’ll just drink” - but if I was gonna drink I wasn’t going to waste my time on some tiny-ass shooters, I wanted to really *feel* it.  I walked around to the back of the cashier’s island where they kept the liquor, and put my hand on the sliding glass cabinet door. Now, in addition to anger, I felt spiteful.  Fuck that person, fuck everybody, just…GAHHH.

And then I stopped.

It was the closest I’d come to slipping since I stopped drinking.

I played the tape forward in my mind, forcing myself to think of the consequences if I chose to drink, and of the things I stood to lose.

&#x200B;

Was I willing to trash my precious, hard-earned sobriety just because someone else was being a shit?

*No*.  In fact, I’ll say it a little louder not only for the people in the back, but also as a reaffirmation to myself:  **HELL. NO.**

&#x200B;

For a fleeting moment, I felt disappointed in myself because I almost let it happen - but I took a breath, and remembered:  I’m human. I’m not perfect.

Humans make choices every moment of every day.  And while I let my emotions get the best of me for a second - instead, I chose to do the next right thing.  To not drink.  And I will always have the power to choose when it comes to my sobriety.  *My choice* to drink, or not to drink.

I choose not to drink.

——

Every day, people share their stories here - brand new members, seasoned veterans, and all points in between.  Based on a lot of the comments I’ve seen this week, and also individual posts outside of the Daily Check-In, here are a few things to remember:

* If you slip up, and drink, it’s not the end of the world.  Most all of us have been there - and some of us, numerous times...including me.  Forgive yourself, pick yourself back up, dust off, and come back here knowing you will always be welcome here.  Never quit quitting.
* If you don’t have a “toolbox”, or a list of resources to draw upon mentally/physically when presented with trigger situations, you’ll want one. In fact, [**here’s a fantastic, extensive list of tools**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/i3e1px/one_thousand_days_here_are_my_tools/) from our very own u/SaintHomer.  Pick and choose whatever you like, find what works for you, use them often, and have them ready because at some point, you will need them…just like I did.
* Figure out what your triggers are, then avoid them if you can.

&#x200B;

So I’ll ask you, Sobernauts:  what tools do you rely upon, to help to get through tough situations?  Feel free to share below; your answer may just resonate with someone else and help them through a rough spot or trigger as well.  And that’s the beauty of SD… we’re all in this together.

&#x200B;

Happy Friday, everyone.  I promise tomorrow’s check-in will be MUCH lighter… ‘cause it’s the freakin’ weekend, baby!

Last attempt to quit for a while i had a major depressive episode on day 4 so hopefully this time goes more smoothly. I’ve told people about my decision this time and my boyfriend also wants to quit for a while so I have more support than before.

I'm on day ten without a drink. I've been worrying about my drinking on and off for years. Alcoholism and alcohol-related deaths run in my family and my alcohol intake has been steadily increasing in frequency and volume. The last few weeks (or more? hard to say) of covid involved daily drinking, earlier and earlier in the day. It never interfered with work or responsibilities. But, when I tried to cut down or institute rules like ""I'll only drink on weekends"" or ""I'll only drink to be social"" I always ran into huge amounts of angst and failure to stick to whatever limit I'd come up with.   


Now that I've just cut it out until further notice things I have way fewer issues. Not NO issues. I've only been dry for one weekend so far, which involved a lot of cravings and discomfort and sadness. Presumably that's going to crop up again. But that all passed a lot quicker than when I was trying to stick to rules on consumption. It felt doable.  


I have a weird sense that because I'm not struggling that much, I must be overreacting. If I was dealing with cravings every day it would at least confirm that I'm right to take the drastic step of giving up alcohol. But since I'm not struggling, does that mean I'm just blowing things out of proportion when I am drinking?   


It seems wild to me that abstinence would be less fraught than moderation.  Or is this all just early days stuff? If abstinence gives me more peace of mind, on balance, than trying to cut back or drink normally, does that mean I should suck it up and give up drink forever? Does anyone else have thoughts on this stuff?",8

I spent every penny I had, and lost my wife, who was the love of my life. I tried many times to stop, but I just couldn't do it. She stayed with me way too long, but finally cut ties in January 2019. I drank and used to cope with that, and I don't know if I ever fully processed the pain. I was bitter and angry for a long time, and I blamed myself but also found ways to hate her. I think it was just self-denial. I couldn't face all the pain at once, so I pushed it to the side. Now I've been sober for almost 6 months, and my life is starting to take shape again, slowly but surely. I'm proud of myself, and with the help of therapy I have been on the right track, which feels really good. 

Yesterday I learned that my ex has not only moved on, but she is in a very serious relationship for which she moved across the country. They are apparently raising a kid together. I knew this would happen eventually, but the reality of it hurts like hell. I feel like the real me disappeared for a few years, and when I got sober and ""came to,"" I'm missing my best friend. I haven't spoken to her in over a year, and the last things I said to her were bitter, hateful, and caused her to never talk to me again. I don't know how to get closure. I thought I was mostly passed this, but I'm not even close. All I want to do is call her and tell her that I'm back, but I know that isn't an option. I don't know if she hates me, but it's possible.

You can replace the female pronouns with whatever you'd like ;),"Beautiful girl, when you are finished falling, after you hit rock bottom and watch yourself come apart into a million pieces, no one is staying to help you collect yourself, no one is sticking around to pick through your pieces to decide which parts of you are worth keeping. That’s for you to decide. So stay down for as long as you need to. This is the most important part. Take your time. Pay attention. You already broke. So the easy part is over. Go slow.... I know, you thought the breaking was the most painful chapter. It wasn’t. Turn the page. The next part is much longer. It’s the healing. The rise. The comeback. It’s the birth of the new you. And it’s not easy. But you are strong and brave and worth it. You’ll have to leave a lot of yourself behind, you’ll have to let go of all the parts of you that you’ve outgrown. We’re not making ourselves small anymore. We’re not bending to fit where we don’t belong anymore. Do you hear me? We’re going all in. Count your wounds, every scar ripped open, every drop of blood you bled like a promise, every tear you cried like a bet in the name of crossing your whole heart, your whole soul, was all for this moment. Right here. Right now. You had to hurt like that to get here to this version of you who knows exactly who she is, who she’s not, who she will never be again.  Drop the apologies, babe. We’re not sorry anymore for who we are, we’re not sorry for what we had to do to get here, and we’re not sorry for the time it took to learn our worth. Step out of the box of all you were supposed to be, according to everyone who wasn’t you, and walk into the you, who’s comfortable in her own skin. It’s time. You earned it.  We no longer wear the expectations of anyone else and we no longer let anyone else decide what we’re worth. Because we know now.  We finally know.  
And now it’s time to celebrate it.  
Get up, babe. It does not hurt anymore. 
Now go show YOU what you’re made of.

Feeling super blah tonight. 

I think I’m a little extra bummed about 9/11 tomorrow. I know it’s been almost two decades but I’m very empathic and easily feel the heaviness from sad things even if they happened a long time ago or far away. I think this year’s sadness is elevated by going through this pandemic. 

Anyone else feeling blah tonight? Or just off?

Not drinking and full of comforting Ben and Jerry’s ice cream, so at least there is that :)",13

After reading everyone's replies, seeing how many people relapsed, I decided to talk to my spouse about my decision to quit drinking. Because really, he is going to be dealing with both the negatives and positives that come with me becoming sober. Before my post, I wasnt go to tell him, I was just going to go it alone. 

I'm really surprised about his response. He doesnt need me to quit. He needs me to just cut the drinking down. And by down he means from 2-3 cases of beer a week, to 1 a month. And here is where I'm torn. 

My first thought was...oh I can do that. I'll just save up for when I have a bad day, or in social situations. This is even more doable now. My second thought was well I started the slope to here by starting to binge drink, so maybe not such a good idea. 

Did any of you use the cut down route prior to quitting? Did it work out for you? Or did it lead you right back into the daily drinking? 

I am on day 2 of not drinking. I'm going to do day 3 tomorrow. 3 is the longest I've made it anytime I tried to quit before.",5

I 25/m, was biking about 35-45kmph and his speed was at least 50k maybe more like 60 so he would've been doing 25-30k about faster than I was and I was forced flying into a tumble/summer-sault/barrel-roll over my helmet mulitple times over. My Bike was completely destroyed and My Helmet (saved my life) was scratched up pretty badly. 

I got up, ran about 100 yards to the driver who then treated my injuries with a firstaid kit. He, also 25/m, initially was going to drive me to the hospital himself, but then I noticed I was bleeding hard from both my legs and panicked so immediately pulled over and got out his first aid kit, I then put The 9-1-1 Operator on Speaker with My Phone with Him giving better information on what had happened as I had a lot of shock and adrenaline at the time. 

The Police and Ambulance arrived on scene at 7:18am (Time Of Accident/9-1-1 Call 7:07am) I was then immediately taken to local Hospital via Ambulance, I suffered lacerations to both calfs, Surgery required on my left and still needed stitches for the right too and had a broken right collarbone with large road rashes all over my body. 

I Survived The Accident and part-way through the recovery stage quickening by day. It'll be about 6-8 weeks before I can play any sports. 

I thought I would take this opportunity to give up alcohol as well Even though Alcohol had nothing to do with the accident (never of us were drinking and it was 7 in the morning).

I still thought giving it up the bottle for as long as I can go would be great because I get sick to the point I can't keep fluids down and I dry heave after meals with poor alcohol consumption. 

I thought it was for the best I give up alcohol while I can, It will also help quicken the recovery progress.",13

I'm almost four weeks in to my first semester of veterinary nursing school. It's brutal, but having it as a constant distraction usually helps keep the urges away. This week I had a test in two classes, my first round of clinic rotations, and a two-hour therapeutic nutrition seminar. After I finished up for the day I felt a really intense urge but I managed to get through it. 

Aside from the occasional craving here and there, I've been having really intense and vivid dreams every night. When I wake up, they always scare me but by the time I calm down and get my bearings I seldom remember them. The few that I do remember are always relapse dreams. But with two exceptions they're never about booze, they're always about some drug that I haven't touched in almost 13 years like coke or heroin. 

I've been on and off therapist couches since I was 19, so I know myself pretty well, or at least better than I used to. I need some kind of creative outlet to blow off steam and center myself. Before Covid got bad and school started eating up all of my time I used to play music at whatever coffee house would have me. Since I can't do that for the time being I'm going to try writing again. I've started journaling again since the dreams started. Maybe that will get the writing juices flowing.",6

I'm 8 days in, and it's been a hard stretch. More than usual when getting back on the wagon. Usually for me my cravings hit a flatline after one or two days sober, but this time they just haven't let up. This is especially rough because of the temptation to ""start over"" and hope that the next try is easier. But, as I'm sure you all would agree, that would only deepen the hole. That said, I feel like every night is the night I relapse.

​

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for, but I'm hoping I'm not the only one who has experienced this. And hoping that I keep proving myself wrong.

Surrounded by heavy drinkers on both sides of my family, me having a couple of drinks occasionally never seemed to be a big issue. I didn't do shots, and I never finished a six pack or full bottle of wine in one sitting. I also never blacked out or even drank enough to be completely hung over the next day. I was a ""social"" drinker, I coyly admitted if ever asked.  Socially drinking progressed to solo drinking, but it was ok - I'm not a very social person anyway, and grownups are allowed to imbibe. I drank wine or beer while cleaning, helping the kids with homework, after a long day at work. Still just a couple of drinks. Besides, I am generally very healthy. I eat pretty well and exercise often. As I've gotten older, I've noticed that drinking even just a little noticeably affects my energy levels and workouts. So I shifted to only drinking the nights before I planned to exercise. A couple of drinks progressed to a self-imposed maximum of 4. I was careful to not overbuy to keep to this limit, and would carefully check the alcohol content on the wine or beer I was purchasing for maximum impact per serving. In the back of my mind, I knew that consuming only a couple of high-octane beers wasn't significantly different from downing a multipack of low alcohol domestic brew, but it's only two, or four I told myself. Often, I would just decide I was done with drinking. There was no specific trigger for this, other than waking up with low motivation and finally realizing (again) that my relationship with alcohol was - is - problematic. And then I'd find myself heading to the store again on a non-workout night. When the pandemic hit, I allowed myself to wallow in misery and upped the ante with hard liquor. Just a couple of shots here and there. Oh yeah, I don't do shots, right?  About a month ago, I found this subreddit and began lurking. ~~Three~~ Four? weeks ago, I committed to not drinking again, knowing there were two tall cans of good IPA chilling in the fridge. I l had purchased those, along with 4 other cans, during another dreamlike trip to the store a few days before, almost instinctively giving in to a craving that was becoming increasingly difficult to continue pretending didn't exist. I happily posted ""IWNDWYT"" as I committed to stop drinking for the first time ""publicly"". I lasted a week. On the 8th day, I drank the two beers in the fridge, very disappointed in myself, but not surprised.

I've been back for a couple weeks now. Zombie bot keeps notifying me of the count, but I'm really not keeping track. I'm holding myself accountable by making this post. Also to share - as many of you already know - that alcoholism is not always recognizable. A person doesn't have to be falling down drunk, have blackouts, or drink excessively to have a problem with alcohol. Alcohol is problematic for me. The stories and posts you have all shared have given me the courage to admit this and IWNDWYT. Thank you!

I sat back down with it for around 20 minutes, smelling it, thinking about the excitement of downing it, considering my behaviour when drunk, considering how it wouldn't just be one drink.

Football and alcohol are very intertwined in my life. On Sundays, I would start drinking around noon when the pregame shows start. I'd pour a rum & coke (2 shots per glass) while chopping up veggies or rolling up deli meat snacks to munch on during the 1PM game. I'd usually be starting drink #3 when kickoff happens - it was my ritual to drink a sip while the kickoff was in the air as a way to kick off the day of football.

I'd drink about 4-5 drinks (8-10 shots) during the pregame and first wave of 1PM games. I'm usually passed out around 5PM - midway through the second wave of games. Wake up to have dinner, and start drinking again while watching the SNF pregame show, and pour drinks #7 & 8 (shots 14-16) for kickoff of the night-time game. I'd then head to bed around 11 and usually be hungover like a champ on Monday morning. 

Tonight, I have some sweet tea, a huge bottle of water, and my veggie & deli meat snacks. But no rum. It might be a little weird at first, but I'm feeling so good right now being sober I don't want to ruin this. 

So here's to the return of the NFL - and to staying sober! IWNDWYT",49

Better overall, still not perfect, knowing through several long sobriety stretches weeks, months and once 2 years long, I can manage to not ingest poison. 

That said, I'd be lying if I didn't admit concern for the long-term. I have all the motivation and plans to stay off the sauce, and the fact is, the window for me coming out of a binge of any length without major chronic health issues is narrowing. This last time was the worst withdrawals ever. I can't keep doing this.

That said, I'd like to transition from reckless boozebag to funtional non-bored, non-boring human without a stop off at church mouse, addicted to smoking, or preachy AA douchebag. Couldn't swing it last time, and now I've got no choice. 

I gained a little experience last time, but it was pathetic, and far more existing than living. Eventually said fuck this, it's my life, and opened up the old carnival box again. Booze was the only way to a decent social life, any dating life, and the vast majority of prospects in music, production and other work endeavors. 

While I am encouraged by the few stories on here of long-termers going from down and out to decent career, spouse, family, picket fence, etc, that type of stability just seems impossible considering people's lack of response to me outside of drinking environments. 

Typically I'd go over this in a therapy/group therapy/addiction treatment setting, but, you know, COVID = no income, no health insurance, no non-AA evidence-based groups (that are non-deadly to be part of). So I figure this is my best shot for now. And, not for nothing, this sub seems to have a high success rate and none of the above strategies had an answer last time, so why not try here?",1

I went to Little Caesars and got a cheap greasy pizza that made me feel better for exactly 5 minutes before making me even more nauseous. But I knew that all of those feelings had been coming, because I planned for my 24th birthday to be my last huzzah with all of my favorite drinks. And it was horrible, I made one last fool out of myself, but that was okay too, there had to be a 'last' time. I spent so long drinking around work and college that it was pretty much the only hobby I had left.

Now at 25, my favorite drink is honey lavender tea and most days I meal prep the night before (although I do give into little caesars every now and again). I started doing yoga and got back into crafts and I am so incredibly happy most days which is a real shift from before. I sing in the car very loudly and take time out of my day to help others. Most of the things I fill my life with now are not compatible with drinking. I make a fool out of myself in other ways, sure, one time I forgot that Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Pennsylvania aren't three separate states.

Climbing a small flight of stairs is doable, but my legs feel week and shaky. I have also put on about 50 pounds, so I don't think it's the typical malnourishment. I know I should have tapered off but I didn't. The first few days I felt hot, sweaty and overall bad. Fast forward 11 days, my legs are still feeling weak and shaky. I had an EMG recently for an unrelated reason, so I know I don't have nerve damage. There was also no permanent muscle ""damage"" in my legs which is good I guess.

I am adamant for now about not drinking and prepared for ridicule, but I am a bit afraid I will falter like I often did or just avoid the situation altogether. But maybe the morning after will be cozy and nice instead of a hangover. Wish me luck!",1

I was back in the past wakeing up early but feeling sick, I was hungover, frantically flipping through the photo's/ video's/ calls and texts on my phone to try and remember what happened last night. In reality the bed is heavy with my husband, so my dream brain created a video of him begging me to go home long after the night out was over, complete with me justifying why we needed to search for more beer at stupid o'clock in the morning. 

This was a dream, a nightmare. I haven't had there regularly and I woke up frightened that I had destroyed my relationship by drinking again.

 Yesterday my brain said once again maybe if you stay sober longer you'll be able to drink again one day. I know that's not true. That was my down fall on my last long stretch of sobriety. That's what other people without problems with alcohol say to me. 

I'm edging closer to a year of sobriety now. Prior to this I had a 6 month lesson teaching myself what I already knew, i can't drink like 'normal' people. Then before that I had just over a year sober. I won't make the same mistake again, I will learn from my experiences. I'm happy I had this nightmare to remind me why I'm staying sober.",3

However, as nice as those first sips would hit, the fallout would be terrible, and wine won't fix any of this shit. I'll just feel disappointed in myself. 

The world feels like it's falling down around me. I feel my brain explode every time I think of the impacts of covid beyond my small little bubble. But drinking won't help any of that: this is one hell of a time to decide to get sober, but my god it would be shit with alcohol.",17

Like, Wayyyyy Back.","Couple weeks ago, I said to myself, ""It's easy enough. I'll just stop drinking when I'm alone and only have a drink when someone else is in the room."" Two milliseconds later, I'm thinking, ""What the fuck did I just say? Hold on a sec. Might be an issue here."" That's when I gave it some thought and realized that since March, I hadn't gone more than 48 hours with a drink (or, more accurately, several drinks).

By my count, in that time I've gone through, almost entirely on my own: Around 8 handles of Wild Turkey 101, 10-12 bottles of wine, and literally countless beers (almost never less than 2 pints at a time). I think that's ridiculous for one person in about 5 months, so I decided to scale *way* back, because I'm not ready to quit completely.

Today marks three weeks that I've kept drinks to Saturday and Sunday only. Generally 2-3 beers a day with a meal, and/or one mixed drink. Might not be a huge thing to some, and in reading around here I know that many have given up more, but for me, it's been a big win.

The wife has also said she's noticed that I've stopped drinking during the week and she appreciates my decision. I hadn't specifically told her I was cutting back, I simply did it. But the fact that she noticed made me proud of myself that I did, but also embarrassed that it ever became something worth noticing.

A few times I was tempted for an afternoon Jack and Coke (while working from home) and one time watching a dinner scene in movie I got a major craving for some merlot, but I waited it out. Just wanted to share. Thanks.",222

After the initial relief of quitting I'm now pretty much back to my normal, which is feeling low and anxious most of the time. The mental health issues are still there, which are the main reason I drank in the first place, and I never found much that helps apart from drinking. 

It's been a while since the last time I tried to quit so I guess I had kind of forgotten what tends to happen, which is that it starts out ok then just gets gradually harder and harder as the strain of being ""on"" all the time starts to slowly grind me down. I've really wanted to get drunk for the last few days but I've been gritting my teeth and sticking it out - I feel like I've managed a couple of weeks sober and I should try and keep it going as long as I can, but I can tell I'm not going to last much longer.

I'm seeing a counsellor, and while it can be good to talk, counselling has never really done much in terms of helping me improve how I feel in general. I've been on a few different antidepressants and they also didn't help.

I'm still trying to make some changes to my life in case something makes a difference. I'm looking at moving, which I've wanted to do for a while, and I'm trying to find ways to open up to people a bit more. It just seems bleak though, I've been here plenty of times before.

During this quit however, things are not coming ""right back"". My brain still feels fucked and so does my stomach. I have been losing more weight when part of my motivation to quit was to get my appetite back....well that has not happened.

&#x200B;

I was already too small (ectomorph genes here.... I really struggle to hold on to weight) and felt that it must be the alcohol as it sometimes inhibits appetite.  I quit 2 weeks ago (when I was at 12 beers a day) and not only has my appetite not really returned, but without all those alcohol calories I am losing weight fast. I cannot afford this as I already look too gaunt. I have been drinking soda all day for the calories. I just hate eating I guess. Eating seems like a chore and I almost never get food cravings. It could be sweet , sour , whatever--eating just does not interest me that much.  I can eat one meal a day, the rest is just going to have to come from a liquid source. I cannot manage more food than that.

&#x200B;

The ""hungriest"" that I tend to get is being merely capable of gulping down something small. The rest of the time I am still dealing with an actual aversion to food. I will still look at something ""good"" and pretty much want to throw up.  My other GI symptoms have also not gone away. They have gotten a bit better, but the improvements seem to be stopping. I have taken prescription strength omeprazole everyday since quitting if that makes any difference. I am also managing a benzo taper as well so my GABA receptors haven't gone back to complete normalcy either. 

Before anyone suggests: I do not have a (psychiatric) eating disorder. I want to gain weight. All my issues are appetite related.

A little over and month and everything has been going pretty smooth. I've read posts about people having dreams where they are drinking after going AF and I thought to myself - interesting I haven't had one. 

Well, last night I had one. Sitting around a table with friends and family celebrating my birthday and I was drinking Crown and Coke. I had the similar experience of feeling bad in my dream for drinking and then waking up and realizing it was just a dream and relief set in and I fell back to sleep easily. ***\*\*Was this dream foreshadowing the day ahead\*\****

Fast forward waking up - I decide I should keep the momentum of getting my shit together by going to the DMV and taking care of my expired registration (its been an ongoing hassle for 3 months with multiple trips and I finally have all the documents I need) I check online to see what the wait was before committing to going...it said 15 minutes. 20 minutes later I'm pulling into a packed parking lot. I go online to ""check myself into line"" and it tells me the wait is now 4.5 hours. I'm not waiting 4.5 hours so I tell myself I'll come tomorrow first thing in the morning. 

I pull out of the DMV and within a tenth of mile from the DMV a cop on motorcycle pulls up behind me and throws his lights on. He proceeds to tell me he pulled me over for an expired tag which I proceed to tell him that I'm literally just leaving the DMV as he can see all the paperwork I brought to handle the registration on my passenger seat. He ask for my license I give him my license. He comes back and tells me that he is giving me two tickets. Expired registration and apparently (I had no idea) I'm driving with a suspended license! He was nice enough to let me drive home but like...FUCK!!!

So here I sit - annoyed as fuck and just wanting to have a drink or 6 six and just zone out for the day. I've read This Naked Mind and I know it's poison. I know the problem is going to be there after. I know I know I know. I'm not even craving the alcohol. I'm craving the zoning out for the day. 

I'm battling right now.",9

BUT this isn't about loss and death.  **This is about living**. 

And 3 months ago I took a really hard fucking look at how I was ""living"": 41 year old functioning alcoholic, out of shape, drunk, wife & mother to 3 kids under 10. Starting in the morning, or mid-afternoon if I could wait that long, drinking whatever amount was enough to put me out for the night, fully into the ""wine is mommy's medicine"" bullshit.  Waking up shaking and miserable, terrified of what I had forgotten about the night before, sick, tired, sad and ashamed. Just broken.

Being a functional alcoholic is bullshit because it's all about the ""yet"". I didn't crash my car, or get a DUI, or hurt anyone or anything (except myself), I hadn't lost my job, hadn't had anything happen with the 3 kids home, just getting through every day, a little nip at a time. 

See, my dad ***WAS*** the ""yet"". He kept going until he lost his job of 30+ years. He kept going after the motorcycle accident that broke 7 ribs (front & back), his elbow, his shoulder blade, and put him in a coma for a month. He kept going when he found out about the brain damage and finally left the neurological rehab center. He kept going when they lost the house. He kept going after he came into my work (his old work) drunk, fell and broke his arm 2 years ago. He kept going until his body systematically shut down on him within a 24 hour period and he died having no idea why. 

I know in my heart I am like him. He is my ""yet"" and I don't want to live or die like him.  I also don't want my children to go through even a small percentage of what we went through growing up.  

Here's what's helped me:  

Keep trying. Keep putting together little pieces of time that you don't  drink; try to wait until after 5pm, or then try a whole day, and then the weekdays. Have 100 day 1s. Just **KEEP GOING**. It's not about the long game right now. Don't drink right now. And if you want to drink in an hour, or a minute, remember HALT  (Are you Hungry, Angry, Lonely or Tired?)  And follow the thought through. ***IF*** you have that 1 drink, what then? Eventually, all those battles you win ALL day long becomes a whole day. And them another and  another.  Then a week, and then maybe a month, and then maybe 3 months. But it's never really about all of them stacked up, because all of us are still only trying to get through this moment.  

Right now, I don't want to drink. And I am grateful for that. I'm learning to be kind to myself and you should, too.  Every day is another chance for all of us to be a little better.  Thank you, SD.  IWNDWYT.",32

*Last updated on August 26, 2020*:

[By Lucy Rocca](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/wc/lucy-rocca)

I often wonder why it took me 20 years of heavy and frequent binge drinking to realize that I was poisoning my body and mind every time I downed a glass of wine.

Alcohol always seemed to be my ally, something to get me through the good times and the bad. I associated it with champagne in restaurants, red wine with meals, a cold beer on a hot day with friends in the garden.

I never blamed booze for anything. The problems in my life were always due to something else: an unscrupulous boyfriend, an unreasonable boss, a too-busy schedule that meant I deserved that relaxing bottle of wine each evening.

Today I inhabit a different world, a [sober one](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/ruby-warrington-on-aa-spirituality-and-why-everyone-is-a-little-bit-addicted-to-b), and I see the whole business of alcohol consumption differently.

Here’s what I think of my erstwhile friend, booze, after almost two years of shunning it in favor of a healthy and happy existence: *alcohol erodes your body’s natural ability to cope with difficulties in life, thus causing anxiety.*",22

I unfortunately have a high tolerance for alcohol (both genetic and because I've drank for as long as I can remember). My biggest problem is I can put down a 12 pack and keep on truckin. Most people say they don't even know I am drunk. 99% I never do anything ignorant or otherwise that would make me think I need to quick. I just don't want it anymore. I've got in a habit of picking a six pack after work and downing it while doing yard work or whatever. My primary goal is fitness and weight loss. At this point alcohol just seems to have zero benefit towards that so I would like to go at least a year without it. Big problem is I love football and drink ALOT during football season. Any suggestions or anyone else in a similar situation?

Side note- all my friends are heavy drinkers too so its going to be very weird telling them I'm sober. I expect to be bothered a lot but I don't give in to peer pressure at all so its not that big of a deal. Probably just annoying.

TL:DR Quitting for health reasons, want to lose weight etc, love drinking and watching football. Tips would be appreciated.",2

I’m loving my sobriety and have made huge improvements in my life, while my partner has..not. I don’t judge him at all for drinking while I’m not but it’s getting to the point where his drinking is disruptive to my life. Last night he came home after drinking with friends and was absolutely blackout belligerent. He woke me up, yelled incoherently at me, and then proceeded to throw up all over our bathroom (it’s still a mess). I made him sleep on the couch and this morning he didn’t even know why he slept on the couch. He thought he locked himself out of our room. Anyways, now I’m sitting here drinking coffee thinking about how I can talk to him about this. I wish my sobriety would inspire him to try it. It’s only been getting worse since we moved in with his brother.

This one lasted around a month. I tried so hard to stop, but I felt like I couldn’t. It got to the point where I could drink a lot, and I felt like it barely changed my state of mind. It finally came to a stopping point when my stomach started acting up again (gastritis). I talked to three different doctors. The first two were online consultations, but the last appointment was in person, and the doctor finally gave me the right combo of medications to make my stomach pain go away completely. I was in so much pain before, but I took two days off of work to rest. I felt like a brand new person after the first day. I’ve had trouble with drinking before, and the doctor usually recommends talking to a therapist, as well as stopping drinking. I always say that I will, but deep down I know that my words are empty, and I won’t follow through. This time, the doctor actually got through to me. She was really thorough and took the time to talk me through how the meds would help and what steps I should take to get better. I feel like it was the first time someone had actually taken the time to sit down and talk to me and make sure that I didn’t feel judged at all. Most likely going to switch to her as my pcp. I finally feel like my mind is clear, and thankfully, the drink has not been on my mind at all. I would always contemplate whether I should go to the liquor store after I went grocery shopping bc it was right next door, but those thoughts haven’t been on my mind. I’ve started exercising and eating more healthy lately as well, and I’m hoping I will stick with it. Right now, I’m just employing the one day at a time method in terms of drinking and health.

I just know in my gut that I'm done drinking. I really appreciate this group because reading all these stories about positive benefits from stopping drinking is really motivating.

Anyways, I work a somewhat stressful job. My supervisor game me an assignment a couple months ago that has taken forever for me to get through. He was being super harsh and intense about it. I wanted to pull my hair out and bang my head on the wall. Because of the nature of the assignment and the feedback on the assignment (notably, he thinks I'm great at what I do. I just got super frustrated), I would day drink while working and drink heavily at night. I've drank habitually too much before anyways, but it was just super exacerbated with this situation. I decided I need to pull back, so I did for five days. Then I was frustrated again and picked up a bottle of wine. I drank most of that in one night (I was proud of myself for not drinking more tbh). The next day I felt like crap. I got more comments back from my supervisor and finished the last bit of wine while working. I woke up the next morning with, what I would call, an emotional hangover. I was so frustrated, exhausted, etc. (I'm also pretty anxious about the state of the world). I knew that I HAD to push through that assignment that day, and for some reason the idea of working out came to mind. I have a gym in my building, and I hopped onto the peloton that morning even though I felt like crap. It was like flipping a light switch. Working out made me feel so much better and gave me the energy that I needed to get through the work day and finish that step of my assignment. I decided to give up alcohol because I realized that drinking helped me in NO WAY with anything going on. Drinking also stopped me from working out, and I decided that working out was helping me in a way that alcohol just couldn't. It's been 14 days. I feel like a new person. I've been working out before work every morning. I've noticed it's made a huge difference with my patience and resilience. I've been doing a good job at work (even working extra one day to push this last part of the assignment out). AND TODAY MY SUPERVISOR SIGNED OFF ON IT. IT'S OVER. THE PROJECT FROM HELL IS OVER. Thank you sobriety for giving me the strength to push through this project. I'm committed to my sobriety. Thank you SD family.",12

Hear me out.,"Ok a little backstory. I met my friend, let’s call him Eric, about 3 years ago when I started working with him at a restaurant. He was the somm, I was this assistant manager. Eventually he was the AGM, got fired for something stupid, I took his position. I have since also become a certified sommelier, song with our former boss. Anyway, when Covid started in March here, I was coming off of a 70 day sober streak, and had just told my boss of 3 years I resigned (finally). I worked briefly with my husband at another restaurant before the closed due to Covid, and have since gotten sober (103 days). 

In this time, we have been going to the liquor store Eric is now the wine manager (idk his actual title) at, and have remained friends with him. He knows I’m sober and have no plans on drinking. We’ve still frequented the store because they have the best N/A beverage selection. 

Eric texted me out of the blue last week and asked if I had any job prospects lined up for when I returned to work, and let me know he’d like me to do help with wine sales within their company. Again, not sure of the exact title, but this is a huge liquor store in the area that is growing rapidly. It would be a great way to utilize my knowledge, without having to be in a restaurant environment. I am looking to get out of the industry for a while for a number of reasons, but it’s also all I’ve done for half of my life (31F). This would be great for me as it would utilize a lot of my skill sets and the pressure to drink is not there. I love wine, and utilize spitting to taste when I go through sober streaks, and Eric knows and respects this. 

Overall, I feel more comfortable that I would be working under a friend I can trust and will respect my wishes. He’s also friends with my husband, in fact they’ve been friends longer.  I’ve also come considerably far in developing discipline this time around, something that was always lacking before.

Let’s see how this interview goes..

Thanks for reading, I just needed to get that out. I hope you all have a wonderful rest of your week, stay safe! IWNDWYT!",10

I use to drink, sleep like shit for 4hrs and be a zombie at work. Then I'd not drink the next day and stay awake all night, literally zero sleep and then go to work basically drunk off of zero sleep. I was moody and short with people and felt so terrible. I'd just lay in bed thinking about what my life had become, how much I hated myself and my actions. How I could do better next time...just to drink the next day to get some sleep. 

Now that I'm sober I can crawl into bed, smile at the warmth and comfort, say goodnight to my dog, and drift almost immediately into a deep restful sleep. I sleep so good I wake up groggy AF, but after about an hour I'm ready to tackle the day. Sleeps so damn important. 

I've been reading for the second time this book called ""The Upward Spiral"" and it's really pointing out how negative alcohol can be to your happiness. It creates a lifestyle thats nearly the perfect storm for depression. 

Anyways, hope you guys are sleeping well in your sobriety. Love.

In my teens and early 20s I was a party kid, binge drinker. However, I developed chronic pain 7 years ago which put an end to my party days and ever-changing medication regimens made drinking unsafe for me for some time.

However things changed for me as my health started to improve again. Last summer I went to visit my sister in her beach side tourist city. As we walked around in the sunshine we'd stop at some of her favourite watering holes (Brits on holiday, day drinking is basically mandatory) and I got a whole new perspective on the anaesthetic properties of alcohol. So I drank the whole long weekend I was with her. That summer became a blur as I found more and more excuses to drink. Not to get drunk, just a nice warm buzz. I could already see that this was headed in a bad direction but I was having fun and doing things I hadn't been able to do in half a decade so I let it slide for a little bit.

The turning point came one morning after one of these fun, chill summer weekends when I poured a bowl of cereal and found myself reaching for a bottle of gin to go with it. I've done day drinking but I've never been a breakfast drinker. My life, everything I could lose if I let this continue, flashed before my eyes. The gin went down the sink because I couldn't keep it in the house long enough to give it away.

I have drank since then but that was the day I knew I had a problem. I hope one day to be able to drink in moderation and I believe if my pain were better managed that might be possible for me.

Anyway, share time over for me, IWNDWYT!",9

My goal today is to identify - to see - to capture those moments when I become fearful, apprehensive, threatened, or irritated, and deal with those emotions when they occur.

The deeper I go into sobriety the more I realize that I have been using alcohol as my personal emotional crutch.  It has helped me hide from a challenging world.  My fears, and my understandable desire to avoid and get distance from those fears, have abetted my alcoholism.

I understand the need to focus on not drinking every day. And of course I will always do that to some extent.  But for me right now, it seems more important to get at one of the key root causes of my drinking.  

I need to feel better, stronger, and less anxious without alcohol.

My health was abysmal, I was vomiting almost every day, drinking from morning to night. Id start when I got up, nap from noon till late afternoon, wake up and kill a couple of bottles of wine. I didn't lie about drinking but I was trying desperately to hide the morning drinking and sheer volume. My liver enzymes were way off and I was so depressed I rarely got off the couch. I felt like I was staring into the abyss and it was definitely staring back. And the hangovers were something out of a nightmare. I dont know how people can feel like that and survive.

I got really serious about quitting last October. I began taking antidepressants and naltrexone. I've had to face some serious demons. And I've continued no contact with my family of origin because yes, they are that bad. It wasn't the booze speaking. 

By Christmas I was tired of quitting then relapsing and going off again on the drunk parade. I got very serious about it. Since then I've been sober almost continually. I've slipped a couple of times...if it was only a beer or two I dont reset. Ive had by far WAY more sober days in 2020. In fact I can count drinking days on 2 hands i think. I am happy and relieved.

So in the dream, my husband and I were getting ready to celebrate our upcoming anniversary (something I've been anxious about because we normally go out for a nice dinner and drink waay too much). In the dream, my sister, who I don't get along with very well, had organized a party for us....at a winery/beer garden. 🤦‍♀️

I was terrified! I didn't know what to do! It was this beautiful place with every type of wine and beer you can imagine, but I didn't want to stay because I was afraid I'd drink. So I went for a walk! During my and my husband's anniversary party! My husband stayed and drank and socialized with our friends and family. I felt bad leaving, but I was so worried I would drink if I stayed. 

When I returned, the party was winding down and my sister was pissed! She confronted me and told me how mad she was that I didn't stay. I was surprised by my response in the dream. I very calmly told her that I was sorry I upset her but that I was hurt that she chose this venue when she knew I had a drinking problem and had finally been successful at not drinking. I told her that I was doing this because I love my family and I want to be around and remember our happy times together. She had no response to that.

I walked away and surveyed the scene as I left. All my friends and family were there and wasted! They looked like zombies and I felt grateful that I didn't have to do that any more. Then, I bought myself a gourmet soda at a local grocery store to celebrate in my own way and met my husband back at our house. 

There were lots of other little weird details and it was so vivid and real! I woke up feeling as though it had actually happened and proud of myself for overcoming such a huge obstacle. IWNDWYT!",6

It was social lubricant. I thought getting wild & doing stupid stuff made me exciting. I know I could blow up my life in one night of drinking. I have no off switch. I could seriously injure myself or wind up dead in one binge. 

I have a child on the way, it's not worth it. I have a renewed sense of purpose. 

It's been 3 years of trying to abstain with some slips in-between. This time it feels different, I feel as though I can say no.

A year ago I ended a 15 year streak of drinking heavily followed by a six month stint of quitting for a few days and then drinking again.  It took me several tries to get to a year free from alcohol. So if you’re trying to quit, keep trying, you’re doing it right.  

A year ago I never would have imagined being able to get through holidays, celebrations, shit days at work, a fucking pandemic, or even a weekend camping without wine.  I was so certain wine could cure all my problems and make any celebration even better.  What I know now is that it made my life harder and I am stronger mentally and physically than I have been in my entire adult life.  

Today, my husband and I packed up our car with some belongings, our dog and cat and left the first home we ever purchased to the fates of shifting winds and a wildfire.  When we got to my friends house (my favorite drinking buddy I should add) to wait out the fire, I still didn’t drink.  I cried, I’m worried, and I’m grateful to be safe. Whatever happens to my house, I know I can get through it because I’ve got some practice at this sobriety thing and I’m one tough lady.

Finally, thank you to this community! I’ve read so many of your stories, successes and challenges.  They keep me sober and keep me hopeful.  I will not drink with you today.",25

I'm not convinced at all I will not drink ever again.  I didn't do any commitment at all, I just wanted to feel better for me and my kids. So far so good.   4 or 5 days without was my world record and it happened maybe twice in 15 years.

Every Wednesday out of two, I work late and come home at 23PM or something.  I always get drunk at this moment.  It was my first night shift since sober and I was there at work super pissed that I was out of 0 percent at home and was surely gonna hit those leftover beers.  Then I chose to just stay at work a couple more hours.  I wanted to be so tired that I would go straight to bed.

It may have actually been 28 days that last time. After those few weeks I dove head first back into the sauce. This time has felt really different. I haven’t had many cravings and those that I have had have been fleeting.

I think this is partly because this time around I really haven’t been enjoying drinking for a long time. The last cider I had, a day after I planned to stop drinking, really felt like a chore to choke down. I was literally drinking it because it was in my house and the addicted voice in my head told me I may as well have it because it would be a waste to pour it out.

I’m glad I drank it in a way because it was so miserable it made me realize alcohol is stupid and does nothing good for me anymore. 

But then today I had a counselling appointment for the first time in a while and it brought all my partially suppressed emotions boiling over to the surface. I felt sad and tired after the session. Then I heard this little voice in my head starting to get louder - telling me I’m doing well and seeing my therapist was a really great step. I talked openly at the counselling session about how alcohol is an avoidance mechanism for me and I want to face my problems head on.

That voice told me how I did such a good job facing my problems head on today that maybe I deserved a break. That I could just have a couple drinks and forget about it all for a night. Then I played the tape forward and realized that a few drinks tonight would mean amplified anxiety tomorrow. They would mean I wouldn’t be sharp for the presentation I have to give at work first thing tomorrow morning. 

Fuck you little voice. Fuck you alcohol. Not today. Today I had Doritos for dinner and got in bed at 8:30 pm but I sure didn’t drink and for that I can be proud. So this is just a reminder to me and whoever needs to hear it that whatever you’re going through - whether that’s anxiety and depression like me, or something else all together - booze will only make it worse.

Feel free to ignore everything below, it's mostly venting. I just need to write it down so I can see it. Thanks y'all, IWNDWYT.

---

I didn't think I had any problem with drinking. I would down a few with my friends at the brewery a few times a week, and we would push each other to stay and have another, or polish off that drink so we could all grab another round.

I would have 5-6 drinks and barely seem tipsy. I'm just one of those people who don't change much when they're drunk.

What I didn't realize is that the nights between socializing at the bar were also filled with booze. I was going through six packs 3 times a week, while ""treating myself"" to cocktails (just an excuse to take shots of gin and chase them with a g&t). 

Then covid came along, and suddenly I was only drinking at home. Only drinking alone. My girlfriend doesn't love alcohol, it gives her a headache, so we would share a glass of wine with dinner, then I would pound 3 beers and 2 old fashioneds, smoking weed between sips while she went to bed.

How could I not have realized this was unsustainable? I always felt like I was just trying to get a better buzz so my video games felt more fun. So that dumb movie was funnier. I had a hard day, why not have a few more? 

It felt so easy to justify. I'm well on my way to a PhD, could someone with a drinking problem do that? Yes. Fucking yes. In fact, it's almost definitely contributing to why I'm always so stressed. Why I feel like garbage in my morning meetings and can't think clearly all day. Why I feel incompetent.

I need to stop. It sucks to realize, but it needs to happen. Thanks for the stories here, you're all helping inspire me to live a better life.",15

But, guess what? It’s a good thing!","So as the title says, I was just informed that I have been given 30 days to leave my home. I am an older undergrad student (31) who found this house on craigslist over a year ago because renting the new room was crazy cheap and I was tired of the Oxford House I was living in. So, I, with barely a year sober, made the jump into Earth Person territory. It all fell apart for me mentally three days in. There I was, sponsorless, vulnerable, and in a strange home with roommates that drank booze like normal people. I caved, that’s when my active drinking revved up again.

I hid it for a long time. People reached out, but I ignored them. I was in a home with two strangers who drank and there I was, a lonely little goblin girl, thinking “I have a job and a car! I’ve made it! No rules! I’m on top of the world!”

But I was so, so alone. Oh, and in so much denial.

Fast forward about a year and a half. I finally told my family and that gave me the strength to get help. I detoxed and have been in an IOP for almost a month. I am trying to make meetings everyday and seeking a sponsor. I am actually taking the meds they say will help. I was finally proud of myself, until...

my landlord, who has been gone, approached me on the 1st of sept about if I knew “anything about” her liquor being watered down. of course i knew that I had done this, and had been carrying the guilt around like the globe of Atlas since I caved and drank her tequila. in my delusion i thought i would replace it, but sobriety took priority and silly me didn’t replace it in time. 

so we had a little roommate meeting today. I KNEW what was coming. my loved ones tried to calm me down and tell me not to expect the worst but I am very good at reading people. Even her stone face glare told me everything to know. We met together and my suspicions were right: because I watered down her liquor I was no longer welcome in the home.

Her house, her rules (even though she is in her mid 20’s, is clearly affluent and I have never heard her ever speak about having a job yet “owns a home”, but that’s really not my business,) so I get that in her limited life experience she must have some very... stereotypically negative views of alcoholics. She has told me that even letting me live here was a “risk” (i am a reserved, clean, respectful person even when drinking.) 

The most BIZARRE part though was the OTHER roommate who when I went to my notebook to ask questions I started with the FACT that the #3 killer in the U.S. is complications from addiction, lost her absolute mind. You see, I was trying to lead into the fact that my condition was very common and that it was pretty disrespectful to throw me out while I’m trying by best to get better, but this girl... holy hell. As soon as I calmly stated that statistic she started screaming in my face about if I was threatening them. (?!?) I calmly, yet wide-eyed from shock, asked what she meant and she stood and hovered over me while ranting that I was trying to manipulate them and that I shouldn’t play with the idea of mental illness and was asking if I was begging her to call the police and kept screaming “are you suicidal? huh? are you? don’t play around with that stuff!” (i am not, never was, and what in the absolute hell was that reaction!?)

so in an attempt to wrap this up, I’ll be here for a max of 30 days but will hopefully leave sooner. i went to a meeting immediately after and guess what? i told my story and people laughed and empathized and no one batted an eye about my plight. i was hugged and felt love and fellowship. I am truly blessed to be a recovering addict/alcoholic today because that judgemental shit looks so toxic and exhausting.",17

""I'm ok, it's just the weekends. Im ok I went 3 days without being drunk. I'm ok, I'm still completely functional drinking each night. I'm ok, because I'm not day drinking at work"". I knew I needed to quit, but I'd give into an urge day 1. And everytime I said ""that's it I quit"", and than drank again, I'd start drinking even more. 

2 weeks ago my barely adult daughter and I went camping for the weekend. And i watched that kid drink way more than I'd like to see. And when I mentioned it, she said it's ok, because she wasnt drinking before noon. And she only drinks socially and while camping. (Jesus, she is justifying it already). And I know that stems from growing up watching her drunk mom. 

Last weekend, i decided to have a talk with my SO, because he is always working. I havent seen him more than an hour a day for like 6 weeks. And I had had enough with not having a spouse, but a roommate. Turns out he is working so much, because he isnt happy at home anymore. And who can blame him? I honestly cant remember the last time I was sober for even a whole day. Honestly i wouldnt want to live with me either. 

So for the sake of showing my kids something different than a drunk mom, and that you can change.  And for the sake of my of my relationship, and just because I dont want to live like this anymore. I'm giving it the old college try. 

I am at day 1. I didnt give into the urge to buy booze today. I wanted to but I didnt. And normally the I want to, ends up with me buying it, even when i say tell myself I won't.

(I had been trying, unsuccessfully for about a month to get into a detox program but there are limited resources.) My doctor was horrified when he felt my belly and I was admitted immediately. At that point I actually passed out and didn’t wake up for four days. I guess I almost died twice during my detox. My liver was inflamed and I had pancreatitis. My liver very nearly shut down. I was intubated for two weeks and then kept for observation for another half a week or so. Released last Monday. 

The whole time I was in the ICU I just felt so bad for taking up resources for something I did to myself. The staff were all incredibly respectful and nobody ever made me feel bad, but I just have horrible guilt.

Now I’m back in the freaking ICU because my drinking made me develop diabetes, which I have to say my doctor did not set up a good plan to manage, and yesterday I went into diabetic ketoacidosis and have to be kept on a constant insulin pump and monitored 24/7. Once again my poor choices have me taking up a bed when there’s someone else who might really need it. The lady in the room next to me is recovering from a heart transplant.

This is the longest I’ve made it in two years. Two years of active sobriety attempts. This is so incredibly hard. 

Like the title says, every time I make it for longer than a week or two things get... sketchy. Every day blurring into the next like a long drawn out sigh. I feel like there is no relief, no pleasure. I’m so afraid I will never feel happy again.

I know booze is the enemy in this situation but I imagine how it would feel to sit on the couch, have a drink and engage in some old ritual. Something that used to be fun, and to feel it, really feel it. There are moments I enjoy, and some days are better than others. But I cannot seem to maintain. There is this constant underlying theme of fear, deprivation, and bitter struggle that I cannot shake.

God, I sound so whiney and dramatic. I hate it but I need to vent, and I’m hopeful that someone will recognize their own experience in mine and say “yes, it does get better”. Although, it gets better is one of those mantras so prolific that it’s hard not to be skeptical.

I know that I need to exercise, and do things I enjoy, and make the most of my time. When I have a long day at work I’ll bemoan the lack of free time to enjoy my activities, but any time I am not obligated to do something all I do is lay on the couch. And I nap, oh gods do I nap so frequently now. Not even physically tired but just so profoundly lacking in purpose or desire. Mentally drained I guess, for no apparent reason.

In the immortal words of Walter White I feel like “a walking dead man, just marking time” although this is not at all how he meant it. I just don’t know, man. I want to give up. I want to throw in the towel, tickle my brain’s pleasure center, and feel okay for one fucking night. I really don’t know if I can do this anymore. But I won’t give up, at least for tonight.

This is the most sober year I've had in the past.. 15 or so years.  I just turned 34 a few days ago.  For the first half of this year, I was good.  I had a few drinks in January, but didn't have a drop between February and May, and then I broke the seal in a huge way and had a 4 day bender.  It sent me to the hospital.

You'd think that ""Come to Jesus"" moment would do it.  And it did.  For a month.  Then it slowly started trickling back in; The bad habits, the secret drinking, the ""Don't be silly, you got this, just enjoy one more night"" and it accumulates over and over again.

I'm afraid for my health, for my life, for everything.  I live with my parents and I've been honest with them since I got sent to the hospital, and now the new stipulation is I need to do something like AA to stay with them, which is more than reasonable.  Which is one reason why I'm coming here.

Hi.  My name is P90Wreck, and I'm an alcoholic, and for as long as I can, IWNDWYT.

Im also happier now than ive ever been even when I lived on my own... On day 37... Last two days have been a struggle.. but not for wanting to drink,"Ive been trying really hard to get my moms house up in order as she has helped me through all my problems the last few years. During my transition period through drugs she helped me by letting me stay here. We went through a lot because of my sickness but if she didnt do what she did, id probably be dead.

Its because of this ive been actively getting her house to be in a place better than she has ever had it in. Shes never felt like the house she currently stays in feels like home. Ive been on a mission to change that for her as im leaving but things have kept happening the last few days... In the last two days ive spilled a gallon of paint on the floor, had an entire tube of molding explode on the floor, broke the washing machine and in the process of fixing it broke something more expensive in it. Broke a few decorations and dropped my phone and cracked the shit out of it.


Its been a brutal and challenging last few days as my intentions have been pure at heart have been met with road bumps. But as i was meditating after realizing my emotions were getting control of me, one thing i realized is during all of this... During every moment where i became frustrated and mad... Not once did i want to drink. Id yell, id cuss, id do some exercises, shit i even shed a tear during one moment i was so frustrated.... But not once did i say i need to drink.

Maybe it was something pushing all this on me to make me realize im able to handle more now. Still got some more work to do as im moving out of my moms but figured id share this with you all. 

Im no longer ashamed of my situation and am more blessed than most. I just wish i put my ego away awhile ago and realized i do not care what people think when they judge me for my situation. Im here and yet im smiling more now than ever. We are born alone in this world and we will leave this earth alone. Most see that as a bad thing but why does it have to be. It makes your moments now more freeing because like you on a vacation, you wont be seeing these people after the trip is over anyway so why not just enjoy yourself. The usual outcome being this way is you enjoy yourself more and people accept you more because they feel the energy off of you. They want that energy and will help grow you even more as a person. Those that judge poorly are secretly insecure and wish they could do what you can do.

Sorry about the last part just want to help people more :) hope you all are staying safe.",9

(Spoilers for Dr. Sleep and Among the Sleep)","The other night my husband and I played Among the Sleep. A horror game where you play as a two year old trying to find his mommy and horror ensues. It's a great game, but the final twist is that the mother is the monster, because she's an alcoholic. The creature coming for you is you drunk and/or hungover mother. I knew the twist going in, but my husband didn't.  We were also drunk. It killed me to play through that ending, as my youngest is turning two in a few days and I wonder if that's what he sees me as. He doesn't see me drunk, only hungover, but that's no excuse. 

Both my sons are toddlers and I don't want them to see me as a loving mommy one moment and a rampaging demon the next. I only want to be the loving Mommy, not a creature hunched over the toilet. 

Then a while later my husband and I watched Dr. Sleep, the sequel The Shinning. (Again, drunk) There is a scene early on where the main Character wakes up in a house next to a woman he doesn't know, to the sound of a baby crying. He puts the baby next to his mom and leaves. Find out later the mom was dead and the baby dies later because everyone was used to hearing him scream, so no one came to check. That killed me, that was the night my husband and I admitted our problem. 

I don't want those to be me or my children. And I hate that it was media that forced me to confront my failings. (Especially horror, a genre I usually take shelter in because it's so far from my reality). I am glad we were faced with it, in the ugliest way possible. We are still struggling, but everyday it seems more doable to actually not drink.",2

My growing negativity, cynicism, and pessimism were due to booze

I’ve been sober for 18 months today. The first 12 were super easy. It’s these last 6 that have been difficult. Not because I wanted to have a drink but because there were so many excuses; the economy, work, lockdown, the dog, the rain. But guess what, all of it is temporary. 

I did groups at the beginning of this journey and that didn’t stick with me. I’ve been doing private counselling with a mix of less than traditional 12 step based groups. 

All that to say, don’t give up. There is a solution for you whether it’s AA, rehab, counselling and all of the other options out there. Surround yourself with people that will lift you up when you don’t need it. Because when the times get tough, you’ll have those moments to remind you how good life can be. 

Good luck and have a good 24!

At the time, I was very self righteous and in a victim mentality and I sent her an ugly, critical text about her and her husband. My actions were wrong and hurtful. We spoke at length about it last summer I apologized unconditionally, at which point she said ""we forgive you, we love you, its over."" When I saw them over Christmas things seemed pretty normal. 

When I woke up and read the text I immediately wanted to drink. I thought it was unfair to have this randomly thrown in my face a year after the fact. I wrote my sister and said that I thought we had put that behind us and that if she feels different I am always free to talk. I haven't heard back. 

I have thought of several things I could send her about how that was unfair to me. I have thought of some things I could say that might cut her. Thankfully, sober me has not sent those. I am trying mightily to put myself in her shoes. I know what it is like to send those drunk texts in anger and I could see the anger grow and the self righteousness manifest itself with every text she sent that night. 

My dilemma is that when this happens I want to totally disengage. But, that's what I did when I was drinking. Act like I don't give a shit about anything. I know that I can't change where she is. I also know that I can't allow myself to continue to pay for something a year after having apologized and been forgiven. I love and care for myself too much in my sobriety to allow that. 

I called her yesterday and she said she'd call me back. I'm not sure if she will. I'm going to give her her space. I'm going to try to empathize with what she's going through because like myself I know she has struggled with alcohol. I am trying not to get angry or self righteous but sometimes when I think about it it pisses me off. I shouldn't have to wake up to a drunk text from her throwing something in my face from a year ago. That dominated my thoughts for the last day and a half. I skipped my class because I wasn't in a good head space. 

I'm rambling and I don't even know the point of this post. I just needed to put it out there. I know this is something I will be able to look back on and be proud I didn't drink over it out of self pity.

I made the choice to be a healthier version of myself, and my life has improved in literally every aspect imaginable. 

If you're just beginning, keep on going. Waking up without a hangover is only the tip of the iceberg. As the weeks and months keep going by, the changes keep coming. 

I am interested in hobbies again that I thought I lost with my adolescence. My relationships are growing stronger, and I've found it easier to be honest with the people around me. Somewhere along the line, without trying, I lost 20lbs- all of my clothes fit better.  I am less angry- frustrating things still happen in my life, but I am able to take a step back and look at the bigger picture instead of getting tunnel vision. I have made my bed every morning for over three months!

I am a better partner and parent- and this is an important improvement for me because I oftentimes would justify having a few drinks by needing the energy to make dinner, clean, entertain the kids etc. Without believing alcohol's lies I can mow the lawn, make dinner, load the dishwasher AND read bedtime stories WITH enthusiasm even after a day's work. 

I still crave a beer here and there- we were camping last weekend and I didn't feel right without one. Budweiser Zero satisfied my craving, and best of all I was able to stop after I had a couple (never could figure out how to do that before)

I owe my current streak to the decision I made- but nothing helped me make that decision (and continue to make it, daily) more than this community. In the words of Keanu Reeves: You're Breathtaking!!

Just thought I'd post after 123 days of sobriety as to what has been helping:

1. Have a personal reason and remind yourself of it. 

In my case, it's seeing a family member relapse the night after they left an in-patient six month rehab program. 

2. Celebrate the victories.

Remind yourself that this is a fight and that you're winning it. You're even winning when you have a terrible day and relapse. The important thing is that this desire is in your daily thoughts.

Celebrate the things like improved relationships, better health and a larger bank account: these come part and parcel with the decision not to drink. 

3. Find something else to occupy your mind like that hobby you've been wanting to do.

You should be in a better headspace to approach it alcohol-free. You'll probably also have more money to spend on it. 

Anyway, just some thoughts folks. Stay positive and I won't be drinking with you today.",9

The last time I drank, I ended up in an incredibly dark place, mentally. It resulted in a 2 and a half day stay in the ICU. My kidneys seem to not be functioning as good as normal anymore (though my fatty liver healed when I'd cut my drinking back from 5 nights a week to once every 2 weeks). I've been extremely sick for nearly the last 2 weeks. 

But today, today I feel alive - truly alive. I can't remember the last time I felt so excited to conquer the day with a clear and level head.

- My face is less bloated 
- my anxiety and depression are definitely more controlled now than ever before when I drank
- I feel calm and less prone to angry outbursts . I feel more in control of my emotions overall
- Most of my friends took some time but they got around to accepting that I don’t drink anymore (I keep saying it’s to lose weight) . 
- Sparkling water has been a life saver . I like the feeling of having something to drink when everyone is sipping on beers or cocktails. Gives me something to do with my hands and makes me feel included. 
- I dealt with a lot of my old issues because there was no escaping them now that I had no drinking to hide behind. 
- TMI- I don’t have diarrhea every single day from the bottle of wine I was drinking daily. My stomach is doing much better in terms of my IBS flare ups. 
- I feel lighter, happier, like I’m made of sunshine most days instead of angry, dark, drunk emotions and resentment. I’ve been laughing a lot. 
- all my decisions in these 100 days have been taken sober and what a difference that has made. I don’t have regrets about decisions I could have taken when drunk or blacked out because I wasn’t drunk or blacked out! 
- I haven’t puked in a 100 days (more probably but definitely not when I’m sober!) 


The Bad 
- have put on weight from all the sugar intake to make up for the lack of alcohol calories and sugar 
- I miss escaping from my problems but also know that the problems would still be there the next day when I wake up hungover AF 
- it’s still hard to go to places or parties where I know there will be booze (socially distanced) but I make an effort to go so I don’t lose out on what little social interaction I get with this quarantine 
- I have a LOT of free time now and with no hobbies it gets boring sometimes . 
- I sleep better somedays but I’m still taking melatonin and still wake up at least twice most nights 

The Ugly 
- people keep asking me when I’ll start drinking again.
- there are days and nights when I just want to give up and enjoy a drink with my friends just to be normal again
- I feel regret and shame for being unable to moderate like normal people , so I know I can’t have “just one drink” 

Overall, I have to remind myself that this journey is worth it. And coming to this sub definitely helps emphasize that emotion.

I had a few NA beers and as usual always had a fine time. But noticed it’s days like that when I consider I will drink again one day and this is just a very long and healthy break I’m taking. (I want to go 365 days and I’m on day 118 with no desire to drink). Two friends got “drunk” and the other only drank 1.5 beers. I noticed that I could not have a conversation with the two drunk ones because they were on their own level. I was telling a story and they had no focus and kept interrupting. Which is fine because I love them. The thoughts I had about drinking lasted all of a few seconds. They didn’t linger. When all was said and done. The two drunk friends slowed down and stopped drinking like normal drinkers. And on the way home the one that drank 1.5 beers actually got pulled over for speeding. 
So based on this if I had had the amount of drinks the drink friends had I would have felt like shit physically and mentally and would not have been able to drive myself and my drunk friend home and if I had 1.5 beers and got pulled over I think it would have really really freaked me out. What I’m trying to say is I’m really really happy to be here with you guys and I’m so happy I’m not drinking with you today. I truly do not believe that anything good comes from it.

It was a picture of a mom passed out on her front porch with 9 empty wine bottles while her kids in the background were all cheering. Enter something something about homeschooling this year.

Look i get it. I am about as sarcastic and dark humored as they come. Im also a mom. But holy shit, this needs to stop being normalized.
I believe one or two people made a comment on how this picture wasnt funny with literaly, hundreds of women replying with things like, this is is hilarious, get the stick out of your ass, and my favorite, well my friend/parents were alcholics and im not offended by this.

Excuse me? I cant even begin to process that last one still. 

Honestly, ive scrolled past pictures like that many times without a second thought. Yesterday i realized its part of the problem. Acting like its funny or even cute to be blacked out or that you deserve 5 cups of wine due to the stress of having kids shouldnt be the norm and as a society, we use it as humor. We use it as an acceptable coping mechanism. We celebrate it.

Im not sure where this is going, but thanks for reading. Im not sure why that one picture bothered me so much. Maybe its because of how excessive it was. Maybe it was the kids laughing in the background and cheering. I think maybe one kid had an expression of, oh mom! You silly, not again!  Maybe it was the collective group mentality that this depiction of not being able to cope and using alcohol to somehow do so (?) Was cute and funny?
Maybe it was the whole thing.

But, it made me not want to drink even more. So i guess thats a positive. I just find it so strange in ""mom culture"" how much and often drinking is almost praised. I know, for myself at least, it was one of the many reasons i continued to tell myself that what i was doing was ok.

Anyway,  not drinking today. Hope you all have a good day. Apologies for the rant.",597

The easy option is to go back to alcohol and weed, but I'm going to try to stick this out for a few more weeks and hopefully it regulates itself eventually.

I know the cliche, “I can’t believe I’m here” but shit so many nights and days of “starting the party” (and continuing it alone sucking down cigarettes and other chemicals till the birds came up) had to be put to bed. 

If your reading this, you’re in the right place. We’re all much stronger than alcohol would let you believe. 

Honestly it’s been better than I could imagine. Anytime any issue comes up (work, money, family, stress) if I take a moment to check my day counter it will always inspire and put things in perspective.

So maybe it's not so drastic due to the struggle I'm facing which is quitting. But yeah I changed my number. Haven't told anyone. I'll share it with my two brothers and my mother. Brothers don't drink because they are family men and just don't have the time. I'm changing my number to avoid being drafted out by friends into these drinking situations. I feel like everytime I attempt to quit they pull me back in like crabs in a bucket. It's also a case of when I see them most of them have ridiculous drinking problems. They normalise waking up and drinking a brandy in there tea. They normalise getting hammered on a cinema and museum date. They drink bottles of liquor before going to the pub. Who does that. Anyway I'm too weak and they are too deep.

The main main issue I have in my life. In my late 20s. I just kept journalling ""I can't do this anymore"" or ""I need to get my life together"". I'm tired of to do lists that stay the same. Of goals that are never reached. Year round. It's the same old thing. Why can't I change? There has to be a way. What do I have to do. I've changed my number before. I wasn't successful multiple times. Am I just bound to this lifestyle? I'm not down and out yet. I am a little worried about my mental health how will I manage not talking to anyone. Either way my mental health is screwed. Might aswell choose the less of two evils.

On the plus side though, i was able to get her a good last minute gift since i now have extra money due to me not drinking anymore. Even better i was able to get her a thoughtful gift as well. Instead of just handing her some cash.

I was racking my brain on what to get her when I remembered her talking about how she wanted the steelbook for last of us 2 but wasnt able to get it for pre order at the time.

So i looked up last of us 2 special edition which had the steelbook. Almost bought it then I decided to see if they had a collectors edition and if it was different. So glad i did. They have a collectors edition which comes with the steelbook and so much more. Its got a statue some trinkets some artbooks. 

I was overjoyed i was able to afford it. I chose the one business day shipping so it should be here soon. Maybe not by the 10th though. It might be late, but im super excited to give it to her. Wouldnt have had that much money lying around were i still drinking.",3

Been struggling with depression for the past 15 years or so and recently dropped my medication because it made me very restless. And of course I knew that the meds won't even work properly if you drink while taking them. But now it seems I've realized the problem myself even though everyone around me always said it was because of drinking or at least that it's not gonna help my mental health.

Well now I gotta say I haven't felt this good since probably the fourth grade. I actually enjoy doing things I used to enjoy, like listening to music and playing games, and it's so refreshing to feel genuinely happy!

It is with a pure heart and stable mind I say good riddance to you. You’ve brought nothing but pain sorrow and turmoil in my somewhat positive life I had before you came along. I have lost pretty much everything I had and hold dear, made the dealers that you support rich while I did whatever I could to make money for your sadistic momentary gain. I cannot express enough the material things I have lost, along with so many opportunities to better myself. I had just started college when you came along and took over my life and ruined probably the best chance I had at success. Because of you, or shall I say my subconscious you I have done so much that I regret. People that I’ve hurt, expections that I’ve shattered and lies I’ve told all because of a selfish lust for the few moments of pleasure I got from you. Nothing I can think of better describes the attitude you make me feel and my behavior other than selfishness. That is selfishness in it’s purest most accurate form. I still can’t believe that I let you have such a grip on my life and decisions. You controlled my every move, each hustle and took every dollar. You lured me into excitement every time I got money, while I cursed you every time the money ran out. You covered all my problems with a mask of ignorance that in reality only made them exponentially worse. I thought I had something to care about while my friends and people I loved were long gone. You gave me a fake reminiscent feeling that only dug this hole deeper and deeper. You took and took and left me with nothing but a mountain of financial debt, and debt to society and the state which I will pay for a long time. It will take me years to recover all that I’ve lost and most likely longer to forget about you. I can’t wait for you to be old news. I would love to never see you again but the control you posess makes me have to watch my every step. It will be a long road ahead, and no amount of preparation will make me invulnerable to your manipulation but I will do my best. I will put you down every time I can and try my hardest so you will never get even an inch of power over me. For all the unnecessary trials and tribulations, for all the loss, for all the adversity I say good riddance,and never come back.~

Was told I should share the above here too. He tried his hardest but couldn't shake his problems. I do my best to honor him by doing my best. I miss you bud wish you were still here you were taken way to soon. You lost your battle but the memories that we all carry of you and your kind soul mean so much still. With all the love in my heart that I have always had for you, until the day day we will meet again. -Dkor",25

Spent 3 days in jail for a dui. Because of corona you get to be in your cell without any type of reading material for 23 hours and step outside your cell to watch tv for 1 hour a day. 

NEVER WANT TO DO THAT AGAIN. 

2. On 6 months probation. So if I decide to drink again it lands me right back to number one to finish probation. 
Let me emphasize how much number one sucks, I would rather have my balls stuck to my thigh and have a wet spot on my sock for the rest of my life than go through that again. 

3. I wake up feeling so much more rested and noticed I have a lot more energy. Granted the 3 days were spent in a cell but regardless I can tell I’m not nearly as lethargic as I was almost every day before now. I also have seen where my actions undoubtedly will take me if I continue down the path I have been. 

With all that being said. I will not drink with you for the next six months, and I hope to keep that streak going. According to my sober app I’m using to keep track I’ve already saved over 40 dollars in these past 5 days from not buying my happiness in a bottle, and that number can only keep rising.

I still automatically feel guilty when I have a stomachache- my body associates nausea with drinking. I often have dreams where I try to piece together my night after a blackout.

My partner left beer in the fridge and went out of town for two weeks- I didn’t even care. I moved them to the back to make room for my croix. it helps that he still buys such shit beer. 

I am trying to understand what being proud of myself means (for me). my instinct is to deflect, to tell myself it’s embarrassing that I didn’t do this sooner, that it was easy, that it’d be pathetic if i COULD’NT do this for a year. When I’m bargaining with myself I ask, even if those thoughts were true, does it help anyone to feel such disdain for myself? What if I just saw this as an accomplishment? wouldn’t that be neat? I can get myself to a place of contentment; I know this is better and I don’t want to drink. Maybe I can just pretend I’m proud of myself and the rest will come later. that’s good enough for me!!!

2020-09-08 18:26:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ip3n3f/finally_made_it_to_the_1year_club/,Finally made it to the 1-Year Club!,"Alright guys, all cups of tea are on me because I'm celebrating 1 year of being sober today! 

It's been 1 year since I drank my last alcohol on the night of 7th September 2019, so 8th September 2019 was my first sober day. I've been reading posts of all fellow sober people here since then but here I am with my first post celebrating 1 year! 

This is actually not my first time quitting alcohol. I did it in 2016/2017 for 9 months (21/08/2016 - 18/05/2017) because I wanted to have a healthy body for my laser eye surgery. However, this time I did it for 2 reasons: First reason was to challenge my willpower and I wanted to say I didn't drink alcohol for 1 year in my life. It's like a badge of honour proving my willpower, and what a willpower it was! I've survived countless house parties, office parties, birthday parties, picnics, concerts, festivals, nights out, pub crawls, dates, and a damn pandemic with no alcohol at all. The hardest part was definitely trying to explain to people why I'm not drinking. It was easy to explain to close friends but I must admit dates were the biggest challenge. 

The second reason was related to an association I created in my mind. I had a quite stressful job and a very annoying boss last year. During my peak time of consuming alcohol, I unfortunately happened to associate job stress/anxiety with drinking alcohol. Every single Friday I was like a rocketship taking off from the office. As soon as I’m done with work I would meet my friends to drink loads of alcohol only to get relaxed and forget job-related stress. Then I realised when I got stressed, I was thinking of alcohol and this, my friends, is a dangerous association. Essentially, I wanted to disconnect this association in my mind by quitting alcohol altogether. However, I replaced chocolate with alcohol and started eating chocolate when I get stressed. Now I’m in the process of breaking this association as well. 

During my 1 year challenge, I had food with alcohol ingredient such as profiterole or beef/chicken braised in red wine, but I didn't consume alcohol in liquid form. I still remember the moment my friend offered me the chocolate she brought from Switzerland. It was a hollow piece of chocolate with liquid alcohol inside, so I got confused if I should have it or not but I said no as it still counts as liquid alcohol! 

Being sober definitely helped with my sleep efficiency and energy levels, but apparently it was irrelevant to my dark circles under my eyes so now I'm looking for other factors causing it. I suspect iron or vitamin D deficiency. If these don’t fix it, I’ll accept it is inherited. Saving money is a big advantage of being sober. I managed to save so much money by not buying alcohol, especially at the bars and clubs. Some bartenders gave me that weird look when I asked for soda & lime but who cares! Being sober in clubs has its own benefits as well. I agree it is a bit harder to let yourself go when you’re sober, but it feels like having superpowers when everyone is like zombies can’t even properly talk. Besides, if you have a great time, talk to girls and flirt successfully when you’re sober, you’re successfully disconnecting another association in your mind: you don’t need alcohol to have good time and flirt! Apart from that, when I drank alcohol I could go for a night out only once a week, either Friday or Saturday, but being sober enabled me to go out 2 consecutive days as I had much more energy. 

I still don't miss the taste of basic drinks such as beer, wine, vodka etc. However, I would like to be able to enjoy life with no restrictions. For example, if I go to Scotland, I would like to go for a whisky trail. There are also local drinks I would like to try when I visit different countries. I also want to enjoy a cup of mulled wine during Christmas time with friends and family. I had a vegan girlfriend once and this was a big dealbreaker for me as sharing food is quite important to me so it didn't work out. I can see the same in drinking alcohol. It's all about sharing something together and getting relaxed a bit, definitely not about getting drunk and lose control. 

In my opinion, quitting alcohol altogether is much easier than drinking in moderation. I’m not sure if it's allowed to say here but as I want to enjoy life with no restrictions and keep strengthening my willpower, I’ve decided to start drinking in moderation from now on because I know this will be much harder than not drinking at all. I just want a harder challenge!

On 9th September I quit drinking and not for a month which I'd tried and failed several times as I was always counting down the days until I could drink but quit drinking forever like I quit smoking.  I was quitting an addiction that I hated and was ruining my life and killing me. 

I got on this reddit thread and read it for hours all day and night after work.  I got the i am sober app and the allen carr book.  It was hard, aches, sleepless, seconds felt like hours, anxious, constantly wanting (needing) a drink, frustrated, headaches, emotional...  It was much harder than before but I wanted and needed to quit.

A year on, my dog was 2 last week, we are on a trip celebrating today.  I'm applying to become a foster carer, i clean my house (this is huge for me), I clean the communal hall and do the garden in the block of flats.  I talk to most of my neighbours whilst in the garden or walking my dog something I avoided before because i was drunk/hungover/desperate to get in and drink.  

My life isn't perfect, I need to exercise and eat healthy, that's 2021's goal (covid messed up my diet) but it's a hell of a lot better than 2019 and where I would be if I hadn't quit.

Over the long weekend (Labor Day), I was able to reflect on sobriety, and given that this is the third time I’v tried to quit, I had the chance to examine the negative impacts drinking has had on my life in comparison to a sober life. 

Anyways, I feel pretty content with not drinking and excited for the future. I don’t want to go back to my drinking days, but Jesus, work is kicking me in the balls. 

I’m a publicist with around 11 clients all fighting for media attention. None of them are newsworthy and they are all very needy. My boss refuses to manage expectations, and constantly creates unrealistic, impossible scenarios for my coworkers and I. 

Most days are anxiety ridden grind fests. I average a 60 hour week and have virtually nobody to even vent to. This job was one of the major reasons my alcohol intake increased dramatically, and it makes it so hard not to go get another drink. I almost WANT to ruin my life, because if this is it, I honestly don’t want to live it. 

And the best part? I applied to over 2000 jobs before I got this one. It’s my first job out of college and I’ve been doing very well in it, but there’s literally no more room to learn and grow and I’m pretty much being taken advantage of. But with the pandemic, and my 60 hour work week, I really don’t think finding another job is realistic. 

I very well might drink a couple big Trulys tonight and smoke real weed (I quit for hemp). I literally cannot control how upset this makes me and I don’t see it getting better while working this job. Which I need in order to not be homeless/horribly depressed because I feel like I’m off course",2

Drinking to relax.


Drinking to sleep.


Drinking to have better sex.


Drinking to deal with nerves.


Drinking to have a better time.


Drinking to calm down from work.


Drinking to make things more interesting.

It was all BS I fed myself to justify the drinking, none of it was real.

Drinking stressed me out, made me act like a fool, cost me money, made for a sloppy date, and neutered my mind making me anything but funnier or more interesting.

Sobriety has allowed me to face the things I was trying to numb & learn to live a life like an adult, facing both the good and bad.

I know I need to quit, or at least seriously cut back, however I don't quite know how to have ""fun"" if I'm not cracking open a beer or taking a couple shots. I'm not saying drinking itself is my preferred activity, there are tons of things I actually enjoy, the problem is I have gotten so used to drinking every night that I feel like I've sort of conditioned my brain to expect alcohol to be accompanied with almost every enjoyable activity... For example, my girlfriend and I have recently started playing a scary video game together, which *should* be fun enough on its own, yet it doesn't quite feel like it's ""enough"" for me if I'm not at least buzzed while playing it. I feel like I've reached a point where alcohol has become a strict requirement for my entertainment. I need some advice, preferably from younger guys, on what I can do to have ""fun"" and be social without feeling like I need to be intoxicated.",8

2020-09-08 15:07:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/iozw0s/20_months_sober/,20 months sober!!!,"I never celebrated a sobriety milestone before.  My first 3 years sober I didn’t realise it was something to celebrate. Then I relapsed & I couldn’t quite get sober for over a year.

I remember thinking to myself that I poured 3 years down the drain. The thought of starting again from zero was incredibly depressing. So I would tell myself practically every day: if I have to start from zero, what’s an extra 1-2 days anyway? So those 1-2 extra days with booze turned into over a year.

This time round, when I was a year sober, I didn’t tell anyone. I still deep down felt ashamed for having relapsed. It felt like a reminder of failure instead of something I should be proud of.

As time went on, I realised that the first few years were not in vain. Getting sober, they helped me talk sense into myself.

In the midst of addiction, happiness felt so out of reach. It didn’t feel real or possible. I couldn’t imagine not waking up anxious & depressed. But I would force myself to remember that I used to be sober & happy. If I could do it then, I could do it now, no matter how hard it felt or how long it took. & eventually I pulled through.

So I’m going to start celebrating, not just how long I’ve been sober, but each good day. Now, in terms of sobriety, I can’t even remember when I have had a bad day.

In recovery, to me at least, how you feel is a million times more important than how long you’ve been at it. And I feel fucking great.

These 20 months have been incredible: I’m getting to know myself better and better, worked through many mental health issues, started setting boundaries, and stopped looking for approval. I moved continents. I started painting again, I started to learn arabic, I started writing a book with my little one. I started loving myself. I started taking care of myself. I started showing up for myself emotionally, physically, professionally. I started thriving & not just surviving. 

There’s still so many things I want to do & still so many things I am working on, & I’m so freaking excited for it. Because deep down, I know all are possible, THANKS TO MY SOBRIETY.",21

2020-09-08 14:34:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ioz8ls/one_week/,One Week,"One week is the longest I've been sober in the past three years; prior to that I had a month or three after somewhere around 15 years drinking an excessive amount of alcohol on a nightly basis. Somehow over that time period I managed to keep my house stocked with all of my favorite beverages, and still managed to head out to the bars three or more days per week. The first thing I would do when I woke up in the morning is finish off the cider from the night before, then get out of bed and grab a fresh one. From that point forward I would be drinking all day, every day. On special occasions (Sunday Funday, for instance: liquid brunch followed by a tour of all the bars in town, every week) I would drink even more than normal, to the point I was functionally blacked out, meaning I remembered the general idea of what I had done, while actively forgetting the details, if not the event, location or participants.

What pushed me to take a break from the sauce occurred last Sunday. I started the day with my regular shower-beer, and though none of my friends seemed interested in going out under the guise of eating food when we all knew that breakfast would consist exclusively of mimosas or Bloody Mary's. I am pretty comfortable in bars, so I was getting ready to go out by myself when I got an invitation from an old friend to meet up and do this thing together. I replied enthusiastically, hopped in my car, and headed to the tea house. 

Once there, the excursion began with a series of mimosas. The two of us caught up for a moment, before the conversation quickly jumped to what we were going to do next. Not so much what we were going to do, but where we do it and who to invite along the way. We both texted a few friends, and our group began to grow. “The MeteorMcComet Rule,” as it's known around these parts is one simple, non-negotiable directive: one round per bar. We'd been to about three when I began to feel sick. As we walked into the fourth bar with a gang of about 5 at that point (yes, we were all wearing masks and junk and stuff) I had to made a bee-line for the restroom so I could make room for the next couple drinks, if you catch my meaning.

Because vomiting leaves a bad taste in the mouth, and the entire reason I was at the bar was to drink with friends, I got right back to it. I puked, then ordered a round at the next location too.  I finally called it and caught a ride back home after my third visit to the men's room. After smoking some weed and giving myself maybe an hour to start feeling better I was ready for another cider in the comfort of my own home...

I would be lying if I said that was the first time I'd gotten physically ill from alcohol and continued drinking. That's the kind of alcoholic I am. That's why I'm happy to say that as of today I've strung seven consecutive days together. I've already started to notice small changes in my behavior. They may be the most minor of things that most functional people do on a regular basis, but the fact that I'm beginning to make those changes to my life motivates me to keep working at it. 

To be honest I find some of my old habits funny, like how I'll instinctively look around for my beer bottle before realizing I didn't have one because I'm not drinking today.

I want to thank you all for being here, being supportive of each other, and encouraging me to keep working at this thing. I've been lurking in the subreddit off and on for a few years now, and it's definitely one of the tools I am using to keep myself sober. IWNDWYT!",6

I joined in August 2016, desperately wanting to quit after 20 years.

It finally stuck Jan 2018.

And I let it slip away. 

Working full-time and taking care of the family/ distance learning full-time ate away at all of my good habits and inner supports. I saw it coming but felt like I didn't have even one more drop of energy/ motivation/ strength to give.

I thought being a middle aged, working mom was hard before- haha, I was an idiot!

I could give pages of details, but y'all know. We are being pulled a million directions. 2020, man.  Job changes, uncertain economy, loss of childcare, etc. Our elders need more help. We lost some family and couldn't gather. FIL, a cousin (38 years old w/ 3 kids, what a nightmare), an aunt. 

It is just a very hard time with no signs of letting up. I am perpetually exhausted and anxious but don't have a minute to spare between work and home school. 

It has been a couple weeks since I started drinking again and I still feel like I don't know how to care the way I should. Things aren't a complete wreck, yet, but that is the only direction I head when I drink.

I know what I need to do. This is my first step in the right direction in a long time.

As the title states, it has been 191 days since my last drink. These last 6 months have been very eye-opening. I have been feeling a lot of different emotions as of late. Which is understandable given the interesting time we are all living through. Global pandemic, politics, social injustices, natural disasters, human suffering, everyday life...Etc. It seems pointless at times to maintain my sobriety with everything going on. However, I know drinking will not make any of those things go away. It will only make things worse in the end. 

What has been made clear to me these last 6 months is that I have to feel whatever the emotions are and recognize them. Really feel them. To numb myself because I don't want to feel a certain way or because I feel a certain way isn't an option for me any longer.  So, I sit with the emotions. All of them. I do my best to unpack them and see what is really going on. Most days I feel good. Others, like today, I am not so great. However, I will stay my course. I will not drink.

191 days is the longest I have gone without a drink in my 37 rotations around the sun. I spent a good 3rd of my life thinking that I needed to drink to feel better. That i needed to drink to make an already great day even better. It has taken me 191 days to realize this. I am sure it will take me a lot longer to learn a bit more about who I really am without the alcohol, and that's cool. I have the time.

So, thanks to anyone who read this and possibly got anything out of it. I needed to get this off of my chest. Needed to vent. Maybe someone else feels the same way and thought it was only them. It isn't.  I hope you all have a great day ahead of you. IWNDWYT.",14

So this weekend was labor day weekend, I'm sure you know that already. My husbands sister got married this weekend! She rented out an entire campground, fancy cabins, the whole thing.
I knew going into this that there would be alcohol and lots of it, in the back of my mind, I kept giving myself reasons to screw up. I knew I could sneak drinks if I needed, but I also kept telling myself I could drink just a few (yeah right). When I got there, I was immediately offered a drink, but I had brought a ton of sparkling water with me ( this was so helpful) and I told them I would have one of those. I drank maybe 25 sparkling waters, and I have no regrets there. Keeping a sparkling water in my hand at all times was my saving grace.

I didn't drink a single drop, and I am literally so proud of myself. I was able to be perky, friendly, and helpful to everyone there because I didn't drink. I walked the grandparents home to their cabins when they were drunk, because I was able to! I was able to help my husbands mom out of the hot tub, and watching her be so drunk that she couldn't get out was a huge wake up call for me. I love being sober. I love who I am when I am sober. I had a great weekend where many people had a terrible weekend. So many people were so drunk they couldn't stand, and that was me for so long. I was so afraid that people would judge me for not drinking, but its really true, no one even noticed.

I almost slipped up just one time, my favorite person, my husbands step mom, offered me some wine. I said no thank you, and she offered again, even starting to poor me a glass. I said okay just a little, but then mid sentence I realized how silly that was. I would not have just a little, I would drink that whole bottle! So I quickly said no, and told her I quit drinking. She was so kind and supportive, and told me she understood and even hugged me. 

The whole thing was just so wildly happy and I had to tell someone about it.

Bonus points, I am not recovering from my weekend! I woke up early, feeling great, got a coffee took the dog to the park and now I'm going to do some work.

I thought maybe some of you could offer some insight. I always thought that it was a gradual progression, that it took years for someone to drink themselves to death, and that one would have probably been hospitalized multiple times before succumbing to alcohol-related kidney and liver failure. This man worked with my husband, and just a couple of weeks ago he was ""fine"" then started to become jaundus and ill, was hospitalized about a week ago on dialysis and passed last night. He was in his early 40s. We were at his house, grilling while our kids swam together on the 4th of July. He has a wife, seemed to be very happily married, and they were both drinking openly. Same for a wedding we attended about a month ago. I don't understand how he could have been so sick and not known, or his wife not known. They have 2 small kids, so I can't imagine that he would not even try to stop had doctors told him how dire his situation was. Everyone is just in shock and so deeply saddened by this loss. The family is being super private about it, so I don't know if maybe there were other underlying issues, but he was not eligible for the donor list. Any help is appreciated. IWNDWYT",17

I’ve spent the better part of three years going through the mindfuck of “Do I have a drinking problem?” “Am I an alcoholic? “Maybe I’m a functional alcoholic.” “Nah, I’m good I’m just living it up in my youth.” “Wait, no, I have a problem.” “I should get help.” “No, I don’t need help.” Etc. Etc. Etc. 

I’ve finally stepped away from all the labels and diagnoses and just accepted a simple fact that my relationship with alcohol is making my life worse. Sometimes I’ll go a week and a half without drinking but then I’ll go buy a handle and destroy it over the course of two euphoric, and fucking miserable days. Such was the case with my Labor Day weekend which is why I’m here.  

Even though I haven’t been a daily drinker I’m terrified that I’m on a slippery slope because I have started to let myself go some weeknights if I had a bad day. I’ve been using alcohol as a coping mechanism which is not a path I want to go down.  

I’ve lurked here for a little while and want to give myself some actual accountability in order to break this miserable cycle of making all sorts of progress to my goals then destroying it all over one whiskey fueled weekend accompanied by doordashing junk food non stop and passing out by 6pm.  I want to be able to live my life again without wondering if I’ll spend my weekend hiking with my wife and dog or passed out on the floor and waking up trying to assess how pissed off she is at me.

So, I’m showing up. Appreciate any support and tips and would love to be a supporter and friend to others. I will not drink today.",4

A month ago I was feeling hungover, generally sorry for myself, and googling symptoms of alcoholism (probably not a great sign, right?). I'm 34 and have had a long, mostly functional relationship with alcohol. I've never really been a day drinker (with the exception of a tailgate here or there), my work may have suffered a bit, but it has never caused any problems, and hell, I really only drank on the weekends. One day per weekend, I'd go pretty hard, hard enough to regret it for a few days into the following week. My relationships with friends and family haven't really suffered, but **alcohol was this ever present ITCH** that I thought about more than I'd like to admit.

I'd worry about hanging out with people when alcohol was around. Can I hold it together this time? I can most times, but it always kinda felt like i was playing a get wasted and hungover game of roulette. So much so, that I realized I was actually AVOIDING activities with alcohol present to not be tempted.  And more lately than ever, I've been losing the ""can you hold it together and drink normally"" battle more often.

After stumbling into this sub, and getting ""this naked mind"" on audible my entire perspective has flipped. Here's what has worked:

Just....stop drinking. If people ask you why, you can say it's temporary, not drinking today, not drinking this week, month... whatever. As it turns out, alcohol had convinced my brain that it's a super big deal, and whether you drink or not is a huge thing that people are going to notice and call you out on. In my last month that has NOT been my real world experience. I've said 'no' to friends and family, and no one has even given it a second comment. I hung out with my heavy drinking family and just said ""I'm not really into alcohol right now."" and that was enough.

Alcohol tricks you into thinking it's more important than it is, and AA makes it sound like you're either an A L C O H O L I C or a non-problem drinker. The line is very grey, and it's only going to get more difficult to stop.

I can't tell you the WEIGHT THAT HAS BEEN LIFTED knowing that I won't be drinking. I can hang out with friends and drive home afterwards. I can plan social events on consecutive days knowing that I won't be so hungover I have to bail on the later plans. I have extra mental capacity so I can work on projects I've been *wanting* to do for ages.  I don't have to worry if i'm slowly drifting towards a major problem with alcohol. I don't have to worry about the amount of damage i'm doing to my body from binges. I'm a person who has always sorta ""hated"" the holidays, and I'm looking forward to them this year. I don't have to deal with the constant struggle to moderate drinking to fit in. I'm looking forward to exercise, as opposed to just struggling through to counteract the hangover and calories from last weekend.

I know I'm still in the euphoric early days of this journey, but I don't think I can ""unsee"" the relief that I now feel daily.

If you're reading this sub, or spend your time wondering if you currently, or in your future will have a problem with alcohol, just stop drinking it. See if your life improves.

PS: Shoutouts to all the people dealing with actual withdrawal,  I cannot imagine the effort required to fight through WDs. Your dedication and willingness to suffer to improve is an inspiration to us more grey-area problem drinkers.

PPS: Things I've read here or heard elsewhere that really helped. 

* Do you have great self control with other aspects of your life? Why is alcohol so different? It's because it is an addiction, it's not about self control at all.

Despite not being the heaviest drinker, I have a problem where I cannot get to the end of the day without thinking about having a drink. And I can’t stop once I start. Waking up achey and in a fog is just not sustainable or healthy. Alcoholism runs in my family and has led to broken relationships, abuse and trouble with the law. I’m not so different that these issues could not one day be me. I just hide my alcohol dependence behind being busy and successful on the surface.

Anyway, back again.

I guess I’d like to start off by giving my backstory with drinking: I started drinking when I was 16. I started drinking when I was alone and lonely, and that set the tone for my drinking career. For 12 years I have used alcohol when I am alone and in pain. Many “I gotta stop doing this” moments in those years, so I want this to be the one that lasts.

I quit for about almost two years from 2015-2017, and remember enjoying the mental clarity and overall less rollercoaster emotions (very high highs, very low lows when drinking). I remember getting upset at accidentally getting tipsy from a meal that used wine in it and did not get burned off through cooking. I was in a poor relationship then, so it was not the best feeling at the time, but I do remember it being a net positive in my life. When I was out of the relationship, I returned to to drinking thinking I had “cured” my problem drinking and that I could moderate/drink socially. This quickly made me fall back on my old ways. 

I taught English abroad, and the isolation led me to abuse alcohol once again. When I returned, I had a severe illness that also made me want to drink to pass the time. After that, living alone and working a terrible job created the same cycle. It is always the same circumstance- I am alone and no one is telling me to not drink, therefore I drink. Hence why I am looking forward to joining this group.

I’ve decided enough is enough and I am very serious about quitting for good. I have proved to myself time and time again I cannot moderate. I stopped about three weeks ago, but when my current live-in partner went on a trip and I was home alone this weekend, I binged. I am embarrassed but know the only way to move is forward. 

The thing I am trying to remind myself is that I have so many wellness practices in my life I know work (therapy, zen meditation, writing music, biking, etc), I just need to f\*cking do them. They are practices, meaning I need to continuously do them.

I am also soooo happy there are so many good NA drinks nowadays. I am happy (from my perspective) millennials and Gen Z are rethinking drinking and have alternatives that are not necessarily loaded with sugar. I’ve stocked up on kombucha, many teas, Athletic Brewing NA beer, Lagunitas Hop Water, Ghia (for you former Campari lovers), and Seedlip NA spirits. These are all just as enjoyable as regular beer and cocktails, for me. It gives me the ritual of drinking without the self harm. I also have absolutely no pressure from friends to drink, and have several friends that don’t drink.

Anyways, day two. I am finally feeling somewhat in control of my life. I have returned to school to get a job in a technical field and feel really motivated to do well. I will not let drinking get in the way of me achieving what I want, which is a rewarding career that fits how my brain works and will allow me to buy a house one day. I am in the best relationship of my life and know I have her support in quitting.

Daily Reflections today talks about surrendering control and that's something I know I've been struggling with, as a lot of people do even with significant clean time. A consequence of that is the recurring thoughts of self-doubt and generalized fear. Someone said in a meeting recently that they saw those feelings as a symptom of their disconnection from their higher power, because when you're in constant conscious contact, your higher power will relieve you of those fears. My sponsor instructs me to not only pray at waking/bedtime/meetings, but also in the midst of when I'm experiencing these feelings. I think it's a habit to be built that is one of the most helpful things I could do for myself in the interest of my recovery, and I think it could apply to many others also. 

I think I've been running on emotions, which were fortunately identified as determination and conviction. Unfortunately, we know that this effort can't rely on emotions and feelings which are inherently unreliable, only our actions. Today I might not feel excited or happy, but I'm not going to drink, I am going to go to meetings, I am going to work on my stepwork assignment, and everything else I've been told to do. The house mom where I was staying told me that trust and love aren't feelings, but actions. And as you repeat actions with objective dedication, the feelings will grow in a healthy organic way. So I'm praying for patience and grace, for myself and for everyone else that's struggling.

And what a year it has been. Lockdowns from the virus, questions about jobs, work almost drying up. Cancelled vacation plans at the last minute.

This year has been a little trying, at times. I decided early on in the lockdown (the first week) that I would be responsible for making sure that our meeting continued, outside of the normal church we meet at. I was terribly afraid that someone, sometime, would show up and no one would be there to welcome the newcomer. I could not get the thought out of my head that “what would have happened so many years ago when I finally got the courage to walk into a meeting, and no one was there?” It haunted me.

 There were a couple of weeks that I was the only one there. Not many, but a couple. Most of the time, a few of our regular members would show up, and a few times new folks would show. Last week, our church decided to allow us back inside. Now, we need to determine how to get more people to the meeting again. Our rent will probably go up, and that is ok, we will figure it out.  After all, we are self-supporting through our own contributions.

We had a trip planned to go to England in August, to see our Son and Daughter in Law. Cancelled. We have not seen the kids since their wedding in 2018. A trying year. 

Today, I am sober. I woke up with 37 years. And another token. I owe this to Alcoholics Anonymous and God. Fred had very little to do with it, all I did was not drink and not die. I think I will do that again today.

I was able to make it through this year, and all the previous years, in a very simple way. I did not drink, today, a bunch of times.

When I decided to cut it out I had no idea that I would suddenly be faced with spending 99% of my time at home, cut off from friends and family. Luckily I have my beautiful fiancee to keep me company but I very much love my friends and the last 6 months I haven't been able to see them has hurt.

If I had known this was going to happen would I have decided to cut out drinking? Who knows? But I can honestly say that it was the best decision I could have made. Whilst I have heard countless reports of people's drinking habits sky rocketing during social isolation and lock-down and how mental health is being severely impacted, I have been able to weather it sober.

As somebody who's mental health was heavily affected by drinking I really couldn't have picked a better time.

I have had 200 days free of self medicating, of hitting those sudden mood swings and terrible lows that always seem to happen after I've had too many drinks to stop them.

200 days free of drunkenly listening to Elliot Smith songs, of annoying my fiancee with mopey music video choices.

200 days of being able to spend the evening on the same wavelength as my fiancee who doesn't drink.Of not having to re-watch movies and TV shows the next day as I blacked out halfway through it.

200 days free of waking up with a pounding head, aching neck, and the invasive feeling that a sick animal had just decided to use your mouth as a toilet after sleeping in it all night. Of not allowing my anxiety to swing me towards the bottle for relief, only to remember too late every time how it only ever made it worse.

200 days of contributing to this group and celebrating every small and big victory with you all, and offering words of encouragement when we have had to lament the set backs.

200 days of actually being true to myself.

However, since I am used to numbing myself and ignoring problems, I don't know any alternative method that helps me get through the uncomfortable part to actually deal with the problems.

But why does the drunk me exist in the first place? It's the sober-me that calls him into existence, whenever it's anxious, frustrated, shy, socially incapacitated, etc. The drunk-me then comes, and he's more confident, more powerful, freer, and says what it thinks... These days I ""call"" drunk-me into my life once a month... so it's not damaging my life anymore, but I still call him. I think the time when I will stop calling him will be when my sober-me learns to be more like the drunk-me, not literally, but my sober-me needs to be freer, less self-censored, less mentally constipated... then there will be no need to call drunk-me into existence at all. This is what I found, and I believe it to be the truth for many people. It doesn't apply to everyone equally I reckon, maybe just to introverts. Each person ""self-medicates"" for a different reason. But the ""negative"" method of just trying to suffocate and kill the drunk-me, is not  enough ... you also need to make your sober-me more like the drunk-me, but without the negatives: work on confidence, say something ""improper"" sometimes in social settings (I don't mean insults or anything disparaging)... people don't mind as much as you think, and even if they do, live a little. I feel so alive when I do it.

That's when I feel the same ""high"" as when drunk, but without having to drink...

That's the ""high"" of freedom from constant self-censorship.

It’s not the same as your normal life. How is it different? How do you want it to feel? What new things can you try as a substitute? If you can find something healthier that makes you feel good, do it. Explore innocent things. Build castles out of cards or paint or play or build or read or hunt or fish or dance or sweat or get really really good at blowing bubbles with bubble gum. Find something you used to enjoy and try it out again. Not only will you be free of the bottle’s financial drain, there will be other areas in which you will save money.

Let people drink without feeling bad. Celebrate that they have their own personal relationship with the bottle. Find something that you can have a healthy relationship with. If you make it look fun you might be surprised by who joins you.

And Breathe. Pay attention to your breath. Take big deep slow breaths anytime you can think of it.

I truly hope you can find your path through all this. IWNDWYT.",65

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Who else here feels like they’ve lost their ever-loving mind since they quit drinking???  At least for a little while, anyway...

I don’t know about all y’all, but since I stopped drinking a little over two months ago, I have felt all of the feels.  ALL OF THEM … and, more intensely than I recall feeling *anything* the last several years (other than anxiety, self-loathing, shame and hopelessness).  

Almost every single day, I would come home from work or wherever and drink all evening long until I crashed out/blacked out.  I thought I was doing it to unwind/to enjoy myself, but looking back I also realize now I was doing it to numb myself.  Working in a high-stress job, stuck in an unhealthy relationship, you know the story.  When I drank, I didn’t have to face any of that shit.  I just tuned it out every night, woke up feeling like hell, and started the next day in the same pattern: wash, rinse, repeat.

I noticed once I removed alcohol from the equation: I was no longer numb to all those feelings.  For me, the anxiety/self-loathing/hopelessness, have backed off quite a bit…it’s the other stuff that takes me on a rollercoaster ride from hell, now. *Every other fucking feeling on the planet* came to take their place: incredible joy, intense heartbreak, fiery anger and jealousy … and also, sometimes: the most pure and peaceful feelings of calm and contentment I’ve known my entire life.  

&#x200B;

Mindfulness is something you see mentioned often in SD.  It’s defined as ""a mental state achieved by focusing one's awareness on the present moment, while calmly acknowledging and accepting one's feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations, used as a therapeutic technique.”  Or, more simply: ""the quality or state of being conscious or aware of something.”  

&#x200B;

Without having read much other than what I’ve seen in SD posts, I think I’ve been practicing it (to a degree) on my own naturally, by focusing on what’s happening in the moment…. accepting what’s happening….instead of losing my shit over things I can’t control.  I once saw a post that mentioned a phrase:  **“Embrace the Suck”**.  That’s what I’m learning to do now: is embrace the suck with both arms wide open, because I know now that I *can*.  I’m better equipped to handle these emotions now than I’ve ever been, with a clearer mind and open heart.  I don’t always get it right, but I’m slowly getting better at it with each day that little number on my badge increases.  

  

So…what say you, Sobernauts?  How do you Embrace the Suck?  

And no, hugging your vacuum cleaner does *not* count.  ;-)

2020-09-08 00:29:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ion5ci/sinclair_method_naltrexone_and_thc/,"Sinclair Method, Naltrexone, and THC","I was drinking nearly every day at the start of January this year. I started using the Sinclair Method (taking Naltrexone 50mg in pill form, waiting one hour, then consuming a moderate amount of alcohol) and it helped me cut down to nothing in a few months. It took a few times until I could easily become disinterested in drinking, but I was very surprised at how effective it was. I have been on a few different antidepressants and other medications, and nothing has ever worked as well or as quickly as Naltrexone when using it in the specific way as described by the Sinclair Method. I was able to get some Naltrexone from my Dad who was prescribed it by his doctor for ""carb cravings"". It doesn't seem to work for him for that. I was then able to get it for free from my pharmacy with a prescription from my psychiatrist. I simply explained to her that I had taken it about 10 times at that point and had seen good results.

tl;dr Naltrexone using the sinclair method worked for me. YMMV

I have occasionally had a beer or two since then without taking any Naltrexone. I haven't seemed to become addicted to alcohol again, but I'm watching myself pretty closely. I probably drink once a month or so at this point. I might take some Naltrexone the next time I drink just in case.

Here's where things get odd.

I use THC in the form of RSO (thick, black concentrated oil) sometimes, maybe once every month or two. Since the oil comes in a tiny device like a syringe and the oil tastes horrible it's necessary to put the oil onto something in order to swallow the oil droplet whole. I usually take a very small amount, maybe 1/4 the size of a pea or smaller. This is just enough to notice that I'm on THC. Since I stopped drinking altogether for a while, and I knew I could get Naltrexone for free, I used a 50mg Naltrexone pill as a vessel to ingest the RSO oil. I did this maybe 4 to 6 times over the course of a few months. I stopped taking THC for a while. About a month ago, my Mom was prescribed Naltrexone from her doctor for ""carb cravings"" as well and we had a conversation about it. I decided to try and experiment to see if Naltrexone could help me with my video game addiction, because ""why not???"".

So, the odd thing that happened is that I took a single 50mg pill with nothing else, and I got fairly ""high"" off of it. I waited about an hour, played some video games and then went and had a conversation with my Dad. And yep, it felt just like trying to talk to him when I'm high on THC. I can't explain why this happened.

Why did taking Naltrexone make me feel high? It didn't do that before I took it with THC. But now, my brain seems to react to Naltrexone in a similar way as it does to THC. This would probably fade away after a few more uses. No idea. I might take some more tomorrow and see what happens. Just wanted to see if anyone has had any similar experience.",1

Now my health anxiety is pretty high but at least I can stop worrying about high BP, elevated ALT levels and high heart rates. 

Honestly life really sucks right now for a lot of us and it's hard to find joy with everything that's going on. And I'd be lying if I said I hadn't considered throwing it all away for a couple hours of completely blacking out and forgetting it. But I still play the tape forward and realize that afterward, all this shitty stuff will still be shitty if I got drunk, and at least now I don't have to deal with an alcohol addiction on top of everything else.

I am reading a novel called *Transcendent Kingdom* by Yaa Gyasi. It's about a PhD student in neuroscience who is trying to understand better both addiction and depression, both of which run in her family. It definitely makes me think of my own alcoholism when she talks about the mice she does her ""reward seeking"" experiments on in her lab. She teaches them to push a lever to get some Ensure, the ""milkshake"" in a can nutritional supplement that isn't very tasty to humans actually but apparently is almost irresistible in its deliciousness to mice in the world of this novel. Once they've learned how to get the Ensure, she starts administering a painful but non-lethal electric shock at randomized times when they press the button instead of the Ensure. Some of the mice get one shock and never return to the lever again. Many mice get 3 or 4 shocks before apparently deciding that it's not worth an occasional treat to get an occasional shock. But there are some mice who keep trying until the shocks have withered them away to shells of their former selves. 

Of course this is fiction and not how real studies have worked (though it is modeled on some well-known studies) but it totally rings true to me. I pressed the booze button again and again (and again and again on and on) long after I'd seen that it often hurt me and well into a time period when I realized it was actively killing me. 

It's been a good novel to read on a weekend when so many people around my neighborhood and on social media seem to be enjoying a drink. It would not be a relaxing good time. It would be my brain circuitry being hijacked and rerouted such that all roads lead to booze again.

2020-09-07 22:08:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/iol3hf/this_time_last_year_a_reflection/,This time last year (a reflection),"I spent some time this weekend reflecting on this time last year and how drastically my life has changed. Then I started thinking about how I got here. I’m not at a year yet, but 7 months still seems like a long time and a big accomplishment. I wrote this today to process my journey, thinking that maybe I’d post to social media in celebration -- but this seems like a much safer space to share my sobriety story for now. 

This time last year, I was drinking 8-10 beers every single weeknight and all day all weekend. Hungover was my natural state. I quite literally lived off of bagel sandwiches and late-night delivery because I was usually too drunk to cook myself dinner (I started a small fire trying to cook on a gas stove drunk and decided from there on out it was a bad idea). The only time I moved my body was to walk to buy more beer at the gas station next door. I was getting behind on bills, spending the little money I did have on booze, effectively drinking my paychecks. Maxing out my credit card and literally counting change I had lying around the house when the money inevitably ran out week after week. I had been going on like this for 3 years. 

Looking at myself in the mirror became a terrible experience - I was red, puffy, had gained 50 lbs and was waking up every day filled with guilt, anxiety, shame and fear about my drinking. I finally came to terms last year with the fact that I either needed to stop or accept the fact that this would be the rest of my life. Which would probably be severely shortened as I was not taking care of myself, drinking to the point of sickness every night (not being able to walk or puking was usually my cue it was time for bed, at least I had that) and making terrible decisions.

I was defensive and went to great lengths to convince myself that I didn’t have a problem. This is after almost 3 years of talking about my substance and alcohol abuse issues with a therapist. But I was functioning, I hadn’t lost everything yet or paid some dire consequence for my problem. You’re not an alcoholic until you get a DUI, right? Wrong. And even if that were true, it was only a matter of time. 

I derived no pleasure from life outside of drinking and even that got mundane. I despised myself. I felt disgusting in every way. Towards the end there was literally nothing I would rather be doing than sitting at home binge drinking. I would leave social situations, where I felt I had to hold back on the booze, to go home and proceed to get plastered alone. I knew what time every gas station in walking distance closed and would plan my night accordingly. I was isolated. I was lonely. It was no way to live. 

I spent almost half a year attempting to take a week off every now and then, but I really didn’t want to stop. I was terrified at the thought of never having a drink again. I would make it a few days and relapse into an even deeper spiral -- until I eventually found my rock bottom. It didn’t come in the form of some terrible event - unless you count morphing into a shell of a human you don’t even recognize - but rather being scared shitless that this would be my life and then I would die - alone, miserable, maybe even choking on my own vomit. I would never meet anyone and fall in love. I would never feel good about my body or my health. I would never be happy. 

After an over-the-top boozy holiday season that confirmed what I already knew - that I should never touch another beer in my life - it needed to end. I also knew I was transitioning to a new job, and that it was the opportunity for a fresh start. I drank a few times in January before I was able to completely let go, and one day it just stuck. I didn’t drink, and I haven’t since, for over 7 months.

I now have time and energy to put into myself and my relationships and things I enjoy, I feel lighter emotionally, am literally 50 lbs lighter, am saving money, am working my way through trauma that I’ve been drowning out for years, am working out and walking every single day, and most of all, feeling like I like myself and am deserving of all the good things for the first time in a very, very long time (maybe ever). 

Being sober is awesome. I’m even grateful for the many shitty days and hard weeks that have come as I heal. Though I don’t recognize the person I was last year anymore, or those years I was drinking heavily - and frankly am still pretty annoyed with her about some of the stuff she did - I forgive her and know that she believed at her core that she was deserving of a full, happy and healthy life. I am damn proud of her for giving herself that gift.",47

I slept better than previous camping trips, and was the first one ready to hit the trails the next day.

And even more interesting, I only got asked about not drinking once. I just replied “I’m not drinking this weekend.” No pressure, never heard any other mention of it.

In addition to the hangovers, anxiety, late-night calorie binges and stupid fights with my boyfriend, for a few years I'd had a nagging feeling that I should have been further along in life. Not in a social media comparison sort of way, but more of a sense that I'd spent a lot of days in a Groundhog Day-style endless repeat, rather than making any sort of real progress. I looked pretty successful from the outside and I'd already worked out all of my excuses for why I had a bunch of shallow relationships & friendships, why I was still renting and had almost no assets with a high income, why I was still pretty miserable after 2 decades of therapy, etc.

I can confirm that getting sober jump-started a bunch of things in my life. I'm now financially stable, a homeowner, in a great marriage to my then-boyfriend who quit the same day that I did, we have a hilarious dog we love and we're expecting a baby in a few weeks.

Maybe most of this stuff would have happened anyway, but to me the biggest benefit of quitting alcohol was getting unstuck in so many areas of my life.

(25F for reference) This is going to be a long one because it is my first post here and my entire life has changed in the past week. Sorry in advance and thank you to anyone that sticks through and reads the whole thing!

I have always tried to abstain from alcohol for weight loss reasons alone. I've never made it past 5 days (which even that was rare, usually it was no more than 2 days) and I've never made it through a weekend because weight loss wasn't a deep enough motivator for me to stick with it. I wanted my body back so bad but I wanted booze more.

I have known for a while that I have a real problem with alcohol (sneaking shots, wine in the morning, obsessing over my next drink) but I couldn't imagine giving it up completely. What would happen to my social life? Well, I read *This Naked Mind* a month ago and it really moved me. That was until the weekend hit and I was right back to drowning in the poison. However, I believe the book was slowly working on me throughout the month, I just wasn't ready to quit at the time.

Flash forward to Sunday, September 30th and I finally accepted that would be the day that I kept putting off. The day before, my boyfriend wrote on our white board ""No. Booze. Tomorrow."" and had us both sign underneath. He's not a heavy drinker at all, so I think that was his subtle way of giving me the push I needed. So on Sunday, I knew I couldn't drink. We made a pact! But I had been secretly planning to get sober so knew if I didn't drink, that would be my day 1 and it scared the shit out of me. Is this it? Last night I had my last drink? I teared up, I felt bad for myself and I wanted to drink so bad. So bad, in fact, that my addiction was officially verified. Then it clicked. It scared me how *badly* I wanted a drink. I knew from that moment that I was done. I had to be.

The next day, I went for a walk with my boyfriend and really opened up to him about my problem. He had known for a couple of years that I needed to get my drinking under control but he wasn't aware of how bad it had gotten. So when I finally said it out loud to him, and to myself, it was so freeing. Then, we went to visit family back home in MA for the long weekend and it was huge for me. I even opened up to my mom and my childhood best friends. I've never been anywhere close to this as I was always in denial myself. The more I said it out loud, the more secure I felt with the path I have chosen.

I have been binging this subreddit since day 1 and you all make me feel *hope* for the first time ever. I have lost trust in myself through the never ending cycle and I can finally see that cycle ending. I don't feel deprived because I don't *want* to drink poison anymore and honestly I haven't felt this at peace and alive in over 5 years. My feelings of panic and doom have disappeared which is so huge for me. It's like the darkness is gone. I've been waking up at 7am full of energy and happiness as opposed to 11am feeling groggy, swollen and in a panic. My cat is very pumped about this as well.

Also, I am a musician and alcohol stole my passion from me. I went from writing like crazy and gigging twice a week to letting my guitar and vocal cords collect dust. This weekend, I wrote a song about getting sober and having to confront everything that I was drowning out with booze, but then being able to finally let these things go. It's called ""Ghosts"" and the key line is ""my ghosts are setting me free"". It took me like 15 minutes because it literally just fell out of me. I feel a massive wave of creativity coming my way. 

I know I'll have rough days, temptation and doubts but knowing I can just come here, read, and straighten myself out makes me feel so safe. Thank you all. I am so proud to be here and IWNDWYT!",20

2020-09-07 16:26:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/iofcri/i_went_to_a_small_get_together_and_it_just_made/,"I went to a small get together, and it just made me feel depressed...","So, a little insight: I am now almost 4 and a half months (131 days) off the booze, and I haven't been generally happier in years. To be even more specific, I was an all day, everyday drinker for years and years. I hated my life and I hated myself. I finally decided to do something I never imagined I could or would do, which is completely abstain from alcohol. The results were mind blowing, and though I knew drinking was my biggest qualm with my life, I didnt realize how much better I could feel without it.

It was incredible for months, but unfortunately, the honeymoon phase has left me as quick as it came. I didn't think it was truly gone until last night, when I decided to go to a small gathering of people for a soft opening of an arcade bar that my brother will be working at.

I just wasn't ready for it. I wasn't even proud of myself for not drinking, just felt like a loser that still doesn't know how to have fun without some sort of drug. I would have been more proud of myself if I drank and had great, flowing conversations with people. I just felt anxious, overwhelmed, bored, awkward, and alone instead.

It feels even more lonely knowing nobody understands why, how, and where something so assumingly miniscule made my mind plummet to. It was just such a blow to the ego to realize how weak I still am to it and to wonder, once again, if I'm ever going to be able to do this... I thought I was past that. I'm trying to be proud of myself but a celebration by yourself is still lonely, and it just doesn't feel like it weighs much.

It's just pathetically such a big aspect of my life that unfortunately makes no difference to anyone else whether I abstained or drank myself into a blackout. So it's like, if nobody else cares, why should I? What's the point of all of this? And if they can do it, why can't I? I already have horrible social anxiety, which is why I developed such horrible alcoholism in the first place, so why is it fair that I don't get the crutch that everyone else gets to have when I feel like I need it even worse than they do?

It honestly made me cry, so I guess I am still mourning the loss of alcohol and still haven't fully accepted that this is the reality of the situation.

I feel like I have to put myself in those situations to live a normal life. I can't live like a hermit anytime a social situation arises just because I don't have booze now or what kind of life is that anyway? Not to mention, I can never prove to myself or get better at doing things without it if I have zero experience in doing so. And the amount of time that I've gone without it almost makes for a more depressing perspective because how long am I supposed to wait? It just feels like that burning desire is never going to leave me, and that's a sad, sad, sad realization. It just shifted my entire perspective and made me realize that if I looked ahead into the future and saw myself with a beer in my hand, there would be no surprise. I'm just not as far along in all of this as I thought, and to truly be able to see that sucks really hard after all of this work I've put in. I thought I had come a long way, and now it just doesn't feel that way at all.


Despite all of this and in spite of it, I didn't drink. I didn't fucking drink....",28

I've been having a pretty bad time the last few days; long story short, I quit my job out of frustration before I had another one 100% lined up, and it looks like the new position is going to fall through. I was feeling extremely down on myself last night, but I kept coming back to to same thought:

""This would be so much worse if I weren't sober.""

I'm still here, I'm still not drinking, and no matter how bad things get, at least I can still have that. Good days remind me how much better things have gotten since I quit, and that's awesome, but nobody has good days every day; that's just unrealistic. I'm thankful for these bad days as well; not only are they tests of will, they too remind me that things really have gotten better. My lowest sober low is still leagues better than even an average drunk day ever was. And that's pretty cool, all things considered.

I'm feeling a tiny bit better about everything this morning, so I wanted to post my thoughts just in case anyone else is having a rough time today. You are most certainly not alone, but we're all going to get through this together.

He was a drinking buddy but is first and foremost a friend and supports what's best for me. Plus, he's seen me completely blacked out and acting fucky so I think he was tired of some of it. Don't blame him lol.

But yesterday I was telling him about 40 days being the longest I had gone being sober probably in the last decade. He looked at me quizzically and asked what about 3 years ago? We took 2-3 months off. I had completely forgotten. I still don't fully remember all of it, but I do know it happened. Crazy.

And that got me thinking. Over the past 15 years there is much that is just a fog. So many blank spaces. My life. Gone.

There is no benefit to this poison. It's an adddict that lives in your house, your temple, rent free and steals all your shit.

A few weeks later I'd be back here asking for a badge reset. I'm not sure what clicked this time, but after I got past 90 days it got so much easier. The first year was the hardest, year two and three was easy, and this year I feel like not drinking is the normal, but it has definitely been a challenging year. I've thought about drinking a lot more than I did in the previous years, that's for sure, but I'm glad I never really gave it too much thought.

Not sure why I'm posting in here, after not posting here in ages, but I guess I just wanted to give a little hope for the newly sober folks. It DOES get a LOT easier.

I never drank in high school due to pretty strict parents and a tiny school system.  When I went to college I slowly opened up to it and became more of a pro.  I could drink most under the table and I took pride in it.  I also got to experience sex for the first time, and while I wouldn't try to describe myself as a ""pro,"" I did make the most of it.  It was really important to me, and the intertwining of drinking and sex didn't really connect to me at that time.  I would say my priorities in college were 1. Sex 2. Drinking 3. a bunch of other stuff 4. Academics.   I look back on college fondly.

My wife and I met in college... we were on and off through college and got married several years after.  Our sex life was always electric.  Obviously, this is a personal view, I'm not suggesting it was better than anyone else's sex life, but for us it was a huge part of our lives.  We could always get each other going and usually exhaust each other in a great way.

We had children and though our lives changed with the added responsibilities, we kept focus on us.  We always felt that the best way raise kids is to make sure they knew that their parents valued their relationship as much as the relationship with the kids.  I know that may not be a universal truth, but we felt that way.  We loved our children and would do anything for them, but date nights happened every week, if possible.  I traveled a lot, so it was even more important that my wife and I connect on the weekends.

Date nights were usually dinner and drinks.   Usually a nice cocktail (for me usually a high octane Manhattan or martini) and then split a bottle of wine over dinner (maybe some port or sauternes after?)  Usually we'd have some wine when we got home.  Lots of sloppy sex usually followed, it was great!

As issues in life became more complicated (teenagers, college, kids with depression, other issues) drinking became more of a crutch.  I was also traveling more and I'd knock back a fifth of something over a couple of nights away.  Never huge, but every once and a while I couldn't perform after date night... I'm getting older... it happens.

Fast forward (I know this is long and you'd have probably rather I fast forwarded sooner!) to the pandemic.  Now I'm home... all the time and college age kids are home and my wife is home.  Weird times, we're lucky to be healthy, but weird times.  Anyway, I manage the weirdness with drinking in the evenings... lots of it.  It gets to the point I'm blacking out regularly.  Also, the sex has stopped.  I've lost all confidence in my ability.  It doesn't take too many whiffs in the bedroom to rock your confidence.  My wife thinks I've lost interest in her, she's too old, too ugly, too whatever (none of which is true, but it is hard to prove when you're not performing.)

A week ago Sunday, after a particularly embarrassing night in the bedroom, I just decided to stop drinking entirely and start taking exercise more seriously (C25K)... I scheduled a full physical in early October and started working towards it.  Ever heard that story before?  Hey, I've told that story before, but now I'm on day 9 of no drinking and my wife and I had the best sex in years last night.  My wife and I are on a completely new wavelength after just one night like that.

I was so in my head before, I thought I was broken.  I would never perform again.  I would have to sort out what a sexless marriage meant to us.  This is a mind altering thing for me, I realize I'm not broken, that I can show my wife how I really feel about her, and selfishly, I can feel how she feels about me.

Anyway, I'm not sure why I'm writing this, other than to say my path to stop drinking was through sex, or the lack there of.  I am only 9 days in.  I'm not declaring victory, I was out with friends yesterday and those IPAs looked amazing, but I didn't drink them.  Who knows what tonight/tomorrow will bring, but right now, I'm not drinking and I feel great about it.",11

I don't savor it, I don't stop when I feel dizzy, I get wasted and black out. And something happened this last saturday that just won't leave my mind.

I went out on a date with a girl I've been talking to for the last few weeks. She lives about seven hours away and came to visit her parents over the extended weekend. Before we met, I went to have lunch with some friends and ended up drinking for about six hours straight. When I finally went on to meet my date, I was pretty drunk already. Got to the restaurant before she did and ordered a beer... She got there and my God, we just clicked. She's gorgeous, smart as hell, has this wonderful heart-melting smile, and I was drunk. We spent the night together. 

I woke up hungover. Hungover and afraid, and ashamed. What did I say to her? Did I do anything that would scare her off? Probably, I mean, if I barely remember all of our night together... But she sent me a message. Two, actually, pretty long ones. She loved our time together, thought I was charming and fun, and admited to having feelings for me.

And I just wanna fucking cry. This woman diserves better from me, and I myself also need to be better for myself. I wanna fucking cry because I don't really remember our talks, our sex, cuddling and being intimate. And I want to. I wanna make her happy and remember her laugh the next day, no headache, no shame, just the memory of us happy together. 

Alcohol is a great mean shadow that's been casted over myself and my relationships for too long. It's my monster, my demon, it haunts and drags me down with it. And I cannot lose something so beautiful and meaningful to such an ugly addiction. I am an alcoholic, and I'll always be. But I don't have to go through this again. I don't know if I'm gonna make it on my first try, if I'm gonna commit like I should, but I'll start my fight against this monster and shame of mine.",9

I've had enough. I always say this. But this time I don't even feel anxious about quitting, or scared, or daunted. I'm just really chilled out about it all which is weird!

Is it the end or is it the beginning?,"I have always enjoyed a bit of the ripple here and there, but I’ve noticed that over the past two years, but drinking became problematic, that is to mean both in intensity and also frequency.  Did some shit happen a couple of years ago which probably exacerbated this behavior? You bet it did, but I’m not going to get into all of that right now.  

The point is, a couple of weeks ago I had reached the point where I was feeling like absolute shit EVERY DAY.  I was starting to realize that this was untenable. I cannot be getting fucked up each and every night.  In retrospect, after a couple of weeks off of the sauce, here is what I have observed for myself:

1. I was saying a lot of dumb shit out loud, that I would not have said otherwise.

2. While I thought being fucked up would lead to more and better creativity, sure, I was coming up with crazy ideas, but most of them were not good.

3. Most people in my life had no idea what was happening.  I was, for the most part, a completely under the radar “functioning” drunk.  

4. Waking up sober as fuck is amazing.

5. I probably destroyed a couple of personal relationships with my behavior.

My original plan was to go two weeks without drinking, just to make sure that I could.  That was not easy, by god.  However, people at work, while not aware of my little journey, have noticed huge positive changes in me, even if I didn’t.  My hair and skin are better and I am back to old, smart ass self, quick witted and I feel like my brain is working again.  After 14 days I had originally planned to, I don’t know, actually.  I didn’t really have a plan, except to not drink.  At this point though, I figured that I may as well stick it out.  After the headaches subsided, the only other real symptoms that I noticed were anxiety and a little bit of depression, but I’m pretty sure that was there before and I was probably self medicating. I don’t know, because I don’t go to group meetings and I haven’t been to a therapist in forever, so I couldn’t really say.  

What I can say is that I feel fucking amazing and I feel like I’m just going to go ahead and stick this out for a while longer, because in all honesty, the only real thing that I’ve experienced is the mental trick of boredom, as in like “What in THE HELL do people do when they are not drinking?”, yes boredom is fucking boring sometimes, but it beats being hungover, and I’m at the stage where I’m kind of not missing being drunk.  

I’m not saying that I’ll never drink again, who knows, but I’m not drinking today and I have no plans to do so in the very foreseeable future.

My perspective is one I've learned from the quit-lit books; that everyone is on the same trajectory with alcohol. You become addicted to an addictive substance over time, it's not that crazy. Given enough time and resources everyone will become an ""alcoholic"" and certain biological factors just contribute to how that plays out.

Ok, that last line is bullshit, food/nicotine and caffeine have definitely filled some dark moments, I’m still a work in progress. I’m grateful for the time I’ve accrued and the beautiful opportunities sobriety has let me take advantage of. There are some days, even weeks, that I struggle hard but it always circles back to gratitude and content. IWNDWYT",41

Tapering seems to be more difficult than I expected. I’ve been reading this for about 2 weeks. Not completely sober but striving to be.. Hopefully this is an exception to the rules.,5

I have always had anxiety and depression, but I could control it.  Then last year something happened (I don't know exactly what) that caused me to just unravel.  I'll skip all the nonsense that followed, but things were really bad for me at the time.

I started to do some really erratic things, made really stupid decisions, and I was simply not myself.  I didn't have health insurance and I didn't even know where to go to get help!  When I finally *did* get help I was still so unraveled and impatient that I needed a quick fix.  So I experimented with vodka.

I ended up losing my first job (unrelated to the alcohol) was a moderate drinker for a couple of months until I found job #2.  I craved vodka while I worked there, but one day I drank some cranberry juice and it actually helped curb those cravings.  I was very busy with that job and simply didn't have time to drink alcohol.  I ended up being sober for two months.

But that was a temp job, and I lost it in January.  First thing I did was start drinking lots of whiskey.  First, whole pints in a day - then fifths+ in a day.  I would go a few days without it at times, but my anxiety and depression got so bad that I *had* to get some alcohol before I did something really erratic and stupid again.  I managed to go one whole month without, but then I spiraled into depression again and I went right back to the bottle.  But I went back to drinking pints, not fifths+.

I have a new job now, and I hoped it would help me slow down.  It hasn't.  I still drink whole pints in a day, and I refuse to buy a fifth because I *know* I will drink the whole thing in a day.  I bought two pints on Saturday (so I could have one on Sunday) but I drank both of them on Saturday.

Maybe that was a good thing, because I was sober all yesterday.  I'm sober right now.  But I am so afraid that my anxiety and depression is going to come crashing back down on me.  I'm afraid I'm gonna go crazy again.  And I'm afraid it's going to cost me my job.",7

But over the past few months I've regularly found myself drinking when other people are because:- it's felt rude to say ""no"";- I want them to like me and I'm worried they won't if I don't drink;- I don't want to have to field all the questions/curious looks/teasing about me not drinking. The truth is my dad was an alcoholic, I have to work hard not to be there, and other addictions, mainly eating disorders of most shades, swallowed up a good chunk of my twenties (I'm 32f).

Does anyone have any tips on how I can say no?

I had no idea how much my casual, consistent, drinking had been holding me back. I’m amazed. I feel like non-drinking is a superpower I’ve just discovered.  Thanks to you all for the support.   
Advantages I’m feeling from not drinking:  

* I feel more consistent happiness through the day (vs. just at night due to drinking) 
* I’m able to be more present with my two children 
* I’m able to be more helpful to my family  
* No more waking up with stomach aches, feeling bloated, tired, anxious, ashamed 
* I’m making more progress on my creative side projects  
* Because I wake up earlier and have more time at night it’s adding \~3 more productive hours to my day!  
* I feel like my “old” personality is back. The one I had in college.  
* Waking up earlier than normal and rested  
* 70% less anxiety 
* I now consistently remember my dreams 

Next milestones I’d like to hit:  

* 31 days: this will be the longest sober of my entire adult life. 11 more days! 
* 90 Days: 3 months, hot damn 
* 150 more days: my 40th birthday

My no isn’t enough to them.

For all those who have been trying to quit, or who are early in the process: it's totally worth it! Tell your significant other, or anyone, about what you are doing - it helps you to maintain some accountability. So long as you are accountable only to yourself, it is all too easy to pack it in.

I could compile a long, long list of the benefits of life as a non-drinker - there is no downside (aside from the odd trigger, but those are fainter than before). I am now heading into my final year of work, with retirement tentatively planned for the fall of 2021. I have a lot of plans, and none involve alcohol!

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

&#x200B;

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning, SD family - welcome to the Monday edition of the Daily Check-In.  We're really freakin' glad you're here! 

So...how was your weekend?  Whether you're returning home from holiday break or gearing up to head back to work today, the fact of the matter remains: it's still Monday, and we've all got stuff going on.  With this in mind, we're going to keep today's post easy and light. 

&#x200B;

Tell me - **what's a bit of good news, or something positive in your life?**  Maybe you've got something you're itching to announce but have to keep it a secret from your friends and family IRL (so naturally, share it with your friends here on the interwebs, of course!)  Or, perhaps you've reached a milestone - in sobriety, or even just in life in general.  Doesn't matter if we're talking grand-scale (*""I developed a cure for cancer!""*) or on a more personal level (*""I didn't stab anybody today!""*)  

I'll go first: since I quit drinking a little over two months ago, I've been immersing myself more in the things that make me happy again.  Playing the drums, singing more, getting off my ass and getting out there and just *doing* stuff: going for walks, working out, staying the hell off of TV and social media (other than reddit) ... I even went kayaking this weekend for the third time ever - it was freakin' amazing! I'm totally hooked.  

I gotta tell ya, I feel SO much happier in general. Not every single moment will be sunshine and daisies, of course... but when I feel good overall, I want to keep on doing good things, and sobriety's a HUGE part of that ... and so the cycle continues on.  It's a beautiful thing. 

&#x200B;

So lay it on me, SD.  What's going on in your slice of the world?   Gimme the good stuff!  

And last, but certainly not least:  IWNDWYT.  

Now go forth and kick some ass, my friends!  :-)",111

Everyone knew ahead of time that I would be sober and they seemed to be understanding. I wasn't sure if I was going to go at all. But I decided to test my willpower.

So I load up on 3 liters of soda stream and head out.

I get there and the first thing out of the host's mouth is the question of why I'm not drinking. I explain myself and she seems to understand but then immediately says ""...and there's beer and booze over there. Help yourself."" I got a teensy bit snippy and said, ""We literally just talked about this!"". She was already a bit loaded and apologized. lol

After an hour or so of normal talk, the conversations started to revolve around stories of drugs and alcohol. It was funny for a while and I shared a few of mine. But the more they went on, the less funny they became. The more I saw the dysfunction. This is a new realization! Usually, by this time at a gathering, I'm feeling the buzz come on and these conversations are normal. ...And quite entertaining. 

Over the last almost two weeks now, I've started to live each day with more of a meaning and feeling quite good. And as much as I love these people, my friends, tonight these stories are not fun for me. They are quite the opposite. They made me almost uncomfortable. 

I thought maybe I would get the urge to join in the imbibing, but I didn't for a second want that tonight. I was completely fine sipping on my flavored spicy water. I did have fun.

I’m amazed at how empowering it has been to stay sober in situations where I thought alcohol was a necessity. However, an upcoming girls trip has me questioning if I can or if I actually want to stay sober for it. Part of me feels as though I’d like to keep the option open to drink when traveling. Another part of me wonders if I’m subconsciously making an excuse for something that I can’t actually give up. This trip was planned months ago, long before I knew I’d be sober. Had I known I wouldn’t be drinking, I’m not sure I would have committed to it as wine tours are a big component of this trip.

I suppose my question is - do you or have you ever made specific allowances for drinking? Did it work in the long run?",12

The routine is every two or three days I will down a pint of my favorite poison-of-the-week and a couple of tall boys, play some video games, send a few embarrassing texts, and hopefully pass out on my bed instead of the couch.  

My brain rationalizes this behavior with the idea that ""Oh, there's worse alcoholics out there.  You don't drink before 6 PM, you don't drive drunk, you don't even get mad when you're drunk.  You're OK.""  

But it's not.  I've gained an incredible amount of weight from this, my job performance has suffered, my relationships have exploded.  And I know it's going to get worse.  There's going to be the night my side explodes with pain and I'm taken to a hospital because of acute liver failure.  It's inevitable at this rate.

I can swear oaths before God, I could write contracts in blood with Satan, I've even permanently scarred my left arm with a chef's knife as a juvenile ""reminder"" to never put myself through this again.  Nothing works.  

It's always day three or four.  It's the reasonable face of my addiction I can't seem to argue against.  That ""tonight's OK, you can have some fun, and tomorrow you may feel a little shitty but you'll bounce back.""  

Anybody out there feel this?  Get it?  Faced it and found a counter-argument?  What stops you when the addiction makes it feel so reasonable?",9

I've been in and out of the hospital 7 times now trying to stop and needing medical help to do so. My girl ended up leaving me a little over a month ago because of it. I already wanted to quit and had failed over and over but that situation gave me the push I think I needed to be more serious. We made amends and she came back.  I'm 26 days. Not much I guess but for me I'm almost feeling proud. No cravings no slip ups. I talked with my girl about her drinking and made it clear that it doesn't bother me because it doesn't. But today when she laid down next to me it's all I could smell and it made me a bit sick. I politely explained and I guess because of her being drunk she just lost it saying she had to smell it on me for years and cussing me for all I've done when drunk. It solidifies why I don't want to drink anymore for sure but her words are kinda crushing me. Idk. I guess I needed to vent somewhere and you guys know what's up. Sorry for the rant.,17

I have some observations about sobriety so far... please add yours if you have any? I would love to share some sober side effects with you! Especially the good ones!

My house is really clean. I don’t just come home, open a bottle, and sit on my ass until bedtime anymore. I notice the mess and I have the energy and drive to do something about it. This is my favourite sober side effect. 

My emotions are incredibly intense and feeling them without alcohol is really, really hard. 

I don’t sleep very well and I wonder when the last time I actually slept well was? (and wasn’t just passed out, woke up at 3, woke up at 6, had a shame shower, and was hung over all day)

My mouth is really really dry all the time and I drink a lot of water 

I have lost some bloating in my tummy and I fit into my favourite jeans!

I am picking up hobbies I used to really enjoy. I’m drawing again. 

Being able to drive whenever I want (even after 3pm) is pretty great. 

Despite all of this I have a weird particular sense of boredom- like somehow I would enjoy my regular activities more if only I had a drink in my hand? Like drawing or watching movies or reading or playing video games just doesn’t *sparkle* like it used to. How have you overcome this deception that the goblin in your brain tells you? Does it go away? Did I really used to enjoy talking to my friends more after four drinks???",22

It was hot.  It was hard work.  I'm sore as all hell.  


Friends are gone, truck is returned.   



I sit alone in my new home and crack open an ice cold Perrier.    I bought a few beer for the friends who helped me move.    The thought of having one briefly crossed my mind, but now because it was cold on a hot day.    I reached for the Perrier instead.    


Just as satisfied.  


More so I'd say, no one judged me or even really commented on it.  

 Moving day beers was an unwritten law amongst my friends.    And it went by without temptation.

Some of my best memories in life are whille been on the piss. I couldn't imagine birthdays, holidays and Christmas without drinking! 
Drinking as always got me in trouble in the past having been convicted for drink driving twice and been arrested a couple of times for drink related offences.. 
At the minute I've had a drink nearly everyday for the last 3 months. Between 2 - 4 pints.. previous to that I stayed sober for 1 month so I know I can do it.  Yesterday I said I was going to try and stay sober for the next 7 days and then take it from there. Today all I've been able to think about is having a pint! (Which I did) dont feel as though I have a problem yet but I'm on a downhill slope.

I've had many nights of waking up with bruised legs and shit like that and that never got me down. I had horrible WD for the first time a week ago. My partner had to wake me up because I was gasping for air. Once I woke up, I couldn't even catch my breath for at least 25 seconds. It scared the shit out of me. Then the shakes and jaw clenching. I felt like I was about to have a full blown your-face-is-left-drooped seizure. 

I'm in a better space today. Counting days gives me anxiety because I feel like I am trying to beat the clock but my 1st goal is to chill until December, get my insides checked,  then I will set a new goal. 

Anyway, we all drink for a reason and just want to talk about how I found an awesome therapist who used to work at a rehab. She is really a gem and I am happy I found her. Today was my first session with her and I am actually looking forward to the work I will put in with her. I know it will helppp!

I love coming on here every day reading everyone's stories. I really appreciate each person that is open and honest about drinking, sharing their stories and shit. Good ass vibes. It helps me to know I am NOT ALONE.

Today I realized I have a drinking problem.," My drinking has accelerated greatly the past few months. The pandemic has been difficult for me, throwing me out of the routine I had and keeping at home much more often than I’d like. I’ve been stressed with school and was on the brink of getting removed due to COVID related stuff. Things have gotten a lot better for me the past 3 weeks, but the drinking still persists. I haven’t gone longer than 3 days without a drink. 

I’ve done things that I am quite ashamed to admit. The other night, I finished the 3 beers I had left in the fridge and started to work on the whiskey that my roommate left out. I never touch his stuff, but with the beer already in me, any ounce of restraint I had just diminished. I finished a 1/4th of the bottle, and you know what I did after? I got a fucking funnel and filled it back up with water so it looked like I never touched it. Talk about a red flag. I wasn’t even satisfied after that, so I went to the gas station down the street and bought a couple of tall cans. Hit the spot. Goodnight.

I am ashamed of myself. When I stop to think about it, I have covered up my drinking a lot lately. Rather than throw beer cans in the recyclables bin, I have been throwing them directly in the large trash cans outside so my roommates doesn’t see empty containers of alcohol in the bin everyday he walks in the kitchen. Two days ago during a small get together at my house, my girlfriend asked me where I left the tequila I bought. I told her I didn’t like it and gave it to my mom. What really had happened was I poured it down my bathroom tub because I knew having my own bottle of liquor was a bad idea. The thing would’ve been gone in 3 days if I hadn’t done that. She is stopping by in a couple hours to drop off something, and I am worried she is going to ask about taking home the leftover drinks she bought for our little party the other day. I drank it all yesterday, so once again I am going to lie and say me and my two buddies drank it.

My self control is so very low. I CANNOT have alcohol of my own in my house, because I always feel compelled to finish it as soon as I can. Like if there is some time limit on it and if I don’t finish it fast enough, it will disappear. If it weren’t for those beers of mine, that whiskey wouldn’t be diluted right now. I don’t even like whiskey. But all it takes is one drink and I just go down a hole, justifying every dumb decision I make.  At times I also have this thought in my head I “deserve” to drink. Oh, you had a long shift? You deserve a beer. Hey, you actually studied for one hour today? Pop open a cold one, bud. What the fuck is wrong with me?

I guess I thought I didn’t have a problem, because I didn’t fit that typical image of a person with a problem. I don’t get black out drunk. I don’t make a fool of myself when I drink with others. I don’t need alcohol to function normally. But underneath it all, there is the itch. That little reminder of the warmth and comfort that comes from a good drink. It is something I look forward to and chase when I can. No one can see what's going on with me, but that doesn't mean the problem isn't real. 

I don't know how I am going to do this. I go a few days sober and then feel the need to reward myself and it starts all over again. Wish me luck.",53

I don't want my children growing up under an alcoholic someday.

But, man, I have been horribly depressed the last 6 days or so and it is becoming a little much for me emotionally... one day at a time I suppose.

30s, female, UK. 

I hardly drank at uni - and when i did start to feel drunk I didn’t like it and would stop.

After this I lived alone and with the evenings by myself I would buy a bottle of wine - “because I can”. 

This then went to socialising after work in the pub and then buying more to have when I got home. 

It then became clear I couldn’t just have a drink. It was binge drinking every single night. The longest I have gone is two weeks without back in October 2012. That has shocked me. 

Since then I tried again - only managing a few days each time. 

It then became a habit. I knew i was drinking far too much but lockdown made it worse it went from wine to bottles of spirits. 

I have gone from a girl who could go without wearing make up to needing to

I was so upset I almost drank but I told myself to take a 20 minute walk first.

When I came back, the troll had been banned and literally 50 some odd people had upvoted my question. By the next day, hundreds had and many had given helpful suggestions. 

It was a positive lesson and I stayed sober for 7 months afterwards, until a few weeks into Covid. Our IRL sobriety can be like this sometimes - except we don’t see the upvotes. We often only hear the lone idiot’s comments outside a meeting. But there are literally thousands of people rooting for you and would tell you if they knew you. It’s hard to focus on the intangible thousands you may never meet- but they are literally more real than the trolls and the problems that make you want to drink.

It took a while to get comfortable enough to get to the dance floor, but when I finally got comfortable, I actually had a lot of fun dancing like a fool! Everyone else was drunk, but we all still had a really good time. 

I’m not showing much, so many people didn’t know I’m pregnant, but a tonic water with lime looks just like a G&T/vodka soda/vodka tonic/ etc. so no one called attention to it anyway. 

I would have previously been plastered and saying inappropriate stuff to “keep up” with my guy friends, falling over and totally stressing the next day. Instead, I was the friend I know I should have been this entire time, fully present, there for my friends if they needed anything, fully thinking through conversation and jokes, and not to mention, a wife my husband can be proud of. 

I cannot stress how much fun it was ESPECIALLY with no regret or stress the next day (my legs are a little sore from dancing though!). I’m seriously so happy, I could cry.

(6 plus drinks a night usually)

So I’ve noticed my anxiety is not all of the way gone, but I can rationalize and deal with it better now. I can “talk myself down” from anxious thoughts. 

I am FEELING everything for the first time in awhile. Anger, sadness, guilt, grief... also though I am feeling true happy feelings. My brain is working again! I chalk these feelings up to success, because before I would just “drown” them out. I am cranky and snappy sometimes, but I am working on improving my overall mood little by little. 

I am sleeping better, but soooo tired sometimes. I for some reason thought I would just have this insane amount of energy, but some days all I can do is go to work and not drink, and that’s a successful day. I’ve realized my body and mind are healing and that I need to be nice and kind to it.

My to do list is shorter and more manageable because I am not putting stuff off day after day. I am following through with the things I commit to.

I am being kinder to myself, resting more. Relaxing, reading. I think this is because I used to overcompensate for my drinking by always “doing” because if I was doing something I was not a failure or an alcoholic. Spoiler alert: I was. 

My skin looks great and my bloat is going away it seems like daily. This is I’m sure because I’m not drinking, but also because I don’t pass out before I do my skin routine. I’m also wearing my retainer every night so my teeth have never looked better! 

I’m making better food choices. I’ve lost 7 pounds and haven’t really done much other than make better choices here and there... I also have been eating a lot of ice cream/dessert so I’m going to focus on that in month two, reel that in, if you will. 

I am peeing all of the time?! I guess I didn’t expect this... but like all of the time. I am drinking a lot more I guess... a lot more water, coffee, seltzer etc. so I guess that’s why. I did however schedule myself for some blood work next week just to be safe, so I will eventually report back on that after this coming Saturday.

Feel like it fits and I struggled with a title, so. Here I am. I'm ready to start day 1.","Hi. This is an account I made specifically to post in this sub. I don't post much on Reddit because I have severe social anxiety and people can just be mean. I'm just looking for support.

I'm 31 and I have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. I've always ""justified"" my drinking with ANY reason. (I had a rough day at work, I had a great thing happen, I'm bored, I can't sleep...) I only became aware of the lies I told myself in recent years and it's still taken me til now to just STOP masking my addiction to alcohol with some lame reason to drink. I had trouble understanding what people might call a ""functioning alcoholic"" Like, I don't drink through the day, but i get WASTED most nights and usually by myself and never leave a drop and I cleaned my room the other week and found about 10 empty wine bottles. (I knew they were there, just not how many and I just... ignored them but they taunted me every so often.) 

Also, I did originally join this sub in my main account and even created one of those flair things where it keeps track of how many days I was sober. It keeps sending notifications that my flair has been updated and it is currently at 65 days. But it's eating me up because I only stopped drinking for 21 days. I decided I could minimize or moderate my alcohol consumption, i guess, because ""look! You did 21 whole days!"" I'm an idiot. Haha I just ended up binging again. 

But anyway, now I'm here and I wanna get a new one that starts today as day one. I want to fucking stop drinking. Please send good vibes and advice and anecdotes that helped you.

Well I’m not normally a daily drinker, I usually go on a binge once ever 3-4 days. So I took naltrexone, waited an hour, and drank anywhere from 3-8 drinks for 5 days in a row.

I felt like such crap, drinking isn’t appealing at all. I have gone 6 days without drinking and there is beer in my fridge I haven’t touched.. 

It definitely took away all the endorphins I got from drinking and just left me in the same mood, but drunk.

Usually drinking makes me really fricken happy and I’m super social and just love life for that time. This took it all away. I hope it lasts- I’ll never drink w out naltrexone again.

Wow; what a very honest and accurate perspective of the reality of alcoholism IMO.

We are so often mislead by movies, ads, music and TV about the glamorous and cool side of drinking. Bars are beautiful, hip places filled with gorgeous people. A handsome person, clearly smart, fit and intelligent sips a drink out of an expensive glass while making thoughtful conversation.

This movie brought it back to reality. The loneliness of drinking, the solitary act itself and how it cannot exist socially, to the extent that I used to drink anyway. The way the bars were actually functional and not elegant, instead chosen to ensure that only drinks poured, and not judgement. 

The more accurate view of drinking alone at home; how it was constant: one after the other with no end in sight, always needing one more.  I never used to drink in the morning but I imagine that was how it would end up, starting the day drinking in the shower.

The darkness that existed that I felt sure would be resolved with another drink but was only fuelled by it.

So difficult to watch, and it made me cringe in certain parts, when i saw myself in the character and was embarrassed by what I saw but proud of what I had achieved; one year sober. 

Would never have achieved that without this group, listening to your stories and the challenges we are all going through together. The movie reminded me just how real the struggle is and how difficult this addiction it is to break, but that it is possible, and life is so much better without it.

Stay strong everyone.",11

I decided it was time to get sober and here's what I've learned:

\- My friends have been unwaveringly supportive and are friends with or without alcohol (even my previous hard-core drinking buddies).

\- I can go to a bar with friends, drink my soda water and still have a good time (and have a good time the next day not hungover). Alcohol doesn't make me fun. People still like me when I'm sober. 

\- I'm fully back on the exercise and healthy eating train. The only soreness I woke up with today was from my 5-mile run and yoga class yesterday. I used ingredients in my fridge to cook a lovely meal rather than spending money on takeout. 

\- My mom has been the most skeptical, saying things like: you'll drink for the holidays, right? I don't think you have a problem. She doesn't seem to accept that I've accepted my unhealthy relationship with alcohol. (Side note: most of my extended family are heavy drinkers to alcoholics so maybe it's just strange having someone admit it?? Or even to have someone not want to drink??)

\- My relationship with alcohol is unhealthy and I don't need it in my life. I shouldn't feel any guilt for not wanting to put poison in my body.

I realized why I started drinking and my triggers. Once I had, it kinda pissed me off that I let a toxic relationship continue to influence my life. But, I figured it out and I'm grateful.

This past Friday I went to a friend's house where they were drinking wine and I didn't feel the least inclined. But a tip? I had a water bottle with me. So having that drink with me helped with the social aspect.

I know that's just in my head, but it's another source of anxiety. 

Today has planned 2 meetings, a family event, and then all the regular ""take a shower, get dressed, do chores, stay active stuff"". Since getting home I've tried to maintain a similar schedule of operation as we used at the shelter and its definitely beneficial.

Back in my drinking/drugging days I wouldn't get super-stressed out about much because I would get the feeling of instant relief from drinking some beers/shots and getting high on marijuana. That would numb me and ""turn my brain off"" for the rest of the night. At the least it would ""turn down the volume"" and slow down my thoughts so I wouldn't be stressed about every random thing that popped into my head.

Being sober it's hard to find that instant relief. It's usually just family/household stress but being somewhat quarantined for half a year, I feel like I'm finally at a breaking point. I want that instant relief. I want to turn my brain off for a little while. I just want to slow myself down, turn the volume down. I don't really know how.",21

I've stopped checking my counter daily and it's kinda freaking neat to see that. Surprised me a bit. I've survived my birthday(25!), unemployment, a messy situation-ship breakup (?), the collective pandemic anxiety, a camping trip, a trip home to visit my family of alcoholics, and several other high risk situations. And also, two weeks into a new college program. Can you believe one of my city's community colleges has got a program called Alcohol and Other Drug Studies? lucky me!

I'm actually doing pretty damn good so far. Somehow. Finally. Mostly just wanted to post to keep myself accountable. Okay and *maybe* brag on myself a bit. I don't have a real life sober support system yet. In fact, my friends kinda often forget that I'm sober now. I'm working on that though. Psyching myself up to attend a meeting for the first time. And to anyone on those first, sweaty, tearful, hours, days or weeks: I can't wait for you to experience being on other side. It's fucking rad. 🌈",21

I discovered I couldn't quit as easily as everyone else.

Fast forward a few years with a terrible relationship, a late diagnosis for Aspergers and incomprehensible people, and there I am bottoming at least one bottle of wine every evening, with a lot more during weekends. 

Buying a house a year ago, starting a new job (teaching again) and then Covid with isolation didn't do me any good. I don't experience empathy in a way most people do and social contacts drain me completely, but man did I underestimate the need for people.

So after spending the summer holidays mostly wasted and feeling like crap, gaining weight and being bored AF, I quit drinking two weeks ago as schools were starting. 

I didn't want me to feel like I didn't get a grasp on what was happening, something a teacher truly needs.

The first week, I slept terrible. I knew that would happen. After two terrible nights I started taking extra melatonin to get a decent sleeping rhythm. It helped a lot. Feeling fit in the morning gets me through the day.

The changes are massive. Lost 3cm on my stomach already, I can cycle 1,5hrs to school each day, I keep sleeping better and longer every night and can continue to work for 12+ hours every day and feel a more deeper connection to people, interacting more effortlessly.

Not to mention the time I have left on evenings and the last two weekends, and the extra money I have already saved.

I was most worried about my best mate's bachelor party and his wedding, but that was amazing without being pissed. Not to mention having two whole weekends, where I normally needed to regain my strength.

And that's only on two weeks. I wish I did this years ago when I was studying.",3

I want to be the best i can be for my kids. I want to be a faster cyclist. I want to spend more time working on some photography projects. Don’t need to be spending so much money on cheap whiskey and wine.

I worry about withdrawal symptoms, but when i did dry January earlier this year i was fine. No issues. I took a few days off a couple weeks ago and was fine too. I don’t know why i worry about it and use it as an excuse to postpone quitting.

It's hard for me to understand how so many people can go through these descriptions I'll have on my own, see on this forum, and hear in those rooms; but not get the results that I am so desperate to receive. 

I can study every academic I've peared at, I'm excellent in the trade I practice for a living, but no matter how hard I try, I've failed every attempt to stop drinking myself out of reality. As many of us werw raised to be strong and persevere in moments of struggle and failure; it's hard to see any purpose in a task where no ground is gained after countless years.

For those who have found that tempo, that ability to keep going, do not lose it. I can try my best as a man defeated so many times to tell you that it is likely you've forgotten just how dark and rotten the bottom truly is.

I sit here, trying again, against all previous odds, speaking my mind in a place where I can be together and alone at the same time. Back at ground zero, I hope that any passing by wonder to themselves ""is it worth it?"". Yes. Yes it is. It is so worthy that after ten thousand failures I will continue to try until I myself can finally stand on those fields of freedom.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

&#x200B;

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

One of the first comedy albums I ever loved as a kid was Robin Williams, *A Night at the Met.*

*(the crowd applauds as Robin takes a sip of his water)*

Robin:  “Damn!  A little sip of Perrier here… I had to stop drinking alcohol because I used to wake up nude in front of my car with my keys in my ass.”

&#x200B;

(The SD mods are looking at each other thinking *“ahh shit, who gave Siren the keys to the DCI??”*)

&#x200B;

😇

&#x200B;

Now that I have your attention:  welcome to the SD Daily Check-In, Sunday Edition!

&#x200B;

Whether you’re a seasoned veteran to the DCI, brand-spankin’ new, or maybe you only pop in occasionally … it doesn’t matter:  everyone is welcome!  **We’re glad you’re here.**

Visit us anytime you need - daily, twice daily, every 10 minutes, maybe half past the even hours throughout the day, when the moon is in the Seventh House and Jupiter collides with Mars (oh wait, no, that’s ALIGNS with Mars, my bad) …the time and frequency with which you visit matters not, my friends.

Regardless of where you are on your sobriety journey, you will always be welcome here. Daily regulars, occasional posters, lurkers, third lurkers twice removed….EVERYONE is welcome here.

&#x200B;

If you’re in the United States, we’re smack dab in the middle of another Labor Day holiday weekend.  Holidays are triggers for some of us, others seem to sail right through.  How are you getting through your holiday weekend, sobernauts?

If you’re struggling, what challenges are you facing and how are you trying to work through them?  For those of us who have tricks and methods that never fail us, or have any ideas you’d like to share, show us what ya got!

One of the treats I like most:  sugar free ginger beer with a splash of pear nectar over crushed ice, then add frozen blackberries.  You can even throw on some fresh mint if you’re feeling fancy.

It’s friggin’ delicious … and guaranteed to NOT be the cause of me waking up nude in front of my car with my keys in my ass.  Nah - if that happens, it’s completely of my own accord.

Have a great day, everyone - and stay safe out there!   IWNDWYT.

Every weekend, I wake up thinking I’m done. Why did I just spend my weekend nights getting drunk alone when I know I would regret it? I feel like shit, I’m unmotivated, I’m bloated, and I don’t want to do any of the weekend projects I had in mind all week.. 

I don’t drink during the week, and i tell myself it’s fine, because I do a fantastic job at work and everyone likes me.. but.. deep down, I think they know. When I first started my job I was in good shape, I was on top of my game, everyone knew I was a go getter.. now, I still accomplish my goals, I stay on task, but I spend the first part of the week recovering. I think people can tell.. I tell myself I’m just paranoid and no one knows.. but I bet they do.. i don’t think people respect me as much anymore..

My wife knows.. she ignores it. Doesn’t bring it up.. but it affects us. She wants us to go do things. She wants us to have fun on the weekends. She wants the old me back.. the one she married..

But I’m fucking stuck in this habit. Every weekend. Same thing. Same stop by the store, same sneaking it in, same drinking all weekend, same pretending I’m fine, same dull, boring, wanting to do nothing, bad attitude till Wednesday me.. 

How do you break the cycle? How do I get back to my old self, that my wife fell in love with, that I miss? Back when I was in shape, had energy, felt great... I know it’s there, but I keep letting alcohol find it’s way into my routine. I keep letting it be a part of me..

To celebrate this awesome number and to maybe help anyone who is struggling atm. Here is my 6 top benefits of stopping drinking..in  no particular order.. 

1. Lose weight and get active. For the first time in my adult life (46 F) last year my BMI was in the normal range and has stayed in the normal range. 

2. Sleep, sleep and more sleep... Sober sleep is the best

3. Money, the things I have been able to get done to my house over the last 666 days with the money I saved has been astounding. Jeez, if I had stopped drinking on my 20s instead of my 40s I could of owed the estate 😂

4. Freedom from planning on how to get more alcohol, how to get my hungover arse somewhere etc. 

5. Better relationships with those closer to me as I am available to them 24/7

6. Personal hygiene, better hair/nails, way better skin., brighter eyes and to top it all off smelling like a goodness by not carrying around the smell of alcohol with me. 

The above is just a few examples of the positive benefits of taking things, one day at a time and saying No to that first drink.

Hey, all! You have all become my family and support system in the last 33 days so I wanted to share my birthday with all of you. I spend a lot of time on here and comment a lot but this is my first post. This is my first sober birthday in many years but I am HERE FOR IT! 

About 5 weeks ago I knew it was time and I wanted to join this sub and get started living without alcohol. Both offering and receiving support and encouragement here have meant the world to me. I spent the last 7.5 years drinking to escape a massively unhappy marriage, but only ended up with horrible anxiety and a million more problems, including some severe health problems. I still have 2 upcoming surgeries and then will get a divorce after that so I will still need all of you more than ever in the coming months. 

Im so thankful for everyone here helping me have the strength to stop drinking and be the person I was meant to be. I’m so happy to be physically and mentally feeling better and to be present for my kids. I have the most incredible kids ❤️ 

To stay positive I’ve been keeping a list of all the things that are better now without drinking and it’s a LOOOOONG list. The power of my daily counter beside my username is incredible— I never ever want to have to reset that thing! I feel like I’ve seen the light and I never want to drink again. Today I’m going to spend time with my kids (I had them make me cards yesterday) and say “IT’S MY BIRTHDAY!!!” as many times as I can possibly squeeze in 😬🎉👩‍👧‍👦 

Much love, fam. I will not drink with you today. ❤️

Grabbing only one small black box, or one tall boy. Then it was one tall boy and a shot of jose. Then two shots of gin with the tall boy. Then a bottle of gin bc it was cheaper and I would only have one, or two, after dinner. Eventually I started unnecessarily pushing the bottle above the fridge further back so my wife wouldn't see how low the bottle was getting over the week.
Our little one is due any day and I told myself to be sure to be present. To be clear headed to drive. So I just stopped straight up. But it makes me sad I cannot control myself to just have one. That i have to get a solid buzz to be satisfied. So I'm sitting here drinking my hibiscus tea bc I'll float away if I have another soda water,  happy I'm clear headed but just shitty I can't moderate.",6

I have had a few tests in my past 2 months of sobriety but this one has been superrr tough.

So much so that I said to my friends (a few times) “I think I’ll just have a drink!” and they started to get excited at first but then realized how messed up it would be to support that. They didn’t actively stop me from drinking but they did stop encouraging it and didn’t physically hand me a drink.

I stayed strong and pushed through..and once the end of the night came, I finally got to enjoy my decision not to drink when one woman in particular got way too drunk and embarassed herself and was put to bed super early. I am usually that woman, but I’m sure glad I’m not tonight. I can’t wait to get more reassurance when I see how hungover people are tomorrow..

2020-09-05 23:58:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/infdfu/resentment_and_horrible_people/,Resentment and Horrible People,"Hello, lovely SD, the House of Fox checking in here.

Where to begin... this is gonna be a long one...

Well, it was clear to me this time coming back in from the hellish world of drinking, that what often led to my drinking was resentments. I would find a comfortable oblivion somewhere in a bottle, be it those first burning sips... or those regretful last drops that cling to the bottles edges. 


I've been wrestling with one resentment this past week and I feel it starting to bubble over. I'll be damned if I let it lead me down to the dining room, where there is ample booze to obliterate myself. I can play the tape forward, and it's a horror show. It could kill me if I go backwards. And nothing is so terrible that drinking won't make it even worse.


I knew that not drinking would have challenges, I knew that my friends group would probably change, I knew that I'd be saying goodbye to some things from my drunken life before I started heading down this path with you here... but damn, this one's really got me.


I've tried to be kind, but the f-ing resentments are seeping out in my words and actions. I thought maybe instead of continuing to formulate my plan of vengence against this perceived aggression, I would lay my burden here, with the kind souls who fill this space day and night. It's what I've been told to do so many times... lay the burden down.


There's an event. I know it's happening. I know who has been invited. I have been excluded intentionally by the host. The host doesn't know that I found out... but let's be real here, it's hard to keep a party a secret. Even if I was invited, I would have refused to waste my time attending because I don't need or want Horrible People in my life. I have enough on my plate, taking this sobriety journey each day.


When I was coerced into a terrible situation by my Ex, this Horrible Person went full rapist apologist over it. I found out what they've been saying behind my back. If there's one thing that grinds my gears, it's victim blaming. And my gears, phew, were burning... the resentments began building that day, when I saw in full color the Horrible Person for what they are, and that is toxic to myself and my happiness.


Some days, I wish I didn't know just how horrible this Horrible Person is, but now I know the depths of their maliciousness. Sad part is, I was warned that this individual is a Horrible Person, but I ignored the signs. Live and learn, time to let go of the ashes of the past and embrace the beauty that is surely ahead. But damned if these resentments aren't sneaky little jerks. I know if I bottle them up, it puts my recovery at risk. Horrible Person, I will not let this cause me to stumble back into the bottle. You will not be a factor in my downfall. 


I was shocked, then saddened that they would choose to not believe the victim. I went to the police because of what happened to me, and am still recovering from the aftershocks of being assaulted. It's probably going to take me a long time to heal, but I have overcome these kinds of pains before... and I will do it again. I'm getting sober during a f-ing pandemic, and I'll be damned if a Horrible Person is my excuse for stumbling and falling. It's not worth it.


Today is a beautiful day to be alive!

See you at the DCI and IWNDWYT 💜🤘",14

I’m ready to be done with the pain killers, I hate how the fog my brain up. The Addict part of my brain completely understands how people get hooked on them even when I hate the sensations of taking them. 

Been having lots of cravings for things like cheesecake and fancy coffee. I miss being able to jump in the car to run to the store for whatever random craving I’m having at the moment. But nope too foggy to safely drive myself. Much like how I had to pre plan my late night junk food when I was drinking two bottles of wine a night. Now I have to either ask my spouse or call the local delivery service when I decide I need a hit of pumpkin spice for no good reason. I miss the freedom of sobriety.",22

I just was with my neighbors for a BBQ, distanced in the yard of course, just drinking my water and for some of them it was the first time we've hung out since I stopped drinking. All was fine, briefly explained why I stopped since I used to go hard with them and they were just genuinely curious. 

Anyways, I feel like I wasn't fun like I ""used to be"". But I also am realizing, I had legit conversations that I was mentally present for and will remember and I definitely love that. Its just weird. I know this will continue to happen when I experience each ""first time"" since I've stopped but its just crazy to see how I am viewing myself and interpreting things so differently. From my anxiety standpoint though, instead of being anxious about being stupid or saying dumb shit etc. now I feel a little anxious about whether I was too serious or awkward or not fun etc.

I know this is all part of the journey but I just wanted to vent to some fellow strangers who can relate... At the end of the day, I'm still glad I didn't drink though.

2020-09-05 22:11:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/indwjt/an_update_reflecting_on_my_time_in_rehab_and_a/,"An update, reflecting on my time in rehab, and a thanks to this sub.","[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/i2btev/back_to_day_1_and_i_could_really_use_some_support)

[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/i36573/finally_went_to_detox_rehab_is_likely_next)

A quick recap is that a little over a month ago I went to the hospital drunk with a blood alcohol level of 0.26. I sat there for hours and was stabilized, and then taken by ambulance to a detox center. I spent 8 days there. I was then released. 

I sit here now over 30 days sober and I'm in my last week of a 30 day rehab program. I am feeling incredibly grateful. Like so many people who suffer from addiction I've carried around with me tremendous amounts of shame and guilt. I realize now that that is from what is in my past. I cannot change that. 

One of my counselors here who is a recovering addict commented on how she loved her time in rehab because it gave her time to work on herself. No work, no family to be around, friends, any of the people and/or things that might exacerbate the stress she had been feeling. That really struck a chord with me. There are so many people out there who never get the chance to go to rehab, be it because they cannot afford it, or their insurance won't cover much time, or because they carry the shame and guilt that prevents them from reaching out. Maybe they do reach out and no one is reaching back to them. There are people here of all ages, races, ethnicities, and sexual orientation. There is a guy here who is only 19. We all have a chance.

I've had a lot of fun in my life, I've done some wacky, weird, silly, fun stuff. I've done some dangerous stuff. But I haven't done a lot of responsible things. Except for this. This is among the best things I have done for myself.

I've reflected a lot on why I think this time will be different for me. I've been in detox 3 times, this is my 2nd time in rehab and I've been in an outpatient program. I've had long periods of sobriety. I somehow managed to maintain those long periods of sobriety despite not attending meetings, getting a sponsor, or working a program. But here I am. I didn't do something, anything, on a daily basis to maintain my sobriety. If I can spend hours a day drinking, I can spend 1 hour a day, even 2 attending meetings and/or working on step work. And the best part? It's free. My drinking habit sure wasn't. 

It's been difficult at times while here thinking about the real world that awaits me outside of this bubble. There's work stress, earning back trust with family, my boss, my job, and others. But I have so many people behind me that can keep me going. I once heard someone in recovery say, ""If I were to relapse it wouldn't be because AA failed me, it would be because I failed AA"". It's there, it has been for a long time and hopefully will be for a long time more. Baby steps, that's what it is about.

I have a tendency to overwhelm myself, and in a hurry. I realize now that I need to take it easy. One day at a time, one step at a time. I don't need to do everything at once, just place a few tools in the toolbox at a time, slowly it will get bigger and I will have people to help me carry it. A healthy support network is huge. And that's where this sub comes in. I just got my phone back recently, and I've been checking this sub everyday. Your posts, stories, and vulnerabilities have been an incredible help and is one of those tools. I want to thank you all for your contributions. I don't always post or comment, but I see you and I hear you. 

I don't even know exactly how many days I've been sober, but I'm sober today and that's what matters the most.

I'm /u/Caffeine_Routine and I'm a grateful alcoholic.

No whiskey, wine, or scotch

From chardonnay, and

Forgot to lose my watch.

In 5 spins

No gin inspired sins

Absinthe, vermouth, or schnapps

I’ve bit my thumb

At old, dark rum

And doubled down on pops.

Tequila hasn’t touched these lips

Or fortunately

Launched these hips

Onto the floor

Into the night

Right out the door

In under 30 seconds or

Maybe less

If you’re keeping score.

No buying shots

For the whole damn bar

On an underwater

Credit card

Some new best friends

With a story that

Makes zero sense

and ends a little

Awkwardly

When I decide they are

the enemy.

No campfire Fireball

Morning after Tylenol

or waking up

In some place new

With 50%

of last night’s shoes.

Has a purpose

It sure has helped me

Tame the circus

In sober times

I’ve saved a dime

Kept promises (and bones) unbroken

Much less regret

Of moments when

Insane words were spoken.

To have a couple

With an old, dear friend

Wants to pay my rent, we

Better go

I can use the self check-out and I don't have to wait for an attendant to come over and and input that I'm old enough to buy the wine.

I don't have to wait until noon on Sunday to go to the grocery store (TX law) because I'm not buying wine.

When I do get a shopping cart, I'm prouder of what's in it because I'm eating better and not looking for things to throw in the oven knowing I'll be drunk.

And finally, it always shocks me when I see the total of the purchase, minus the wine.  

Logging these tiny ""successes"" keeps me going.  IWNDWYT!",71

I read at least a few posts everyday and find strength in them, the good and the bad! 

My current situation is complicated to say the least.. and I welcome advice even if it’s harsh but here it goes: 

About two years ago, my fiancé was deported.  His work visa had expired and he was in the process of applying for citizenship. At the time I was pregnant. We lost our baby girl. And although I don’t know for sure, my doctor and myself are convinced it was due to stress... I constantly blamed myself until recently. Well, I take that back. I still often blame my body and myself. 

For the last 4 years, I have been my father’s caretaker.  He never fully recovered from a major stroke. He’s always been an alcoholic for probably 40 years and is violent at times. Verbally abusive all the time, drunk or sober.  No one else in my family wants anything to do with him. He says he needs me to help him but yet he’ll walk a few blocks to get a bottle (while 
I’m at work) and gets completely trashed. I’m trying so hard to stay clean! Have had a couple of relapses since setting my clock on here.

So I guess my question is: Am I a bad person if I walk away and just leave him? (My dad, not the fiancé) I’m getting away for ten days next month to go see my honey in Central America and know some time away may help clear my head.  I just really value the opinion of you all who understand what it’s like to crave that next drink, which for me leads to a bottle. I came so close today to buying one that i almost cried in the parking lot after leaving the store.",5

I'm probably a ""grey-area"" drinker in that alcohol has never directly caused me problems at work or with my family/social obligations. But I do use alcohol to deal with my anxiety disorder, to help me wind down, and to make some of the necessary tasks of life feel more manageable. For instance, it feels a lot more doable to tackle laundry and meal prep with a glass of spirits and a podcast; same thing with making phone/zoom calls, even social ones with people I like.

Then I was at the bottleshop, but they only sold coffee, so I got one, but the milk was obviously off and lumpy. They wouldn't replace it and said it was fine. So I got more pissed off, then went to the supermarket and bought wine (I've obviously been on here too long as supermarkets don't sell alcohol here...except Aldi), I drank 2 glasses... and was chatting to my ex and someone else I don't remember and was just getting angrier and angrier. I didn't feel a buzz, just dizzy and sick and couldn't string my words together..... and still carrying on about the bloody toilet, and how the person responsible had disappeared....

Weird, not sure if there is a meaning in that mess, now I'm just trying to shake it off! I think I'm more disturbed more that my ex was in it, and we were amicable haha.

I drank 3-4 nights a week and would drink a pint every Saturday. My husband went to the ER on August 1st and was held for a week due to severe malnutrition and low potassium. He has been doing so well with not drinking since then (I’m pretty sure) because he got scared. 

I, on the other hand, am not handling this well. It seems like a switch gets flipped when I get home from work and I just can’t help but be in a bad mood. I really don’t want to be but I’m annoyed all the time and get in stupid little arguments with my husband nearly everyday. 

We have recently gotten into RPGs and board games and I used to love playing (with or without alcohol) but it just seems like something else I have to do now. There’s no “break” and nothing to look forward to with the weekends because we can’t do anything due to COVID. 

I really expected to feel better without alcohol due to knowing some people who stopped and reading posts here. It’s really disheartening to feel worse when I’m supposed to be doing something because it’s better for me.

Won’t tell my whole life story but cheap whiskey is my drink of choice and always has been. I didn’t really start to notice things were getting bad until I was about 17 and cheap $4 pints of whiskey became an expensive habit and I started justifying to the world that “drinking in the morning cures the hangover!” It started as a joke, then it became an excuse, then it became a dependency as most of you guys have also experienced. But for me and maybe some of you, I fucking loved drinking in the mornings. I would almost look forward to waking up in the morning and being hungover because it was a chance to drink the hangover away and start fresh. I loved when the booze made me sleep like shit and I’d wake up at 3-4Am because I could start that much sooner. Some days I would look at my clock and get a smile on my face because the sun wasn’t up and I could start drinking. In my drunken brain I would also actually enjoy hiding liquor and hiding drinking. It became a sort of a game, a game of how much could I drink before anyone noticed. And by the time anyone usually noticed and started yelling at me and telling me how disappointing I was and all of that good stuff, I would be so drunk I could usually just fall asleep on a dime, forget about it and once I woke up I could start again. It’s a cycle that obviously has ruined relationships for me, ruined any trust anybody has had in me, and ruined my mental and my physical health. (I just noticed how long this paragraph is so thank you to anybody who is still reading because I’m going to continue for a little bit longer lol) So long story short with me being off the rails and doing this cycle for multiple years I was able to see and reflect on it, but I could never stop drinking. Id go a day here, maybe 2 days another week, one time I even went 5 days, but I was always right back to the same cycle and the worst part was how much I enjoyed the cycle. Until about 2 months ago I finally fucked up so bad I got to see my mom in absolute tears, and my girlfriend in hysterics. (Not the first time but this time hit differently). It was a morning and I was plastered, and I finally decided to tell them that I would accept in going into detox and then a rehab program. After hours and hours of phone calls, turns out no rehabs would accept me until I had a doctors visit to help with insurance. Turns Out the only appointment I could schedule because of COVID was an entire month away. All of the outpatient rehabs near me were full as well, so even if we could afford to pay without insurance they didn’t have space. So I finally try and they tell me to get fucked and wait a month, so I wait a month. Was not sober, the girlfriend went out of town and I figured that would be a perfect time for a bender, Because hey my appointment wasn’t for a few more weeks so I might as-well get it all out now. Then my girlfriend came back and I lied and lied about drinking until she found my stash that I had forgotten about and was forced to tell her. She obviously freaked out and so then since she was mad at me, I decided it was high time for another bender. Fast foward another couple weeks and I finally had my appointment. They asked me questions, I told the truth on some, and didn’t tell the truth on others. Mainly anything related to suicidal thoughts or self harm I kind of left off the table because I was scared of what would happen, not sure if that was a good or bad thing to keep under wraps. They then told me I had a “moderate” drinking problem on the scale of drinking problems, however that is gauged, and said we could follow up in a week to get a session set up to see if I “needed” rehab or therapy. So since the moment I had been waiting for turned into a next week thing, I begged them to get me a prescription of some kind because I knew I couldn’t go another week. They prescribed me Antabuse, and it is the best fucking thing that has happened to me. Something about knowing in the back of my mind that I might end up in the hospital if I drink anything has weened me off. I haven’t drank in 18 days and hopefully things are looking up. Unfortunately though, the follow up appointment with the doctor got postponed another month, so it looks like me and Antabuse are going to have to just do this alone and figure it out. Shout out to Kaiser, at least they are good at signing prescriptions. Well, as much as I want to on this fine Saturday morning, I will not drink with you today.",5

I am 11 days sober. But thanks for the reminder of what could have been.,"Kind of a kick in the teeth when I received the notification, but also this time it feels different and I am approaching it differently. Every other time I stopped, I thought I could go back and drink “like a normal person”. Each time I would extend it, just to show that I am not an alcoholic. I can stop! The longest I got was six months, and it was partially due to a surgery and I could not mix drink and medicines, not my own willpower. Here I am, two years after, a few stops and starts, to say this time I know I surrender. I can not control myself. What should have broken me was a recent bender that landed me in the hospital, I nearly severed off a finger, deep cut, I am fine thankfully. I apparently loved cooking drunk and am shocked I still have all my fingers.  I have enough drunk cooking stories to fill a book. To be honest, what broke me this time was my state of health and mental health. Drinking half a bottle to a bottle a day of wine, a perpetual hangover, sleepless nights, the anxiety, the self-hatred. 11 days ago, I decided enough was enough. I have 20 years of drinking behind me. I want to be better, I want to be healthy, I want to be present. This time I am doing it with more focus. I have told friends and family, I am here, I have sobriety books to read, I am listening to podcasts about sobriety, I joined a gym to have somewhere to go in the hours after work (when I would normally go to my local wine shop and come back home and drink until things were blurry). I have started to write things down, I read journaling helps. I feel better prepared, although absolutely terrified. One day at a time, I will not drink with you today!

I was doing good for a couple months actually, no alcohol in the house, if I was with friends id have a beer or hard seltzer but would cut myself off early, wasn't getting hammered or blackout and it felt good and ""healthy"" compared to my old ways, I was even avoiding hard liquor. 

Buuuut i backslid, I still wasn't drinking at home really which was an upgrade but I did start getting blackout or close to it at a weekly gathering. 

Anyway, last weekend was the culmination of it, was sloshed for the entirety of it and did drink at home because I was gifted a rather expensive bottle that probably should have been saved for special occasions but is now mostly gone. 

I felt awful basically the entire week, hungover Monday and minor withdrawals for the rest of it, unable or motivated to eat, acid reflux, nausea that lasted till Thursday evening/Friday morning and terrible brain fog. For a bit I was worried I'd have to see a doctor cause my eyes were looking a little jaundiced but it was just from lack of sleep and some irritants at work causing some severe veins and discoloration to appear for a bit. 

But today my stomach almost feels normal, still some cramping and gurgling but it's getting better, at the least I don't feel like I'm going to vomit at a moment's notice or if I eat anything. 

I'm sure there will be more slip-ups, but at the very least I've never felt more motivated than now. last time I mostly just wanted to cut back and get to drinking like a ""normal"" person would, a beer here or there or whatever. 

Now the idea of even that sounds unappealing, Its just not fucking worth any of it.

The money, the health worries, the anxiety of a blackout night, it's just unhealthy physically and mentally and I have some other non alcohol related health concerns to worry about so I certainly don't want to pile on alcohol related issues. 

Well that's about it, no great point to all this or anything I just wanted to vent my frustrations somewhere. 

To end on a positive note the girlfriend has been out of town so having the apartment to myself during all this has actually been nice, she doesn't drink or anything but it's just an environment where I can veg out on the couch for hours/days while I get through the worst of it without needing to put on a face or make conversation heh.

I've had DUIs, court-ordered counseling, you name it.  I've looked into rehab, but holy crap is it expensive!  I'm a stress and boredom drinker, and not unlike so many others, this pandemic has caused incredible amounts of stress for me.  

I've been furloughed from my job for almost 6 months, and home with my 9 year old every day.  I hate being a stay at home mom and housewife; I have this odd notion in my mind that tells me I'm not valuable unless I have an actual job outside of home.  I'm sure it stems from my childhood, but all the same... I got my weekly ""Sorry, but we still can't bring you back to work"" email yesterday, and it pretty much put me in a tailspin.  Hello ""sneaking"" beers in my bathroom.  Needless to say, my kid knew what I was doing and was way more than pissed at me!

I have a list of triggers a mile long, and have been trying to avoid them as much as I can, but damn am I tired of it!  Most of the people in my life are drinkers, including my hubby, so I'm often around booze.  There are days when I'm perfectly fine not  drinking, then days like yesterday happen and here we are.

I KNOW I need to be stronger and stop letting it get to me, but unless I can do a total life overhaul I feel like I'm stuck.  Last week I went 7 days without drinking, this week, I drank every other day.  I don't understand the ebb and flow of my drinking problem.  My 17 year old says I need to ditch the drink and start with weed, maybe he's right.

I know I'm all over the place, just a lot of jumbled thoughts rolling around in my dome.  Maybe I should go get myself another cup of coffee.  Anyway, today I'm just going to try to keep a clear head and not let crap get to me!",6

It just makes me feel pretty sad actually. The thought of not going to my favourite places with friends and not drinking with them. It's not only been the route of alot of problems for me but it's actually also been one of the main ways I have fun and find my escape. It's also given me so many unforgettable memories and took me on unimaginable adventures. Ahh I know this feeling. This is the feeling of what the actual f*ck am I going to do now to fill the void and will it be worth it. My heart is somewhere different from my head. I've never been so torn between anything in my life.

I told him I didn't think he needs to reflect on his drinking like I do, since he's so consistent with how moderately he drinks. He doesn't seem to have to fight the impulse to keep drinking once he starts like I do. And he said something that I thought was so supportive and also so true.

He was like I understand why you're trying to stop drinking. You have negative effects from it, like hangovers and it effects your weight more. If I experienced those things, I'd quit too. I'm not someone who keeps doing something if it doesn't agree with me. 

This made me feel like he would support my sobriety long-term if I quit for good, which is so important to me. Since a love of beer is something we have in common, I was worried he would be sad or angry if I won't share that with him anymore. 

Also, what he said is true! I'm a health-conscious person and very invested in my fitness, another thing he and I have in common. Why keep doing something that interferes with my workouts, gives me empty calories, makes it hard to get out of bed in the morning? I'm committing to Sober September, but I'm very open to continuing not to drink once this month is over.",7

Spinning around till I'm stumbling, falling down and laughing.","As a young child , I loved spinning till I was so dizzy , I'd be falling down .It was fun and made me laugh.One day I remember well was a day I was alone in the back yard ,spinning away .I looked up to the sky, and being taught about God by my family, I saw clouds that appeared to look like., the pictures I had seen in Sunday school of God. I was so excited I ran to my mother and told her I saw God in the sky. She was happy to know I believed in him and and I felt from her it was true. God was right there.  So spinning was where I  found God? It certainly made me feel close to him . This little girl was heading into life with faith that he'd always be there all I had to do was spin and want to be near him. 

As I think about this sober now , It seems as though alcohol was the new way to connect , it certainly made  me dizzy and sometimes falling down laughing . Best part was I always found the courage to search for other people who liked  to drink alcohol too. My loneliness would subside.


So my story goes on.  A teenager of divorced parents. My Mother was choosing to spin and.  leave me alone . I used alcohol then not to find God , but now companionship.  It lead my 16 year old self to the boy next door who became my first love , and my biggest heartbreak.  
And once again , I was alone I used alcohol to fill in that loss and  give me courage to reach out to be part of the world.


Now in my twenties,  I was a responsible working , selfsificiant woman. I still used alcohol. 
I found love again . We both used alcohol till our son was born then it changed. We found God without having to use alcohol .With church and busy with our family the alcohol was put aside .It ended in divorce. My son now a teenager, brought up in church., but he also found alcohol for a lot of the reasons I did.
So this brings me up to now . Ten years of the same use of alcohol .To find courage to get back in the world alone.Only the use became abuse. It was more than a dizzy feeling that was funny and made me laugh. Now it wasn't filling in holes in my life , it was taking over my life. 


Just quitting wasn't enough,  it never lasted. It just made me feel weak and out of controll of myself. I tried over and over and over . Exhausting ! Who had I become ? Who was I in the first place? My life was soaked in the alcohol and its effects on me .Why it hadn't taken my life was the question .
Today I'm sharing with you all what answer I found . God. He never left me . Even when I replaced him with alcohol. Most of you here understand where I'm at now . Repairing the damage alcohol causes.  

It's going well this time . You wonderful folks are part of the reason.  So much comadery here! Thank you all. I'll stop here cause this was a long one . ( smiling) Six AM  an I was so inspired to share this with you. 
Oh I know not everyone is a believer in God but I do believe we all have a stronger will inside us , not to abuse ourselves , .

I'm now in my fifties. This second part of my life, wheres it going ? I dont wanna leave earth being the one who couldn't get over the booze !! And the best part of all my son is sober now too.  Thanks for being here everyone💖",6

Anyway, I woke up actually feeling hungover. I kept my eyes closed for a few minutes going through my night. When I was drinking, this was typical behavior. I would search my memory looking for the point I blacked out and evaluating my actions. I would think things like: Did I embarrass myself? Who did I call? Where did I go? Do I have any aspirin? 

Then it hit me. I ate a late dinner and watched some shows on Netflix and went to sleep. I DIDN'T drink at all! I felt so happy and my expected, imagined, hangover vanished into thin air. Today is not ruined! I feel great and I know that I am making progress. You can do it too!

I have been sober from alcohol for 98% of 2020. I never did a day count on the time since I had my last drink because I would always fall off at some point. I started to not drink after I got caught being drunk the day after Christmas in 2019. I did not get fired due to this because 1. that was a retail establishment and they needed people to work, and 2. I actually owned up to it when my manager asked me.  I had 2 or 3 days where I fell off the wagon when my state first went under lock down. I thought that I could drink a little bit since I felt like EVERYONE was posting about how turnt they were getting at the beginning of the outbreak. I felt that one drink would not hurt me. TBH it really did not hurt me at the time. 

 I tried to go completely sober back in July, but I had a death in the family, and I thought that I should be able to smoke sum sticky icky because that was a pretty devastating  death to me. Before that death I had been COMPLETELY sober for 2 weeks, which I have not done before. I was trying to get a different job, and that was why I stopped. 

Flash forward to September, and I thought I was doing soooo good with not drinking, or smoking that I would reward myself by buying a small bottle of my preferred vodka. THAT WAS A MISTAKE LOL. I told myself that I would only drink when I was talking to my friends online, but I did not follow that rule. I decided that I was going to take 2 shots earlier in the day, but that turned into me drinking the whole bottle. I talked to my friends while intoxicated and honestly I cannot remember what all I said last night. I woke up at 5:30 this morning to the smell of vomit. I had gotten it stuck in my hair, and there was a pile of vomit waiting in my room for me when I woke up. Who knows when I actually did that though. Was I on that call when I threw up, or did I at least get off the call and do it? 

I am so ashamed of myself for allowing this to happen. I've realized that I truly cannot drink anymore. 1 drink will throw me back into my old ways. I hope I will not allow this to happen again in the future. If you're looking for a reason not to drink today, this is it. If you're looking for a second reason not to drink, I lost 40 lbs alone from not drinking since the end of December.

TLDR: Never deleting this post. Gonna go 1 month clean for starters and then just 1 day/month social drinking.

In the last year, I've picked up heavy drinking (at least 3 times a week). I find myself buying cheap vodka because I don't care about the taste, I just want to get drunk and feel good. I've never drank so much before. I think what freaked me out is that even the next day when I am hungover, I am still tempted to drink because I want to feel that buzz again. Alcoholism runs in the family. My family is also pretty poor (no one ever made it to college, the men just joined the military because they had no other good option). I got good grades in high school and got to college on scholarship because I knew I had to get out of that mess. Always had 2 jobs in college to make ends meet. Now I'm 6000KM away from home with a great job I enjoy but I'm doing 60hrs per week. I guess I might just be burnt out. It took a lot of work to dig myself out of the hole of poverty and it takes a lot of work to not fall back into it. That's probably why I'm using alcohol as a crutch. 

Anyhow I think a lot of people have similar stories and there are a lot that have it worse. I don't find my story particularly special and am grateful to be where I am.

But I think if I let alcohol go unchecked, it might be the last straw. I'm worried because I want to quit, I've tried, but I keep coming back to it. I don't feel like I have control. I've worked too hard to let an effing $10 vodka take it all away. It's all frustrating and scary.

So, I wanna start small. I am promising to go 1 month without alcohol. After that, I will only allow myself 1 day a month to drink and I cannot drink alone. I am never deleting this post and will read it everyday as a reminder.

If any kind soul is reading this and has any suggestions, you have my full undivided attention. Thank you Reddit family. Mahalo nui loa kakou!",7

Now I have learned about PAWS.,"I was a heavy drinker and pot smoker. I am 34 days sober. As we all know what a emotional ride this can be. I hit a wall the other day I was not prepared for. Yes, there has been challengs throughout this last month but nothing like the the last two days. I've been hit with this terrible depression. I didn't know what was happening. Motivation, happiness, energy  just all gone. It was scary how quick it came on. Luckily this sub has been here for me along the way. Yesterday I learned about PAWS. (Please take time to learn about this) Its great to know I'm not alone fighting this. It really does help reading how others get through these times and knowing its a common and expected part of the process. So, this is basically a big thank you to this community. To everyone who has shared their struggle, thank you. As I was laying in bed at 8pm all these post kept me from caving.

 I think a great way to break the cycle is first understand it. I’m aware I get carried away and now I know it takes about 2 weeks to break my will power. Was it worth it? Absolutely not. The embarrassment, the hang over, the anxiety.... for what? I need to remember to push through those two weeks of not drinking and make it more. I’m glad I’m figuring this out now so I am aware at university where the drinking culture is so big. 

I can stop drinking. I will stop drinking.",5

This past year. Since COVID-19, I've picked up a bad habit of gambling. I've found happy stomping grounds in the rush and just like my drinking was, I have let it get out of control. I say all that to say this, whether you're on day 1 or 13 years, we suffer the same, and I believe, more strongly now than ever, without a belief in something bigger than myself, a program of recovery, going to meetings, working the steps, and working with others, I will, for sure, destroy myself.

It also reminds me how many times I've started over on a Saturday morning, so I wanted to offer something to anyone who is back there again- or the first time.


Accountability is one of the hardest parts of getting sober. The alcohol is still leaving your system and you can't come to terms with all of the stupid things you did or said- you don't even want to remember them. You hate yourself, you hate everything around you, all that can silence that feeling is more alcohol. So you drown yourself in it again and lose months, years, more to the cycle.

Accountability hurts. Beating yourself up, cringing, over who you were when you were using. But that pain is a hangover of its own, and is exactly what stops you making those mistakes again. The pain of accountability has to be felt, as awful as it is, to prevent you continuing. 

Holding yourself accountable while hungover is probably not productive. You are already chemically a wreck, and dont need to add guilt tripping yourself to the list of reasons to relapse. If its day 1, you don't need to overwhelm yourself with this yet, but when it comes dont be afraid to embrace it.



Forgiveness is almost as hard in the other way. Feeling deserving of it, of asking for it, as well as forgiving yourself and the things that enabled your alcoholism. After holding yourself accountable this is especially hard, but radical acceptance is incredibly important (in my opinion) to let go of the pain and guilt that kept you coming back to the bottle. 

If you read the big book you will know how to go about this, but in short and for those who don't have access to it: apologise to those you have harmed unless that apology only serves you. If your apology won't help anyone but yourself, hold onto it. For a while at least. 

In the same stroke, apologise to and forgive yourself. The guilt of being an addict is unparalleled. The weight of torturing your own body and soul day in, day out, because its all you can do to keep it together. You've harmed yourself, while being harmed by yourself. It is complex, but recognising this makes it easier to understand why you did the things you did during your addiction. Your psyche was desperately trying to fill a wound, not realising it was filling it with feul for the fire that hollowed it further. 


Recovery is a delicate balance of accountability and forgiveness, among a dozen other things. Some days, like day 1, you may need forgiveness more than accountability.


I hope this helps someone on day 1. We are all with you on day 1 again after 24 hours, just trying to make it through another day. Every hour you can make it through without touching the bottle is an achievement, no matter if its your first or five hundredth attempt to kick the habit. 

Please feel comfortable sharing here, and dont worry about judgement about what your counter is at. I've never seen anyone here be less than understanding and helpful, we are all taking this journey together and wherever you are in your journey our steps align.

I can honestly say that I have not experienced the devastation that some of those on this sub have experienced, but it leads me to think it may be the path I was heading down. Having found this sub read the stories and listened to the Naked Mind I’ve not had a drink in 47 days, the longest since I was a teen. Having realised I’m not and have never been at rock bottom I poured myself and the wife a glass of red last night and watched tv - I could smell it, but I didn’t drink it - I thought about how much effort I’ve put into stop drinking and wondered if I had the one glass, would I have 2 and would I then buy more tomorrow? I couldn’t drink it. All that hard work would have been gone. She took the wine and said that she’s proud of me and it’s ok and drank the wine. She’s not a big drinker, can easily stop after a few drinks where as I need to polish off the bottle. 

So last night was a small win for me. Now if I could only have that will power with food!

I used to be a member of this amazing community a few years ago but I started drinking again. Simple as that. 
To cut out all the tedious excuses I made to myself and family and the embarrassing episodes (I'm sure I'll relate those at some point), towards the end of my lockdown here in UK I ended up in hospital with liver failure, a heart atrack and my gall bladder decided to kick my arse for good measure by passing some stones.
Ouch.
So I have fatty liver disease and alcoholic hepatitis. 
I'm not drinking through fear or painful and agonising death, it works for me so far, but I do need some mental and emotional support from you wonderful people. You helped me so much before and I am so very sorry I left you and I am sorry that it has taken so long for me to return.

Got taken to hospital and monitored (felt so terrible!) next morning I knew when I got home I’d drink. Went to shop got some gin, drove to mums house (she has a huge sweeping driveway) anyway, pretty much downed the gin (35cl mixed with energy drink) and planned on staying at hers for the day (we only live a mile apart) when I knocked on her door she saw the state I was in. Told me she didn’t want me in her house n took my keeps off me. So I just went n sat in my car, couldn’t go anywhere obviously. About 15 mins later the police turned up, mum had called them as she was worried about my mental state. I was arrested, spent 8 hours in a cell and charged with refusal to supply a sample of breath (although I did try.). My court date was for 9 sept but this has been put on hold because of COVID and I have to stick to bail conditions which were not to drive or even sit the front of a car. I’ve since had an appointment with a psychiatrist and have been diagnosed with bipolar and am taking meds daily to control my moods so this may help my case.

It's taken me almost two months to get to four days again. Things are starting to feel up. But I know I'm far from out the woods. Here's to another day sober with you guys.

Just want to say you guys are some of the best humans I've ever encountered on any online forum. Such a wonderful supportive bunch. Really wish you all the best.

I was having some thoughts this morning. Some observations. I spent the night sober at a birthday party of a close friends. It was the first time I'd seen that many people drunk at the same time whilst being sober. Reflecting back on it and how people were behaving and without being judgemental. I just can't help but think damn alcohol is a crazy drug. It really messes people up. Ive been such a messed up person on it myself for so long. It destroys lives and it's so clear to see damage it's done just by spending the night sober around all your closest friends. Some I might add I've known for a lifetime. Anyway just an observation. I hope you guys like myself make it out of this and get back on the path to our future.

Peace out guys, have a good one",10

Repeat, Repeat, Repeat.

What a fucking boring life I used to lead. For around 30 years.

And I’m craving THAT?

I was a slave to my addiction and would just torture myself with alcohol for so many different reasons. I use to think I was swimming in it at one point until I realised I was drowning in it. I relapsed so many times, lost so many people in my life (for good and bad), I hide away in my house alone and away from the world feeling like this Frankenstein monster drinking whatever I felt like that day until my nights would end up with me blacking out asleep or until I drank all the alcohol in my house. 

This past week has not been that at all. I don't hide anymore. I take leaps and chances, I put my heart and soul back out into the universe and let it know that I am here and living and want a wonderful happy life. Life isn't perfect and I have had ups and downs in the last week being sober as well as side effects. However this is SO much better than being hung over hating myself and probably drinking again to kill the hang over. I got up early, cleaned the house, went to gym, treated myself with sushi and icecream and know just laying in bed after a long successful day. I can actually handle and deal with shit if it comes at me. It's tiring, it's exhausting and sometimes I just want to cry but I keep going and never give up. Also I will try my damn hardest to make sure I never pick up another bottle. The feeling of actually being free from my addiction is priceless and I can actually breathe! 

I am sharing this so if someone is struggling or hung over or about to pick up a bottle... Maybe think again because you won't find your answers at the bottom of that bottle. You have to dig deep and push through. I'm a 27F who started partying at 19 and somewhere along the blurry lines became a full blown functioning alcoholic. I refuse to live my life this way anymore. I hope everyone has an awesome weekend and just wanted to share this because this is a proud and happy moment of soberity. I hope everyone has an amazing sober weekend !

I was driving on the highway in a CRAZY downpour today and could barely see in front of me.

Two other cars wrecked ahead of me because the conditions were so bad which caused the sudden stoppage on a highway in rush hour.

It was a very scary experience but I walked away without a scratch and so did the others. After the initial shock and I got home I used this as an excuse to go get a bottle wine.

I was 7 days sober and I was feeling great about it. But then this semi traumatic experience happens and I tell myself “well you deserve a drink after that!”

Not sure the point of this post other than that I wanted to admit to someone that I caved when things got tough and now that the bottle is gone I don’t feel any better.",8

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I like a good motivational quote. They will have a string of words put together in a way that makes sense and sounds really cool and it comes across as obvious in some profound way. But when it comes to life, motivation won't always be there. That's why I say, depend on yourself more than motivation. Build routine and habit so that you can rely on yourself when things get hard.

This past week, I’ve been fighting the urge to drink. I haven’t really had urges since my early days of sobriety. I’ve gone weeks and months without a single urge, but for some reason, those urges are coming back. 

I took some time to actually think about what is going on rather than being impulsive. Why are these thoughts returning? Well, I’m nervous and anxious—that’s why! I begin a new school year (I’m a teacher) next week, so how did I use to take edge off? I drank. 

I find that “playing the tape forward” helps me focus on my sobriety. I know that one drink will inevitably send me into a bender, and I know I’ll hate myself. I know the subsequent withdrawals will be awful. It’s just not worth it. 

So, here I lie, about to go to sleep. Am I still anxious? Yes, but I’m glad to deal with my anxiety with a clear mind. I’m glad I won’t wake up tomorrow with even greater anxiety due to the drinking.

2020-09-04 22:53:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/imtp7k/hey_guys_im_quitting_my_job_and_could_use_your/,Hey guys. I'm quitting my job and could use your advice. 29 days off the sauce btw ;),"I'm 24, been in the service industry for 7 years. I've worked FOH, BOH, Security, and management. About a year ago, I was hired as a bartender at this really cool place in my city. I was so excited to finally get behind the bar and see what it's all about.

&nbsp;

I started drinking when I was 17/18. It's never been something I thought was a problem until now. I've recently quit due to realizing the enormous amount of negative consequences alcohol has had on my life. I've also had a few brushes with other addictions in the past. (Mainly stimulants like Adderall, 4-FA, Propylhexedrine) I also have a family history of addiction, on both sides. I have a few aunts and uncles who are recovering addicts; my father and sister are both currently alcoholics as well. 

&nbsp;
 
The thing is, everyone at my bar is a user in some capacity. Everyone drinks. Most use cocaine nearly every day, among other substances. I was like that for almost the entire time I've worked there. Drinking nearly every day of the week, and drinking heavily on the nights I worked. Hell, it's encouraged here. If you don't get fucked up every night you work, you're sort of a black sheep. The social/peer pressure to get shithouse drunk with the team is very real. It's to the point where if you don't want to get fucked up, you're the weirdo. I feel like I've been the outcast for this reason. 

&nbsp;



Another thing is,  before the second shutdown in my city, my GM pulled me aside to talk about something ""serious"" as he put it. He proceeded with trying to recruit me to sell cocaine for him. He said we needed to look out for each other, and that this was a great opportunity to make money during uncertain times. I respectfully declined, stating that I was uninterested in that sort of work, staying neutral and nonjudgmental. After his proposition, he offered me some cocaine, to which I turned down. He was visibly upset and tried to pressure me into doing a line with him. I had to say no about 4 times before he let up. This was not fun and was incredibly uncomfortable for me.

&nbsp;

I am now one month sober from alcohol and I think I need to get out of that place before I get sucked back in. I hate to quit without notice, but I feel like it the only way I can stay on the right path in life. I've made great progress so far and I don't want to throw it away.

This was a big support to me in the early months. I feel like when I wanted to stop drinking, I couldn't find concrete advice about how to do it until I came here. If anyone is feeling unsure how to proceed and wanting suggestions, here are mine. 1) See a therapist. Likely there are complicated reasons that drove you to drink to excess that you need to untangle and/or in your drinking years, you muddied some relational waters that now need to be analyzed and improved. This is a therapist's bread and butter. 2) Post here daily in the early weeks and months. Make it a rule. Think about how unpleasant it would be to have to post that you drank. Accountability helps. 3) Tell everyone that you're stopping. More accountability. Too embarrassing to pick up a drink in front of someone I had told I wasn't drinking anymore. You don't have to tell each of them a big long sad story about your enormous drinking problem. You can instead say something like, it was getting a little out of hand so I'm not drinking anymore. 4) Choose a physical object that's meaningful to you around the subject of drinking. Pick it up every morning and say to yourself, do I know as well as I knew yesterday that I don't want to be drinking? Having a tactile connection like this helps. 5) Make it a rule to read for 10 minutes every night something related to recovery. I read blogs, this Reddit, celebrity memoirs about addiction, books about the science of addiction, etcetera. This helps remind you daily that you are no longer drinking, provides negative examples and scientific evidence to support your decision, and most importantly, takes away a lot of shame as you learn the details of how difficult it is to reprogram the brain, which is what you are now trying to do. 

I personally wrote all these rules down and thought of it as a prescription, a treatment plan I have to follow each day. That made it feel like a workout regimen or a diet - it took the mystery away and made it all seem doable. Which in fact it turned out to be. Good luck to all of you who are in the early days. It's possible and it's wonderful to put down the drink.",34

For me, the overarching sense of clarity has been the best part. I used alcohol as a way to ignore my problems and evade the  challenges of life, I really stagnated because of this. 

Now, for the most part I'm okay. I'm not enduring the thrilling 'highs' and crushing lows of an alcohol fuelled lifestyle, I've just got an overall sense of okayness. Its very relaxing.

I'm reading books constantly, like I did when I was a teen. I'm running. I'm making plans for the future. I've got a set of humble goals. They're not huge achievements to impress people but rather a centred list of things I'm aiming for, a gentle ascension. I've got MY OWN nice little plan.

It's Saturday morning where I am and I'm drinking coffee, the sunlight is shining in through my window. My bags packed. I'm going to the sea to swim and read for a few hours then later ill meet some sober buddies for dinner.

I'm very grateful to have found this sub. Whenever I forget what it's like I scroll through to be reminded. I've learned so much from your posts, both the exclamations of how great sober life can be and the advice on how to avoid the pitfalls.

Obviously It’s a big party weekend and I’m getting a bit worked up about it. I was probably in my late teens the last time I was sober throughout the whole thing.  Our house usually ends up “party central”, so I’m kinda glad Covid is keeping most of our usual suspects away. 

On my way home from work I had those awful thoughts to stop at the packie, get beer and cigarettes, just for ONE night. Then said to myself, which night? Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or Monday (I have Tuesday off) to get shitfaced. Decided it was too much work TO decide, and really talked myself out of ruining what I’ve built up in sober days. The thought of going back to Day 1 was depressing and I knew how much I would beat myself up about it. And, I thought of how hubby’s IPAs smelled, and frankly, it’s a turnoff now. My upstairs tenant smokes and I can smell it now and then wafting out the door when I’m on my deck, and it’s disgusting. By the way, I gave up drinking and smoking same day.

Anyway, I stopped at a butcher to get BBQ chow instead of drinks and smokes. 

And I will re-read this and my post history to keep me on track this weekend, and come out the other side proud of myself.

What helped me get through, was a plan.  I'd develop it in advance.  What am I going to do?  Who am I going to be around?  What am I going to eat?  Just having these basic things lined up was very helpful to keep my out of the liquor store parking lot.

It's the end of the day for me. Got through an extremely rough day of cravings.

Beat Friday.

Beat a birthday party.

Beat alcohol.

One day at a time ay. 

Someone poured me a drink early in the evening. I thought best not to make a scene. So I held on to it for hours. No one questioned why I wasn't drinking because it seemed I was. It wasn't about being deceptive. I was just feeling weak and it was easier than explaining I was a problem drinker to everyone who asked why I wasn't drinking.

Anyway the night went on, and this glass had become part of my hand. I didn't notice it after a while. It was like I was keeping it just incase. Just incase I had one sip. One drink. I held on to it all night. Then finally at some point I thought what am I doing and just decided to leave. When I left I handed it back to the person who poured it and said ""here I made you a drink"" ha they never noticed just thought it was kinda funny but also poetic. Stupid yeah. Felt like I let go.

But anywho,

Hope you who ever you are. Are doing good.

If you really want sobriety. You can have it. You really can become sober and stay sober. The question is- deep deep down- do you want it? You might know you ""should"" become sober, but its not the same as wanting it. You might ""kinda"" want it, but not bad enough to make a real dedicated effort.

But when you really want it - you can have it.

I think many alcoholics just aren't honest with themselves. That's their downfall.

But ultimately I realized that I'm the one that Chooses whether to drink or not. No outside force is actually making me drink. There might be a lot of justifications as to why someone drinks, like pain, or they can't sleep, or they feel they can't quit.

&#x200B;

I'm just here to say- when you want sobriety bad enough- you will have it. But you have to \*really\* want it. And that means- you stop drinking and you take responsibility for your actions.

&#x200B;

Its not something anyone can talk you into or do for you. And sometimes we need big and difficult life catalysts to really help us transform, I know I did. And its hard to make those first steps and stick with it, but **there is good on the other side.**

I decided that day I needed to quit drinking.I haven't  had a beer in over 24 hours and I feel so tired. I just can't get motivated to get up off the couch. I'm trying to at least do some laundry so I don't feel like I've wasted my day off being unproductive. Is it normal to feel so lethargic? Any advice on regaining my energy and motivation?",2

I dumped out all the beer, and instead had a bowl of ice cream, a few cookies, and a couple mini candy bars.

I miss being able to “turn off” and hide...but it’s important not to forget the terrible consequences of picking up a bottle.,"It’s funny, my life is changing so quickly these days, all in really positive ways. More and more opportunities are opening up because I’m not drinking, and I feel strong enough to actually act upon them. In doing so however, I find myself pretty scared of what’s to come. Also worried about my ability to handle high stress in the long term. 

Doctors appointment. Buy first car. Floss. Finish furnishing new place. Worry about money. Worry harder. Why isn’t your business open yet? Pandemic. Too bad. Try harder. Are you on the spectrum? Maybe. Probably. Seek diagnosis? Sure, when they’ll have time for me sometime in 2029...no friends? New city? Lonely? Tough shit. etc etc ∞

It’s a whirlwind. A cycle of overconfidence, overcommitment, subsequent loss of confidence, becoming overwhelmed, then short circuiting. All whilst living like a hermit.

But I can’t forget what it was like. Drinking 6 tall boys after I got off work at 2pm, then stumbling back to the liquor store for a bunch of whiskey nips. Then in a stupor order $30 in Chinese food, somehow skateboard through/amongst traffic at night, and eat almost all the food in one sitting. Mind you, I was making $12.50/hour back then. This lifestyle kept me in poverty... Later in the evening, perhaps for dessert, I’d call people terrible words while gaming online. I’d pass out, only to wake up at 5:15am for work feeling like shit. “I’ll be fine”, said the puffy-faced me, hoping I wouldn’t have a massive panic attack at work again. Those were always so embarrassing. Regardless, I’d have a massive panic attack at work whilst hiding in the walk in fridge. 2pm comes around. “It’s time to drink.”

I did that for years. I drove my clueless parents to tears due to lack of contact. I woke up surrounded in broken furniture, or a soiled bed, or unexplainable blood on the floor. I smelled and looked like shit. I passed up on several opportunities for romantic relationships because even I wouldn’t date me if I were someone else, so why bother. 

Hey alcohol fuck you. I don’t need your brief comfort. What is comfort really worth anyway? Certainly not worth my life.",14

It’s not simple at all, but it can be. In my job as a trucker now though, I haven’t been able to go to meetings, so I rely mainly on my own will power. All I can do is just go another day not drinking, and that seems to have worked this far.

I have read the science behind it and my family does have a history of drinkers, but when it's you somehow that rationalization doesn't take care of the emotions very well.

I used to drink every day, vodka, tequila, wine, etc.  It got really bad in 2014, but over the years I've drawn that down and now have a glass or two of wine a few days a week.  I had to go this route because when I was drinking more, cold turkey just didn't work.  I'd get max a few weeks sober.  

Done the whole AA thing and I do value its approach and the supportive nature, but find that groups like this suit my style a little better.  Life-long anxiety suffer so that probably has something to do with not wanting to be in too many group meetings (and probably also why I started drinking in the first place years ago).

During the five-day drive I had plenty of time to reflect on my life, but especially on my drinking. I thought about the mistakes I had made in the past, the people I had hurt, and the opportunities I had wasted. Throughout the drive I kept coming to the same conclusion: I have to stop.

When I arrived at my destination I cracked a beer in celebration without really thinking about it (like I had always done) and took a swig. For the first time, that sip didn't fill me with excitement or release my stress. If anything, I tasted failure and regret. I tasted the hangovers I would have in my new state, and the disgust others would have when they saw me at my worst. For the first time, I found myself not wanting to take another sip.

So I decided to run with that feeling. I poured the rest of that beer out on the ground and never looked back.

Three years later and I am in the best relationship I've ever experienced, and we just moved into a house together, right by the beach. Three years later and I am happier and healthier than I have ever been. Three years later and I am making amends, volunteering, and treating myself better. Sure, life isn't perfect and there are definitely things I would change, but A) such is life, and B) it would be so much worse if I were drinking.

Thank you to this community for your support and encouragement during the last few years. Hearing your stories, sharing in your accomplishments, and getting your collective wisdom has been a pillar of my sober journey, and I am grateful for each and every one of you.

I'm writing to remind myself how far I've come in the last two months. I've had a good ease in to the alcohol free lifestyle. Since March, I have been living with my parents. I haven't been around friends and the bar life  or late nights drinking with people around a fire. Next week, I will be moving back into a small drinking ski resort town. 


I know I will have many more opportunities to drink and I know people will say, ""just have a couple"" or ""one wont hurt"". I know because I've stopped drinking before around them. I'm not worried though. Ive spent the last two months mentally preparing for this. 


This past year, I haven't been enjoying drinking. Ive been doing it ""just because"". With a solid 2 months behind me, I feel confident. I also have the support of my partner and for that I am grateful.

It's hard to get engaged and interested but I'm sure this eases up with continued sobriety.

It really has registered that I'm an alcoholic- more broadly have addictive tendencies across the board.  I think the hard hitting grief of really accepting this has faded somewhat and now I feel like I'm a bit in the middle of an ocean.  Maybe early sobriety feels vast and big and overwhelming.  I don't know that I'm overwhelmed, maybe moreso underwhelmed which has always been a bit trickier for me to sit with.

I am so ecstatic and overwhelmed with positive emotions, I had just had to let it out!!!

1 year and 1 day ago today I was in such a terrible place and my body was basically shutting down from drinking.  I was struggling to get through every day, was miserable all the time, and was making everyone around me miserable, yet I somehow thought I felt good and was the life of every party.  I have came so far in just one year, and none of it would have been possible had I not stopped drinking.  

I was so terrified the day I admitted to everyone that I had a problem, and the day I walked into a detox center.  I was terrified the day i quit my job to start my own business, and have honestly been quit terrified since.  However going through those experiences has been the most rewarding things I've possibly ever done in my life.  My relationships with everyone have greatly improved and are so much more meaningful now i cant believe it or begin to describe it.  I am a person that I can be proud of now, and I feel so much better both mentally and physically.   

I never thought I had a drinking problem until I was too far gone.  I never thought I could quit, and didn't really want to, until it was obvious that I had to.  Even then I told myself I'd just dry out for a bit and get my head right, then i could drink like a ""normal"" person again.  Here I am 1 year later and so glad I was dumb enough to believe my own bullshit about drying out for a bit.  Thats what got me through the door of that detox center, and got me my first month sober.  Once I had a taste of that, I knew this was the life I wanted!

Sure I had struggles, it was hard AF.   However, no amount of getting drunk could match how great I felt being sober.  No hangover could ever feel how good it feels to wake up without having had drinks the night before.  Getting actual sleep, and waking up clear headed and not remorseful is such a beautiful thing.   I used that motivation as well as a ton of other tools to push through the cravings, and within a few months it became way less of a struggle.  

If i can do it, you can too!  If you are thinking about getting sober, I highly recommend it and am here for you.  If you are fighting to gain sobriety, I am here for you too.  I hope everyone can win this battle and find their new life and all the beauty and wonder that it has to offer.  Good luck and best wishes to all of you out there, thank you for reading this.",11

* The people in my life do not have the wherewithal to help me: emotional support does not pay rent.
* Being present in my life is fucking heartbreaking.

Questions:

1. How do you cope with being constantly present? (from the perspective of somebody who's just come out of for example drinking 3-4 8.7% beers most nights at 120 lbs)
2. How do you handle existing after you're done with your day?
3. What sorts of things have helped your stress tolerance throughout the early start of not drinking?
4. What sorts of things have you done to manage the burnout that comes from the feelings of alienation, betrayal, disappointment, and heartbreak that life brings to us every day?

What I am already doing:

* Task/Project management: I plan my weeks, months, and days out. (it's just to-do lists).
* Physical activity.
* Anything that slams the dopamine button (books, games, media)
* Sitting with those awful, awful feelings and crying buckets until the body stops shaking.
* Seeking professional help for stress tolerance (working on it)
* Sharing feelings with people.

Almost every night would go like this: I would drink wine, not accomplish what I wanted to, eat bad food, fall sleep late on the couch, wake up at 2 and go to bed but not be able to fall asleep, be hot and restless sleeping, wake up, feel guilty, and then do it again. I felt like I was tricking people and they didn’t know the truth. I was hiding my drinking from friends, family, my boyfriend, neighbors on recycling day, the store clerk, etc. I felt like I was constantly fearing that someone would find me out. I tried beer instead, which also didn’t lead me to moderation. I knew (and know still) alcohol was holding me back in life. Holding me back from achieving my goals for my body, business, and happiness. I had anxiety that I would “calm” with wine, only to feel it return stronger the next day. 

In March/April, I went a month without drinking and it felt amazing. The first week, where I am again now, was filled with anxiety and withdrawing from friends and family to avoid snapping at them or being around any alcohol. During that week, my skin cleared up, as it is now. My weight started dropping without doing anything, like it is now. I felt PROUD of myself. I didn’t worry about driving to the store or if someone could tell I had been drinking. My recycling can filled with seltzer cans instead of wine bottles and I didn’t hide it from my neighbors on trash day. I am more on top of my work and serve my clients better. 

I still struggle with motivation. My house isn’t as clean as I’d like it. My legs aren’t shaved and my hair has roots. I am not an energizer bunny and I don’t jump out of bed with a Mickey Mouse smile. AND THATS OK! I’m no longer hiding, lying, or feeling guilty (except when I have to leave my dog at home when I go to work haha).",8

My husband knows I’m not drinking, but thinks it’s because of a health issue (it triggers my heart palpitations) which is a part of it. I think if I asked him if he thought I was an alcoholic, he would balk. I know that he was aware of my nightly glasses of wine, but I’m sure he’s not aware of the real hold it had on me—how much I thought about drinking and worried about my drinking, and how hard it was for me to take a night off.

Part of me wants to keep the addiction piece to myself. I think because I’m afraid of being that vulnerable and I don’t want him to think of me as an addict. He’s not great talking about deep feelings and has at times tried to gloss over bigger issues because he’s not comfortable wading in. I don’t want to hear anyone say that they don’t think I have a real problem with alcohol, I feel very protective of my (102 days of) sobriety.

Another reason is that I’m afraid if I fail and drink again, then he will really see me as an addict. He is a good person and an excellent father and I don’t want him to think less of me.

On the other hand, I feel bad keeping the whole picture from him. He’s my husband and I love him. 

Any thoughts or advice? Is it ok if I keep plugging along while keeping an important piece of this journey to myself?",3

I wish I could go back to 12-days-ago me, slap that first beer out of my hand, and tell myself to ask for help. 

If there’s a silver lining, it’s that my FOMO has been shattered by this experience. Drinking wasn’t satisfying at all, and the physical and mental tolls have been awful.

In the first list, I can put all my plans, aspirations, needs, wants, and dreams. It’s a massive list. Some items are scarily ambitious, like “visit every continent”; others are modest and arguably unimportant, such as “beat Contra finally.” If I had to choose the highlights, it might look like this:

* Start a family
* Get in great shape
* Advance in my career
* Learn Java thoroughly
* Develop my own video game
* Volunteer and be of service more
* Write my self-help book
* Maintain an awesome website
* Learn a musical instrument
* *And on and on…*

My second list only has one item:

* Drink

Here’s the kicker: **I only get to work on one of these lists.** And every day I *get to choose* which one that is. If I focus on the second one, everything on the first fades into daydream grey before blinking out entirely. I’ve spent many, many years working on list two. And I’m fucking tired of it.

For 114 of the past 116 weeks (2 yrs, 3 mos.), I’ve worked on list one, and my life has become more manageable – and I’ve become a better manager of it. None of it has been magic. None of it has been easy. But it’s all been *practicable* – that’s policy language for “capable of being done.”

You'd think I'd learn my lesson but I don't get bad hangovers because i drink a lot of water while drinking and i've sort of perfected this sad, sad routine that keeps my buzz going throughout the day—but never too much to get blacked out or sick. It kind of feels like I've reached ""expert"" level as an addict since spending about 10 years as a functioning alcoholic but im SOOOOOO SICK OF IT!!

I wake up for work and my first thought is ""I hate this fucking routine"" just because I know I have to pour a drink in about 30 mins to take the edge. Then pack something I can drink at lunch, then after work, then through the night, repeat. I fucking hate it. I'm a prisoner to this drug and I don't know how to escape it after the detox cycle.

For detox I plan to start saturday morning. I have 4 pills of Librium leftover from a previous detox which should get me through day 1 and maybe part of day 2. Then I have a few dozen Naltrexone to hopefully mitigate cravings...but im still worried because I haven't detoxed after drinking this much volume this frequently. 

What are some things you all have done to make the detox period as safe and as comfortable as possible? How do you mentally prepare for the weeks and months afterward? How do you approach social gatherings where drinking is inevitable? These thoughts keep me up at night, but I'm grateful for this subreddit and the honesty and empathy everyone shows here. I hope all of you have a safe and sober weekend. Take care of yourselves.

I feel super content selling off all my positions at a loss and sit back to let the market do its thing. I also told my wife about the current loss I’ve incurred and what my strategy is. She is not happy. Things aren’t good right now but being sober and level headed makes me feel content and calm AF. I absolutely love that.

Need some advice.

It's a really close friends birthday today. All my pals will be going to his for a get together. There will be drinking and lots of it.

I've really been struggling with booze and trying to get sober a long time. I've been drinking around 8 years. Multiple benders a week. Sometimes they last days.

That means I'm drunk all the time, spending all my money and not doing anything productive. Well some productivity but mostly the minimum as I'm usually too hungover or depressed from drinking to get out of bed.

It's my third day here sober. I haven't done a whole lot since I ""quit"" mostly lay in bed. Today I felt better in myself. Although I hadn't done much today either. Just sit around, watch YouTube and play playstation.

My friend called and asked if I'd meet him at the pub for a drink before we go to the party. I felt so dumb saying it but I said ""I'm trying not to drink"". He laughed and said I've been saying that since may. 

Looking at that friend they you know do the typical weekend drinks/friends/partying but still manage to not mess up other areas of their life. I seem to be a destructive drunk. But my question now is will I get myself together if I quit or will I quit and still be wasting my potential. I'm just not sure that the drink is entirely the problem. I don't want to punish myself by not drinking if in the end I'm still going to be wasting my life without it.

Also after that phone call. Thinking about seeing friends and getting drunk. It makes me so devastated that I can't go and enjoy the party because of my toxic relationship with alcohol and the fact that my life is such a mess. I feel so ashamed. I don't know what to do.

Should I just go and drink and say f*ck it. Perhaps continuing to drink but be more controlled and sensible with it. Whilst working on being in a better place.

Or should I completely eradicate it from my life?

I really don't know. But I do know that the drink makes me feel better. Suddenly these emotions of my mess of life are otherwhemling. I've been craving the drink so much today. 

I don't know if I'm even asking a question here. I'm just venting. I hate this pity party I am throwing. But I can't help how I feel.",3

It’s just something I’ve thought about for a very long time.

Anyway, I’ve decided to not drink this month because my birthday is on the 30th and it’s kind of like a birthday present to myself.
Today is day 3.

I hope that one day I can last longer than a month. I don’t think my body does well with alcohol, and my boyfriend and I only fight when we have been drinking. Unfortunately I just really love craft beer and have worked at breweries for the past two years. Also I live in Australia and a friend jokingly said, “it’s impossible to stop drinking here.”

Anyway that’s my story for now. Just wanted to say hi.",17

I’ve done a bit of research on the science of sleep to try to figure out what’s wrong but I seem to be doing what is recommended. I do drink about 6 cups of coffee/tea a day but that’s usually in the morning to early afternoon. I drink about a gallon of water and eat 2500 calories a day, which I understand to be optimal for my bio (6’4, 185 lbs, very active). 

Does anyone else experience this and/or continue to have sleep problems after sobering up? I keep reading about how great sleep is after quitting drinking but I’m yet to see these specific benefits. Every other aspect of my life has greatly improved. Oh and also very little stress.

Edit: I think perhaps I’m underestimating the physiological effects of nicotine withdrawal?",3

It reminds me a bit of my relationship to beer, as the behavior is similar (without, of course, the consequences). For example, once I’m through one can I immediately crack another and go through 12 cans a day or more on the reg. And if I run out I HAVE to go to the store. I have a sodastream but much prefer the cans. 

I know this seems silly, but it makes me wonder if I should be trying to control this, for lack of a better word, compulsion? It’s not negatively impacting me in any way, although the people around me do think it’s a bit weird as they watch me crush like 3 seltzers in an hour. My diet soda intake has also increased over the past few weeks which I’m actively trying to cut out because it is a random new thing and I didn’t drink soda at all prior to last month and I crave it now.

I've noticed that multiple times an hour, I find myself scanning my counters and floors for where there was usually always a bottle sitting. 

And as much as its disappointing to not see one, it's also equally relieving. I dont NEED it. I tell my brain to stop the scanning and it does until I catch myself doing it again. Always searching, wanting, but that feeling of relief when it's not there to grab its what's keeping me going. I want it, but I dont REALLY want it. I can do this. I can do this. I can do this.

Previous daily drinker. Drank every night. Didn’t usually get plowed, but had enough every night to get a solid buzz and a bit drunk. Didn’t have all terrible hangovers the next day usually but never felt good. I used it to help with anxiety/depression. It only made it worse. Anxiety is nearly gone without it. Can’t believe the difference it has made there. From frequent panic attacks to it not being much of an issue. It’s still there but it’s not nearly as severe. Blood pressure was in the 140s and now is under 120. I’m down 33lbs. I’ve been able to save thousands of dollars since I quit. I still occasionally miss beer, but it’s more for the social aspect than drinking it. 

I can’t believe the cycle I was in and I can’t believe how beneficial I perceived it to be. I really thought I was gaining so much from it with my social life, anxiety/depression, etc. I wasn’t. You’re not. Nobody is. It’s a horrible cycle. It’s hard to quit, but do it. Life’s 10000000x better on the other side. I know it doesn’t seem like it will be but it is. The social aspect isn’t even an issue. Sure, I’ve stopped hanging out as much with friends that place too much value on drinking but that’s allowed other friendships to grow. The interactions I have are more meaningful and I remember all of them. I never have to worry about how I’m getting home, saying something stupid, acting liking a moron, ruining something because I puked or peed on it, or if I will feel like shit the next day. I never have to go through my texts the next morning to see if I have any of those ‘oh no I sent that to them?’ moments. 

It’s just been incredibly positive. Thank you guys for being there. I don’t always comment in here or post often but I read a lot and it’s been so helpful. Thanks a ton and for those still debating quitting or in the throes of it... you got this! Don’t let temptation win. You’re strong! IWNDWYT",15

I meant to stay for at least 30 days, and all was going well initially, but I ended up leaving yesterday after getting into a pretty heated argument with the Director, which I have to admit was a good bit my fault. I can try to blame it on stress or perceiving her as being rude, but ultimately I'm the one that got up and walked out. Anyway, as upset and disappointed as I was at this outcome, I didn't drink last night. I called my sponsor and she will still help me working the A.A. steps, and we can go to meetings at other places if the shelter doesn't want to allow me back as a visitor. I hope they do, as the Director isn't always around, in fact yesterday was my first time meeting her. And I had great relationships with the house mom, custodians, and other girls there trying to work the program. So I'm hoping I won't completely lose that resource, but I am planning backups. 

I'm proud of myself that I didn't use that as an excuse to pick back up. At least they gave me a better idea of how I should be living and acting, and allowed me to sober up so I could have a somewhat clear mind. Today is going to be a good day. I now generally prefer sober me to drunk me. I don't lose my sense of humor like I feared I would, and I have so much more energy. I tossed a ball for my dog when I got home and without putting anything extra into the throw it went twice as far as my throws normally would go. Just small things like that I'm noticing. Also my little cousin now wants to stop drinking, and is considering trying out a couple of meetings with me.

In the past 1 year and 9 months since my birthday, I think I've managed to pull off going 2 days without drinking maybe 3 or 4 times, and besides that it's been every day. I recently bought a 16 pack and figured I'd at least have 3 or 4 left for the next day but I woke up with one in the box, and I know it's only going to get worse. One of the main reasons I wanted to post this was because I feel like there are things happening to me that even the people I know who I know are alcoholics don't talk about, because it's not good conversation and, because I feel like I've taken it much harder than the people in my real life. My dad and my roommate both are heavy drinkers and probably drink just about every day as well, with my roommate bringing home a case of beer probably 4 to 6 nights a week and never leaving a beer overnight. But I don't see or hear any of these issues from him, and my dad seems like he gets by with nothing more than a slight beer belly.  
Every second of every day my upper back is killing me, constantly popping and feeling like it's bent or contorted. I can't sit still anymore and I know people probably think it looks weird. I even feel the pain get worse during drinking and I know that it's the cause. On top of that my lower back just burns and when I try to stand up still for too long it stings and sometimes my legs shake. And typically if I go on a big streak that lasts several days I come out of it twitching and spasming for a day or two, usually giving myself just a smaller dose of booze to try and numb the movements, and ultimately feeling like shit. I've also gained weight for the first time in my life that has completely drained the confidence out me and made me want to avoid any attempt to make new friends, date, or even hang out with some friends of mine who I can tell are disappointed. I've tried to diet or attempt to work out to no avail and meanwhile my roommate still has a six pack and looks like hes in perfect shape. The worst part in all honesty is that my body is so used to falling asleep from the booze that I don't remember how to fall asleep normally anymore and any attempt to quit has been met with horrible insomnia, which of course is a seductive excuse to just drink a little bit.  
I know I have to stop now because my body just can't take it anymore, and I wish I could have stopped all the times in the past when I told myself it was finally time or made bets against it with my friends. But now im stopping just because I have to. I can't take the pain, I can't afford it, I need to get a new job and a better life and I'm out of time. Tonight's gonna be the second night I haven't slept and I'm very grateful for the users here for giving me something to do for most of it. Nothing right now feels like it will cure the immense sense of boredom. Quitting feels like it will be the hardest thing I've ever done and I don't even know why. Most of the time getting drunk just ends up with me cracking open the beer or the bottle and drinking away while I do whatever waiting for that moment when im finally ""drunk"" and my night is epic but just before I get there I stumble over my computer and pass the fuck out on the floor waking up unsatisfied, and trying again tomorrow. If anyone reads this who is further along than I am, remember that drinking fucking sucks, and I won't be doing it with any of you tonight.",3

I’ve never been one to be open about my problem and the times that I have I have regretted it in one way or another. For the few months I have tried to count my drinks each week and gradually lessen the amount. I was at about 50 drinks a week when I started and managed to get down to 25-30 about a month ago. But after a weekend of being around family who drank liquor (I’ve been drinking mainly beer for awhile now) I started picking up pints of vodka the last few weeks and my drink levels are back at the 50 drink range. I finished this last pint about five hours ago and I just felt this tired feeling inside me which has been showing up more and more as I get older (I’m 27)  and just want to quit, I know attempting to limit my drinks is futile and I am reaching out here hoping for some support.

This started as a punishment to myself for getting wasted and missing my close friend's wedding. My friends were texting, calling, trying everything under the sun to get in contact with me and I lay there ignoring all their calls thinking ""the very least I can do if I'm not going, is keep away from alcohol this weekend cause I've really fucked myself over this time"".

I started feeling loads better within a couple of days. Realised that drinking every day had meant I was living on a permanent hangover. Felt like a superhero with a spring in my step, literally skipping down the street with the newfound energy I had!

Course that feeling wore off within a month or so but it was enough to help me realise that the alcohol was doing me harm. Lots of people who were healthy were really happy and proud of me! Some folk who were not so healthy were not so happy for me... 

I had to cut out a big old group of (pub) friends and a bad relationship ended. I'm reconnecting now with a good few people who I've alienated in the past. I've found the Tao and read it every day. I'm trying to stay as  humble as I can cause as soon as I get cocky with any of this I will likely backtrack.

This group is absolutely phenomenal! I'm approx 7.5 months sober, my longest break by far. I would take breaks here and there, my previous record was 4 months. The idea is to go 12 months, and once that's finished I certainly don't plan on returning to my old ways (unless I do, in which case it'll be permanent sobriety after that, last chance!). Another added motivation to drinking less once the break is over is due to the insidiousness of the alcohol lobby, so I would certainly like to ""vote less with my wallet"". 

It's hard to envisage where I'll be at once the 12 months is over, whether I'll be so uninterested that I just won't drink ever again, which I've heard is a common reaction, but as it stands, I'm somewhat looking forward to the break being over lol (but I think a fairly strict quarantine in Melbourne is contributing to those feelings). Also I should add, I don't see any chance of falling off the wagon at this point, before the 12 months is up. 

So, to summarize I was wondering if a) there are people who only planned on taking a certain amount of time off alcohol, but then proceeded to remain sober after the time elapsed and b) if people took an extended break and were successful in changing their relationship to alcohol after that break. But I mostly just wanted to share my thoughts and experiences! 

Thanks for being such an awesome and supportive group.",6

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

She bottled everything up until she labeled something as me not wanting to spend time with her anymore. The lack of communication ripped us apart and being smothered did not help at all.

We planned our future together and everything else. She always said ""you're stuck with me forever!"" It is truly devastating because she really does mean to the world to me.

So now we're giving each other alone time but I'm worried sick she won't come back. I am giving her all the space she needs and not communicating with her unless she starts it. Alcohol has separated us a couple times but now I have been sober the longest time being with her. I'm afraid it could be too late. I wish she knew how serious I was this time.

Please pray for me this is an extremely difficult time. I feel completely blindsided by this after the huge sacrifice I made.",19

I was very afraid to get sober because I didn’t want to lose my friends.

Lately I have been doing some more digging and realizing I was afraid to get sober because I didn’t want people to get to know the real me. I have a very hard time opening up and being honest with people about my struggles. Drinking was the only time I felt vulnerable enough to tell people how I felt. Drinking was the only time I could laugh loud, dance and be silly. It’s so hard to show up be sober and be open. I don’t want to be watered down version of my self. I am still fun, loud and opinionated. It’s just had to get my self out of my shell sober. But I am working on it. I have not lost my friends they don’t care I don’t drink.

About a month ago, I decided that I wanted to quit, and discovered that I'd probably die without medical intervention, which isn't an option for me, so I'm paring down, and I think I'm doing a pretty good job. 

My last bottle lasted 8 days, and I bought this one on Monday. My son's mom called basically to tell me that she's talking shit about me to our son because I'm struggling to find a job that has any future potential or pays more than $12 an hour, and most of those require weekends, which means I won't see my son basically ever, as she has to have him during the week because school. Apparently having a shit job and never seeing my kid gives me value, while freelancing as a handyman and selling woodworking projects, keeping the lights on and food on the table doesn't. She's not entirely wrong, and she talks out of both sides of her mouth, but that kid is literally the only reason I'm alive. I NEED to see him.

I drank that night. Killed over 1/4, almost 1/3, of the handle.

3 days later, there's almost exactly half of it left, and while I've slept like shit, I'm able to post here after 10pm. I'm not completely alcohol free, but I'm going to bed sober, for the 3rd day in a row, without day drinking, and I will not drink any more tonight. 

It's hard, but I'm doing it. I'm already amazed at how just a cup of coffee can fix the whole morning after shitty sleep when you're not dragging a hangover. Looking forward to both life without booze entirely, and the heavier wallet, to boot.",14

My Grandfather died drinking. My Uncle died of repercussions - epilepsy acquired from a blow to the head. Alcohol was always present in our house growing up. My mom's a binge drinker of variable frequency. My father was a drunk, who now 'moderates' with variable success. 

My sister is a runaway train of alcohol addiction, bulemia, anxiety disorder, trauma, and depression. Her path to her current low has been a series of snakes, slides, and booze - bad actors, bad luck, and bad choices. It's been real bad for at least 2 years now.

Me? I was high functioning, but hard drinking. With focused effort, I could make a handle of swill whisky last a week. Other wise, I might go through 2. Meanwhile, I did well at work and generally kept a lid on my shit. Most people had no idea how much I drank, although a handful I liked to drunk dial were concerned at how often I was drunk. I quit in July, largely thanks to naked mind.

Today talking to my dad, admitting that I had slipped up and wasn't happy about it, he tried to reassure me. I appreciate the thought, but it didn't work. On one level he's right - I do think I could moderate - I just think it would probably suck. The constant struggle to keep it in check is a pain in the ass. The hangovers are awful. And eventually, life is going to knock me down and if booze is in the picture it won't make it prettier. I might even end up in as bad a shape as my sister.  

This is a hell of a f\*\*\*ing year - and every day I hear the voice in the back of my head offering a brief relief - I'm not craving a good feeling, I just want numbness. Thankfully, everyday I get away from the slip ups it seems to get a little quieter.

I played on the slides and had fun on the swings. I was giggling like crazy. I felt so content even with the two parents staring at me like I was lunatic. I could tell they thought I was insane but I didn't care. If only they knew the happiness I felt in that moment. I felt free. I wanted to cry. Life felt so simple, it was in this moment. It wasn't at the bottom of the bottle.

It’s bitter sweet. Everyone around me on vacation is drinking. It used to be my favorite part. But my relationship with alcohol has changed. 

Not suddenly or all at once. More of a slow slipping. It doesn’t feel warm and fuzzy. It feels cold and toxic. I approach with caution, not with open arms.

I still feel moments of longing. Of wanting to fill a void. Of needing......something. That feeling of yearning that comes with being alive. But I know alcohol isn’t the answer. It never was. 

Sobriety isn’t some magical fix all. But it’s a brave way to be human. At the least, it’s not breaking anything in what’s already a broken world. And that’s enough. Wholeness is the goal, but I’ll take less broken too.

&#x200B;

On the flip side, I do feel very accomplished when I walk out without buy any alcohol.

Adding an elaboration edit: To elaborate, this is a new issue caused by quarantine. Due to social distancing TJs in my area have now created a line area before you can approach the cashiers, this line is located in the beer, liquor and wine area. So, you wait in a line that winds through each alcohol aisle before they assign you to a cashier. The line is long currently because temperatures have been reaching 95+ which causes TJs to let more people in instead of having them wait inside. 

Now, I have not had a problem with this prior to summer much, however, recently having to wait in this line has become a mental chore. Do I go to other grocery stores? Sure. But TJs is still the safest and has what I’m looking for most often. 

As a person who’s main source of drinking revolves around food, and casually grabbing a few bottles to pair with dinner this is what is triggering me; holding a basket of groceries, walking through every single aisle of liquor during the season which I would drink the most, summer.",69

I haven't even touched caffeine in a month. My mental and emotional health is better than it's ever been. I haven't felt this un-awful since I was a child.    

The second I got the memo that my place of work was opening up again my heart sank. I nearly cried as I was crossing the street. I don't think I can go back there without ""going back"".   

I apologize to anyone whose lockdown experience hasn't been the same as mine. I know a lot of people lost their livelihoods and I'm lucky to even have a job right now. I just can't do it, and that makes me an ungrateful PoS.

Anyways, it's an amazing feeling to choose something to watch with my wife and longer be told, ""... We have seen that already"". That has felt like a kick to the gut knowing how many times I've been so gone that I can't remember anything from our nights in togrther. I love being able to really immerse myself in activities now and not feel like I need to dull my senses because all I was really doing was cheating myself out of a better experience.

Tomorrow's challenge is looming it's a friend's party I'll be expected to go and to drink. Going to have to think of a way out of it. To be honest I'll just be honest with them I can't be at a party right now.

I made myself walk the last 15 minutes in shame because I refused to give up completely and now I KNOW I MUST make the gym a daily habit.

I knew I had packed on pounds but because I dont really eat too poorly I chalked it up to being 30. Turns out a 12-18 pack of PBR or Rainier a day really catches up with you....

Speaking of which - 

I poured out all my booze like I also mentioned last post. The liquor wasn't the difficult part - I've always been a cheap beer kinda guy because of how light and deceptively refreshing it tastes. So I wasted no time pouring the Kraken down the drain. What really hurt was my last 2 Coors I had in the back of the fridge from my last binge. I felt like fucking Frodo in Mordor with a whispering ring in my ear telling me sweet little lies. I couldn't crack them open to pour out so I just threw them in the trash whole and full. 

Even though the natural cravings weren't bad today - because of the tasking I gave myself it turned out to be a much more difficult day.

I've been looking into fermentation for making my own hot sauces.  I want to cure my own pancetta.  I have so much more time and money after all these years of sobriety.  But the most recent desire has been to make my own cheese.  Doing my research i found that for aging cheese my fridge is too cold.  But my basement is too warm.  I needed something that would hold between 50-55 F ideally.  So I now own a wine fridge for the first time in my life.  The irony hit me on the way home.

2020-09-03 15:32:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/im0e8x/alcoholfree_booze/,Alcohol-free 'booze',"Hi everyone,

Before I start I'd like to warn anyone that's prompted by my post to get some alcohol-free 'booze': some of those beverage actually do still contain a small amount of alcohol! Please beware of that and carefully read the labels! I also marked my post as a spoiler because I see how it might be triggering cravings for an actual drink in some.

&#x200B;

>!So, I'm curious about what your stance is on alcohol-free beer, wine, or similar beverages. For me, I feel like it can definitely serve as a means to make the transition easier. My own cravings aren't solely focused on being under the influence (although that is obviously what my brain associates booze with) but also on the specific taste of a glass wine or a beer or an IPA or whatever.  The taste is always a bit off compared to the 'real deal' although some come really close, but this might also be helping my brain wean off the association and expectation that, for example, a cold beer always means intoxication via that specific taste that I'm after. Since you still act the same by drinking a similar beverage but the taste and effect are different, maybe the brain will stop being such a whiny lil' bitch about it?!<

>!I also see how it might be impractical to keep the addiction habit alive, in a way that nictotine-free vaping would be, or could even make the switch back to actual alcohol easier.!<

The first sip, the buzzed feeling, the sleepiness, the sadness, the heaviness, the headache, and the unfulfilled morning I woke up to the next day (headache still going strong) were all dreadful.

I’d convinced myself for a month that I should try to drink again (that I’d have to) to be sure that I couldn’t learn to moderate.  

All I ended up doing was disappointing myself.

I didn’t even enjoy the buzz, my evening was wasted, and my body was rejecting what it worked so hard to get rid of.

I didn’t realize how much I needed that mistake to realize how fine I am with my sobriety. I had myself convinced I could take a break, learn to moderate, and drink on certain occasions.

After drinking two nights ago, I realized that I don’t even know if I WANT to learn to moderate or drink on occasions anymore. I felt awful and it did absolutely nothing for me. Why even go back? I love my new lifestyle.

Here’s to day 2 (following a month and a slip). 

Still feeling awesome and I no longer have the nagging “what if” inside me.

Instead I get to be present with my family and my partner. I get to help my grandparents with their appointments and spend time with them (which is rare in the age of COVID-19) AND I’m actually not being a passive aggressive bitch because my plans were postponed.

Maybe for now, maybe forever. 

Last year I was in an accident that disabled me. I got a flesh eating virus that spread through skin, fat, muscle, and bone, at various degrees of intensity, from my right shoulder, down my arm, across to my chest, down to my abdomen, and up to my sinuses. As such, my right side is practically useless, I am always in pain, and I am partially deaf. 

Since the accident I noticed the relationship between me and alcohol had changed. It was no longer a fun thing for me, I was consuming too much too fast because I was seeking out the ""buzz"" that would numb the pain, either physically, mentally, or both.

I'm sure I don't have to explain to all of you how that became out of control. I already do not leave the house because of my PTSD, so I began to self medicate. Maybe once a week I would simply feel to overwhelmed with the pain or emotion and drink. I started to scare myself and stress out my loved ones.

8 days ago I had a break through and it was illuminating. 

I saw a path in front of me that included alcohol, as well as pain, hardship, and health problems. I saw a version of me on that path with a crutch called alcohol, who was even sicker, even more depressed, and ultimately alone.

I then imagined a different path, where I stand up to my physical and mental demons and go back to the coping mechanisms I had before my accident. I saw myself walking down that path, happier, healthier, growing into a new person with this disability, re-nurturing friendships I let lapse, and honestly, being the person Mr. Rogers would want me to be. 

Since then there have been moments where I have been overwhelmed. I am having a lot of testing done right now for some complications from my accident. I am stressed with some house renovations that seem to only get worse. My dog slipped and fractured his pinky in his paw so I've had to spend money I didn't have. There have been so many moments already in only 8 days.

But I keep thinking of the woman on the better path. I think of how happy I saw her, and how I cannot become her if I choose alcohol as a crutch on my path. I must walk on my own, tall, and determined. I must have faith in myself.

I still don't feel ""happy"". Maybe I'll be happy when I get my own place. Maybe I'll be happy when I go back to school.

I keep thinking the next thing I need to do will bring me happiness, and it doesn't.

I need to reevaluate what ""happiness"" actually is. Why can't I just be happy with what I already have and have already accomplished?

I've been struggling with alcoholism for a couple years. Once covid hit, my drinking turned from nightly to give on five day binges every couple weeks. I did a 28 day inpatient at Hazelden in Minnesota, immediately relapsed and then relapsed three more times over the next month. I went to another inpatient at The Retreat which is basically an AA crash course and relapse by the end of my stay there. I got into a sober house about three weeks later, made it 20 days and relapsed Friday, ended up in detox and now am back at my parents. I've been working with a sponsor for about three months and I was going to 4-5 AA meetings weekly before my last relapse for three weeks. I know I can't control my drinking, but I lie to myself and say I can get away with it for a night but I can't. That's what's been happening before every relapse. I'm feeling really hopeless and I don't know what to do anymore. I never really felt I fitted in with the AA community because of the strong Christian influence, people telling me I need to find God and conservative undertones at the meetings I've been to. 

If anyone has some similar experiences I would love to hear from you. I could really use some hope because I feel like I'm doomed.

Unfortunately, and unsurprisingly, I have of course failed in that. I drank about 2 bottles of wine last night, alone. I called two of my friends and can't really remember the conversation, this is the second time that I have done this with one of these friends. Both have been very kind today, but I feel like I am never going to get better if I don't address the fact that this has to stop, because it is bad for my health, and because it will ruin my chances of getting to the kind of life that I want...whatever that is. 

I don't really feel comfortable talking to anyone I know about how I have a drinking problem. It's too scary. So I guess I just need to say it to you guys - I have a drinking problem. I am a problem drinker. Some might call me an alcoholic. I almost always have memory loss when I drink. I almost always binge. When I am going to an event that has alcohol, it consumes my thoughts. I can leave it if I really put my mind to it, but that in itself is a sign that it is a problem. 

I have joined a gym, and I am about to go for a run to sweat out some of the alcohol that I am sure is still swilling in my veins. I am going to post here again, like I used to on the 3 or 4 times I have tried to quit.

Then I became anxious about what would happen if I had to reset it because of a slip or if I would make it to that next milestone . Things like day 69 ( haha ) , day 100 ( triple digits , hooray for me ! ) , day 365 ( I did it ! ) Blah , blah , blah . I'm turning it off today with 125 days ( -1 ) that I have sober .

PS . About that  ( -1 day ) . Yes , I had a slip , of sorts . It was because I was so frustrated about being sober for a decent amount of time and still was unable to sleep . After trying everything I could think of , I went and  bought some booze , drank some and you know what ? It tasted horrible , I couldn't sleep anyhow and I felt like total shit physically and emotionally the next day . Does this mean I'm ' cured ' , Nope . Can I sleep better now , Nope . Am I ' better ' than others , Nope . I really and truly just don't want to drink today , I want to experience my life without booze , I want to know who I truly am . Drinking alcohol is a lie , it will prevent me from getting what I want in every way imaginable . Being honest with myself , posting here , helping others , learning to accept who I am , finding meaning in my life  are what I want and booze is not the answer , far from it .

I (40/m) have been drinking everyday for about 7 years but never to the point of it creating problems for me or anyone else. I can have a few beers or a fifth of liquor and function pretty normally. I have quit for days and weeks but never months. I have a good job but no immediate family so I guess there isn't much to screw up except for my own health.
So once again, I am at the point of facing down my biggest problem with not drinking: boredom. 
I am a few days sober with not much of a difference in my life. I pretty much do the same things I would normally do just without a buzz or socializing at happy hour. I have hobbies that I end up doing less because they are more fun with a buzz (music & painting).
I don't have much of a social life so giving up happy hour is difficult.

One thing that I realized is that the root of my problems isn't alcohol, as I had suspected. I've been abusing it out of habit caused by underlying mental health issues. My perfectionism had gotten out of control. Being with my thoughts rather than choosing to turn them off has provided me with the clarity to see this. It's been hard. I list constantly. I'm always thinking about what's coming up next, how to be more productive, how to optimize various aspects of my life, things I could've done better, and my body's flaws. I'm nearly incapable of relaxing, and that's where the alcohol problem came in. I feel very reluctant to have broken this habit in the last few weeks. A month ago, I could have sworn I was experiencing depression, but those thoughts have left me. As it turns out, I was inducing my own depression by using depressants! I now feel that I have more insight as to why I'm not feeling myself. My mental health may not be in the most stable of places still, but I know I have to keep trying to practice mindfulness and not use alcohol as a quick means to get there.

This is honestly the longest I've been without alcohol since high school (I'm 26 now), so I really am feeling successful today. Abstaining from destructive behavior, has been such a worth while decision. If anyone has any advice pertaining to any of my above mentioned feelings, that would be great.

I'm a 51 yr old female who is am incredibly blessed with a good husband, wonderful children, and a strong career, but I feel crappy about myself every single day because I can not get control over my drinking and this has gone on for years now.  

Heavy drinking is not new to me (started as a teen) and everyone close to me has complained about it at some point.  I'm setting a great example for my teens - Ugh.  With age, my drunk behavior is much more subtle but the actual drinking quantities are considerably bigger and it effects by overall health and weight.  It's hard to drink at work functions now because it's such an effort to pace myself to a ""normal"" drinking amount.  Also, alcohol keeps me stuck at home a lot because I don't want to drink and drive, and I don't usually go to things in the evening where there's no alcohol because if I stop drinking I get sleepy.  Everyone I'm close with is also a heavy drinker (no surprise) and I swear we just keep having the same  drunk conversations over and over, and I feel like I'm degrading my whole live experience.  I mean I don't have to tell you, it's just one shitty consequence after another and I keep doing the same thing over and over.

I'm awakened every morning (usually at like 4am) by an overwhelming anxiety and sense of impending doom which is strongly fueled by my drinking because I feel so guilty and also because alcohol raises hormone levels that trigger early AM anxiety (or it does for me at least).  Every day I wake up hungover, anxiety and guilt ridden, and I swear I'm done - I'm going to eat healthy, workout and not drink.  By 2pm I'm craving a drink.  I usually am able to wait until 4-5pm to start drinking and I drink until I go to sleep.  Then I wake up at 4am feeling panicked and start over.  Why?

I'm so over all of this anxiety and negative self talk... so yeah.  It's time.  Here we go - Day 1.  (YIKES!)",6

I woke up this morning clear headed, no residual cough from chainsmoking a pack (or 2) while imbibing. I am so sick of blackouts and the embarrassment and the shame. My drinking got to the point I'd feel all of those even if there weren't a reason to actually feel them. I plan on checking in here way more often this go round. Psychotic thoughts would occur - literally convincing myself awful things happened and i did awful things. Sometimes I actually did. It was a roll of the dice.

Drinking has caused such awful things in my life. Luckily I still have my husband, who really is a champion for putting up with a lot of my shit. I am tired of blaming my issues on the sexual assaults that happened to me when I was younger (drunk or drugged, everytime, btw) and using alcohol as a crutch to deal with the trauma I quite literally never dealt with. I have tried so many times to get sober but I never changed anything else or addressed any of the issues I was drowning in the use of alcohol. This time I'd like to address them. I guess the first step would be writing the above as a public post. 

I found a staggering statistic today that just blew me away - 90% of alcoholic women are either the victim of sexual assault or a victim of parental abuse. While i am sure I have known this, this just blew my mind. I cannot believe I allowed myself to fall into this statistic. It feels like I have allowed myself to be victimized over and over and over again. In my case, for almost 15 years. Although i claimed to be *over it* clearly I wasn't, because drinking is slow suicide whether I like it or not. 

This ends now. If you are a person who falls into a similar description, i encourage you to look into the trauma, too. I may have only a few days (again) but I think I finally get it. I can't stay sober unless I deal with this big reason that made me want to black out and abuse my body in the first place. I hope this helps someone. Trauma and sexual assault are not unique to women, either. So this is just a reminder for everyone to maybe do a mental check in - this is just the statistic that shook me and made me have a GIANT realization.

I am fully committed to being sober now and have been for a while. My motivation is simple: I am now in touch with my son. I am even meeting him and his girlfriend tonight (for the first time) and going out to a nice dinner. I am really excited and feel super fortunate. 

This sub has been really helpful, but also so has my sobriety counter. This may sound silly, but it really motivates me when I look at that number every morning. I LOVE seeing that number climb. It helps solidify my goal daily. I strongly suggest trying it if you need a little extra motivation.

One of my best friends passed away suddenly last week. We're all in shock still. The funeral is tomorrow. Due to COVID, the close friends are meeting at his wife's house afterwards where there will definitely be drinking.

These friends definitely know me as the guy who goes hard when it comes to alcohol. I'm not a purist, ""IWNDWYT"" type, but for the last two months I've been doing really well with my fitness, health, and drinking habits. Max I've had is four drinks in a week in the last two months, and more weeks where I didn't drink at all than otherwise. A huge part to this has been the quarantine - it's so much easier not to drink when not in a social gathering - drinking has definitely been my crutch for social anxiety.

Anyways, when the old crew gets together I'm certain I'll be the only one not tying one on. And while I'm completely happy with that decision for myself, I don't want anyone else to feel uncomfortable and I don't want the focus to be on my recent life decisions when we're here to honor our friend. Moreso, I think it'll put me on a pedestal while everyone else is mourning. 

I'm proud of the decisions I'm making and am happy to talk about how much more alive I am as a result, but that comes off as so pretentious when you're talking to a buddy you used to drink with all the time at a celebration for another buddy you used to drink with all the time.

I guess I don't know what to say - should I just gloss it over with a, ""nah man, I'm not really feeling it tonight""? A few of the friends I've stayed close with know my situation. I also feel like even making this post is making it about me, so there's that.",3

I hurt someone that I care about deeply last night (as a result of drinking).  When I'm sober, I would never even think about hurting someone I care so much about and therefore, I'm really struggling to come to terms with this outcome. 
Whenever I drink, my mind races and all my internal emotional conflict and trauma surfaces- It's a cycle. I hate the damage I can do when drinking and I'm ready to, one day at a time, refrain from drinking entirely. I want to be the best version of myself always and drinking doesn't allow that for me. I'm so happy I discovered this as a resource.  Please wish me well on my journey.",6

This time I am riding my bike almost everyday, got a new paddle board, and i skateboard every night.  Usually by the time I sit down for TV and dinner I am too tired to do much besides enjoy dinner, TV and think about the fun day I had, not counting work.  So like i said so far so good.  A couple of things I wonder about are, when I was drinking I would maybe wake up once in the night to pee and that was it, now at 45 days with out booze, I get up and go 3-4 times, is this normal?  Also the sweets, I was hoping by now the sugar cravings would have died down, but only seem worse, any advise?  I am still way more tired in the mornings than I expected at this point, but other than that I am surprised at how much I am enjoying all the things I used to love to do, and love no hang overs, and feeling hydrated every morning.

All good. Then they called to say I have heart issues (probably caused by the booze). Which means the detox is significantly more dangerous than normal. We discussed options such as postpone as they aren’t taking in patient at the moment. But we agreed it should go ahead, though I need to be aware there is a serious risk of death.   
They are arranging it will change from just a nurse for an hour, to two nurses and a doctor for a large part of the day and have things like a defibrillator with them. They are also going to try and arrange an ambulance on stand by. My nearest town normally has one that parks up a few miles away waiting for calls and they are hoping to have it nearer my home as I live remote.   


Apparently if I get through Monday ok, then the risk is much smaller. Seems like it is going to be a “interesting week. On the plus side, I am writing my will tomorrow",21

Reading bedtime stories and being fully present is amazing gift. Having conversations with my wife and fully remembering them is an amazing gift. Not sneaking my hidden bottles/cans out to recycling is an amazing gift. Not worrying about when I can make a run to the liquor store every day is an amazing gift. Not feeling that aching on my right side every morning is an amazing gift.

I understand the potential pink cloud phase and that these feelings may not last long term, but for now, they feel great. After admitting my problem to my wife, things really fell into place and I've honestly had no desire to actually drink.... I mean, it has crossed my mind, but the consequences are so vivid and obvious that it is not close to justifiable (these aren't related to threats from my wife, they are consequences related to me and the people around me suffering in the end).

Still having crazy dreams, sleeping harder than I've ever slept, and feeling really tired right after work. I did notice that I can become extremely irritable if my blood sugar gets low (and it seems to very rapidly right now) - it's like being super, super, hangry....figured that one out yesterday after a bit of research and trail/error.... lots of snacks on hand now and eating at regular intervals.

I am an alcoholic.,"I had my first drink literally 7 years ago on the same week when I was 14. I continued to use alcohol and started abusing it when I was 18-20. It had always been a problem, but never a serious problem.

In June, a month before my birthday, I was sexually assaulted. That was the first night I have ever blacked out. Since then, I have drank maybe 20 times, and blacked out around 8. I have driven ""tipsy"" a shitload of times, mildly drunk a handful, but 2 weeks ago drove black out drunk for the first time ever. I have no recollection of it, besides waking up to an entire emptied bottle of Jager.

I have been using alcohol to cope. I do not drink every day and have only gone on maybe a dozen benders in my life. But when I do drink, I can't control myself. It's not 1, 2 or 4 shots, it's 10-15.

I look forward to checking in here, getting physically and mentally healthy and stop being a fucking deadbeat and make my mother in heaven proud.

It always was curious why alcohol would be such a stumbling block and yet if someone offered me free cigarettes for life I wouldn't even be bothered. So I'm chatting with my subconscious daily and saying 'no drinking wine isn't cool, it doesn't make one look sophisticated no matter what the tv and internet pics seem to say. No being drunk isn't fun you look like an idiot and you lose inhibition. Alcohol isn't a social past time you're right, it's  waste of time and money'. And instantly the memory will pop up of where that belief came from! And then it's easier to address it and rewrite that belief.

I’ve always struggled with moderation and made a lot of excuses. There was a time where drinking was just fun… And then a time where I was trying to get so numb that I would go through the cycle of blackouts, panic, and shame. 
In the past few years I’ve “gained control”, but I feel like sometimes we can get creative. I found a way, like many others I’m sure, to turn drinking into a “hobby” and when something is a hobby you feel like it’s OK because others think you’re just passionate about it… it’s a phase of interest...it’ll go away. Maybe in your mind you start to realize the guise of “passion” means you count the minutes until the next drink. On the surface you think you’re fooling everyone - ‘it’s just something they enjoy exploring and experimenting with’ etc etc - but in the quiet hours it’s wondering if anyone knows how badly you felt you needed it. That the days where one or two in the presence of others is just scratching the itch that you really get after once you’re home alone. When three more without anyone else’s judgment is just more “enjoying” and then the shame sets in. 
I read so many posts and you guys are so eloquent at how you can express the cycle...I’m not sure I’m making any sense...
Right now I have some clarity and the motivation to draw a distinction between something I don’t handle the best and where I think I could be if I let it go. The something that I just want to have less control over my personality. When your friends and family consider your interest in drinking a personality trait it might be a good sign you’re headed for troubled waters.

I had joined my partner in attempts to quit or slow down several times over the years, but this was the first time I told myself what I needed and wanted to do, in those quiet early hours of the morning when you just cannot lie to yourself, because it feels like God himself is in the corner listening.

I lasted 19 days before relapsing, and I have probably tried to quit 10 times since then.

On August 23rd, I had my last glass of wine, and I knew it when I drank it - it was intentional - I was saying goodbye. I have told more people this time around - my two older brothers who are also in recovery, my boss - and I have opened up and participated here.

It’s not any easier this last time - frankly my sleep was much better when I tried to quit last winter - but I have this odd almost resigned feeling that this is it. I’m done. I have been drinking for 45 years, since I was 12, and I have accepted that alcohol has been pulling far more from me over the last decade than I have pulled from it, and I want to move on. I know where this ends if I don’t quit.

Those who are longer in recovery than I am:  did you know, when you finally and irretrievably quit, that this was the attempt that would stick?

Maybe I am kidding myself. I know alcohol is a devious and patient bastard and I do not intend to be complacent. But I want my fucking life back. I want to read and write and love and run. It’s like leaving a bad relationship. Sure, it’s going to hurt, but damn, I want to have hope again.

Yes, I feel that I am in the wilderness sometimes, and I cannot see the path. There is a hole in my life sometimes that I am not sure how I will fill. But I also feel like I bought a ticket for a jet flight.  Yes, I dawdled while packing. I procrastinated before loading the luggage.  I drove past the airport exit a couple of times. While standing in the baggage check line I reassured myself that it was not too late, I could still turn around and go home. When they told me to board I stayed seated, watching everyone else surge forward before slowly rising myself.

They closed the cockpit door a few minutes ago.  The plane moved slowly to the runway and then picked up speed, pressing me into my seat as it lifted off. Just a few seconds ago, I heard and felt the landing gear retract into the fuselage below me.

Hope you guys are having a good day so far. I know what it's like if you're not too. I'm currently going through the day 2 motions. The toxins are leaving my body. I'm starting to feel ""normal"" again and that feels like crap. I decided to post for accountability as it helped me in the past get some days in.

Not going to lie really struggling this time to quit. But I'm going to do it. I'm sticking at it this time. I don't feel like doing anything at all today. I was in bed all day yesterday, I feel like I shouldn't do that again today but I want to. My works been slow lately, but I luckily have some new jobs to keep me going and bounce back. I have a project due in less that 7 hours that I've not started. It's a bit otherwhemling knowing that whilst going through the withdrawal. I will try to be more positive going forward. Let's start now. It's great I have work and even better than I'm making a choice to improve my life. Ha there, it wasn't so hard to be a bit more positive after all.

Anyway just sharing my experience. It's not easy but I'm not giving up. I'm doing it for me and for all of us. We can do this.

The weekend just gone I went out out 4 days in a row (it was payday) and on the Tuesday I felt awful. Not just physically but mentally. I had to call in sick to work and after checking my bank balance realised I didn’t have enough money to make it through the month.

Rewind maybe 10 years I moved in with my then bf. We would drink wine maybe 4 times a week. Then we went travelling for 2 years and would drink everyday because why not? We were having the time of our lives after all or so I thought. On our return the the UK I was kind of lost, didn’t have a job or a flat so would drink everyday to feel better. Then we found somewhere so we’d drink to celebrate. Then we bought a house so more celebrating, more drinking. Then I had an abortion, sad times, more drinking. You get the jist right? Everything single thing would be a cause to drink which lead to years of drinking almost everyday and it seems silly but I didn’t even realise I had a problem. Or maybe I didn’t but didn’t want to admit it. I’m young, I have no family (I’m infertile but that’s a different story) so why not enjoy myself? 

But I’m not enjoying myself. I waste the days in bed hungover, I waste the evenings falling asleep on the sofa. So enough is enough. This is my first time trying to stop properly. I’m feeling ok on day 3 but I don’t know how I’m going to have enough will power to get through the weekend. I haven’t gone a weekend without drinking since I was 17 years old. I’m already anxious just thinking about it but I’m determined to do it.

Thanks for listening. I admire you all.

I hadn't tried it since my early 20s, so I said ""fuck it"" and decided to grab some. It was okay..nothing magical.

Despite my lackluster experience, I've come to develop a bit of a problem. 9/10 times I drink, I end up getting more blow. 1 drink, 10 drinks - doesn't matter. I don't crave it sober, but when I drink, it become an almost pavlovian response.

This wouldn't even be an issue if the connect wasn't so convenient..a quick call and a short walk is all it takes. I deleted his number but that is no help because I end up just logging into my cell provider's site & pulling his number from my call history.

I don't know if there's any way to break this cycle other than to either move or stop drinking, and moving isn't realistic right now.

>Is this a temporary realization or a true awakening? Will I only get a few more chances to get it right before getting it wrong is all I’ll ever know?

The scary part of my alcoholism is that I feel like I either need to commit 100% to drinking every day/all day or I have to completely abstain. Any time I think about drinking again, I play the tape forward and realize that I'd lose myself forever in a 24/7/365 binge.

I tried to fool myself with sober periods or cleanses or whatever. The result was always the same: I'd moderate until I didn't then I'd blackout. I was always brought back to the same inescapable conclusion: absolute abstinence was my only option.

So I did it.

That whole not ever drinking thing.

Four and a half years passed, and I found myself staring in the mirror, bleary eyed, regretful and getting one of those rare moments of intoxicated introspection where I saw through all the bullshit to the core of the person I really am.

In that moment, the real me evaluated intoxicated me. The result was far from flattering -- more like soul crushing.

No, I did not drink.

But I did let my guard down. I reconnected with an old ""friend"", cannabis, and, for a long time, I thought it was my friend (aka, I could moderate). It has been awfully friendly to me, much like alcohol in the beginning.

I've come to see that those chemically-induced reveries are only a gap-filler for a hole larger than any illicit substance can fill. I don't use because it brings me pleasure; I use because it alleviates the pain.

Why am I writing? I am quitting cannabis -- much the same as I quit alcohol.

In my withdrawal, I've discovered that the temptation for alcohol is still there -- even if it's just my drug-deprived brain desperately seeking any familiar chemical fix.

I used to think an 'awakening' was an external event, endowed upon us by some wise figure or spiritual-from-the-heavens revelation. Now, I see an awakening as the result of deliberately choosing the path you want to go down and sticking to it. It's an internal process, not an event, and it's one that doesn't get a coronation ceremony.

I see an awakening as putting your realization into a daily practice. For me, sobriety is my awakening. It is expressed as a daily commitment to sobriety. To me, that daily renewal is so powerful, so transformative, and so life-altering. Sobriety is the absolute and only path to true happiness in my life.

I choose sobriety. Complete sobriety.",8

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

20% of any area in your life is the good stuff, 80% is filler.

So 20% of your wardrobe; you actually wear, 80% just hangs there collecting dust.

20% of your friends are actually good friends, people you care about and care about you. 80% aren't actually friends at all; they're acquaintances or people you just happen to spend time with.

When I first quit I was worried about losing friends. I thought I'd be eternally solitary. I definitely have less people in my life than I had before but the funny thing is I haven't lost one actual friend, not one.

Perform well for a few months. Lose my shit for whatever reason and go on a bender. Like, an extreme bender where I black out for days or end up in detox. Lose my job and continue my bender for weeks. Go through detox, sometimes medicated, sometimes white knuckled and spend a few weeks in anxiety and depression, wondering what the fuck to do next. Slowly come out of the hole and drag the tattered pieces of both my body and mind back together. Start taking care of myself again with exercise and eating right. Realize I both need and want to work again and so I start looking for a job….

Rinse. Repeat.

Saturday will be my 40th birthday.  I have spent half of my life drinking.  I have almost nothing to show for it but shit ton of W2s and a very tired liver. So a few weeks ago, after the worst detox I have ever had (white knuckled) where the nerve pain in my feet prevented me from walking for a few days, thinking about the Big 40, something seemed to quietly shift in me. The list of things I needed to do to finally get sober and get my life together, well I looked at it and told myself I would just do the first one and see how it felt. The first was to call mental health and get an appointment to see someone for withdrawal and relapse prevention meds. I made the call, got an immediate appointment via zoom, and had a script within days. I was amazed at how easy and smoothly it all went, and at how great I felt about myself just getting that one thing done. I allowed myself a teensy tiny glimmer of hope and focused on the second thing on the list. General doc to check my liver. Check. Planned parenthood for girly stuff and STD testing to boot. Check. Reach out to family, cautiously. Check. Check, check, check.

It is day 17 and I have kicked the shit out of that list. Today I finally filed my 2018 and 2019 taxes, something I have no good reason for never having done. Turns out I’m getting a lot of money back. Enough to pay off all my bills and change my living situation. This is something I never would have had the motivation or presence of mind to accomplish had I not had a couple of weeks of sobriety under me. My teensy tiny glimmer of hope is starting to become a blaze. One that gets bigger every time I knock something off that list.  And man, seeing that refund $ amount was a shot of oxygen to that fire!

One night I just simply could not fall asleep at all. I Didn't sleep the entire night. Had to work the next day on no sleep. It was the worst physical feeling I have ever experienced. The next night my anxiety was so bad for fear that it would happen again, that I once again could not fall asleep. I fell into such a deep depression over the next few days from lack of sleep and anxiety from not being able to sleep. I got some xanax from my mom and that helped calm my anxiety so that I could sleep. Obv I couldn't rely on the xanax as I didn't have a prescription. I told my doc about it and he prescribed me a few diff things that had side effects of ""being tired"" but they didn't work. I had no prob being sleepy. I needed my mind and anxiety to shut off so that I could sleep.

Eventually he put me on Lexapro which did help with the depression and the anxiety to a degree. I still have anxiety to where I can barely leave my house other than going to work. I honestly feel like Sheila from Shameless. Being at home is my comfort zone and any time I leave I have panic attacks. Unless I'm drinking.

And here we are. Since the docs prescriptions didn't work I'm left to self medicate and drink myself to sleep every night. (Tito's vodka and club. 4-7 nightly) If not, I get no sleep. I work Mon-Fri 9-5. I have to be able to sleep at night in order to function at work. Even if it means being hungover every day. I'm sick of feeling like shit every day at work. Shitting my brains out every morning. Not remembering shit. Having no energy. Not leaving my house. I have two kids and a husband that wonder why I don't do the things I used to do. We all used to go so many places and explore so many new things. Now the thought of leaving my small town for any reason gives me immediate panic attacks.

It was a hard road for me and might be a hard road for you as well. Keep going make a goal every morning to hit the pillow sober each night and rinse and repeat. Find pleasure in something every day even if it is just some food after a long day of work or the company of a friend. You don't have to go through this journey alone and shouldn't.  I am internally grateful it let go of me finally but I know its always there the ferocious allergy that will break me before it kills me. I think once I got it off my back that old familiar pull that caused me so much misery, I came to terms with the fact that I am not biologically able to drink alcohol after that it has become easier. I still feel envy though for those that can put it down and sadness for those that can't and I'm always available for them. 

I look back on who I was and who I am becoming and it is a more stable and happier version of me than before. I was so miserable before so sick and always feeling sorrow for myself and never thinking about others. I am getting better at that last part and trying to grow as a person because this world has enough sick and sad people. Be patient with recovery and remain on the path and you might wake up one day with four years, I will keep going and might wake up one day with 30 years. I'm grateful I found this forum I remember trying to piece together sentences in the sweat to ask for help here in a closet apartment. It wasn't that long ago but it feels like it's been a decade, yesterday was a pretty quiet day but I still carry the pride I went to sleep sober on that cool pillow today.

I slept like shit because we all know booze fucks with your sleep cycle. Was wanting to sleep in but just kept rolling over and checking my phone for the time, every 30mins. I work hard, like real hard, for the next five days. I should’ve been taking care of myself not fucking myself over. But here we are! 

My hangovers aren’t me feeling crappy so much anymore, just feeling super stupid. Two and two do not quickly or easily make four. It’s embarrassing. I mean, I still feel like shit but as long as I can get a decent amount of sleep I’m functional. But conversations and basic shit just goes out the window when I’m hungover. Probably not a good sign. 

I got to do things that I loved today. And I feel like I fucked them over because I was hungover. I worked a bit and felt like I wasn’t really all there. I’m missing out on my life. I say it every time. Last days of summer here and I’m pisssing them away. I’m lonely and pushing people away. 

I feel so raw and just backwards right now. Every time I sober up this heaviness and sadness washes over me. I don’t enjoy it. I feel very vulnerable. I haven’t eaten all day and was very physical. I’m sure that has something to do with it. I guess some food and some rest will help. And no booze. 

Just ranting. Thanks for listening.",6

It’s going to be great. Lots of family time, fishing, being outside, games, hammocks, fires and hotdogs. They know I don’t drink and couldn’t care less. 

I just found out my old drinking crew is also going to be at the same campground this weekend. They’ll also have fun, but they will be blotto at times. 

I’m having some anxiety over this. I’m not worried about being pressured to drink. I can’t be pressured to drink anymore. I’m more concerned about having to interact with their drunk butts. Having to listen to them drunk is beyond annoying to me these days.  The same poorly told stories on repeat. The buddy hugs, the staggering around. I really don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings either, just don’t like being around drunk people these days. Seems slightly hypocritical but whatever. 

I even considered changing campgrounds to avoid them but that’s also just ridiculous behaviour. 

Does all this sound selfish and whiny? 

Anyways, I’m sure it will all work out. Just wanted to get it off my chest.

I cut back significantly on drinking already, and I found that even 1 beer would screw up my sleep cycle. I used to go to bed 1-2 am every night (usually after a couple of drinks) and wake up late to start my work day at 10,10:30, sometimes 11!

Decided one day to change it up - wake up at 545 or 6 am and bed by 9/10 the night before. This changed everything for me (energy, time in the morning, power to workout early cause I started work earlier and therefore left earlier). By the time I finished working out and having dinner I was too tired to even consider drinking. If you’re struggling with drinking, I highly recommend trying to alter your schedule so you’re conscious for less of the evening hours when the urge kicks in. :)",15

I just want to vent a bit. First post here.","First, I really appreciate everybody here sharing and being supportive of one another. Reading this sub every day. It has really helped me understand what is at stake. But I am so goddamn frustrated right now holy shit.  


What is driving me nuts is that I seem to hit some kind of wall every day 3 or sometimes 2. I am a 48 y.o. father and husband who had been a weekly binge drinker since college. In the last two years it has gone downhill to where I am drilling about ten beers over three or four hours almost every night once my family is in bed. I can't be doing this shit. I don't drink during the day and couldn't imagine waking up with it at this point, yet I can't seem to pull my head out of my ass. I'm pretty sure I have started showing mild symptoms of alcoholic neuropathy, definitely some gout, my triglycerides are through the roof, I weigh 117kg while my ideal weight is around 95kg. I've got to quit or I'm screwed. I don't get any physical withdrawal symptoms except sometimes a headache on day 2. So why is it so hard? What the hell? I've been ""quitting"" for six months. I get this weird feeling of watching myself fuck it up by buying a bunch of cans, like my brain is trying to wash my hands of responsibility. Damn it. 


On a more positive note, my incessant failing has resulted in me cutting back to about 4 nights a week. I am about half way through the Annie Grace book. It's just ok so far, but I think it is helpful and worth reading. Maybe I should try a meeting online. I don't know. I'm embarrassed because I feel like I am being really childish and self-absorbed. 


Well, anyway, thanks for reading. I thought maybe sharing here would help me take more responsibility. It's almost 10am on another day 2. I will not drink with you today.",15

Me and my partner went on a detox in August after realizing how unhealthy we have become since March. It's now a new month and he's having a beer but I've decided to stay quitting. This time (I've quit for 4 months 2 years ago) I've asked for his support because last time I didn't feel he was there for me and just wanted me to be drinking with him instead. I know my goal is clearer and my focus has shifted and he's also agreed to be more supportive and to drink less himself.

I'm excited for this chapter...I just wish I can have a more regular bowel movement! This happened last time too and it was so painful!

We drink together EVERY time we hang out, and we’ve had black-out type nights, too. But she’s not typically a heavy drinker and doesn’t even touch it during the week or most weekends. So I think she’d be happy to see me even if I don’t drink and I know she’d be supportive if I told her I’m sober now. I don’t think I’ll break and start drinking again.

I’ve already been to rehab twice, the last time was 3 months. I relapsed. It’s important to be honest and I think it was because I tried to supplement with marijuana, and then I ran out. I was faced with a stressful situation, and I turned to what I knew would provide immediate relief, booze. 

My family has been helping me out financially during this time as I tried to sober up, but I’ve also been reluctant to ask for help. Last night I ran out of gas after a 9 hour shift at work, and no one would help me push my car into a safe place. I ended up walking to a nearby bar, befriending a stranger, and getting a ride home. I let my mom know what was going on...

But she picked me up today to help me get some gas in my car and I swear she looked like she had aged 10 years overnight. And I felt awful both emotionally and physically. I love my mom so much, she’s always been there for me and Ive put her through so much. Sometimes I wish I was all alone so that I wouldn’t have to hurt anyone anymore by doing something that hurts me too.

2020-09-02 19:02:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ilhorm/year_one_completed/,Year One Completed,"Last September I finally was able to make the commitment to myself to lay down the bottle and make it stick for a whole year and frankly it’s bonkers that it happened but here we are. I mainly wanted to post just to say thank you to everyone sharing their stories on here. It’s helped immensely to check in daily and get recharged, educated and encouraged by this community. 

My story: I’m a female in my late thirties and socially always ran with musicians and artists and general outcasts of society. Drinking was so engrained in my identity as a creative person that it was really strange to think of giving it up. I was drinking hard liquor daily and it was taking more and more to get any sort of buzz.  Fortunately I’ve made a few close friends over the past five years who were sober but still were able to demonstrate that they were living interesting and fun lives so I became open to the idea of living alcohol free myself. 
Since March 2019 I had been going 30 day stints without drinking but had a few big celebrations once a month that I felt obligated to drink (I got married, so I don’t regret those few controlled occasions) Until finally in September 2019 I was able to get serious about it.

What I found:

-Probably the first 90-120 days were the hardest. I didn’t set out to do a year, but I knew if I could keep reaching those 7, 30, 60, 90 day goals I could keep going. I amazed myself by being able to celebrate my birthday this year without drinking, mostly by insisting that alcohol adding nothing to the experience and would only detract from the day.

-I was super grumpy and easily annoyed. This went away mostly but the misanthropy was real.

-I was also bored, especially in the evenings. That went away eventually once got in to the groove of new habits. I’ve been working on building a library this year so I spend my time looking at potential books to fill my shelves and window shopping cardigans.

-I still wanted to drink at six months but every time I had a craving I would come here and read stories and let the feeling pass. It always did.

-my skin improved, the little red veins I have always hated have faded a bit

-The urge to drink daily pretty much went away after about 9 months. I’ve been careful not to watch Mad Men or listen to too many Rolling Stones songs, don't want to get triggered, haha.

-the community support aspect found here in StopDrinking has been really key in keeping me on the path, also counting days gave me a metric and made me feel like I was accomplishing something.

-I was more in touch with my body, the “hangover factor” was gone and I couldn’t attribute feeling shitty to alcohol.

-Alcohol made me feel shitty… emotionally I noticed a lot of my anxiety was gone, it came and went with the hangovers. 

Essentially the more I examined alcohol’s effect on my creative energy, the more I realized I was living someone else’s version of fun. I noticed going out with friends and drinking soda water I was getting intoxicated on good conversation and the booze didn’t make a difference. Better yet, I could now remember what I said and had less day after regrets. I found that it was a great practice in asserting my boundaries by telling people I wasn’t drinking and sticking to my guns.

Tips I used to stay sober:
-Always try and bring your own non-alcoholic beverage to the party, people generally thought I was drinking along with them and didn’t notice if I had a can of sparkling water or a Reed’s Ginger Beer. 

-Stay hydrated: turns out I was actually just really thirsty, lol. We got a soda stream and I treat myself in the evening with a fancy glass of soda water + frozen raspberries, blue berries and mangos as my ice-cubes so it also helped with the sugar cravings + more skin improving vitamin C

-Alcohol isn’t a path to fun and pleasure, it’s sold to you by giant corporations with that promise but doesn’t ultimately deliver because it’s toxic and addictive. Being Sober can be it’s own form of rebellion and liberation if that’s the experience you are seeking.

Again, huge thank you to everyone for contributing to this community and sharing your successes and failures. You are truly saving lives. Much love to you. 🙏",91

Per my dads wishes, I limited myself to drinking on the weekends as my day job involves lifting and heavy machinery so I have to be on point for my safety and those around me. I was off yesterday because of inclement weather and I had in mind to finally clean my desk after so long of putting it off, and wouldn’t you know who was staring at me the whole day.

I know i should probably just pour it down the sink but that feeling of “Just take one to relax and get done quicker” came over me but I remembered this sub and instead put on some music and started cleaning.

It felt great when I finished because I knew deep down if I had taken that one I wouldn’t have done a single thing and I would’ve been hungover today.

I finally felt the feeling of overpowering this addiction even with a tequila bottle right in my face.

I am watching my countrie's MasterChef.

Entry round. That guy was weird in the kitchen; eerily happy, trying hard to articulate. Talked to a herb.

His wife was there, too (with their toddler!). He was very expressive, too.

His wife gave him an advice, and a second one too; both practical. Cut to him talking about him being proud of himself, that other people just do not understand.

Cut to his wife disagreeing with the taste... the reply? ""I just do not listen to my wife's crith-crithics."" \*starts to sing\*

&#x200B;

Cut to more... overly expressiveness. (there was also a short cut showing him literally crawling on the floor)

Then he dropped the pot into the sink.

\---------

When presenting to the bosses... obviously stumbling with speech. Tried to blame it on his life abroad.

Boss: (...) As you came in here, did you have had something to drink?

Guy: No.

Boss: (not explicitly said, but heavily implied Guy is drunk)

(...)

Boss: We smell alcohol.

Guy: No.

Boss: I mean it. There are three of us guys. You had something for courage.

Guy: Well... yeah, one.

\---------

cut to the guy talking: Yeah, I had three or four or five, something like that.

\---------

Boss: If I came in and saw a cook in your state, I would have fired him on the spot.

\---------

cut to the guy talking, still stumbling: They are absolutely right. If they gave me an another chance, I would make it again without any alcohol.

\---------

Now, I: I never failed an interview due to being drunk... but perhaps some due to being hangover.

But: I got directly fired once because I came in drunk; several times because my performace sucked due to me being hangover.

Reading your stories has made me feel so less alone. This place is a wealth of information and support.

I had a troublesome relationship with alcohol since I started drinking, 24 years ago. The first sip was magic, quieting my self doubt and making me feel normal.

College was nuts, I drank and drank. Did dumb things, left school having wasted the education part completely. 

I managed to build a good life, drinking more than normal and needing it more than regular drinkers. But I made things so much harder than they had to be and my drinking held me back a lot.

When I had my two kids, post part in anxiety and depression hit me hard, and wine stepped up to save me when no one else did. I got through it, but it was dark, and everything was darker on the other side.

I wasn’t a binge binge drinker, but I drank nearly every day. 2,3 glasses of wine. I felt awful, and I could not stop myself, couldn’t take a day off. I spent hours awake at 3am, worrying and wondering about my drinking. Hundreds of sleepless nights. But then, every afternoon, I’d feel the need again. It was freaking exhausting. Mentally, physically, emotionally exhausting.

The morning of December 31, 2019, I had enough. I stopped and felt great until the pandemic. Mid-March to the end of May, I started again. Daily drinking. I quickly got to the point of exhaustion. Quitting at the end of May felt different. I gathered tools, did a lot of reading, and for the first time, reached out for support online here and another place. That has been the key for me.

I’m working on actually feeling my feelings and rooting out why I needed that wine so much. I have benefited so much from other people’s stories and advice. I feel changed. I know that alcohol doesn’t work for me anymore, it dulls my life. It gives nothing, only takes,

But for the first time, I drank the whole case. Alone. And then seriously contemplated driving to get more. I had to call off work this morning and wasted all day sleeping and feeling like hell. 

My family has been telling me for 2 years that I have a problem. I never believed them because I don't HAVE to drink everyday. I haven't lost a job due to drinking. Never dealt with anything that made me think I had a problem. Not until last night. Not until I reached for another beer and found an empty box. 

But where do I start? I only have fun when I'm drinking. Video games? Gotta have a few drinks. Hanging out with friends or family? Gotta drink. Date? Gotta drink. Rough day with work? Drink. 

You are all so strong to be able to do it. I just hope I'm strong too. Even as I type this, my inner voice is telling me to go get some beer, just a couple, it'll help you feel better.",8

I had tried so, so many times to quit in the past but it never stuck.  I went through this ritual of setting a date, going BIG for the weeks leading up to it and doing the honorary end of the evening ""This is my last drink I'll ever take"" on the night before my quit date. I'd go through 3 days of hell detoxing and tell myself that I'd take that feeling with me, that I'd never want to go through that again.  The anxiety of never having another drink ate away at me though.  Every setting was another reminder that I couldn't drink.  I can't drink to have fun, I can't drink to let go of a tough day at work.  I can't I can't I cant.

For me, the ""you can never drink again"" was just too big.  So, when I found this sub I was intrigued by the daily check in and said simply, I'm not going to drink today.  I didn't put much thought into it.  I mean, I can do a day.  I'd done it before.

I found the simple support of an upvote or two and some kind encouragement from some lovely internet strangers was enough to check in the next day.  I got my flair on day 3.  Here I am celebrating one of the greatest things I've done for myself and my family - 100 days sober.  What changed for me was that I went from thinking I can never drink again to I don't want to drink today.

So, If you're struggling with it like I have for so many years, just worry about today.  If that's to big, just worry about right now.  You'll get through it!  IWNDWYT!

I drank literally all day yesterday, and was drinking the night before as well. Woke up yesterday and said, “Well I kinda feel tipsy, let’s just keep it going!” And looking back on it now, I kinda can’t believe that happened. Woke up today sure that I had just overwhelmed one of my organs, cold sweat, and a level of anxiety I’d never had before. My wife was trying to calm me down, mentioning it’s a crazy hangover, telling me to hydrate, etc, but I couldn’t shake the feeling or calm myself down that it wasn’t something more serious. I’d visited the doctor on a hangover day previously, so I was just hoping to go in, they say, “No worries, not today!” and that would be the end of it.

I’ve been laid off since March with Covid (hotels took a huge hit, naturally) and in the first few weeks of being off, making more in unemployment than my salary, and general chaos of nobody in the world knowing when things would be back to normal; yeah, it was kinda fun embracing the chaos and saying “Lol whatever, let’s get drunk at 11am on a Tuesday!”

And my wife asked a question a few weeks ago when we were were drinking with her sister and brother in law; when does it stop? Not just for Covid, but in general. None of us could really answer the question.

So cut to the urgent care visit, and I’m going through my symptoms with the nurse practitioner. General hangover, high anxiety, etc. From my check-in time around 10am to what is now noon, I of course start feeling better. Was very slightly nauseous when I got up, that’s now fine. Anxiety has calmed down, she’s reassured me I don’t have jaundice, and so on. So she phones up a psychiatrist at a nearby mental health facility that I was familiar with (wife’s brother in law and I went there to take BIL’s younger brother), but I wasn’t expecting the conversation I was in to be happening.

The psychiatrist asked during our conversation, “What did you think was going to happen today?” And I was kind of taken aback. Yeah I expected them to tell me I was fine, good seeing you, have a good one. He offered for me to go over, have an evaluation, and possibly go into treatment. Not sure if anyone has perspective or experience on that; feel free to share.

But I’d looked at this sub before back in the day, and found myself visiting again. Haven’t posted before.. but I need to think about this. Going to take it a day at a time.

Two months ago I had to go to the doctor and do a barrage of tests, and I got some very troubling results, which made it very clear: keep drinking, and you're in some serious trouble. 

I'll skip the details, but that's the ""broad strokes."" Stop drinking, get better; keep drinking, get worse.

So I stopped. And I haven't looked back. Even while every other attempt to stop drinking lasted a few days (at most), this has been easy. Drinking is no longer an option, and my diagnosis took the choice out of it. My mind finally accepted, ""You \*literally cannot\* drink anymore,"" and that's that. There have been a few longings---my addiction was mostly mental, and not yet physical---but it hasn't been too hard to dismiss them. 

All of this got me thinking about ""hit bottom"" moments. So often we think it's some calamitous tragedy, often with some sort of legal ramifications, but it doesn't have to be that. It's any moment that says, ""OK, that's it for me."" I've had a bunch of moments that I \*thought\* were ""hit bottom"" moments, only to find out they weren't, but... well, it's been two months, and that's the longest I've gone, so I'm hoping I found mine. 

What's my point here? Maybe that our ""hit bottom"" moments don't have to come after we've utterly destroyed our lives. Maybe a warning that really scares you can do the trick, before things get really bad. Maybe it makes sense to gently, safely look around for those warnings---by going to the doctor, or imagining where you drinking will lead you, or by looking at friends or family members who have gotten in trouble.

I don't know. I'm just spitballing, trying to keep it all together, and I thought I'd share. Thank you all, and IWNDWYT.",16

The last 2 years have been rough on me and I slowly drifted back into a cycle of drinking heavily. It wasn't every day it wasn't every week, but when I did drink it was enough to make up for the time in between. While I was in jail I read This Naked Mind. It really helped me and reminded me of the ways I made it 5 years sober before. I've reset my badge to the last day I drank, the day before I violated my home detention and was put in jail as a result. I'm hoping I can go much, MUCH longer this streak.

I've been lurking here the entire time, in fact I've given this place multiple shout-outs on my blog hoping to get anyone else looking to get sober inside this support network.

I appreciate all those who've shared and felt it was necessary to stop relying on others and to share my journey as well.

I'm 33, married with kids, and almost 2 months ago I'd decided enough was enough.

Call it what you want, I've taken to calling it ""Spontaneous Sobriety"", a term taken from ""This Naked Mind"" (great book).

I did not have a legal or relationship type of wake-up call, I simply realized I was tired of being tired and I stopped.

It's been the single greatest decision I've ever made in my life. 

In fact, thanks to Ed Latimore's ""Sober Letters to My Drunken Self"" and Annie Grace's ""This Naked Mind"" I've dropped booze after 2 decades of binge drinking without withdrawals or cravings of any sort.

I find myself repulsed by the liquid now. I still find myself repulsed with how long it took me to reach this point.

The arguments, the times I shouldn't have driven, the nights I don't remember, etc.

What's done is done, though the regret still remains.

I look forward to being more vocal in this group and thanks again to those who are sharing their story, it helps.

There were a few things I suppose that brought that on - curiosity if I could control myself to enjoy a glass without going overboard, and also wanting to get rid of the nagging idea of “won’t you always be curious about your first drink after a long break? Won’t you always wonder if you could become a moderate drinker?”

That undoubtedly was just my alcoholic mind trying to justify a reason for wanting to try a drink.

In a way I can’t regret the choice, because it confirmed a lot for me. 

It confirmed that the feeling of being buzzed wasn’t the feeling I remember it being. There was a lot of shame attached to drinking last night and I felt sad about it. After the first sip I think I instantly regretted it. And not because my counter or “breaking” the streak of a month I’d already had behind me... but because I knew how good I’ve felt, I knew I was loving my new lifestyle, and I knew that choice can only go downhill - not up. I knew the only outcome would be shame. 

It also confirmed that my nagging urge to want to continue drinking more and more when I start was still there, as strong as it ever was. It didn’t just disappear with a month off.

And to top that off, people around here were not joking. I had two glasses of wine and a beer (well under what I used to put away a day) and my head was absolutely pounding. It’s already nearly noon and my head is still hurting.

Admitting all of that sucked, but I’m really proud of how far I’ve come. I slipped up last night, but I have a new edge to my drive to continue my sobriety. I know what comes when that cycle is broken now. I know how I’ll feel mentally and physically. I don’t need to wonder anymore, I know now. I probably knew last night.

If you’re struggling with an urge - or left battling the “what if’s” like I was, I can tell you from this experience that it’s the same ole’ demon waiting for you at the door to drinking and it hasn’t changed at all. And it wants to quickly grab you back in.

Ironically I got my blood results in this morning. Everything was normal. I one time chose to use results like that as a reason to continue drinking (“I’m not dying, I can keep drinking!”)

What better time to start off fresh than with a clean slate of knowing I’m still in good shape - and that I want to keep it that way this time.

Here’s to my new goal: an unstated one. I’m going to go as far and long as I can without the idea of a deadline looming nearer and nearer.

Here’s to taking it a day at a time.

And here’s to confidently knowing: IWNDWYT",8

I'm not the kind of guy that toots his horn, but today?

Today, I toot.

What's different?

5 years ago.........

I was a shadow of my potential self, my life had no meaning or direction beyond the next 5 to 10 drinks. I was living in a plywood shack,no running water or electricity, waking up at 4 am to chug a few 8% beers in order to stave off withdrawal for a few more hours of ""sleep"".  Then riding my bike to work because I would rather pay for booze than insurance.  90% of my income went to financing a lifestyle of continual alcohol intake.   And while that may sound bad, by this point in my alcoholism, this was the best I'd ever been at it.  I had learned how to not let my life completely self destruct from booze consumption. After years of destroyed relationships, frequent interactions with police, criminal charges, duis, fist fights with other hobos, and the loss of my children and first family, not to mention drinking nearly continually in order to avoid withdrawal, many trips to the psyche ward and several tries at medically assisted detox.  I had finally found a way to 'successfully' have alcohol in my life.   And this is what if looked like.  Living rough in a shack, bathing in the river,  holding down a minimum wage job I could bike to, and mostly avoiding hard booze in favor of piss warm high alcohol beer, consumed alone, in a shack i rented for 200 bucks a month.    But hey, no more fights, family losses, or police interactions, so..........SUCCESS!!

After about a year of this level of 'functioning' alcoholism, I was ready. Ready to become myself, let go the booze and move toward meaning and responsibility in my life.

And now 5 years later.

I am present in my life every day.  My life has meaning and direction. I own my own home, with my wife and family. My children from my first marriage and my second all know each other as brothers and sisters.  I am the primary breadwinner for this family of 5, and I earn the money to pay for everything we need from a business I started myself.  This summer I took everyone on our first family vacation ever.  The only thing I had to struggle with while we were there was not bursting into tears of happiness because we were all together.  This song wouldn't leave my head.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuOG-Gw5Rg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuOG-Gw5Rg)

I have been able to be a good example to my children, rather than a cautionary tale.

I am untroubled, or concerned in any way with alcohol.  It's hold in my mind and desire is gone.

It is possible, and It can be done.

It took me at least 200 tries, but I finally got free.

Best advice I can give.  Keep trying.

Love to all you guys",61

There is a scene that reminded me of the importance of friendship when you are in recovery. Moderate spoilers ahead.,"I am 31. When the show aired, I was kind of too young to appreciate it. Now, it’s on Netflix, so I can stream it. If you haven’t watched it, it’s absolutely worth your time. It’s well-written, relevant, poignant, and entertaining. 

In one of the early episodes, it is revealed that the president’s Chief of Staff, Leo McGarry, is a recovering alcoholic. 

McGarry goes home to his wife one night to discover that he has forgotten their anniversary. 

The next day, he gets in a heated argument with the Vice President, John Hoynes. 

He goes home that night to find his wife’s bags are packed. She is leaving him. 

Visibly devastated, McGarry takes a late-night meeting with the VP for some menial policy issue that he knows the VP can corral votes for. 

Hoynes can tell immediately that something is up. McGarry tells him his wife is leaving him. 

Hoynes *first reaction* is “when was the last time you went to a meeting?”

It came out of nowhere. The show had been relatively light-hearted and jovial until that point. Suddenly there is this really personal issue that someone is dealing with. I immediately felt tears coming. 

McGarry says he can’t go to a meeting. He is too high profile. So Hoynes says, “come to *my* meeting.” 

McGarry looks horrified. “Don’t tell me that you have been going to AA meetings, Mr. Vice President.”

“No no, it’s my meeting. Underneath the building. Friday’s at 9pm. Two senators, a couple federal judges, and a bunch of senior staff. It looks like a card game.”

Then, Hoynes says not to worry about the votes. Just come to the meeting. His meeting. Because he is in recovery too. For that moment, they were just friends. He was just a friend that was concerned about his friend’s wellbeing. 

I lost it. Right after these guys were at each other’s throats the day before. Such a compassionate moment. 


Anyway. It’s a good show. Check it out.",17

I’m suffering from a hangover of guilt and shame, and everything in between. I’ve been wanting to quit drinking for awhile at this point. It would only last a few weeks at the most, and then I think “well, I can pace myself and have two drinks max”. We all know that never works out. But this time I want to quit for good.

I used to think I didn’t have an alcohol issue. I’ve never been one to drink alone or drink everyday. I always had this vision of an alcoholic as someone who woke up and reached for the bottle. However, even if that’s not the case for me, when I DO drink at parties or events I get way entirely too intoxicated. It’s not fun waking up and not remembering parts of the night, and feeling so much anxiety that I may have pissed people off. 

Last night was the last straw. I was out on a first date at a bar, and naturally the drinks kept flowing. It was going great!! Of course the drinks really caught up to me later. I went back to his place for yet another drink, and decided to walk home after...this is where the embarrassing part comes into play. Apparently a sweet older couple saw me in my drunken state and tried to walk me home. I was completely incoherent and couldn’t even tell them where I lived. Finally, by some miracle, I eventually told them where my parents lived which is a half hour away (even though I lived about a five minute walk away...couldn’t tell you how my drunken mind works). They drove me to my parents house and made sure I got in the house safely. Somehow they got my dads email address and sent him a message about what happened and expressed their concern. This of course caused my family to go ballistic (rightfully so).

I’m just in a huge ball of embarrassment and shame right now. Obviously this horrible feeling is definitely part of the hangover, but mostly I feel horrible that I put myself in such a life threatening situation. I could have easily been killed. I’m so lucky that this kind couple was looking out for me. I’m ashamed that I worried my family too. Everything feels messed up right now. I’m writing this out partially to set my mindset up to stick to this goal, but also to look back on this and never make the same mistake again. 

The sad thing is I really don’t even need alcohol. I’m a fairly social person. But I realize I’ve started to use alcohol as a crutch. It makes me feel like I’m fun to be around. Without it I don’t feel as fun. Which I get is a horrible mindset and I want to work on that. I really want to make this work and stop drinking officially. Just need to get over these horrible feelings that I’m going through right now. I realize it may take a few days to go back to normal :(",9

I don’t really know how to do this tbh.  I’m never going to any sort of group meetings, that’s simply never going to happen, so I figure I’ll give this anonymous thing a shot because at the end of the day I’ve realized that I can’t do this by myself.  

I’ve been an alcoholic for probably 10 years now, drinking pretty much every day.  I’ve had stretches where I’ve gone 6+months sober on a whim and lost tons of weight and started running half marathons.  I’ve had months where I’m killing 2-4 bottles of wine a day.  I’m sort of all over the place, which seems to have made this really difficult for me because I keep waiting for the next “whim”, and I know I’ve gone sober so many times before that it makes me think I don’t really have a problem.  I’m not dumb though, and I know I’m telling myself what I want to hear.

I don’t really know where I’m going with this.  I’m sitting on a bench in a park (I walked here) about to walk a few miles after having drank a bottle of wine and a malt drink and it’s only 1pm.  

I’ve seen this subreddit pop up every now and then so I figure I’ll give this a shot here.  I know the simple solution is to just stop drinking, but I can’t seem to get past it.  Work stress causes me to drink, and hell even awesome things like huge paychecks causes me to drink in celebration.  It’s just always there in the background.  

Like I said, I don’t know where I’m going with this but I have to start somewhere",1

Im Lars, and I'm a recovering Alcoholic","Recently I decided to control my drinking, I started out as a party boy when I met my girlfriend(who is the mother of my two children, we've been together 5 years) and not realizing the stress that comes with the pride of being a father. I am ashamed to admit I couldn't handle it, and after fighting with my girlfriend for the last 4 years(The last 3 years being binge drinking all day everyday(In the mornings I'd keep it lowkey but come around noon Id be shooting whiskey for the rest of the day until 2-4 in the morning usually) and her breaking up with me 4 times and my improvements only lasting a few weeks on average. Shed lost faith. 

Heres what happened, she left for jersey to visit family for 9 days and things were going well(We were technically broken up but she was trying to motivate me to stop drinking, she admitted) so being home alone I had a chore list basically, and I figured theres plenty of time. So I invited one buddy, then two, then it was 4 and my ""ex's"" best friend who normally didnt even like me. The first few days went okay, controlled drinking after noon like was the house rule, until the ""party"" started. Nothing I promised got done in the 9 days, we wrecked the house, I relapsed on substances and ended up sleeping with her best friend(Who turned out to be planning for that too happen, unbeknownst to me, she knew my ex wanted me back, she knew why things were complicated) After a huge binge all day which ended up with me on crack(First and last time) My girlfriend and I were fighting about a car ride I took with her friend(totally platonic at this point) she got mad and said she was going out with someone then, and ghosted me until morning, which after being pretty much awake for 3 or 4 days(minimal sleep and binge drinking) I got very upset and in my own head about it, so after sitting up until 5am to buy booze I was on a hard comedown and a rage burning in my head, listening to her friend who knew the situation from my girlfriends side decided to shit talk her all night, saying she was definitely out sleeping around, and she isnt worth it ""I'm a Great Guy and I don't deserve it"", I slipped up when she put my hat on and seduced me, Honestly I thought it was cute and I messed up.  When she returned to find the house in its state, and that I was drunk and high, and nothing had gotten done, she rightfully was very upset. After talking to her for a few days and trying to basically be roommate and rekindle our friendship, I admitted to what I had done, we fought more, and eventually hashed it out to where we both understood where the faults lay, and chose to try to fix the problem without toxic people in our lives. Now things are going well, and we are trying to be happy. Im here subbing and posting today to seek help. Shes worried I might backslide again, and after what happened last time she is scared and wants me to seek help, but my friends are not healthy, and only take my side which was primarily the core of my feelings when I was drinking. Drunk I have a hard time listening to my own reason and opinions, so i had to leave social media behind and move on, but now because of that I dont have a support network anymore. My mom talks shit about me behind my back and thinks im useless, and wont help me. My friends are not good influences, and I lack peers. I also dont think group is for me, Ive considered that option in the past. So I am hoping to find some like minded people who have been through this too.

Other things I've done include, crashing my new car drunk driving and angry and ghosted my cousin I owed for it. I could have died, no seat belt, beer in hand, I lost control of the vehicle going 20+ over on a back road my back tires lost traction and I fish tailed right before a sharp corner and couldn't  gain control, I nearly flipped the vehicle and totaled it, beer still in hand(not an accolade im proud of, Like I wrecked my car but oh lookie loo, saved the beer)

Ive had to be kicked out of my home multiple times, I've had the cops at my house twice for domestics(Only yelling loudly, I live in apartments) Ive broken things, put pock marks in my doors, one time locked out my house I kicked my door in because I wanted my shit, and the cops had to show up and determine it wasn't an actual break-in and that I was ""within my rights to do so"" We've had dhhs have to come and talk to us(case was closed with no findings being totally honest with them about everything) Ive been given many chances, from my girl, from the state, from the cops, from my parents and family and I burned them all. Now my girl and my kids are all I have left and if I don't rise from the ashes this time I'll lose everything.

But when I'm not drinking Im a great partner, a great parent. I fixed the broken door myself when the apartment maintenance wouldn't right away, despite being the one who fucks up all the time, I clean myself up when my girlfriend needs someone to stand her up again, I have motivation and cause to quit. But as im sure you all know, its a demon and it likes to sink its claws all the way down to your heart and brain. So please, know despite my bipolar behavior sometimes I am a good person on the road to being the best person I can be. I slowed my drinking to a very low roar, currently the house rule is no getting shitfaced, which has been working. But even that has been interfering with my coding and hobbies like working out and gaming. So I need to be sober but thats a long road that I have only started walking, Im not here begging for attention and help, I just need the extra support sometimes and I felt like the only way for someone to help is by being totally honest with them. So please dont confuse my post as pining or what have you.

I just need someone to talk too sometimes. We all do.

2020-09-02 12:19:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/il9vzj/after_4_years_of_neardaily_drinking_im_still_not/,"After 4 years of near-daily drinking, I’m still not convinced I’m a “true alcoholic”.","I (25F) been drinking nearly every day (aside from a few breaks) for around 4 years. I drink anywhere from half a bottle to a bottle of wine a night. In these 4 years, my drinking has not really escalated, so it’s always been around this amount.

I want to start by saying the only reason I want to stop/cut back is because I feel like I SHOULD. I know drinking this much is not socially acceptable and I know it isn’t normal. I know I have a unique and potentially problematic relationship with alcohol.

But, aside from this, my drinking doesn’t have any real negative impact on my life.

Nobody close to me has ever expressed concerns over my drinking. It’s never impacted my work or relationships. I don’t drive drunk. I’m not an angry drunk. I don’t do stupid shit when I’m drunk. I only drink to get drunk when I’m around other people that are also getting drunk; when I’m alone I only ever really get buzzed. I don’t wake up hungover (my hangovers are actually quite rare). I don’t throw up or black out. I know when to stop drinking. I can take long breaks from drinking no problem. I can enjoy social activities with friends without alcohol. I don’t drink in the morning. If I have shit to take care of I do it before I start drinking. I’ve had several therapists that have been aware of the extent of my drinking and it’s never been the focus or even something that is really discussed.

I enjoy alcohol. I have had anxiety for as long as I can remember and alcohol is the only thing that’s ever helped. But that’s not the only reason I drink. I just like the way it makes me feel. In the same way that would cause a stoner to smoke pot every day. The relaxation that I can rarely achieve without. The enhancement of mundane experiences. Especially throughout covid/quarantine.

My most recent break from alcohol was around 3 months. Every time I take a break, I expect some sort of enlightening experience. I expect to have less anxiety, be happier, be sharper, more productive. But that doesn’t happen. I feel about the same, maybe slightly more well rested in the morning, but the trade off is worse anxiety. My life is overall better with wine in it.

I guess I just can’t help but wonder what’s wrong with this? If alcohol is having no noticeable impact on my life and hasn’t in 4 years, why stop? 

I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else can relate and offer some genuine insight into this experience. Is this denial? Are there some obvious reasons to quit that I’m missing? If so, how do I motivate myself to give up something I love when there are little to no downsides? Thanks in advance, y’all.",6

I am 36 and have been a heavy drinker since 18.  These past two years have been pretty bad.  Back in May I stopped for a few weeks and spoke with my doctor.  They did blood tests and ultrasounds of my liver, kidneys, pancreas, gallbladder and everything looked normal.  They said I was perfectly healthy.  I am lucky.

I kept drinking heavily until last weekend when I had enough.  I am four days sober now but I am getting these random pains in my legs.  They come and go, sometimes they feel like they are in my muscles, then bones.  I seem to get them worst at night.  Is this normal?

I typically run 15-20 miles a week, even with the heavy drinking, but I have never had leg pain like this.  Is this part of withdrawal and the healing process?",1

He said he enjoys me always being there (present mentally), because when I would drink it would only be a matter of time (more so matter of however many drinks) that I wasn’t “me” on any given night. And now he doesn’t have to take care of me, or constantly worry about what kind of antics I might get us into. He said he feels more relaxed now that I am not a giant ball of anxiety all of the time. 

So it’s cool to think that while I am doing this for me, and I am loving the benefits for me, how much it is impacting those around me in a positive manner. 

I will say that it has been a bit tough, hearing feedback from family and friends that they may have been afraid to share before- but I am not letting shame take over. I am using this new info to continue to improve myself in sobriety. 

I’m happy to report that I am still fun, even sober.

Might work for you too.,"In 10 years I've never had much of a problem day drinking unless I was off work and hair-of-the-dogging a hangover. (That could last all day cause I'm a dumbass.) But the majority of my drinking was cracking open drinks in the evening keeping a steady flow of not sober but not wasted all night while playing games, doing projects, programming, cooking, whatever. And THEN still having a double-night cap to get to sleep somewhere between 12am and 2am. (8-12 drinks, sometimes more, sometimes starting as early at 3pm)

When constant hangovers started interfering with my life I finally quit.

Filling the time was easy, but those cravings around 9 or 10pm took a little fighting. That is, until I started waking up with the sun every single day at 6am. I normally have no propensity to day drink, especially if I have to interact with people at all. So not drinking all day was easy, and when 8pm rolls around, god damn, I'm tired. It's all I can do to make some food, catch up on reading or a show, and stay away until I crawl into bed at 10pm. 

Of course, if I stay up much later I'll catch a second wind and want to do stuff, but I've found that just shifting my circadian rhythm around, tiring myself out all day, and riding that 10pm wave to bed has been the easiest way to not even think about drinking. 

So if you haven't tried it, even if you don't have any reason to get up at 6, I highly recommend giving it a shot. I promise that getting out of bed at 6am a little tired beats getting out of bed at 9am hungover af.",37

Making it to year three has been easy, I actually go days and even weeks in a row without thinking about alcohol.

Perhaps it is true for some people. But not for me. It only gets worse, every time. I've never had a problem NOT drinking. I've always had a problem stopping. Since my first drink, all those years ago.

I have to remind myself every time I get the urge. ""Do you want that drink so bad? You'll still be drinking a week from now. That is, if you're not in jail, if you haven't passed out in a parking garage. Maybe a car will crush your head this time.""

I've seen some posts about regrets and shame lately. Whenever I tell an old friend or drinking buddy that I'm not drinking anymore, they reply with some variant of, ""Well, that's good."" Rarely is something so unforgivable that it outweighs your current efforts. Keep at it.

Today I (F, 25, UK)  am 1 week sober. 

This is because 1 week ago I found out I was pregnant with my first child. 

I've been snooping around this group for at least 6 months now, I've attempted sobriety a handful of times and always faltered at 4 or 5 days sober. 

For years I have drank whenever I felt like it - mostly every other day and anywhere between 4 and 8 cans of cider. I would put my weekly units at over 20 - for the last 7 years. 
I kept trying to quit and I'd definitely say I was drinking less this year in comparison to 2 years ago. But now I'm in the early stages of pregnancy and hoping to GOD my baby is safe and not affected by the alcohol.

I will never forgive myself should this baby suffer for my lack of self control.

As soon as I found out I was expecting I stopped drinking and smoking and haven't even been tempted to pick up either habit since. 

It's the first time in 18 months I have gone a week without drinking. 

I feel amazing in myself - aside from the anxiety of the possible consequences of my habits, and I haven't been sleeping well due to night terrors and feeling like I can't breathe. 

No hangovers though. No morning headaches, afternoon sickness or entire days lost to the void of the ""morning after."" 

Drinking doesn't just affect you and your body, it has the ability to affect everyone around you and possibly those you don't even know exist yet. Tell me, would you purposefully harm your loved ones for your own gain? I don't think any of us would. But now I am looking down the line for the next 9 months of sobriety and registering the pain I've caused to the ones I've loved the most over the last few years. It shouldn't take a huge event like this to wake you the f*** up and smell the roses. It's like realising your a criminal after you've been sentenced to life. 

I pray with all my heart that I've not caused any damage and that once my baby has arrived I can be a better daughter, sister, partner, friend and most of all - mother, than I ever thought possible. 

Please, don't drink with me today. Find your reason to become a better person today, not when it's too late and the damage has been done.

The more I read the easier it seems to make all of this. I don’t have any alcohol at home and I’m going to keep it that way. One day at a time. I will not drink with you today.

Damn. I wasn’t expecting much out of my post this morning. It’s the first time I’ve ever posted to reddit and I’ve been lurking for years. I’ve seen this sub pop up now and again and was always intrigued by some of the successes and hurdles you all have over come. I can’t say thank you enough to anyone who took the time to check in with me. Now I feel like I owe it to each and every one of you to go another day without alcohol. I’ve browsed reddit probably every day for years now. I will make it a point to check in here. I love you guys already and it hasn’t even been a full day. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.",1167

Hi guys,

I've been reading this sub every couple of days for weeks now. You have given me plenty of awesome and elegant quotes and vantage points on drinking which have helped tremendously in my efforts to stop getting drunk nightly. Things that ring through my head each and every day.

I guess I just wanted to write something about myself on here so I feel more committed, because as it stands I've not managed to last more than a week without drinking (to excess) in years. It's a pattern that, especially in the last couple of years, has started to noticeably deteriorate me, both mentally and physically.

I'm only 25, but I started drinking quite heavily when I was 16 - 17. In those years it was only maybe 6 or 7 beers in an evening, sunk as quickly as possibly while playing games alone in my room. I always told myself it was to help me get to sleep - plus I felt I got more enjoyment out of my games, specifically online ones. However I think it was just more of an outlet for me. I was a pretty lonely kid in high school. I sort of isolated myself from all the other groups because I was scared out rejection I guess. I would take myself home on lunch breaks (I only lived 10 minutes down the road) so i didn't feel too outcast - although I could well have made friends, I just chose not to. Occasionally I had a beer at home on lunch break, but that wasn't, and remains not the time when I crave a drink. I should also mention that when I was 15 I got a job washing dishes at a kitchen, and quickly moved up to 'chef' (if you can call a 16/17 year old that). Anyone who's worked a few hospitality jobs will be aware of the drinking/drug culture that comes with the industry. I was also smoking weed very liberally at this time.

By the end of high school I had some how scraped enough credits to get university entrance, so off I went. Things there actually seemed like a change of direction for me. I almost instantly got a good girlfriend, and a really solid small group of mates - the latter are still with me today. Sure we went out on the weekends to the scummy student bars and we'd pre-drink, etc, but gone was drinking my lonely self to sleep every night. That kind of lasted my duration at uni (3 1/2 years), which was the same duration as my relationship with girl #1. I say kind of because if there happened to be a night when my girlfriend wasn't there, I'd be getting on it, no question. And when we'd both go home for summer (different towns), I'd again have a big drinking holiday. Just me, myself & my computer. During Uni I continued my consumption of weed at around a 1/2oz per week. My girlfriend was into that too. The reason I bring up the weed consumption is because I think I was using it as a replacement for alcohol over the course of many years. Just smoking myself stupid so all I could manage was to sit at my computer and watch movies or youtube. Half of the time I didn't even have the energy or focus to play video games.

After university & the relationship, I had a hard look at myself and decided to really try and better myself - The first attempt of many, and quite possibly the most successful one. 5 or 6 months I spent of not smoking and only drinking at social gatherings. I was feeling much more compos mentis, I was able hold down a conversation with someone without forgetting what it's about halfway through, which is a really lame problem for someone in their early 20's to have! Additionally I was dating again, I'd lost my growing beer gut, things were looking up. Then for no real perceivable reason, I got back into my old rhythm. I'd buy a litre of the cheapest gin, whiskey or vodka (I didn't care which, just the numbers mattered) and drink a little over half of it one night, then the remaining plus some extra beers the next evening. it became a morning ritual to get up, take my shoes off and get undressed from the night before, waddle to the shower with a bottle of water, sit down with the shower head pointed so the water wasn't smashing the top of my skull, and 8/10 times vomit until my stomach was empty. Right there in the shower I was sitting in. During this period of my life I also started doing stupid things while drunk. I have never been violent or embarrassed myself in a social context to any serious degree. My stupid things involved driving (super fucking stupid) and spending way to much money on things I didn't need and only wanted because I was drunk. usually I combined the two by driving to whatever fast food my drunk ass was craving. I would buy ridiculous amounts of food for just one person. So even though I was working 40 - 50 hours a week on a reasonable wage (still a chef, a few locations down the line), I was pretty poor.

Fast forward a couple of years and I was flying to England on a 2 year working visa with a psychotic girl I'd only known for a couple of months. I knew we weren't good together, she must have known too. We had horrible fights on at least a weekly basis. God knows what we thought we were doing together. Regardless off we wen't to the other side of the world. Within a couple of weeks we'd broken up (surprise). As soon as I'd found myself a stable income, again as a chef, I continued on my drinking. It was pretty easy as almost everyone I worked with would get smashed every night too. Free pints at the bar and all that. After a couple of months a found some connections for weed, so got back into that too. I did however, stay away from the cocaine that was very prevalent over there (at least compared to where I'm from). This didn't last though, and by the final 4 months of my visa, I was going through half a gram of coke most nights in addition to heavy drinking, and topping it all of with very large joints in the vague hope that I'd be able to get some sleep before starting work at 8 the next morning. By this time I had managed to work my way up to sous chef at a decent salary, so I had the money to burn. This was only earlier this year, as COVID was really starting to hit.

It was a struggle for me to get to my home country, as COVID hit pretty much spot on when my visa expired. It took my buying two plane tickets, as the first got canceled (on the 31st of march). I was finally able to fly out in mid late June, and into the gracious arms of my government who provided me a quarantine hotel which I was mandated to stay within for a period of 2 weeks with daily health checks - all paid for the government. I might sound sarcastic about this, but I'm genuinely not. Even the parts which at the time I thought were quite crap, in hindsight were beneficial for me. While in quarantine I was not allowed to have alcohol from outside the hotel delivered, so if I wanted to drink, I would have to pay £15 for the cheapest bottle of wine available from room service, and there was a maximum of 1 per person per night. Couldn't even get a few beers on the side. And obviously I was unable to get any weed etc. This meant that for the first week of quarantine I would refrain from eating too much in the evening, then get the wine delivered at the latest possible time (9pm) and knock it back as quickly as possible before trying to sleep. A lot of money spent and a lot of extra routine put into my day just to allow me to get a bit of a buzz before bed. The second week of quarantine I decided enough was enough. I managed to refrain from buying any wine, I started doing 40 minute workouts in my room, and I applied for many jobs (I have been trying to get out of hospitality for a while - I don't want to think my time at uni was for nothing!)

That was the first week I'd spent sober a years. That was less than a month ago. As soon as I got out, I went to stay with my parents and returned to the drinking. I would have a few casual beers or gin & tonics with my dad during the evening, then I'd wait for everyone to go to sleep before sneaking into the kitchen and filling a glass with straight gin or whiskey to down in a quick fashion. often repeating a couple of times a night. I quickly went through what booze we had. In doing this a felt quite ashamed. How much I'd been drinking was directly on display for my family to see. After this, for the first time in my life I announced to my parents that I needed to stop drinking and that I struggle with self control. That was maybe two weeks ago, and since then I'v had significantly reduced alcohol intake overall. However On 3 occasions I've bought 2 bottles of cheap wine from the supermarket and snuck them into room to drink in the evening before bed. My family are unaware of this.

This brings us to now. I'm currently on my 3rd sober day since my last weak moment. I'm determined to stop this shit. I've got nothing against the idea of having a few drinks at a social gathering - like I said I've never really had an issue with embarrassing myself too much when I drink. Although it's quite possibly just wishful thinking that it will stay that way. I just want to focus on stopping this nightly habit I've had since a teenager. All the time in quarantine gave me enough time to get over the weed, which I'm feeling happy enough to give up now, especially as most of the jobs I'm applying for require a drug test. Additionally I'm very glad to be back in a country where cocaine isn't really an option. Although I don't miss it and I genuinely think it's a fat waste of money for nothing but heart problems, I would be concerned about my lack of self control showing it's self again.

So yeah. Don't really have much a closer. This ended up being a lot longer than I anticipated, sorry! I really appreciate anyone that took the time to read this. If anyone can extract anything helpful for themselves out this story, then that's awesome! I really just felt the need to write this down to help commit myself to not drinking before I get swept away. I don't even feel that 'fun' when I get drunk anymore. It just feels like more of a formality. Like I said at the beginning, this community has helped me make it through a few tough days already, and I'm hoping you'll help me through a lot more.

Cheers for everything all, sorry about the wall of text!

TL;DR

I have been drinking since my teens and it's taking its toll. Time to stop!

Edit #2: It's been a short while since I originally tried to post this and I've since fallen back into a pattern. This time however it involves me finishing from my casual employment (while a await for something full time to come up) in the afternoon, drinking a bottle or 2 of wine and trying to sleep it off before my housemates arrive around 6 or 7pm.

I just hit my 30 day landmark. To be honest.. I don’t feel particularly encouraged by the results. I haven’t really noticed any major improvements to my life, but at the same time I haven’t found it too difficult to quit either.

Or actually, I guess I didn't. I got sober after years of heavy drinking and about 6 months of irresponsibly heavy drinking back in June. Made it 74 days without a single sip, felt great. But eventually the sleep deprivation wore on me. I don't know how much of it was quarantine messing with my rhythm and how much was recovery, but here we are. (In case mods are concerned: yes, I'm sober while posting this.)

I got tired of not getting tired. I was running on a 30-something hour cycle, and it just wasn't manageable for work. So I decided to grab a beer just to ""help me get tired,"" because that's what my body is used to. That turned into a few glasses of wine. And thats where it stayed... I can't bring myself to walk into a liquor store, that's my red line. But I've grabbed a few ""softer"" drinks most nights the past couple of weeks. Never getting shitfaced, just enough to go to sleep. But I can feel that stupid demon waking up a little. I can feel it pulling first thing in the morning even though I don't physically need it anymore. The anxiety is back. And it sucks. But I'm learning something really important from it. 

I was under the impression that my problem was confined to a single (albeit years long) episode that I could simply break like a bad habit and then feel completely unburdened by it. But I'm coming around to realize that the choices I made have set me down a path I have much less control over. I'm an addict. It sucks, and I'm so upset that it got here, but this is a thing I gotta live with now.  The great thing is I know plenty of folks who are sober/ in recovery and I have no doubt I'll be supported. But here's the thing: I am refusing to define my whole life around this thing. I'm an addict in the way that I sometimes act, but it's not who I AM. I read this sub a lot, and I'm committed to being better, but if I let myself think about nothing but that every day, I'll go insane. I have to accept that I'm different, and adjust my life accordingly. That means fucking up from time to time, because this is hard. I just wanted to vent that out and let people know that if you're slipping and you are angry at yourself for not being able to tame this thing, it's ok. There's no burden of perfection. It happens to a lot of us. It's ok to say ""this is what my brain does, and it I just have to exist with it now.""

And if you have good sleep tips that aren't Melatonin (gives me trauma-level nightmares), exercise or not looking at screens, lemme know.",6

I lied I have alot to say. Let's start with fu*k!!!! I'm actually out of control. In a sense I can't control my urges to drink. I just get them and then I go. Go drinking that is. I realized I'm consciously drinking and aware of what I'm doing yet I can't stop. It's like an illness. I think possibly a good idea, is stay home for two weeks. By stay home I mean avoid friends and random meet ups. Fresh air and walks are good. But yh stay in for a bit...

I don't know actually.
I'm going to do everything I can to fix myself.

All I can think of to do immediately. Is just heal for a few days and do nothing. And read that book that everyone recommends. The naked mind. Yh I'll start there. Right now.

I'll post again tomorrow with an update because like I said that worked before.

To anybody, struggling. Lurking. Just let me say I f*cking understand the hurt and the struggle and I'm in the same boat with you. Let's defeat this together. Let the strength fill our souls and bodies up. Let's rise up and stare the beast in the face. Let's say, I will not drink today.",5
2020-09-02 05:13:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/il3gzf/benefits_after_one_month/,Benefits after one month,"I have now gone more than a month without drinking! I found posts that listed the benefits of sobriety so inspiring that I thought I'd make my own list. 

\- My rough, dry skin is now softer. This happened pretty quickly. However much water I drank while I was drinking, my skin was chronically dry. 

\- I sleep more deeply. I wake up refreshed.  I used to hate waking up and would regularly sleep till 11 on weekends when I could get away with it. Now it's really hard to imagine lying in past 9.30 on a weekend. (I know a lot of people get up way earlier than that but baby steps!)

\- Redness in my face is reduced.

\- My eyes are bigger and whiter (this one took about 4 weeks to come in).

\- I find work more stimulating. I'm more productive. This one also took a while to come in. I didn't feel any increase in productivity until at least week 3.

\- The world somehow seems more beautiful. Is this the pink cloud syndrome I keep hearing about? I don't know, and I hope this effect doesn't disappear, but I find skies and nature more awe inspiring somehow. 

\-  My anxiety is reduced, to the extent that I am lowering my anxiety medication. I've had more anxiety since I reduced it, but that's only normal and I feel like it's evening out now.

\- I'm more interested in things. I want to learn more, read more, do more.  I keep coming up with new hobbies I want to try. It's like I know I have to find a way to entertain myself now that alcohol is not an option and I have a higher tolerance for things I found boring before, like cooking or exercising. It's sad to think how much I relied on drinking to create fun or interest. 

\- I can't stop cleaning my house. It's like I have less tolerance for mess or dirt now.

\- I am more motivated to sort out little health or skincare issues that have been bothering me for a while now.

\- I feel more present with friends and family. I remember to text back. I'm more thoughtful. 

\- My thinning hair may be growing back? 

\- I haven't really lost any weight but I was pretty strict with myself during the week while I was drinking. Now I'm not, I've been more relaxed with my diet, but I haven't put on weight. I actually feel a bit slimmer though, probably because I've been doing more exercise.

Things are about 99% better but I haven't figured out socialising yet. It's been really easy to meet up with friends in parks but I've done a few meals out and found it stressful, only because of how to handle the bill when other people are drinking.

I hate to feel stingy but I hate feeling like I'm paying for drinks I didn't have - saving money is a big motivation for me. I feel like if I pay equal share, I get social points, but if I don't, I feel hurt and angry that people don't care about me subsidising them. I've said to myself that if people only have one drink each, I'll just split equally. Separate checks, as I've seen recommended on this sub before, isn't really a thing in the UK - you decide how to split when the bill comes. It's making me want to avoid all group activities.",19
2020-09-02 04:48:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/il374o/anyone_decide_to_move_away_and_start_their_life/,Anyone decide to move away and start their life over after an extended period of sobriety?,"36/m here.  My last drink was on January 1, 2019.  So, rapidly approaching 2 years of sobriety here which I never thought was possible.  The longest I'd previously gone without drinking, as an adult, was 5 months.

Let me start by saying that if you quit drinking 6 months ago or 8 months ago or even 1 year ago, it DOES continue to get better.  Sometimes things get worse though before they get better.  The progress isn't linear.  Previous times I've quit drinking, I'd usually have a ""honeymoon"" period of several weeks where I felt literally high from sobriety.  I'd always crash from that high around month 3 though as the reality of a long term sober life started to set in.  I'd realize the damage I'd done and usually wallow in depression until I'd cave and start drinking again. 

&#x200B;

Things really started to change this year.  My mood began to stabilize and I began to truly realize that life IS better without alcohol being in it. Maybe not quite as exciting at times, but well worth it for no longer having to wake up every day to a massive anxiety attack wondering what fucked up shit I got myself into the night before.  I'm now confident in my sobriety.  The cravings are gone.   The FOMO that disrupted previous quit attempts is gone.  

I have my self-respect back, and I wouldn't trade that for any temporary high.

But anyway, to the question in my post title:

&#x200B;

I think I'd like a change.  I hate running into people that I used to know and hang out with during my party days.  It's a depressing reminder of the days I hated myself.  I suspect they still think I'm the same low-confidence self-loathing drunk that I used to be and I know I'm not and it bugs me.  I probably shouldn't care.  

I'm a new person and I feel like a new environment to truly kick off the rest of my life might be the best thing for me.  I just worry a little because I did make a lot of terrible impulse decisions during my drinking days.  

It's different now though.  I feel like my life really didn't begin until this year when I started developing healthy self-esteem, boundaries, and self-respect.  Things I never developed and I suspect alcohol robbed me of.  I think taking this mindset into a fresh environment where I can be anybody I want and nobody has any preconceived notions of me, could be the best thing for me.

Starting over in my late 30s is kind of a scary prospect, but in a lot of ways, I feel like I never ""started"" anything in the first place so who cares.

I'm wondering if anybody else has just thrown caution to the wind, said fuck it, and thrown away their life to start anew after an extended period of sobriety.",12

(Ahem, when my body woke up because it needed more alcohol.) I thought I would share a bit of my story in hopes that it will help someone. Maybe several. 

I drank. Not a lot...at first. Not every day. But I drank to escape. Over the years I drank more frequently, and more at a time. I started hiding it, and guilt and shame led to even more drinking. It is progressive, please understand that. It will always get worse until we make it better. It became daily, every evening after work. Then it became all day every day.

So many times I wanted to stop. So many times I did. Then I would start again. And each time I returned to drinking, it was worse. More use, more missing work, more missing time with my family. I was either drunk, hungover, or withdrawing. Everything became about alcohol. It became a very small world that I lived in because it revolved around either not drinking or figuring out how to get my next drink.

Finally, I had a seizure. Folks, don't kid yourself. I did not have hallucinations, the dark clouds, the people in my room that appear during DT's...I was ""functioning"" with the exception of shakiness, nausea, and anxiety. Totally thought I could taper and be fine. Except I didn't. I had a grand mal seizure due to alcohol withdrawal. In a store. Hit my head, had a concussion. Was in hospital for a week. 

My kids (7, 5, and 3) still ask when I can drive again. Where I live, if you have a grand mal for whatever reason your driver's license gets revoked for 6 months, to ensure that whatever the medical reason behind it gets treated and you will not be a risk to the public or yourself while on the road. Guys. I should be dead. I drove to the store, got out of the van, and seized as soon as I entered the store.  

I very easily could have been driving. What if I had been? What if I had my babies in the van with me and it happened? What if they were in the store with me when it happened? They are already traumatized from when ""mommy went to the store then got sick and went to the hospital."" They still ask if it will happen again. 

Folks. I used to read as much as I could find about withdraw and seizures and strokes to make sure I was okay and I could keep drinking without it happening to me. ""I'm not as bad as that person so it won't happen to me."" 

Well, it did. And I am fucking lucky to be alive to tell this. I am lucky my husband has not left me (yet...we're still working on that) and I am lucky to still be here to be a mommy to my 3 precious babies. 

Please. Please please please don't make the same mistake I did and think it won't happen to you just because someone else is worse than you are or you kicked it before so you can kick it again. Seek help, be honest with you doctor/counsellor/friends/family.  

You deserve it. You matter. You are worth it. I love you, and I'll say it again, you matter.",57

My digestion is so rapid I seem to lose fluids a lot. My skin is constantly dry and itchy, my lips cracked and peeling and I’m super sensitive to touch and temperature (especially after eating).

I’ve been to doctors and got diagnosed with IBS, tested negative for diabetes, and my liver is fine.

These issues began when I started drinking so I’m fairly certain alcohol is the main culprit. That being said I went a few months sober not long ago and I STILL felt dehydrated that whole time.

Before anyone says it...YES I drink plenty of water. Even water speeds up my digestion though, and I feel like I’m not absorbing it properly. My skin feels like it has no moisture.

Has anyone experienced long lasting dehydration like this? Will I ever feel hydrated again??",4

During COVID I got laid-off and had tons of time on my hands.  I actually got into cycling to kill time and try to stay halfway in shape.  Would head out in the morning (usually hungover), knowing once I got about 80% done I’d stop at this convenience store to get a couple waters, but in reality I was going in to grab a couple tall boys of some 9% abv beer.  I’d sit in this spot behind the place for about 20-30 mins to rest and of course chug my beers.  Anyways this would lead to me biking the last few miles home drunk and just getting started for the day.  I mean, I just finished all this exercise, I deserve to have some more beers to celebrate, right?  This would begin my day of binge drinking and the vicious cycle.  So I did this basically everyday for 4 months!  I’ve had alcohol abuse issues for years but something finally snapped for me 4 days ago and I decided that’s finally it, I’m not throwing my life away anymore.  So I’m only on day 3 but I already feel so much better.  Thing is, I was super scared to go on my bike rides for the first two days, cause I knew I’d be so tempted to stop and grab my beers as habit and therefore blow it.  But today I decided I’ve grown to really enjoy my rides and don’t want to lose them, so I went.  I told myself I can still stop there and ONLY get my waters and that’s it, I know I can do it.  So from lurking on this great site for the past few days, I learned “IWNDWYT” and kept repeating it in my head to myself as I walked into the convenience store and PAST the beer to grab my waters.  I took them up to the register and the employee said confused ”just this?”.  I smile and say “ yeah, I’m changing some things,” pay and get outta there.  I thought it was kinda cool the employee seemed to notice a positive change I’ve made.  Anyways it was SO different doing my last few miles home sober today, it felt all so brand new and exciting!  Sorry for the long post, just wanted to share this with somebody.  IWNDWYT!!!",7

I’ve been drinking every day for maybe 3 years now? (it’s a blur at this point) I’d go back and forth between vodka and wine. a few weeks ago i went four days with some minor issues, but other than that it was pretty positive. i decided to have a drink to “celebrate” those four days thinking i could just stop the next day again. i was wrong. i’ve been binging wine for weeks since. i’ve worked from home for two years now so i’m sure you can understand how this happened. for me i never drank during the day so i always convinced myself that i wasn’t that bad. which i’m sure someone can relate with as well. i’ve gained weight. originally that was why i wanted to make a change in the first place, but now i’m more so concerned about my health. it’s poison. i don’t want to put it in my body anymore. i don’t know how to stop once i start. I personally can’t do moderation. i won’t lie i am worried quitting cold turkey like this, but i personally just don’t have self control when it comes to alcohol. I have to admit that. i’m tired of lying to myself. my boyfriend is completely supportive as he feels he’s enabled my behavior, but i don’t want him to feel like that anymore. it isn’t healthy for our relationship. one little thing and i can go into a crying fit about trauma, my family, whatever. i’m sick of the endless cycle. the guilt and foggy memory. every day waking up feeling like I’ve been hit by a truck. i’m looking forward to tomorrow waking up and not feeling like death. it’s 1:30 AM. by now I would have been crawling into bed after binging an unnecessary amount of food and passing out drunk. I may not be able to sleep right now, but it feels much better to know I’m not saying “I’ll stop drinking tomorrow”... because I stopped today. I’m very proud of myself.",10

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

-----------------------------------------

**The Good:** It’s my birthday today. I am looking forward to another year of fun and sobriety spent with you guys—my wonderful SD friends.

**The Bad:** I was waiting for the results of a recent pap smear and was expecting a letter by snail mail, because the doctor had said they’d send me one. (I had gotten an urgent phone call instead when I had a dicey result a few years ago.)

Then, a couple of days ago, the office left me a voicemail, saying, “We just heard back from the lab with the results of your pap smear—and WE NEED YOU TO CALL US BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.” 

The office was closed by the time I got the message, so I spent a sleepless night, tossing and turning, and then got their answering machine when I called back first thing the next morning. They finally called me again several hours later, in the afternoon, and told me, “We got the results of your test from the lab . . . and . . . you’re fine.”

WTF? Was this some kind of joke or something?

**The Shut Yer Yap:** My mother (who was also worried about the lab results and who in addition wants me to start drinking again and who WILL NOT SHUT UP about it), said, “That’s great news about the lab results! We should have some champagne!” 

I told her, “I really don’t think that ingesting a known carcinogen would be a good way to celebrate not having cancer.” That put a cork in her cakehole, and I was very pleased with myself.",58

After a few fucked up nights I decided to put it down again with the goal in mind of doing a year, previously 10 months was my longest with stretches of 6-8 months during the 7 years I decided to get my life together.

I hit the year last month and wasn’t excited or anything about it, I find myself not feeling well these days (poor diet no exercise etc) which has me chasing that instant gratification found in that bottle, I wish I had told myself more than a year cuz in my head I reached my goal but I know it’s best to stay sober. 

Tonight I pulled into the parking lot of the liquor store and only the fear of reverting back to how i used to be (which I didn’t think was even possible until last summer) stopped me from walking in

I am planning on doing Sober September.  One night at a time.  I have had a couple of days clear at a time over the past few months, but the middle of the week gets me again and then it is every day until Sunday night makes me awful on Monday mornings.  It was starting to get in the way of getting to work reliably at the beginning of the week.  Done clean stretches for months in the past, but every time I have one, it is only a matter of time until I am back saying that I should probably give it up for good.  Popped into a couple of AA meetings.  A SMART meeting.  This place has given me the most consistent results for keeping clear.  Thanks to you all.  I am hoping to pull-off the month and get reacquainted with not having it.  The last time I went sober for a while it was 43 days.  I did a Dry January a couple of times and that first one was great.  By the third week it felt so nice that I really thought ""I might just not drink anymore.""  Wanting to get back to that.  Sober today.  Sober tonight.  Tired as hell, though.  A lot coming down the pipeline at work and in Grad School, but that is good.  A clear head is something I need to get my work done.  So much easier to do it dry.  I never feel bad the next morning having not drank, whereas I almost always feel bad the next day after drinking.  If not physically, then emotionally.  My emotions were all over the place on the way home from work and my poor spouse was home sick part of the day.  I made dinner for us and then we took a shower in the dark.  Now I am sitting on the bed typing, still tired, but about to wrap-up some homework in a little bit and hit the sack feeling a lot better than I did at 630p today.  Still sober.  Still clear.

I used to find meaning in someone else’s happiness and purpose, and that’s been gone for a minute now. 

I have to be brave, stop my desperate search for being numb and look inwards,
Stop being afraid of myself.

I need to take my head out of the sand,
Realize that I’m worthy.
Worthy of some progress and get my head out of my metaphorical ass and actually do something for myself for once. 

Face boredom, no dampers, 
Face my demons for real. 

I might actually be able to feel again. 
Stop being afraid of myself, find some kind of purpose, work towards something.

Stop being afraid of myself",20

In return I got it all.,"This weekend I was yapping about how amazing my life has been since deciding to remain sober. My SO politely listened as I droned on about the last 4 months of sobriety.

But in my excitement, something gelled in my head - By making just one change, in return I got everything I wanted.

By just choosing not to drink, I got:
-all my energy back
-mental clarity 
-no drunken fights
-weight loss
-a clear, happy head every am
-ability to think vs be reactionary 
-all the vanilla cake I want
-new experiences
-lots of exercise
-general feeling of satisfaction more often than not
-more satisfying friendships
-being generally more engaged in life 

Had I known how much better I would feel, I would have quit years ago. I still have my bad days, but they’re not as bad because I don’t hide behind the shadow of a hangover.",30

I traveled the world and went to mega parties from San Fran to DC, Acapulco to Canada, never wavered. 

I was a legendary drinker. Threw some amazing parties, invented my own cocktails and was the life of the party. But it turned on me and after a couple of shots over the bow, I knew I had to let it go. 

I dedicate this month to my three children. Two of them won’t remember my drunken misdeeds, my oldest is still mad at me for the ones she does. She is my reminder of what even a drop might bring. 

At times I smoked weed, did mushrooms, other drugs, energy drinks, ate candy and even resorted to working out, in order to stay alcohol free. It worked. 

Good luck to each of you working through your journey. It is not a straight line. 3 years. I no longer crave it. I don’t miss it. I don’t regret it, but I wouldn’t do it again. 

Best of luck to you all indeed.",85

So, I have now been sober for 16 months. And I’m really proud of myself! I feel healthier and happier and I know this has been one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.

But. Every so often I think about when I used to to drink, and I am consumed with shame. I never hurt anyone (besides myself, but that’s another story) or caused any property damage or anything serious, but I used to black-out regularly, pee myself, skip work, etc. I think about this past version of me and I don’t know... I still feel awful.

Does anyone else ever feel this way? The people I know who are sober either 1) have always been or 2) are much older than myself and don’t really think about when they used to drink, so I guess I just feel kind of alone.

2020-09-01 20:15:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ikwa0p/a_comparison_of_the_they_are_such_unfortunates/,"A comparison of the 'They are such unfortunates' section of How It Works, and a very similar section in William Porter's 'Alcohol Explained'","From 'Alcohol Explained' by William Porter (the first five chapters of which are free to read [here](http://www.alcoholexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1st-5.pdf)):

> The alcoholic is not a bad person. He is just someone who has found himself in an impossible situation and he is trying to make the best decisions he can under the circumstances. Unfortunately, because of ignorance and misunderstandings about alcohol generally, he invariably makes the wrong decision, which is to keep drinking. This is not his fault, but is purely because he is not in full possession of all the facts required to make the correct decision.

My view is that alcohol can be understood from a place of reason (inb4 ""wElL tHeN rEaSoN iS yOuR hIgHeR pOwEr"", just stop, please). Alcohol is a psychoactive compound with measurable qualities and effects. This is why I found 'Alcohol Explained' to be so powerful: it EXPLAINS. It explains how alcohol affects your brain in the short and long term.

It demystifies the drug that is alcohol by painstakingly explaining everything it does to your mind (also, your body, but everyone knows alcohol is bad for you, and ultimately it is the mental part that imprisons people). It explains:

* why cravings are so hard to resist even when you don't actually want a drink

* why you drink more and more over time

* why you sleep poorly, wake up early, and are constantly tired

And much more. It covers everything that you or any other alcoholic has experienced during their time drinking, withdrawing, and on the long road of sobriety. It gives you tools of knowledge and understanding to fight back against those feelings that, for me at least, I could not understand or control previously.

Yes, the book is a tad long and repetitive. It's not the most well written. Its scientific explanations can feel dodgy or insufficient at times. It also makes some dubious claims, like withdrawals cannot occur for longer than 5 days (which has been false for me, anecdotally). But those are tiny complaints because at the end of the day, it helps you understand what is happening in your head when you want to drink, and knowledge is power.

--

Okay, now from How It Works:

> Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves. There are such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way. They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner of living which demands rigorous honesty.

It is an eloquent and persuasive paragraph at first glance. 'They' indeed sound very unfortunate. But please allow me to rephrase:

> If YOU don't recover, it is because YOU didn't follow AA. If YOU didn't follow AA, it is because YOU are dishonest, pitiable, and (most insultingly of all), blameless, since YOU were born a pathetic failure.

Shame and an us-vs-them mentality is simply part of the culture of AA. Prayers/meditations/reflections are held for those aforementioned unfortunates in every meeting. How very thoughtful of those AA members.

Now, a quick caveat because I can already see the pitchforks. AA helps countless people and that's great. I personally go to meetings because AA shows you that you are not alone, that there are many, diverse people who have experienced the same thing you have. It can be comforting and quite helpful to hear stories or share your own.

But for anything besides sharing stories, I don't like AA. It is routinely recommended and even legally required for alcoholics, despite being a completely faith-based treatment. There have been no changes to its methods or doctrines since the original Big Book was written in the 1930s. There have been no studies on its effectiveness because it is anonymous. Oh, but don't worry:

> A.A. is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy, neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.

Yeah, right. Entities that are treating health disorders, ahem, ""help[ing]... alcoholics to achieve sobriety"", are ethically required to use the best treatments. Doctors have to sign a fuckin' oath. Entities don't get to give medical advice and then say ""nuh-uh, we're special, leave us alone."" AA's approach essentially boils down to the following: throw your hands up in the air because you are helpless against alcohol (that evil beast that cannot be understood), and place faith in a higher power to guide you to sobriety.

I'm a bit over a month now and I love being sober. I love waking up feeling good, I love that my body feels better, and I love the absence of shame and my spouse not being mad at me.

But I'm having a really hard time today. It's just, everything that's happening out in the world right now... there's so much I'm worried about. It feels like life and death, mentally - like I'm worst-case scenario-ing current events into some horrible future full of violence and brutality. I'm almost sick with anxiety about it. I haven't been able to eat anything today and I can't focus on work, my head feels like it's spinning. I'm trying to distract myself but it's not working.

And there's that little voice in my head reminding me that my husband has beer in the fridge. Just down the hall lies relief from this anxiety. A couple of beers to take the edge off.

I know that I can't do that. But I am having a hard time keeping my resolve, and not sure what else to do with this anxiety. The air is too smoky from wildfires where I am to go outside. I'm home alone for the next four hours. Can y'all not drink with me for those four hours?

In South Africa we have had some serious lock downs with alcohol and smokes and it drove many people to do stupid things.  
But now we are at level 2 and can go out again and visit people within limits and pubs and restaurants are open to sell booze. No alcohol was allowed to be sold for almost 4 months before this.

Now what happens, end of the month when people get paid, they go out and drink.  
All these barely 18 year olds show up and get drunk cause they have no where else to go and its happy hour.  
We watched as this barely 18 year old (legal age here) fall over drunk and hit her heard.  
Tried to help but instead her friends decided to prop her up again and continue ordering drinks and leave her on the chair. About 15mins later she falls off the chair and breaks a glass in the process.  
Now the waiters are at there wits end, turns out these 2 girls have been moving tables to who ever will buy the next round.

This kid is on the floor, broken glass every where and then starts puking and I kid you not, her friends again just pick her up and put her on the chair and want to carry on drinking. 

The manager came over and settled the bill and ordered an uber in between to help them out, paid out of her own pocket.   
Our waitress still helped out so she got an extra tip, she still had 4 extra tables that night as well so really didn't need this.  
We left about 45 mins later only to find this kid in the parking lot, passed out half on the curb and half in the street , drunk friend at her side with her Dad waiting in the car for her to sober up .

I love this group because I really don't miss those days.

This then doesn't stop. I love topping up after a session then I'll go for weeks where I'm pretty much drunk every day. This usually starts off with a swig or 3 of gin or a cold beer in the morning to get myself into gear. Then I need to top up or keep a level of alcohol above a point where I feel that things are buzzin. I make excuses to go to the shop or run errands so I can sneak a drink. I have replaced and drank and replaced my wife's gin so many times. 

I'm at the point now where I have been keeping replacement gin in the car and drink this during my working day. I have recently been driving under the influence, very heavily, going to work having drank, trying to be a dad and husband whilst pissed. I think about it each night declaring that it will not happen again but the next day I just need that swig in the morning to make me feel alert. I haven't even written down the half of it here and nobody knows about my drinking problem (apart from the ""you drank too much last night"").

I quit because I'd drink and then suddenly decide that all the bad ideas I had were GREAT ideas, and I pissed off a lot of people and lost friends.  

I realized through sobriety that I would drink to handle social anxiety.  The first few large events I attended after I quit were very, very difficult to get through, as I was used to getting a few drinks into a night and THEN going out to meet everyone, and without that I was much less comfortable mingling and enjoying the atmosphere.

Over the year I've had periodic dreams where I realize I've had a drink and then have to decide how much of a mistake it was.  It's been un-fun.

But we're at a year now.  I don't know that I feel different, but I'm not feeling the desire for a drink so much anymore and don't feel quite as anxious in situations when I needed it before.

It takes determination and a desire to better yourself,"I knew I should have quit for years, but tried and couldn’t. I slowly spun out of control more and more over the years as I continued down the road of being inebriated on the daily. My lies got so good, I had convinced myself that things were fine. They were far from that. I was a wreck and heading down a worse path, that I would have continually justified, no matter how bad it got.

I had a few awakenings, but the last time gave me the determination and strongest desire yet to quit drinking. I broke down and admitted defeat. I was done. I didn’t want this anymore. It wasn’t fair to others and it more importantly wasn’t fair to myself. I deserved better. I knew I was better than what I had become.

I notified my boss, told my best friend, called my family and said I was an alcoholic, and most importantly, I NEEDED HELP!

Well, I got what I asked for. I was sent off to rehab and started my journey. I lied, ignored and tried to fight it the whole way. I was angry, upset and hated what I was doing, because the alcoholic in me was trying to win this fight. I had to keep reminding myself of the day I asked for help and what I truly desired at that moment.

I’ve had some serious ups and downs since I stopped drinking. What feels like some of the most difficult day’s of my life. I remind myself when I have those days, that the alcoholic life i was living previously, would always be worse than the worst day sober, no matter what. 

My goals, aspirations, mentality and body have never been better. I now don’t have to worry everyday that Ill wake up hungover, tired, groggy, wanting to die in bed, wondering if I’ll be caught coming into work still wasted from the night before on a daily and potentially losing my job. I have so much weight off my back and can now focus on the better things in life.

I’m back to my old hobbies that I had when I was younger that I neglected due to booze. I can work on my mental health and rationalize things for my betterment, now that I’m sober. I spend my time doing the things I always dreamed of and put off, because alcohol seemed more important. Not anymore. I’m now a doing the things and not just talking about them.

We’ve been divorced for over 2 and a half years and she had a boyfriend for most of that time but they broke up. Now just a few weeks later and she’s already got a new one.

 It shouldn’t bother me but for some reason it still does. Combine being down in the dumps about that with one of my best friends who’s a daily case of beer drinker inviting me to hang out and the urge for drinks was coming on pretty strong indeed.  

But, I made it through yesterday and today I still feel pretty low but the urge to drink has subsided.  So I’m going to fill my day with productive activities and keep moving forward.

Last night at around 8:30 I took a giant gulp and decided that I was done. At the end of an extremely destructive 10 day bender, where I spent almost 300 dollars on beer. I then woke up at 1am fully going through withdrawals. Because when i decided to quit drinking, I then went to bed in a very panicked state. I have basically just been a zombie, barely functioning while walking aimlessly around my house. So when I got out of bed at 7 o'clock this morning, and finished a half empty beer that was still in the fridge. I knew immediately that I had just made a huge mistake, but couldn't take it back. So I grabbed the 7 remaining beers in the fridge and poured them out. And 7 hours later, I feel clear again. I feel like my brain is working again.

I know that the drink I took at 7 this morning reset my withdrawals 100%. So instead of taking my last drink 18 hours ago, and probably starting to feel human again, I'm only 7 hours in, and fully suffering.

No one really knows how bad it was except my husband and therapist. My three closest friends have a general idea, but not to the extent I was hiding it from my husband. 

I've lied to him about drinking (not about anything else) and we actually have a very solid relationship and are very much in love after nearly 20 years despite my stupid behavior. We were both social and daily drinkers, but I took it to the other level when I was alone, or he brought it to my attention that I was going too far. I've had a few strings of sobriety this year and had a little lapse just recently and he found the evidence. I can easily have a glass of wine or two and never go past that, but my vice is scotch and if I tap that, it leads to nothing positive. 

I love him to pieces and the fact that he is so hurt that I betrayed his trust lying over a stupid drink destroys me. When he found it he was furious, yesterday he was calmer, and today is angry and hurt. I hate the pain this causes those around us as much as I hate what it does to us.

It was hard because I realized through quitting how strongly I identified with being a drinker- someone who is always down for a good time, can beat you on chug contests, and is generally the crazy friend who turns the party up. I wondered who I was if I was no longer this person and if my people still wanted this less high energy fun person around. It became undeniable that I was in a relationship with someone I wasn’t in love with and had to leave. 

It was easier because I stopped hurting so much, became stronger and fitter than ever before and gained more control of my life. It’s just easier to love myself, to be happy, and to be a better person when I’m not drinking.

A bit of a coping mechanism for anxiety and depression, but there was really no good reason for it, other than the fact that I could never just have 1 or 2.... or 3 or 4... or.... it is an awful compulsion. My wife and I have two small children, and she knew that I was drinking frequently, but she had no idea how much or actually how frequently. I was a master at guzzling and hiding. My tolerance is so high that after I told her everything, she told me she had no idea how drunk I normally was. I have known that I'm an alcoholic for years and have admitted it to myself, but never to anybody else. This past weekend I finally admitted it to my wife and came clean about everything, as I am finally to a point now where I am ready to stop not only for my family, but for me as well. We all deserve more and I am so tired of being tired, irritable, throwing money down the drain, feeling foggy, forgetting conversations with my wife, and not being the best dad and husband that I can be. I was never a mean/angry drunk, but I would just get tired and lazy and not really be present. I would still spend every free minute with my wife and children, but it could all be so much more enjoyable without the booze and its effects. I am a strong believer of the ""playing the tape"" analogy. If I drink, I know exactly how that tape ends, and it's not just with me suffering, but my wife and children as well.

My wife has been very supportive, understanding, trusting, and non-judgmental. Quit on Sunday night, so I had all day yesterday, all of last night, and all of today to experience things so far. A decent amount of anxiety yesterday, some very crazy dreams last night, a bit of what felt like sleep paralysis, and extreme hunger, but today I am feeling pretty normal. Lots of work to go, but I am happy with the start. I know it is a slippery slope and that I'll never be out of the danger zone. I have fully accepted that I simply cannot drink.

Ethanol activates the brain’s dopamine receptors. It trains your brain to associate the act of drinking to a positive experience. So now, I can drink whiskey straight from the bottle and love some 9% bitter af IPA’s. 

So really, it’s all a lie, and our brain greatly misleads us in this respect. 

Ethanol is literally poison.

And calling it ethanol sure makes it less appealing.",7

I will not drink with you ever again,"It's official! As of today, September 1 2020, I am 6 months sober! I had been a drinker for 23 years and was finally able to shake it off sort of by accident.

Back in February, I was struggling really badly with binge eating. I wasn't as heavy a drinker but I was a frequent drinker. I would have 2 big cans of hard cider and go to bed most days of the week. So, needless to say I was packing on the pounds. I broke down and asked my psychiatrist if there were any meds that could help me with the binge eating. She already had me on naltrexone & asked if that was helping with the eating or drinking and I told her unfortunately no. She put me on a med called topamax and I waited for it to come in the mail.

I researched the med & some gnarly side effects turned up on google but I gave it a shot anyway. I was desperate. Anyway, things were going great, and on March 1st I made up my mind: I was done with booze. I threw away my corkscrew as a final ""F*** you"" to alcohol. 

Dare I say it has been easy. I had 1 hard craving a month ago when I returned from the grocery store, because I used to always pop a bottle after I put my haul away. I am so lucky and so grateful to have this opportunity to be sober.

Some mornings I reflect on waking up with a hangover and just recoil with fear. I never want to taste that shit again. I even have a bottle in the house that has been here for months & I don't want it. I forget it's even here. As a bonus, I have also quit smoking 2 months ago and feel like I have finally broken free of all the habits that held me back most of my life.

I thought there was no hope for me ever quitting drinking but this was meant to be. Medication is not for everybody though. I hope all of you find your way out of the bottle for good.",66

2020-09-01 07:23:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ikih07/using_edible_cannabis_to_recover/,Using edible cannabis to recover,"This isn't on the topic for alcohol per se.   I just wanted to share an experience I had with cannabis (marijuana).

tl;dr is I was mixing my own oral pot capsules.   I learned that tolerance builds up quick.  I learned that withdrawals are real.   I observed that in this specific situation, I was doing exactly what I did with alcohol: remembered that yesterday wasn't quite enough, mixed it a little stronger.  Lather, rinse, repeat.

Long form:

I hadn't smoked pot regularly in probably 20 years.   But after I quit drinking I just couldn't get on top of the anxiety no matter what I did.   I had taken a pass through benzos and saw it was going to be like alcohol all over again, so I tapered off that.

First I tried vaping pot.  However I find inhalation to be irritating and uncomfortable.   Then I sourced some candies, but got frustrated because the potency was inconsistent and not as labeled.   I realized I could only know how much I was taking if I ordered pure THC distillate and made my own, so that's what I did.  (All this happened in a state where it's legal).

As I said, in just a couple of weeks I was subconsciously taking stronger and stronger doses.  In the beginning I was taking 40mg. (eyeball guess), it would get me thoroughly medicated.   Over the next 2 weeks I noticed I needed more and more product to get the same medication.   Edibles can be challenging, it's really frustrating to carefully calculate dose and diet, wait 4 hours with no effects, and then you've missed the window to function the next day.  So if you want to ensure that you get medicated, you overdo it by a safe margin.

This kept escalating until I said fuck it, I need to start weighing amounts until I figure out what's going on.  I watched my tolerance blow through 60mg, 80mg, 120mg.  The past week or so I'm up to 240mg and the symptoms aren't good.   Not as bad as alcohol - nothing else is in that league IMO.

So in 3 months I've gone from 40mg to 240mg.  It's doing almost nothing for me.   Is that a lot of pot?   Well, I looked at the commercial products, a popular well-known 10x maximum strength edible chew is only 175mg.  Yep, I have a pretty strong tolerance.

The good news is that I'm finding pot a lot easier to taper.   It doesn't pack that dopamine punch like alcohol, so there's no urge to keep pounding it all night.  If you make your own liquid caps, you can easily make step-down dilutions.    I find the withdrawals are very manageable for my tolerance level, in 4 days I've already cut in it in half twice.

Anyway, once again, be careful with pot edibles.   I don't regret experimenting that route, but I don't think I'll continue.   If I do, I'll absolutely be more rigorous about dose management and tolerance management.   It's nowhere near as dangerous as alcohol, but I found that it isn't a self-limiting habit like smoking or vaping.   Especially for a former alcoholic whose battle flag is just the word ""more"".",11

I will try again. Ugh this is hard indeed but I feel optimistic knowing I have more tools now (you fine folks). Thank you to those who reached out.",4

And I am hosting a dinner tonight... This is going to be interesting.","I am always such a bitch on the first day of my period. And I was delaying this girls dinner for months, one time I actually postponed it because I was having my period on the date we were thinking about doing it.

Actually, I decided to have the dinner now because I thought that would be a good distraction for me. They are not drinkers, at least not heavy drinkers like a lot of my former friends.

Staying alone at my house every night was one of the things that triggered my binge drinking...

I always used my menstrual depression as an excuse to drink a lot and eat crappy food, like ""I know that in the other days is wrong, but today is ok, is completely justified""...

The positive thing is that I think that my premenstrual tension wasn't so strong this last 5 days as it normal use to be. Hence the surprise... Usually I just know it's coming for all the bad mood and all. Maybe it went undercover because of the excitement and depression of quiting drinking... Today I woke up with an annoying headache that made me think something like ""What's this? It is not a hangover for sure!"" Well, now I now what it was...

Let's see how it goes, the next 4/5 days will be challenging.

But I will make it!

Keep in mind that I am tapering. I narrowed down my drinking in about 85%. I am still having 1/2 glasses at lunch time with my family. And then, STOP!

I just want for you to know my story as it is. No lies!

Well, time to go to work! 😊

Wishing you all a wonderful day!",2

Today is my 4th day and as much as I didn't want to go to work, I did (50% of success is showing up) and just kept going with my day. It wasn't bad, it was a bit boring and uninteresting however I did work, helped people out and remembered that I loved my job. Alcohol took my love of a normal life away. Loving and appreciating the simplest of things. I am trying in moments to appreciate and just feel that happiness even if it's so small. I just feel it and the bad or BORING which is a massive emotional trigger. I got a call from a few friends today where we just talked and laughed and it was great. Not those late night drunken phone calls where you are alone in your room or lounge room, sad... Miserable and lonely, feeling like an ugly gremlin talking about all depressing and toxic things. NONE OF THAT ANYMORE! It was positive vibes and I listened to music that I forgot made me really happy within my soul today that I had not listened to in a LONG time! Especially sober! I also cleaned up bits of my house and got ready for the gym. Did an hour at a class tonight and walked home feeling happy, strong, confident and feeling fresh. I still have trouble sleeping. It is own my 4th day however I am happy. Exhausted, tired and sometimes just wanting to sleep all day or do nothing. Every small thing counts! Taking it one step at a time or even into other smaller measurements. Its not easy however I now want to be active and present in my life. No more behind in a poisoned bottle. I actually like the person I am currently and feel like myself again especially after years of drinking myself away and trying to fade into darkness. Not anymore. I started drinking heavily at 19F and now 27F, I think I have destroyed enough opportunities, brain cells, relationships, myself etc. In my life to know if definitely not worth it ever again. Now I just got to take it one step, one day at a time and push through it, push through the pain and never give up :)

I hope this at least helped someone find their strength a bit to say I will not drink with you today :)",6

I slipped and slid, just like some of you are. TLDR: you can do it.","And then, to slightly over-simplify, I stopped making it harder than it had to be.  I got out of my own way.

And today is 33 years.

You can do it too.  Yes you, with the rationalizations and excuses; with the ""but you don't understand""s - been there - done that.  

My middle name was 'don't tell me what to do'  I had to stop having all the answers and learn to listen to those who were actually doing it.

Truth is there is nothing a drink can't make worse - starting with my life - and then going through what is now a lengthy list, parent's illnesses and deaths, divorce, dating, re marriage, setbacks at work, success at work, thinking I was on the path to following my dream, having it snatched away (twice), Sept 11 (close and personal), my daughters growing up, their weddings, retirement, getting older and all that entails, and  much more - and every one of them had the potential to be a shit show if I was drinking.  

**Turns out not drinking is the easier path.  Really.** 

Easier - not easy.   I had to do a lot of work on changing the person (me) who was trying to fill the black hole inside myself with alcohol, drugs, anger, and other behaviors.  Thing is this work turned out to be actually kind of fun, because I was not doing it alone, and the rewards started coming pretty close to immediately.  

The rewards continue today.  Being able to write this is one of them.",136

2020-09-01 05:15:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ikh18t/3_weeks_sober_and_counting_some_things_ive_noticed/,"3+ weeks sober and counting, some things I've noticed","One of my biggest fears about not drinking was that I would have zero social life. All of my friends drink (a lot) and one of my favorite past times is going to a bar with a book to read, or going to meet up with friends at a bar. I've always been the kind of guy who can make friends anywhere as long as you plunk me down at a bar. So, for the past few weeks, I have been learning to live in a weird, healthy sort of self-imposed solitary confinement. I don't go out much, except to the grocery store or a coffee shop here and there, and I certainly don't hang with the friends I used to.

I go to work, go to the gym, then go home. It's a tidy little salubrious routine of self-improvement. At times it can feel a tad lonely or depressing, but on the other hand I have very much enjoyed this time to myself to work on myself. I feel like I'm getting back to myself, the old self before I started drinking and partying all the time in college, then throughout my 20s into my early 30s. The weekends are obviously more difficult to endure as far as social isolation goes. I think the fact that we're in a pandemic has helped justify all this me-time. Regardless, I have still had to avoid bars and social events, that is until this past weekend.

I accepted an invitation to have dinner with a couple of friends of mine on Saturday, a married couple, and they had another couple join as well. Everyone was drinking except for me. This is the scenario I've been afraid of, but these friends were pretty great about it. Didn't ask too many questions, and accepted my quick justification of being ""on a health kick,"" and that's all there was to it. It felt good to be around people, and it wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be to turn down booze.

I have other friends who are a little more rambunctious, who drink and party well into the early hours of the dawn, and I don't think I can hang with them on those terms anymore; but, a civilized dinner, and sitting around on someone's deck -- I can do that.

When I got home, my noisy drunk neighbors invited me over. I've never gone over to hang out with them, but I'm always friendly, wave hello as I walk past their house, stuff like that. They seem like good-natured, cheerful people, trying their best to weather the pandemic. They are retired empty-nesters who drink A LOT, and have their other retired friends over to drink. You can hear their loud asses throughout the neighborhood blaring classic rock and laughing hysterically. It doesn't bother me, though. I'm closer in age to their kids who are all just now graduating college than I am to them. Lord knows I've had my share of noisy drunk evenings, so who am I to judge? Plus I can't hear them when I'm inside the house.

Well, I accepted the invitation, and thought to myself ""oh shit, I'm about to go into the dragon's den of drinking."" And it was just as I expected. The hostess was so confused when I told her I wasn't drinking, and everyone kept asking me repeatedly if they could get me a drink. She kept trying to kill a wasp by throwing her flip flop at it. I accepted a glass of tap water and explained that I had done enough drinking earlier this year to last most normal people a lifetime, and I'm currently focused on my job, which they seemed to accept.

Then, I managed to sit there for at least an hour chatting it up and getting to know them. No booze! I guess I was worried I might cave in due to peer pressure, but I held my ground and slipped out of there by 9:30pm. They were a tad loud and ridiculous, but my presence wasn't seen as a complete anathema to theirs, which was nice. They accepted me and gave up pushing drinks on me and then it all kind of mellowed out. When they brought out the tequila I decided I'd better get the hell out of there, not because I was afraid of drinking it, but because I was afraid of them. In the before times I would have had about 5 drinks in that hour of time, then more, stayed past my welcome, said something embarrassing, or many things embarrassing, then gone home to drink more by myself and wake up feeling terrible the next day.

It's amazing how easy it is to govern your tongue when you aren't drinking. I've had this fear all along that I might come across as too boring or taciturn, which might be true, but then when I do speak people are a lot more inclined to listen. Sober me is a lot quieter, more pensive, perhaps apprehensive, and above all comfortable with myself, even when others around me might feel uncomfortable by the fact that I'm not drinking or speaking as much.

The lesson I learned is that, at 3 weeks, I'm able to be around booze without caving in, and that's a huge relief. I won't be going to bars anytime soon, but if it's a social occasion like a barbecue or house party, I can safely say I'm pretty well equipped to refuse drink offers and sip my water/tea/whatever. I might be a little more boring than I used to, maybe I'm not as fun as I used to be, but you know what? Who cares? That's the trip I'm on. If the price I have to pay for increased health, longevity, psychological epiphany, and growth is that I'm a little less fun in social gatherings, so be it. I've had 15 years since college to be the rowdy, rip-roaring life of the party; now's the time to sit back and try to enjoy the moment on new terms. Let other people throw their shoes at wasps and chant along to classic rock ballads.

Anyway, now it's Tuesday morning and I need to get ready for work. By next week I'll have a month under my belt, and that will feel good. Then two, then three, and so on. For those of you on day 1, it does get easier, and easier, and easier, but I think I need to remind myself to stay vigilant and not be lulled into a false sense of security. I've been sleeping great, exercising, and saving a lot of money. The pros vastly outweigh the cons. Thanks to everyone for your posts and for reading mine. Even though I may never meet any of you, it's nice to know we're on this journey together and can share our ups and downs along the way.",12

A drive to the city with my daughter, stopped for brunch (lovely but agoraphobia trigger), went to a huge unknown shopping centre to pick up my sons b'day cake and some of his present (see above... major trigger), came home, Psych appointment (Good session, but heavy = massive trigger), Large shopping centre but one I know searching for a specific present (big trigger - and now a Covid hotspot), local supermarket for a couple of things we couldn't get at other shops, which is adjacent to my local bottleshop (I used to walk in there on auto pilot.....)

AND my daughter is at her boyfriends tonight - which would normally make me say OK I can drink tonight.

Instead I'm here, drinking water, thinking about what I should have for dinner, and grateful for today :)

Tomorrow I'm going to a Brewhouse for dinner!!!

And I'm still sleeping like shit, so constantly tired - always a trigger. I'll probably ned to lay low tomorrow to re-energise, hopefully I'll sleep better tonight.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

So far, so good.  I’ve sort of been lurking around over the past week or so, but I think I’ve got the hang of it. I’ve read the rules, I’m just not clear on the level of R-Rated dialogue allowed, so here we go.  I’m on Day 7, about a week ago, I decided to crawl into the wormhole that is quitting drinking.  At this point, I think the worst of it is just about over, in terms of the headaches and whathaveyou, but I’m still experiencing the anxiety and restlessness aspect of everything.  I bought a six pack of N.A.beer the other day and that was mistake, not because of the temptation aspect, but more of the fact that it was disgusting, as I was never really a huge beer guy either way.  Essentially I’m 35 and can’t remember the last time a spent an entire week straight up, I usually keep to a pretty good workout/diet routine, so luckily I didn’t gain a lot of weight or anything, I was just completely tired of feeling like shit all of the time.  One of my favourite past times used to be hiding in the corner of one of my favourite dives and working on material, editing and things of that nature.  This is something that I’ve always sort of thought was a bullshit atmosphere of drinking, thinking that somehow I was getting more done or being more creative if I had a glass of something on rocks figuratively riding shotgun with me.  I work in the entertainment industry, and so sobriety isn’t exactly the easiest thing to maintain, but at this point, since 2020 is an absolute piece of shit, the good news is that I couldn’t even really go to a bar, even if I wanted to do so, so I guess that’s a little bit of silver lining.  The other thing that I did not anticipate was the boredom factor.  Sure there is the anxiety and the restlessness and headaches and shit, but after all of that subsides, it’s more of a matter of figuring out what to do with myself.  I was never a huge day drinker, but I would, almost every night, have a few glasses of wine all the up to a pint or so of bourbon, in an evening.  The early days of the pandemic were not helpful in this regard.  I don’t really go to meetings, but I’m not that type of person, but so far, so good, I guess.

I threw all my booze out Wednesday morning and rode out the withdrawals until the detox facility could take me at 10:30pm. I checked my steps on my phone before they took it at the facility. I walked 6.23 miles just pacing and making loops around my neighborhood to resist going to the liquor store that day. I'm proud to say I blew a 0.00 when they checked me in.  My hands were shaking so bad I could barely sign the forms, but I made it in clean.

Thanks to everyone who gave me those little boosts, and everyone who's posts I read that night. Those things add up. I've got six days off the sauce and a month of outpatient rehab starting tomorrow.",19

2020-09-01 00:06:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ikdg26/hi_im_new_here/,Hi. I’m new here.,"I’m new and unsure what to expect, but I’m taking a first step. Given where things are in my life and my alcohol use/abuse I’m looking for support making a change, or at least someone to point me in the right direction. I’m not sure what kind of treatment approach I would benefit from, but things really can’t keep going the way they are going for me. Excuse the lengthiness, but I’m hurting and it’s a lot to get it out as a bulleted list. 

* I am a gay guy, single, living in Brooklyn, NY, just shy of 40, and have been a pretty moderate to occasionally heavy drinker for basically 20 years now. 

* COVID times in New York City have been hard. Although nothing like the nightmare of this spring, i’m still experiencing the aftereffects of losing a close young coworker in April, the loneliness of isolation, the disruption to routine, the sense of fearful anxiety. In this context i have definitely drinking harder and more frequently. It’s not unusual for me to have 6-12 high abv beers, at home, playing PC games on a quarantine week night or weekend evening. Or to join a fried for the rare pleasure of an outdoor bar, have 3-4 beers there, then come home with a pack from the bodega and kill another 6. I would say i’m fairly high tolerance and high functioning, i have a corporate job and impacts of my drinking are minimal. The hangovers can be mildly severe at times; it’s less the physical effects than the mental ones. My anxiety and depression are always worse in days after, and the cumulative costs of these are starting to add up. 

* Good news: i’ve been in treatment with a skilled psychotherapist for several years working on depression, anxiety, and processing various griefs and losses. I trust him and work well with him. I’m transparent about my problematic drinking, and we’re able to address underlying issues. But now we’re at the point where I’m looking at dealing with this more directly, including looking at options for outside treatment programs and support. 

* I was in court-ordered AA for about a year after a DUI back in Michigan in 2004. Predictably, it sucked. I didn’t want to be there, and found i didn’t mesh with the program. Some people were sweet and well meaning, some were just messy. I have mixed feelings about the the spiritual component, and the all-or-nothing, dry-or-drunk messaging, and the slogans and moralizing. I have since come to respect what 12-Step programs can do for people. It seems to work for some people, but i’m not at all sure it’s for me. I don’t know if it’s useful to think of myself as an addict, or if capital S Sobriety is even my goal. 

* I guess what i’d like is skills and support for learning moderation. Looking at why i drink and how I drink, and how to get to a place where i can enjoy 3 drinks in a bar or a glass of wine or 2 with dinner, and responsibly call it a night, instead of this harmful and constant alcohol use, the numbing self medication, the escapism. I’m told programs like this exist (and are controversial with hardline AA). 

* Specifically: Has anyone done anything with a specific online substance abuse treatment website (since under the rules, i may not be allowed to mention it, we will call it M******t, and you can mod that out if it’s an overstep) It seems appealing in that it is self directed and more medically oriented; i’m a little wary of how they seem to be pushing various Rx drugs for alcohol reduction (not even sure how these work). I signed up for the site and am curious, but got wary when they asked for my credit card number. The thought of getting on some kind of support group zoom call is terrifying for, and i just wasn’t quite ready to take that step. 

I realize this was a lot. I’m not sure anyone will even engage. I don’t want a diagnosis or a judgment. Maybe just some encouragement, and someone to point me in the right direction for next steps. Posting here was the first thing that came to mind. If i am not a good fit feel free to send me elsewhere. 

Thank you all. It took a lot just to even admit all of this.",2
