I made an efforts and in the summer we made a new relationship. She waited for me six years, I was so dump wasting time to continue drinking. I'm 35 now and we want another child.

I want to say that today I am grateful for you because I was once there 60 some odd days ago .  I’m not saying miracles happen over night but a lot has changed for me in the last 2 months .  Here’s some of the things :

Sleep schedule has improved greatly 

Feel more energetic 

Read a lot of books especially this naked mind *

Took up a couple of new hobbies because the money I saved allowed me to afford to buy things needed for said hobbies 

Feel more connected and present in my relationships both with my partner , son , x wife 

Feel my days are easier because I’m not constantly forgetting things or rushing though my day or feeling sick and shitty from oblivion the days before 

Can deal with problems I encounter better with less frustration 

Feel focused on what needs to get done whether it’s the laundry or the deadline 

I’ve gotta say I’m glad I finally made the choice to stick with it this far .  I have cravings but if I never give in they don’t count .  I know it’s hard at the start but you got this and I can tell you for the short amount of time I have not been drinking has been great .  Can’t wait for what the future has in store for me . 

* This naked mind by Annie grace - side note from above , if you are struggling with the thought of cutting back , stopping completely or just want to have a conversation with yourself about alcohol you may wonder where to turn .  This book has been very practical for me and has taught me so much about why I drink and showed me the reasons I want to stop for good.  You don’t need to hit rock bottom to start the conversation.  Much love and today I won’t drink with you !",9

No more fights, drama, bullshit or making myself look like an idiot. About 9 months ago I started having anxiety attacks and i finally went to get help for it and they prescribed me some antidepressants. It took awhile of going up in doses to really get to where I want to be, but honestly I feel good today. I kind of feel a little empty though not going to lie. So anyway l, my doctor told me I shouldn’t drink while I take this and there could be consequences. So honestly that scared me enough to stop. I’d rather feel good sober then have to get fucked up to feel good. I wasn’t a drink every day guy, but definitely was the weekend warrior. I’ve had a lot of bad times going out and got into some bad shit, so I started to just stay home and drink by myself. I guess that caused me to get depressed and the isolation started to make me feel weird around people even my closest friends. The people I’ve told that I stopped are very happy for me and told me how much I sucked when I drank. I miss it though. I honestly just miss getting drunk, not giving a fuck. That warm feeling, the numbness just letting loose. I don’t think I’m going to stay sober for ever, but if I do go back I want to try and control it.

Today is my 8th day of sobriety which marks my longest length of sobriety in the past 3 years. About a year ago I was sober for 7 days and decided to celebrate with a drink or two.. Which led to many more and led to relapsing for another year. Now I know I can't do that to myself and my goal right now is to see if I can make it to two weeks.

I kind of want to tell people in my life about this, but I feel that they won't understand that 8 days is a big deal for me, as they easily go weeks or months without drinking. I'm thinking if I can make it to 2 weeks or 1 month I'll open up to people because then I feel like I can admit that I have a problem, but I'm taken steps to correct it like I should be.

I’ve blacked out way more times than I can count, did amazingly stupid and dangerous things on the regular, and generally never gave much thought to stopping or even moderating because it just felt like it would be impossible. Like I was just destined to be this ridiculous drunk person who joked about her problem to make it seem normal. 
Somehow, I never felt that alcohol had control over me until about a week ago. How is that possible?? 
Anyway. Tomorrow my month is up and I have zero desire to drink. It honestly feels like a miracle. 
I don’t know how long this feeling of freedom will keep me off the hooch, but I am feeling optimistic about reforming the image I have of myself, and of the absolute caricature I’ve become.

But today my fiancé was upset with me because he saw that my sponsor texted me.  He said ""oh boy ...I guess that means something is wrong with you. What's going on.""  I got irritated. I said NO.  I just texted her because I'm stressed with losing clients and wanted someone to connect with. 

He said what's your issue?  I said I'm doing all I can to replace my clients and it's not working...and I'm very very nervous. He said ""well, I'm worried about money all the time but that doesn't mean I need to drink.  What's wrong with you?""

So then he proceeded to continue to tell me he now knows he can't confide in me because he wound't want to ""stress me out"" ...so ""don't be surprised if I take a job out of state and then tell you after that I have to move.... because I can't tell you ANYTHING.""

So I was stunned.  I said so now you are thinking of moving out of state and not communicating with me UNTIL YOU DECIDE?  

He said well you just said you are soooooo stressed...it sounds like that's what I have to do.

I wanted to drink badly.  REALLY badly.  And when this happened we JUST sat down at the bar of our fav restaurant.  I ALMOST ordered wine.  But i didn't.  He then said ""i'm glad you aren't going back to the same....  you should know alcohol does't make things better...""

That's longer than I've been sober in the last half year or so.

I don't know if it's the medication and knowing that I CAN'T drink, the urge has certainly been there, but the other day at the ""stop drinking"" center, (it's not really rehab, more a place where I get to talk to professionals about it) I was asked, ""What do you gain from drinking?""

I genuinely couldn't answer that. I sat in that office with the interviewer and said nothing for what felt like an eternity because I couldn't think of one single good thing to gain from drinking. I've been using drinking to escape my thoughts and keep my anxiety at bay, but truthfully, drinking only made both worse.

Yes, facing your depression and anxiety is hard, but drinking will only make it a lot more terrible. When you poison your brain with alcohol, it will create an overflow of dopamine and when your brain is dopamine starved, you will feel even more depressed than you did before you started drinking. Doesn't matter if you weren't depressed when you started drinking. 

There's nothing to gain from drinking, except self loathing and hangovers.

Please wish me luck.,"There hasn't been a single day in the last 2 years when I haven't had something to drink. The last couple of months though have been particularly bad - I have taken to drinking after breakfast, as I just feel sad and stressed without it. I always think, If I have one drink, I'll be able to focus more, - get rid of the anxiety and be productive. This stopped working about 6 months ago. One drink turns into 10, I'm drunk by lunchtime, and nothing gets done.

I'm still young, so this is a pretty embarrassing problem to admit. No one knows how bad this has got. I'm a student, who used to get great grades, but am now close to failing out. My house is a mess, I've gained 50lbs, and god knows what damage I've already done physically. I need to stop now, or I'll ruin everything.

Day 1. Wish me luck!

Update: just finished my first day sober. Thank you all so much for your support!

 As a lot of people have asked about medical issues related to alcohol, unfortunately I have no health cover right now, so I'm trying to do it alone. I know I have stomach problems related to drinking, (occasional vomiting blood after a heavy binge). Other than that I have no idea. Hopefully any issues will resolve themselves in time.

I decided to do dry January again this year (did it a few years ago).. the first time I did it, I wanted to drink after the month was over. This time I think I want to keep going. This is what I've noticed since I stopped drinking.

When I first stopped, I thought about beer a lot.. I love the bubbles and the taste!

I started eating a lot more sugar and chocolate.. had to replace those carbs with other carbs!

My mood has been up and more stable.. I don't have anxiety as much and when I do, it's fairly easy to relax.

I have more energy and I'm more inspired to do other things with my time.. pursuing hobbies, exercising, etc.

I'm a lot more talkative now and less self-conscious.

I feel better about myself and that I'm doing something good for my body.

I don't feel like I'm missing out and I'm happy enough to drink a sparkling water.

It's easier to keep commitments to my health now - going to the gym on Saturday mornings and exercising after work.

I used to want to party a lot but over the years that desire has become less and less. I don't really like going to parties so much anymore and I don't like getting drunk or being hungover. To me, waking up feeling good, clean, and healthy is amazing. I can have a full day without feeling like crap.

I think one of the more challenging things to stopping drinking is when people around me give me a hard time for it. Luckily I haven't gotten that much grief about it this time around. :)

Luckily they only sell these bottles in packages or groups of 6, so I couldn’t afford em anyway. I intentionally took just a few bucks with me to grab the chips.

I don’t know why I cant do that with alcohol.   I don’t have cravings, per se.  it’s something in my brain that says “just have a drink.  It will make everything better.”  It’s mostly a problem when I’m suffering PMDD, otherwise unless I’m going out I don’t drink at home.

When I drink, I do drink more than I intend to.

I’ve been much better than I used to be, but not as good as I want to be.  I want to be able to have a healthy relationship with alcohol, is there anyone here who has any advice?",4

At the very beginning I told my immediate family, very close friends, and a couple of close co workers. I'm not ashamed of my addiction and am looking at it as a positive way of looking inward at myself and hoping to become a much better person. I eventually would love to be able to help others with their problems. 

Here's my issue, yesterday I found out that a couple other co workers now know that I'm working through my issue with alcohol. I've never worked drunk, or let it become an issue at work, but I work in healthcare and am terrified it could jeopardize my job or make people think less of me. I have worked very hard to be where I am and have made vast improvements in my limited sobriety. I guess I'm just scared.

What has been some of your experiences with other, not so close to you, people finding out about your addiction? Has it been mostly positive still? Maybe I'm worrying over nothing. I hope so anyway.

It was at one of their houses and I knew all the women, some better than others. At the end if the night, I was the only driver because of the no drinking thang, so I offered to drive everyone home - 3 stops in the same town about a 20 min drive away. I dropped the first lady off, and the 2nd lady in the back started going mental. She started screaming at me ""stop this fucking car, who do you think you are, where are you taking me, you're a fucking bastard, this is the worst cab drive I've ever taken"". I pull over and I turn around and I say ""J, I am your friend,  Im not a cab driver. I was taking M home next but I will take you next instead. I just need your street name"" I knew she lived a few streets from M but wasn't sure what one, but she refused to tell me, screaming louder still and telling me she wanted to get out. I was still pulled over so I said ""I'm stopped,  I want to drive you home but if you want to get out, you can. So she gathered her things, all the while looking at me like she wanted to kill me, and got out, slammed the door and stumbled off. I waited maybe 5 or 10 seconds, she didn't come back. I drove away and dropped M off.

Now. I'm lying here in bed and wondering, did she get home? Should I have followed her and made sure she got home? What else could I have done. She was slowly getting drunker throughout the night but this was like a switch. As I was looking at her when I stopped the car, I could tell she was in full fight mode, there was no way I was going to stop her from leaving. She was looking at me like she'd never seen me before, like I was a stranger, like she really believed I was a cab driver. I've seen angry drunks before, I used to be one occasionally, but I have never seen this complete loss of understanding  of who the people are around me. I'm really confused and kinda scared, for her as well as trying to think what I should have done differently.",7

I am getting help and have been to AA meetings and will be starting in-patient treatment soon. My family and girlfriend, while disappointed with the OWI, are incredibly supportive and happy that for the first time in my life I recognize the problem and WANT to be and stay sober for life. 

I'm 20 years old and in college, my girlfriend of 4 years is also in college and she does not have a drinking problem. She only drinks very occasionally, maybe a weekend or two a month at college parties with her friends. I need time to distance myself from alcohol so I can't really go to these parties with her for the time being.

How do I deal with the jealousy of knowing that my girlfriend will be going out drinking and having fun with her friends? I will be sitting at home sober while she will be out with her friends (probably this weekend, as it's the first weekend back at school from winter break) and I'm not sure how to deal with it. I'm very new to all of this. I don't want to impede on her ability to have a fun college experience with her friends.

I feel like it's worth noting that I have had to distance myself from my best friends and college roommates because they are huge drinkers. So I don't really have a social group that I can hangout with to take my mind off of it. I now live with my parents until treatment starts. My biggest fear is that I'll get bitter and lash out, and I don't want that to happen.

This is my first post. I’ve been actively struggling with a alcohol addiction for the past 2 to 3 years. I tried white knuckle abstinence as a reset for three months, I tried the Sinclair method for 6 to 9 months, and then I read a few books including those by Annie grace and Kevin O’Hara.  Then I had a really successful 4 1/2 months of sobriety without counting days, but fell off the wagon during the holidays. I am back on the wagon and have drank three days in the past four weeks. I feel good and I am ready to commit to permanent sobriety.  I don’t  think about booze daily, but I know I have a problem.

I started working with a therapist this past week for general life stuff and explained my struggles with alcohol. I also told her that I didn’t want to go through AA.  She told me that in order to keep working with her I needed to go to an outpatient detox program. It made me realize that I probably could use formal support in this process, but I am concerned about an outpatient detox program because they seem a bit extreme. The one I was going to go to wants me to go there five days a week for three hours a day for six weeks. Even though I have insurance that would cover most of it, it sort of seems like a money grab to me: and I do not have time for that as it would interfere with my employment and force me to leave a good job that I really like.  Also the vibe I get is that most of the people in the outpatient program and in the detox clinic in general are there via court order.  Whereas I am totally voluntary.That said, this process has made me open to start going to AA meetings.  

Again I don’t think about drinking on a daily basis.  And any withdrawal symptoms I’ve experienced have been pretty darn minor – mostly just cravings and irritability for a couple days.  Though I have experienced some kindling after these breaks in the past year.The hardest part of sobriety so far for me is that I work in the restaurant industry as a second but financially very important job, and I am surrounded by booze there.
Anyway, Just wondering what anyone’s thoughts are regarding the outpatient detox program versus AA.

Thanks.",2

The 3 mile run I went on didn’t make me feel better, cleaning the house, and doing the laundry didn’t make me feel better, playing music doesn’t make me feel better. I have never hidden a day time drink in my life and I swear it is the hardest thing not to go out and buy a bunch of truly’s and pretend I didn’t sign up for any of this shit for an afternoon. 

my son has a very high IQ, he’s just now 3 and is starting to read. I feel very blessed about that. He can play a few songs on an actual piano and sing with a nearly perfect pitch. He will sweetly, and willingly help me sweep and unload the dishwasher. He uses a professional camera with a tripod and likes to take macro photos of bugs. He can built elaborate train tracks for hours all over my house. He is so brilliant and I am so proud of him.... but this same kid will take a dump in the hallway on purpose just because I walked away from the puzzle before we were finished with it, because I Had to go to the bathroom for a second. He threw a full sized boat full of water at my face, drenching me, and smashing my lip, while I was fully dressed, trying to get him ready for school. Just because the little dude hate his hair washed so much. 

I have a brilliant sweet kid who is spontaneously a bleeping bleepidy bleep! He is the nicest person until my son beats the absolute shit out of me. All. The. Time. 

The preschool days where I don’t have to go back to work full-time are fleeting, and I’m losing my grip on, “why exactly I shouldn’t drown myself in booze, alone, today?”

Sorry for venting, and I’m even more sorry if this triggers anyone else. Trying really hard to not drink with you today.",5

It was only about a year ago that I finally sick of my own shit, and since then I have actively tried to moderate.  Once I realized that is impossible for me, my appetite for alcohol is an endless pit, I knew the only solution is quitting.  

For the past year I have sporadically gone weeks without it, only to let some excuse pull me right back in.  And as soon as I started, stopping was at all in my interest.  I would go weeks on and weeks off drinking, only to be brought back to the same fact: I do not like being drunk and most importantly I do not like escaping reality.  

After last friday, where I had a massive binge, I knew that something needs to change.  And after that something kind of clicked.  I am confident in myself that I can happily live the rest of my life without alcohol.  Yesterday my SO and I got into a massive argument and instead of hitting the bottle i hit the gym for the first time ever. 

I am very thankful for the support of this subreddit. It made me realize I am not alone in this fight, and that it is completely doable.  Thank you all, IWNDWYT!",3

2020-01-30 13:00:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ew9gt8/daily_whiskey_drinking_50_hours_after_stopping/,Daily Whiskey Drinking - 50 hours after stopping cold turkey,"Hey all,

I never thought I'd find myself in this position, but here I am. A series of health conditions has given me the ""wake up call"" of a lifetime. 

About 8 months ago, I got a bad stomach infection that caused intense diarrhea and other symptoms. This lead to a serious case of internal hermmroids that took 3 surgical banding procedures to alleviate.  I finally got relief from the hemmroids recently. All the while during these 8 months, I have continued to put away approximately 1/4 to 1/2 a bottle of Scotch every evening, slowly from around 5pm-11pm. 

I've always had stomach problems, I was diagnosed with Gastritis as a child, and I had issues with ulcers (never diagnosed, just suspected) since I was in my 20s. 

I've also always had serious anxiety problems that I struggle to control. Basically GAD.

Here lately, I've noticed some escalating signs --

1) There have been small specs of dark blood in my stool 

2) I have had acute stomach pain that is only relieved by sneezing (this has been ongoing through most of my life, even during long periods - years - of not drinking. )

3) I've been pooping a whole lot more, but I've been slamming meta mucil so they mostly come out OK. I stopped the fiber cold turkey on Tuesday along with the alcohol, which makes me wonder if that's contributing to the diarrhea. 

4)  I feel like my anxiety levels are higher. I am quick to anger, get paranoid, etc.

The dark specks were my wake up call, I decided to immediately stop drinking Tuesday night after my final follow up with my hemmroid surgeon. 

Well, here I am, \~60 hours later, and I think I'm an alcoholic -- here's why.

1) The first day I decided to quit, I felt terribly sad, like all the joy in my life was over. Like I would never feel good again because I can no longer drink after work. I feel like my hobbies and passions are over because I cannot feel good anymore when I do them without alcohol (mostly sitting and programming at night, playing games, etc).

2) I immediately developed a bit of insomnia and have trouble sleeping

3) I feel ""weird"" -- I don't know hot to describe it. I lack focus. I feel ""slow"".

4) I have developed CRAZY LIQUID DIARRHEA. Seriously, is this normal when you stop?

It's all fairly mild, besides the diarrhea, but I feel like I might be withdrawing from alcohol. 

Other notes:

\- The dark spots in my stool seem to have begun to subside. I had been seeing it often, but this morning, I have taken 3 movements without the presence of the darkness. 

\- The acute stomach pain with sneezing is gone. I have been experiencing this daily for a while now, and it's just gone.

I'm lucky enough to have a good career (still) and heath insurance, so believe me, if the dark specs persist, I will bring my ass to the hospital. My understanding based on my own research is that alcoholic gastritis is a thing, and it kinda makes sense that this would be my issue, given I have been drinking every evening (sipping) for years.

I don't really know why I am posting here. I feel alone. I have resources and support, but still, I feel like  I am in a dark place, and I don't know when it'll get brighter.",4

I know this will pass. But I am being SO mean to myself about everything physically and mentally. Not mention emotionally.

2020-01-30 12:56:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ew9eaq/too_good_at_hiding_my_problem/,too good at hiding my problem?,"I've been a problem drinker from about the time I could drink but it accelerated in the last decade and especially in the last few years since I've been working from home. (I am 39.) I have a high tolerance and am really good at hiding my drinking and also doing well at work, taking care of the house, time with nephews, exercising, etc. I come from a family that drinks. My father, for example, works hard every day and is successful, and every night he comes home and drinks a minimum of six beers. Mom's similar, but vodka. They make it work for them. ... But the fact is I've come to hate drinking for myself and despite that haven't been able to stop. My last year of drinking was scary on many levels. So I went to AA and got a sponsor and all that. 

And it worked! I was sober for about 5 months and for the most part doing great. 

But I never shared much at AA meetings or even got much into my past with my sponsor. I was honest in everything but not forthcoming, I guess. I don't like bragging or showing off, and sometimes that's what war stories feel like. My gf knew I was going to meetings and I told my family I wasn't drinking. I told people at work I don't drink anymore. I figured that was enough. Seemed to be. 

Then me and the gf were going through a little rough patch and she said, ""I don't think you're an alcoholic. I don't like you hanging out in church basements with strangers, it's weird. You need to drink less is all."" That stung. Like to the point that it almost ended everything. Being sober is life and death for me. I was totally honest with her about driving drunk, hiding bottles, waking up to shots, panic attacks, blacking out, etc. I cried for the first time in a decade. It seemed to have made an impression and she supports me now. I don't resent her for it. She needed to know why and I needed to be honest. 

Then  a few days back I went to a meeting after about three weeks away and saw my sponsor there. I really like and respect the guy. He's old school and to the point. ""Where you been?"" ""Traveling for work, busy,"" I said. ""But I needed to make some meetings this week. I'm feeling a little weak.""

""Sober?"" he asked. 

""Yeah,"" I said. 

""Do me a favor. Go back and read Step One and decide if you're really an alcoholic. I'm beginning to think you aren't."" 

It kind of floored me. I truly believe I owe AA my life. Should I just get a new sponsor? Am I doing something wrong? Last night I drank a bottle of wine after church. I woke up and drank another in the morning. Completely stupid. But I am feeling betrayed and alone. Should I? 

Thanks and peace,

So I'm just your run of the mill post-college young IT guy. My father was/is an alcoholic, so alcohol was taboo growing up. I was deeply depressed as a teenager, probably due to just general trauma being around parents that also struggled with alcohol/tobacco addiction and poverty. Lot's of yelling and high strung emotions constantly.

I think this led to me viewing alcohol (and nicotine, and drugs) as an escape. I drank a lot in college. I considered it to be fun but it did numb the weight of the background noise in life. I used to smoke a lot of weed too, and tobacco products before switching to vaping for ~6 years. 

Somehow I came out on top, graduated, got a good job, live with an SO, etc. All in all I'm doing pretty well.

I am concerned with alcohol though. It's been a long time since I've gotten blackout drunk, or thrown up (though I've felt like it), or had to call out of work sick because of a hangover (though I have worked through a hangover). 

I don't do really stupid things when I drink, like driving drunk or messing around on my SO. Just things like eating too much pizza and being too loud. 

But I do drink kind of often. Maybe 3-4 times a week. I go to breweries with friends, drink when I work on cars, and often even drink alone to relax. Most times it's 2-4 beers, or half a bottle of wine. Sometimes a full bottle, sometimes 5 beers. But also sometimes only once a week. It's very sporadic. I don't see it as a need, but a strong want.

Given my family history with addiction though and my clear struggles to avoid it, I've decided to stop.

I also have struggled to give up nicotine. I don't own a vape anymore but do frequently hit my friends' when I'm with them, to the point it annoys them. Clearly, it's not something I've totally overcome.

I'm also overweight (though hitting the gym 3x a week and eating less/healthier, so it's going down) and also drink way too much caffeine. Also I get into a lot of online arguments, though I deleted my old Reddit account so that has mostly stopped.

All in all I think my issue is with boredom and depression. I need something to fill that void and numb the vague ache that just kind of follows me around when nothing is there to take my mind off it. 


I don't know exactly what I expect to gain from my this post, I haven't even asked any questions. It just felt like something I needed to get out there.",2

As hopeless as my situation really is, at least it’s more manageable sober I believe. I’m going to have to take a job a few states away and I’m worried the stress of the change will be too much to continue sober.

I’m super proud of myself although I am terrified of how easy it is for me to fail.  In the past o found myself doing the I can learn to moderate, I can just have one since I’m going out for dinner and those have turned into weeks on end of daily drinking, day drinking and miserable hangovers.  So I have not lost any weight or saved up any money.... my husband who is also embarking on this sober journey with me has taken it upon himself to cook to feed an army.  I have so many frozen meals now once he stops cooking we won’t need to worry about groceries for weeks.... I’ve taken to eating takeout and excessive carbs.  Most importantly though is I’m not drinking.  I will worry about the bank account and the waistline when I feel stronger and I definitely am.  My first week was filled with thoughts of I need a drink then in the second week my thoughts turned to I don’t want to drink that voice is still obsessive and I look forward to just having time without needing those thoughts.  I do have moments of peace now where alcohol is not invading my brain on the constant.  I’ve gotten through the challenges of going to the grocery store and the gas station and even a night where my husband texted me at work that he had picked up beers on the way home he’s on disulfiram and was violently ill when I got home I immediately emptied all the leftover beer and was grateful for no further temptation.

so, now i am looking at other short term commitments i can make. there is a fitness app i want to try, that only costs about $30 for 3 months of service that's $100/mo savings right there, and in that three months service you can start 6-8-10 week fitness ""journeys"". i think i might commit to that. i just started a fiber and milk thistle supplement that has 60 servings. i committed to completing that supplement package with an honest, and clean effort. and, as much as i am enjoying it exercising is only a part of what i have started doing over the past four months. haven't made any commitments elsewhere, but i am writing for about 30 minutes a day. plan to read a book over lunch, thinking about some larger creative projects. it feels good to be able to think in terms of weeks, and months, and not days, but i can take it that each day will present a test or two, and keep that as a given, and prepare as best i can for those moments, while also keeping another larger, maybe even softer focus just a little further down the road. these smaller short term goals are helping me break from the overwhelming nature of a lifetime in sobriety...for now",3

Fed heavy alcohol, stayed up late, woke up early, never paid for the booze. Never reenlisted, continued in my original career in the food industry.

Two years ago started an under the table job at a pizza place for $7.25 an hour (5 hour shifts) , got a raise of .50¢ three months in for my knowledge of the industry, worked there until 2 weeks ago after 2 years of basically begging for another raise. Higher ranking employees get wasted before work, messing things up all the time, generally getting distracted and being lazy. 

In my time there I ended up drinking up to a pint and a half of vodka before the nights were done, no one could tell (I'm usually able to handle myself [unless extremely stressed or treated unfairly])

A week and a half ago I put in my two weeks to work overnight at a local gas station 40 hours a week for $9.25/hr. I'm tempted to start drinking again, as I'm alone for 8 hours from 10pm to 6am.   I've never worked retail before and am afraid I'll taper back into heavy drinking again--only to be discovered by my manager that comes in at 6.

 The cold light of day finally roused me at 8am this morning. Late. I'd missed my train and I would be late for my job. A job I started just three weeks ago. 

The shakes hit me as I was buying a coffee. The sweats came as the train pulled into the first stop.  
Finally, the memories came as I crossed the platform and went back home. I lied to my work and feigned illness.

I'm tired but I can't sleep. The memories come and go and with them the Fear.  I made a fool of myself last night. I spent £180. God knows where. 

Anxiety cripples me, but worse is looking in the mirror knowing the bitter truth that I have let down my colleagues, let down my family and let down myself. Missing work is a new low for me. 

'I'll never drink again', so I tell myself, but I don't have to lie to any of you. I have a bottle of whiskey in my room and I glance at it occasionally. 

I hate myself. All the veneer has been stripped away and there's so little of me left. I think I want to die.

  
My drinking has reached a new low, but I don't think my descent is over. I want to stop but the weight of my own downward momentum keeps me coming back for more. I'm afraid I don't want to stop.  I'm afraid I don't deserve to stop. 

I know I can't just cut back, I need to stop forever.  I don't think I'm strong enough, but your stories make me hope I am.",7

I think I set my badge wrong awhile back (it was my first time requesting a badge, but I like it a lot. Anyway, I think it's one day off, but my last drink was on New Year's Eve, so today will make 30 days sober for me : ) It's been really, really nice, definitely some days that tested me more than others, some struggles, but am feeling stronger everyday, and after today I will have a new record. The longest that I've gone without drinking in a lot of years. I also don't plan on drinking to celebrate that. The last time I had 30 days, in November, I'd never done it, was very determined to do it, but knew that I'd drink afterwards, since that goal had been reached. Today, I know that I still don't want to drink. I want to push myself as far as I can. I want...better. I already have really good, but I want a lot better. This is already getting long, that's just me, but a funny thing happened yesterday. I've been wanting to get my hair colored really badly. I usually do it myself, or maybe 1-2 years I will go to a salon, so not often. Well, I was working a shift yesterday that I wasn't even supposed to be working (a girl asked me to switch) I worked, and was walking up the street to my apt. thinking that I should just go into the salon to try and make an appointment, since I'm off now for two consecutive days in a row now for the first time in months, but was thinking that there's no way I could probably get in anyway, was thinking I'd just go home, and not bother trying, would call another time...and I ran into my favorite person on the street, that does hair at that salon. I was like ""So and So! Hi""!!! and the next thing I knew, we'd been talking for 20 min on the street. She got her phone out to check her soonest availability, and then looked at me and asked, smiling,""What about now""??? And I was laughing, and asked ""Realllllyyyyy""???????? I called my Husband to let him know that I was gonna do it (we usually get home at the same time from work) and he was just excited for me as I was. I've been talking about this for months - the wanting to do it. Well, long story long, lol...I set a record as far as my hair goes - I spent $300 and was at the salon for 5 HOURS. A far cry from my usual $10 box of Garnier Nutrisse from CVS 😂😂😂 And you know what??? I still saved more than that this month by not drinking, I turn 40 in March, and am going to Hawaii with my Husband to celebrate, and am gonna do it with fancy hair : ) : ) : ) And I...feel like I finally deserve to, and finally am beginning to see myself the way everyone else always tells me that they see me. That alone just made me cry. Literally, I'm crying. I'm fucking proud of myself!!! I'm proud of myself. And I wouldn't be here without all of you. I look in here everyday, every single day, multiple times, and it helps me more than I could ever, ever say. Thank You. I love you. IWNDWYT P.S. I got away from the ""signs"" part a little, but it turns out that the woman that did my hair, well her Mom also had cancer twice, and died, and I told her about my drinking, and she leaned in and told me that she's actually trying to make some similar changes, etc. Just a LOT of common ground. I was exactly where I was supposed to be, and I AM exactly where I'm supposed to be right now. I know that ❤️❤️❤️",16

And it’s probably really more considering going out to eat and all the things not calculated in a per bottle formula.  Has it been easier this time. Maybe...I made it through the holidays.  

Will I keep going? You betcha.  Is life crazy better? In many ways. Does my family notice or say anything? No, but I can comment on it.  How is my sleep? Much much better, but not like a baby.  Have I lost a ton of weight? Nope.  Do I have more energy? Yessiree, but not  an Energizer Bunny.  Are my bills getting paid on time? Pretty much. How about the house? More picked up and starting a little purging when I have time.  Do I miss the wine? Sometimes with dinner, or when out.  Have I ‘cheated’? I have had a few Social sake cans, but never the slightest buzz.  Do I ever crave badly? Not so much since the New Year.  How do I feel about this stint?  It’s amazing to be out of the ‘Chardonnay a day’ wheel - that’s a bottle 😉.  How long have I been aware that stopping wine would be a good thing? Since about 2010.  Is this my first sober journey? No, lost count, but one of the longer stints.  Do I have an irl support group? No, someday, perhaps.  Do I still have the same friends? Yes, but working a lot so not really socializing (that probably helps).  Six to go... what’s the best part? Liking myself and knowing I am doing self care.  Has stopping wine solved my challenges? A few.  Has stopping improved relationships? I would like to think so.  What else do I notice? Less likely to snack or do ‘grab n’ go’, so I take time to prep a ‘meal’, even if a small one.  Is my health improved?  I believe it has to, but I have, or notice, the aches and pains much more - self-medicating?

Gainz from weightlifting are triggered by stress from weightlifting. I don't think it's a stretch to say that drinking to oblivion after a workout could mute that response. 

I love the diversity of this sub. With some of the stories, I feel survivors guilt, but then again, I was one set of red and blues from real trouble.

**What helped?**

* This sub! endless source of companionship, reality and wisdom
* Substitute drinks, raspberry cordial with sparkling water served with frozen fruits and ice, no alcohol beer in the fridge if I need it (and I did last weekend)
* food, cake, chocolate, no limits (that will have to change but not just yet)
* journaling each night, multiple 'sober day' star charts, gratitude lists, writing a nightly ""to do"" for the next day
* hand-stitching a patchwork quilt, repetitive, soothing
* dogs cuddles and walks

**What was triggering?**

* Watching 2 friends in a theatre sitting happily chatting with a glass of red wine each
* Phone calls with 2 family members (although not as bad as I thought those might be)
* Anxiety before meeting groups of friends
* Tiredness from disturbed sleep as I get used to AF

**What rewards have I noticed so far?**

* clearer mind
* more energy
* becoming easier to be ""present""
* moments of joy
* feeling proud of myself
* realising I am OK
* working through emotions
* starting to change my narrative
* better sleep

2020-01-30 08:52:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ew5qr9/ready_to_commit_but_im_scared/,Ready to commit but I'm scared,"I've been knowing I needed to quit drinking for a while (about 2 vodka handles a week) as for the past 2 years of my life I've been completely unproductive, gained about 20 pounds, isolated myself from almost everyone, and feel crappier and crappier everyday. Everytime I run out, I tell myself just don't drink today. Get more tomorrow if anything. I fight myself for a bit, trying to decide whether or not to get more. I know I shouldn't but I really want to. Even having the internal fight with the devil on my shoulder, I already feel shame that I've spent so much time thinking about it. Most of the times, I succumb to my weak will and make that trip to the store while feeling guilty the whole time. But once I get back home with it, I'm fine. I just get into that bottle and before you know it, 3 days go by like nothing where I'm just drunk and get nothing done the whole time. My bottle goes empty and the process repeats. The Naltrexone from December that my doctor prescribed hasn't been touched because I had decided I still wanted to drink. 

Right now, I spend most of my drunken time on my computer playing games with a small group of online friends that I've never met. They've been getting increasingly annoyed with me, for playing bad and just being loud and rambling and confused when we play. Most of them started playing other games and don't ask me to play except one other guy who I regularly have conversations with about other things as we both enjoy talking to each other. A few weeks ago I got really drunk and basically insulted him and he told me he was done with my behavior and I'd never change and blocked me. I felt really bad and tried to apologize through other forms of communication (different accounts, other games, phone, etc) and he said he'd give me one more chance but he didn't want to talk to me or play if I was drunk. He could always tell when I reached a certain point and would just leave. I accepted it as I wanted to retain this friendship with him. 

The other night I ran out of vodka and contemplated buying more but I honestly felt pretty shitty from being hungover from the previous day. He was online and asked if I wanted to play but then said wait are you drunk yet? I said no,  I ran out and wanted to get more and he told me not to and started lecturing me and asking me why I continue to ruin my body and life like this. He  had effectively made me feel like shit and ashamed and talked to me so long the store had closed anyways even if I had still wanted to go. It was one thing I actually really liked about him and why I liked talking to him. He's very intense and good at getting his point across and shooting down any rebuttals if they were bullshit. Every excuse I made or reason I gave for why I drank and couldn't stop, he shot it down with a more than reasonable and sound logic that made a lot of sense. It actually got to the point where I was in tears because I knew he was right and I had no more excuses left except just admitting I was weak and didn't want to truly stop and didn't care that I was ruining my life. We also have a slight thing for each other and I didn't want to disappoint him. 

We talked for 9 hours and he finally went to bed because he had work in a few hours. After he left,  I thought long and hard about everything he told me and knew he was right and I HAVE to quit or nothing in my life will improve and I'll continue living this dumpster existence where I allow alcohol to control me. Yesterday was my bazillionth day 1, today will be my day 2 again. In the past,  I've survived past a few day 2s but deep down I didn't want to quit,  I just 'wanted to give my liver a break' and when I told him that before he just laughed and said that was the dumbest thing he's ever heard if I'm just going to drink myself into oblivion a few days later. After a good cry by myself, I am going to wholeheartedly put in the intent to quit drinking. I'm scared to fail but he gave me a great talk. Either you admit you're weak and can't do it and continue to use it as a crutch and destroy yourself, or you JUST DO IT. Don't tell yourself self defeating words like I need it or can't or not yet. I'm really really gonna try and I hope that all of you who are struggling can find the confidence and love in yourself to try and save your body and soul no matter how hard it seems.

Upon further thinking about it, though, the ""craving"" (not really cravings anymore) were destroyed by rational thinking. Thinking about who I am, when I drink. I don't want to be that person. 

When I made the decision, my first thought went to New Years Eve. It's my favorite day of the year. I love watching fireworks, I could do that all day. I thought the magic would go away or I wouldn't be as excited about them. Well I obviously was, without so much as a drop of alcohol. 

My moms birthday was a couple days ago, she knows I made the decision not to ever drink so much as a beer again. At first she was hesitant and asked why. (She should have enough examples, but I guess the ""you're still young you're allowed to make mistakes"" was still valid.) When I told her, I don't want to be like my father, she nodded and has since been very supportive. She asked me if I wanted to drink with her on her birthday as a celebration and was fully okay with me saying no. I wanted to say yes. I just can't. 

I have had the worst experiences when it comes to friends. Pretty much each and every time, it left me hurt and almost sort of broken. Each time a friend ""left"" I felt more broken hearted than after any break up I had. I was over my last break up of a four year relationship within less than a month. When my then best friend told me to fuck off, I was a mess for idk how many months. Aaaaanyway I'm talking about this friends thing because the other day I was invited to hang out with my boyfriends friends. The amount of anxiety and panic of going to a strangers house was OFF THE ROOF. When I was there I was fine. It was objectively a fun night. Even after, all was fine. But then for like three days straight, I felt anxious, for no reason. Back when I was drinking there at least was a reason for this anxiety - ""Shit, what'd I say, what'd I do, was I a jackass again?"". I don't even have these questions now, I KNOW what I did and said. It just makes me feel uneasy thinking about the evening, for no reason, or maybe the one reason, that this fond memory will one day just be another reminder that I have shooed another set of people away, and I can't even fully explain why. Or maybe, this ""after-panic"" is just conditioned and learned from my time drinking. Idk. I'm sorry for rambling. 

Also, I have this odd anxiety of there being alcohol in cakes or chocolates Im offered lol. 

So anyway, on my birthday, I will be exactly a year sober. That will be my birthday present, for me from me. My last drink was a beer I have allowed myself to drink when I turned  25, at midnight. Happy birthday me, you dumbass. Tasted like shit. Thanks for reading.",7

My app has rolled around to 1 month,  1 day and 23 hours. Best decision I made to stop drinking again. I deserve this better life, actually achieving,  being active and doing the hobbies I've always wanted to do but got side tracked by the poison.

The first part of the month I was pretty emotional, my emotions all over the place - they have now settled down. I'm reading This Naked Mind - I tend to read only a few pages a day and consider what she has written and how it applies in my life - I'm finding it very benefical. 

I've noticed again people's reaction and comments when I tell them that I've made a commitment to not drinking for a year - it always relates to them and their thoughts on their drinking habits and defenses  - always a curious observation.

Anyway SD I love this place and I'll surely not be drinking today xx",6

Day 6:
Only woke up once sweating. Still staring awake at night and sleeping through the day. Decided to start cleaning my room /house by throwing out all of my empty bottles and garbage that was laying around. Starting to enjoy things I used to enjoy, like playing video games. 

Day 7:
Still staying awake at night and sleeping throughout the day. Only woke up 3 times during my sleep and was not covered in sweat. Starting to get pimples on my face, probably because I'm eating so much more sugar now. I've basically replaced alcohol with food. Went to the gym today for the first time in a while..

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

So I did not have that drink. It helps that I don’t have any booze in the house. That was one mistake I made before. I had a bottle of the strongest drinking alcohol on the market that I was hiding, er, I mean ‘saving for emergencies’ when we might need to disinfect an injury or anesthetize someone. So of course I found it too easy to get into it. I soon finished it and eventually another bottle. (Like the others before, it was 153 Proof and about $23 USD.)

Firstly would like to say that I'm really appreciative to have communities like this to turn to.

Now down to business...

I suffer from GAD (Generalized anxiety disorder - AKA. anxious about everything, all the time) and depression for which I have been prescribed an SNRI to manage, which works... somewhat.

I've been what you could call a heavy drinker since about the age of 14 (The usual binge-drinking at parties but not daily drinking). Over the years since high school, I have slowly but steadily increased my intake, almost always in a social setting.

I am now 29/30 and have had a few negative seismic shifts in my life over the past 12 months that have resulted in me basically giving into to daily heavy intake.

I still get up and go to work, and do a good job, but I also drink at least 10-12 beers a night.  I dont drink hard liquor, but booze is booze.

I'm sure im the 1000000th post in this style, but anyone willing to weigh in and provide some assistance for how best to break this habit and live without the crutch would be so much appreciated.

Respect and thanks,

More diverse sober groups have been popping up, that are based on community and support without the religious undertones, that support all ages and genders (including stop drinking!)

Today I saw a Heineken commercial for a zero proof beer. That was the first time I’ve ever seen a broadcast spot dedicated to that!

I know that change is slow and these things are just small beacons in a world telling us to numb out, but it makes me feel hopeful. It’s making me feel like I’m not existing on the fringe of society, and that my lifestyle doesn’t have to be rooted in shame.

These are songs that I turn to when things get overwhelming. I’ve done that since I first heard them, over 30 years ago. They got a lot of play in early sobriety. I don’t turn to them out of desperation as much now. It’s more a deep sense of gratitude, and the soothing, calming, centering sense that I’ve acreted around them.

I feel the weight of my addiction hitting after the first big step I’ve taken since quitting...applying to a new job after quitting my last one (on good terms). 

But it’s a completely different route then my last, I only felt I needed to apply to this job because I wanted to feel happy and not overly stressed like I was at my last job. 

But when I went to turn in my application (which has nothing to do with the current job, but I did it anyway) the manager started questioning me about why I would switch from one job to another, and if I had any experience (yadda yadda) and I immediately took that as a criticism of my character and thought “maybe she already decided not to hire me! Maybe she’s right and I should just stay in my lane and not do this! She already hates me!”
And I almost talked myself out of it, almost. 
Then she asked to interview me tomorrow, and I’m feeling very unconfident and telling myself that I can just not take the job if I feel like it’s not right. 

Anyway, I’m feeling very unconfident in my abilities right now. I haven’t really taken any strong initiative in my life since quitting the drink, and I’m having mixed feelings about myself, and not having my crutch that I normally would during these decisions. 

UGH! I stress myself out over nothing. But I’m not used to actually sitting with these insecurities. Lord help me. IWNDWYT!",7

And I wasn’t just sitting in some stuffy room, I was also watching stargate, taking notes in a note pad, just random thoughts, and project ideas - I have projects now - and also scanning SD. Reading so many excellent stories, and efforts, and even getting to get my own shit out there and try to organize it a bit. Two fizzy waters in the process.

2020-01-29 21:45:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/evyc0w/another_30_day_celebration/,Another 30 Day Celebration,"Hi All,

Today is my 30th day of sobriety. I'm happy to read so many posts with this milestone today as well. I wanted to reflect on a couple things.

1) The coolest thing happened today. One of my goals for reaching 30 days was that once I hit this milestone, I was going to reach out to a friend of mine I know has gotten sober and tell him I was clean. I wanted to share this goal with him and it was a big motivation for me to stay sober. He lives thousands of miles away and we usually just keep up occasionally on FB. Out of the blue today, he sends me a text saying he was thinking of me. I teared up instantly because of all the days, he texted me on my 30th day sober, the day I was planning on reaching out to him. I told him about my sobriety and hearing him tell me he was proud of me is simply not a feeling I will soon forget. Now I have one more person in my corner supporting my sober journey. It was a magical moment for me.

2) From this Reddit group, I was added to a smaller group that we eventually moved to Discord that serves as a constant support group for me when I'm feeling low or tempted. There were a couple times I felt temptation but I would just jump on group chat and the other folks helped talk me through it. It's been great to have their support and accountability and it's been an amazing space in which I can be completely honest about my addiction, not just without judgement, but with people who truly know what I'm talking about and have been through. It's like a group of sponsors in my pocket all day, every day. I really recommend folks from this forum to make smaller chat groups where you can if you can make it work. For someone who never really clicked with AA, this has really been crucial, if not lifesaving in many ways.

3) I thought after 30 days I would shed my skin in a catastrophic molt, emerge a new woman, slimmer and more deadly in my clarity. I thought I would be more productive and infinitely successful. I thought the only thing holding me back from my goals was drinking. It has been disappointing in some ways to know that's not totally the case. I still procrastinate, I still fuck up. I am, perhaps, lazy, even without a hangover. It is likely that I've gained a pound this month. I'm getting to know myself and accepting these things, and trying to fight the urge to use them as reasons to say ""fuck it"" and keep drinking. The key to sobriety is honesty, not trying to paint everything as easy and perfect when they are not. Now that I don't have drinking as an excuse, I can see what parts are really me, both the disappointing and the exciting parts as well.

4) SLEEP IS SO GOOD WHAT HAVE I BEEN DOING THIS WHOLE TIME? My schedule was drink from 5-11PM, wake up 3AM, panic about impending professional, financial, and personal doom until 5AM, somewhat sleep until 7AM, then enter the world as a desiccated half-rested monster and white knuckle it through the day. I'd feel so anxious by the end of the day, the drinking seems absolutely, completely necessary to manage. I was terrified that when I got sober, I'd have to manage that anxiety with out alcohol. Amazingly, that anxiety is no longer here. Not like before. I sleep 8 hours a night. I feel relaxed at the end of the day, content I did my work and can relax with some dumb shit TV like The Bachelor. Sleep and anxiety have 100% been the biggest changes in my life. Looking back at how I was living, I am sure that has taken years off my life.

5) Thank you all for being here. I will not drink with you today. Ready for the next 30 days Alcohol Free.",12

(I kind of self medicate because of the state of the world, minor mental illness, etc) I also want to quit smoking which I usually only smoke one or two a day but have an addictive personality and it’s hard for me to not smoke two in a row or have like 10 in a night if I’m drinking a bit. I also want to save money by not spending it on alcohol. My relationship and job can be stressful too which also makes me want to drink a bit to take the edge off, but it’s hard for me to drink in moderation. Here is just some background I suppose, so let me know your thoughts and advice if you got any. I always thought oh just takes willpower but it’s a lot harder than I thought.

I love cooking. I have thought of going to culinary school. Last night I made a meal I would be proud to be served in a restaurant instead of something boxed or mediocre because I was drinking. 

I love hiking and working out. Tonight when I got home I grabbed the dogs and went on a brisk winter walk under the stars. 

I also have all of my bedding I the wash so I can have a cosy bed tonight. 

It feels good but I don't really want to do these things before I start, I want to drink.

So I am gonna fake it until i make it. Do the things that used to bring me joy until alcohol  is not my most omnipresent thought.

The difference is, I never made promises to my boyfriend that I would stop smoking. I just stopped, and let him know that I was stopping. Drinking, on the other hand - I used to swear up and down that I was moderating. I used to come home to him blackout drunk, puking up my guts, swearing I’d had two beers. 

When I quit drinking finally, my mindset was completely different from when i tried moderating. I was just DONE. But from an outside perspective, he couldn’t see that. And he was very cautious around me. Cautious to say I’d quit, cautious to congratulate me, cautious to believe I hadn’t had anything to drink. It hurt to see him so hesitant about my quitting drinking, but I know I deserve it 100%. 

Now, though, he’s so much more enthusiastic. He’s told me multiple times he’s really proud of me and happy for me. I think in the back of his mind he still thinks I’ll relapse, but I’m working on proving to both of us that I won’t. We’ve both seen how much happier and healthier I am sober and I KNOW this will stick. I think he’s coming to trust that it will too.",54

The urge to just drink them away has never been stronger in the week and a half I've been doing this. I'm sitting in my car outside the building just dreading my trip to the grocery store because I'll pass the wine aisle. How do you all do it? How do you just sit and ""stew"" in these feelings?

About a year ago I tried quitting but after the 3rd day I felt so bad, anxious and was sweating and restless the entire day. So much so, that I walked to the night shop which is 45 minutes away on foot, at 1 am. Just so I could buy a bottle of cheap whisky to down in one sitting. 

But today I’ve spend my day cleaning, baking bread, doing paperwork, play games... I was busy the entire day. And I haven’t thought about drinking or feeling any craving for it yet. My brother drank a glass of whisky after dinner but instead of pouring one for me too, I had a glass of water and a fag. 

Now I know that I still have a long way to go, and that this is just the beginning of a long and hard journey, but for the first time in a long while, I actually feel like I might be able to better myself. Finally. Maybe even repair the friendships I’ve broken in my 2 years of binge drinking. Who knows. 


I just wanted to get this of my chest and share it with you guys, if you have tips or anything, let me know. Thank you for reading.",22

I argued with myself but decided I could drink just enough that my buzz wouldn’t catch any side glances from her family at dinner. I pick up 2 pints of vodka, (one for now and one for later; yeah, right). I put a movie on, set an alarm and chug my drinks. I’m a binge drinker. 3 or 4 times a week recently. Everything in my life is amazing from the outside. Those past demons just need to be silenced and that is how I’ve done it. Chugging at 3 am on a Saturday. I blackout. Wake up the next morning with no recollection of the night before. Apparently, I had blocked my wife from leaving with my daughter when I was obviously drunk. My answer was, “wife is at the mother in laws, means I can drink with no responsibilities!” Each drink poured with self-loathing and the sting of the alcohol was covering the sting of hatred I had of myself for what I did. My 8 month old daughter was there, saw it, and I didn’t even remember it or care. 
I’m done. Done forever. I need to put my family first. I can’t keep the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde going without losing everything. I’m 3 days sober. Being a binge drinker, it’s hard to congratulate myself on days between drinking because that’s something I’ve always done but the days between binges had been dwindling. This is my first step.

2020-01-29 16:48:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/evtxm9/28_days_later/,28 Days Later,"This time I decided I’d drink all the alcohol and smoke all the cigarettes on New Year’s Eve so I could start off 2020 with that headachy, nauseated, anxiety-ridden hangover feeling and with the ashtray lungs that really motivate a good attempt to quit smoking. 

Figured I’d do a Dry January too to help solidify this most recent quit attempt. 

I’ve been smoking since I was 15. Just turned 40. Remember when I swore up and down that I’d quit smoking before I turned 25 cause smoking just wasn’t as attractive on “old people.”

Been drinking longer, although less regularly. First time I remember getting a buzz I was in 2nd grade. My older cousin and I mixed some blush wine with Coke at my First Communion party and spent the afternoon giggling in the woods behind my house and trying, unsuccessfully, to climb trees.

Throughout my childhood my parents were the types to give me sips of their wine and cognac while also regaling me with stories about the abusive alcoholic grandfather that drank himself to death before I was born. I’m sure they were doing their best and trying to give me a more European introduction to drinking—do it in moderation, with the family. Drink the nice shit. Enjoy the taste. Be wary. Don’t just hold your nose and funnel it down until you black out. 

When my parents split up my mom tried to win my affection by being the kind of mom who prefers it when your friends come over to drink and smoke weed in YOUR basement cause at least she knows where you are and can keep an eye on you. 

When I wasn’t invited to senior prom she went out and bought me and another romantically unlucky friend a pint of vodka to split to drown our sorrows. She also kept me in cartons cigarettes although I knew she’d have preferred it if I didn’t smoke. 

I loved drinking and smoking. FINALLY, something to do with my hands that looked cooler than that period when I wandered around awkwardly figuring out yo-yo tricks or trying to juggle. Drinks gave me the courage to walk up to people and ask them the really deep burning questions tumbling around in my teenage mind (“What do you think about God?” “What if we are all just an alien’s science experiment?”)

People were so NICE to me when I was drunk. 

Like that time after that one boy mixed me Mountain Dew and 151 proof vodka and put extra sugar in so I wouldn’t be able to taste how much vodka was in it it, everyone was so kind when I started throwing up all over the bathroom. So understanding. 

Like that time my aunt and uncle invited me to their house across the country and gave me scotch at happy hour and made sure my wine glass was full at dinner and made sure to reassure me when I expressed an adolescent fear that my awkward phase was going to result in permanent unattractiveness. “I find you sexually attractive,” my uncle told me. I didn’t black out for the first time on that trip, but it was one of the first times. 

And all this makes it seem like alcohol was poured into me. But I did the majority of the pouring myself. So many dirty martini’s at Thanksgiving that I cursed at my mom in front of the whole drunk-ass family. Waking up from a night of white Russians not knowing how my ex-boyfriend ended up in my bed. Bar crawling with craft beers and convincing myself my Uber driver was trying to kidnap me and jumping out of a moving car. Falling over my cats and cracking my head on my kitchen countertop cause it made more sense to keep the bourbon from spilling than protecting my cranium. 

I’ve made an ass of myself and cried at weddings. I’ve made myself vulnerable and have been assaulted in bars. I’ve alienated lifelong friendships. I’ve fallen asleep with the front door wide open. 

I’m honestly very thankful and kind of amazed that I’m still alive. 

And it’s almost been the whole month this time since I’ve had a drink. And I’m thinking that…MAYBE drinking isn’t really doing a whole lot for me. 

But it’s scary. And even after writing this out and looking back at this bewildering shitstorm I’m still finding it hard to admit that I might be an alcoholic. 

Drinking’s been so much of my life that it’s hard to figure out how to organize myself without it. 

I mean, it’s great waking up and not having to fake my way around blank patches in my memory or, worse, having to ask someone if I was a “liability” or not the night before. 

But…having to face my life without that breezy sense of release that drinks 1-4 have? 

I don’t know if I ever developed a way to relax that didn’t involve booze and a smoke or 20. 

I hope I can. 

I guess no one really has to commit to “I’ll ever drink again. EVER.” But it does seem worthwhile for me to spend some time trying to develop some other ways to be a human. So I guess I might try another month and see how it goes? Fingers crossed.",10

It's been a long time coming. I've successfully worked steps 1 and 2 with a friend in recovery but, I'm still sponsorless. I really want this- sobriety that is. As the days go by I'm realizing more and more exactly how fucked I am mentally. It's going on 3 weeks of suffering mostly in silence. I have no desire to drink. I go to meetings, say a friendly hi, introduce myself, listen intently to others (listening twice as much as I talk), get a few numbers here and there, made a few attempts to open up to others, and I'm still coming up short. My first attempt at a sponsor decided to indirectly inform me during her lead that she doesn't sponsor people, after she very clearly told me she would sponsor me. 

Today, my addiction counselor asked me when I'll drink again. I was shocked. Of course, I told her I have no intention nor desire to drink, in fact I'm terrified of the thought. She is in recovery; I think something like 12 years or more. She told me yet again that I will with out a doubt relapse if I dont hurry and get a sponsor. I told her, I honestly have not found that person who has what I want, on top of the fact that I have not built a report with any of these people enough, to even want to ask them to sponsor me. So, the pressure to get a sponsor is back. I'm a little hurt. I already feel like a failure. Last thing I need is to be told I'm gonna fail regardless.

For whatever reason, people new in recovery or just coming back with a short amount of time are the ones I seem to attract. I'm not the most outgoing, heavily guarded for fear of rejection and abandonment. I really want to work steps, to have a sponsor, to be fulfilled by the program and have a sense of belonging in the fellowship. I'm socially awkward when I dont know people. I lack the skill to just walk up to random people and start making or engaging in conversation. I feel out of place. I've always kind of been a wallflower of sorts. It's a part of myself that I truly dislike.

My mental health is ultimately what's suffering. I force myself to smile, to be happy, to fulfill my responsibilities for the day. My kids and my husband need and deserve a mother and wife that is physically, mentally, and emotionally available to them. My friends and the rest of my family need and deserve a fully functioning person in their lives. I do my best to not dwell on things of the past that cannot be changed nor altered. I aim everyday to not wallow in self-pity, to just push forward and stay positive. To see the positive even in the most negative of situations. I read my devotionals and pray every morning yet, still my mind is a gray cloud of muck. It's a chore in itself to even get out of bed most days. I just feel like shit. 

I've scheduled a mental health assessment for next week. During my substance abuse assessment I was diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety, depression but, I obviously need a more comprehensive diagnosis and possibly some change in medication. 

I haven't lost hope in my recovery, yet. Nor, do I want to. However, I really feel like I'm about to lose it and have a mental breakdown. I've worked way too hard and have come to far to be doubted or to feel doubted.",5

Right now I'm stuck thinking about last year. Ranting about it in words helps, and I'm posting here because it makes me feel less alone. I'm angry, and I'm used to drinking that anger away (or drinking it into an explosion). By far the hardest thing about being sober for me has been experiencing emotions - just experiencing them, not acting on them, and letting them pass. It feels like it takes forever for them to pass, and I haven't always succeeded at not acting on them, but I really have tried. I have to type long angry messages in my notes instead of sending them to anyone, and basically put myself in time out to sulk until I don't want to act on anything anymore.

I feel bad right now, but less angry than I did when I started typing this. Typing has abated the urge to drink a bit, and now I'm going to go find a cat to bother and drink some water instead. IWNDWYT.",4

At first I was feeling like I had found a permanent group because it was my second visit at that particular location and everyone seemed warm and I was starting to feel comfortable. 
After the meeting the chairperson pulled me aside and said was essential to be in a meeting every single day. I told her that with my schedule and transportation I could only attend two days a week. She responded by saying that it was certain I  was going to relapse and that I wasn’t serious about the program. It was such an awkward interaction in general and I tried my best just to listen and not argue. 
This was my second time meeting this person and the first was nothing more than a quick introduction. Just sharing in those first few meetings was really difficult for me and now I’m feeling extremely rejected and just overwhelmed in general.

Yesterday I spoke with some people about readiness for change. Hanging onto the side of the wall. Preparing to let go. Being ready for what you don’t know. Sometimes there’s fear. Sometimes its comfort. But whatever it is you’re searching for, know that it’s possible. Whatever you have to give that day is enough.  Just show up for yourself. Just one day at a time. But show up for yourself. 

There’s no perfect route to change.
 Think about your reasons on why you want it. What’s important to you is EVERYTHING. So if you really value it and you’re ready to let go, just start swimming. You’ll find your rhythm soon. Remember why you decided to get in the water in the first place.  

Hope this helps

2020-01-29 14:16:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/evrk10/how_to_stay_stopped/,How to stay stopped.,"Hi all. This is my first post. I’ve been trying to stop drinking since July 2014. It had become a major problem in my life, affecting my relationship with my partner, my kids, work, friendships, finances and my mental and physical health.   
I’ve managed a few sober streaks since then and currently have not had a drink since 23 Dec 2018, so just over 400 days. I find stopping quite easy as I am brimming with motivation and determination to succeed. I’m also usually haunted by the impacts of the last binge that chucked me off the wagon. 

The problem is staying stopped. When the early enthusiasm starts to dissipate I start to crave again. I dream of a cold pint after work on a Friday. Fantasise about a glass of warming red on a winter‘s night. Romanticise a sparkling G&T at a party. Sobriety gets boring. My resolve starts to evaporate. I don’t cave in instantly, it can be a slow descent but eventually I give in and sneak a drink. Trying to do it on the sly as I’m pretty much on my last warning with everyone I love.

Does anyone have any tips on how to guard against this cycle happening again? Christmas was hard and I've been thinking of drinking a lot since then. If I’m not careful I’ll be back on it before the spring comes.  I’m proud of my 400 odd days and I really, really don’t want to start again. Thanks.",10

Yesterday I cried to myself in bed for about an hour because all I wanted to do was drink. But all I wanted to do was not drink also. It was a stressful day, but nothing more than normal. Rowdy kids, stress at work, financial strain - the typical gamut of things I drink about when the sun goes down (or before, depending on the day).

Then suddenly I remembered how many times I drove around drunk. Then I thought about all the people that have endured the pain of losing a loved one to drunk drivers. I got sick to my stomach and had a borderline panic attack.  I know I should feel ""lucky"" that I didn't get a DUI or hurt anyone, but how much harm have I caused society by bowing down to booze and not the the value of life? How much of a negative impact have I made my displaying apathy toward drunk driving in front of other people, even my siblings at one point? I feel like a horrible person so much of the time, and as disturbing as it sounds, that triggers me to drink. 

At my worst I feel like my whole life will be a karmic punishment for being so shitty.

Today is technically day 32 for me, and every time I tried to hop on this bandwagon last year I fell off on it by Day 31. Something about going thirty days felt like “I deserve a treat,” but a treat quickly turned into a trick and before I knew it I was back to half a bottle of vodka a day or worse.

This time feels different. I’ve been slowly making my way through This Naked Mind and that has helped infinitely. All of my friends and family are also aware I’m on Whole 30 for a couple more weeks, so that’s driving my accountability to keep pushing past day 30.

There’s definitely been plenty of temptations. Work parties, New Years, other social events. My SO is already talking up how we’ll be off Whole 30 by Valentine’s Day and can have wine to celebrate, but I already told him I’m planning on keeping this up for my health. I’m more productive at work, hitting the gym, and generally have a much clearer head. “But you can just have one glass!” Nope, I really can’t, and sooner or later we’re going to need to address that he can be one of my biggest enablers. I love him and he’s been supportive when I talk about quitting, but sometimes I think he misses his drinking buddy or just forgets and offers something like buying a beer at a basketball game. Between the two of us, we were killing a box of Franzia about every two days for longer than I care to admit.

Boredom has probably been my biggest trigger, but I’m trying to find ways to keep myself active and busy. If I’m alone on a week night just trying to fill the time between work ending and sleep, it’s incredibly tempting to have a drink to relax and to care less that I’m just watching the same shows on Netflix over and over. Trying to rebuild hobbies is a challenge, but it’s getting better. Any suggestions for how to meet sober friends outside of meetings would be much appreciated :) I’ve joined some fitness classes but I struggle with talking to other people, especially when I’m doused in sweat and getting my lungs back from years of sitting on the couch working out nothing but my poorly abused taste buds.

He was sitting there with a water, the waitress came by and I also ordered a water.  She said something like ""waters for now, Ok"".  I'm guessing my buddy had mentioned we'd be definitely ordering beers later on.  She came back and said ok how about those beers now (Or something to the like)?  And I said ""I'm good with water"", and he  sheepishly declined as well.   I told him how I""d been sober since right before Christmas, and turns out he was also trying to stop as well.

When I'm sober I don't smoke cigarettes or weed. I won't touch coke. I drink lots of water and tea and I exercise dailey.

When I'm sober I work on my hobbies. I enjoy spending time with my family and being the father I know I am.

On Sunday night my 10 year old son had a meltdown. He was feeling a bit under the weather, melancholy, and didn't sleep well. Monday morning I woke him up for school and he was exhausted. He fell asleep eating breakfast and when I woke him, he started crying - unusual for him. I told him to go back to bed, and I worked from home so that he could rest. He didn't do much, laid around and watched tv and read books. The next day he was ready to go, and I wrote an excuse note for his teacher letting her know that he needed a mental health moment. 

She emailed me this morning telling me that his absence will be unexcused, and that he is only allowed 3 of these before he's kicked from the academically gifted program. I simply replied that this is perfectly fine by me... ""teaching my son self care and allowing him to take a moment, as rare as it is for him, reflects my core values as a parent. Feel free to mark it in your system as unexcused, but I encourage the school to make changes to a policy that doesn't allow children a break when they are in need of it. As adults, we have PTO and vacation days. As children, I guess we get unexcused absences.""

My thoughts on this... as an adolescent my parents pushed me very hard, and I was never good enough for them. I got my doctoral at an Ivy League school in the top of my class, and my father didn't even attend my graduation. I felt tremendous pressure my entire life to be perfect... I developed an unhealthy relationship with food, drank myself into oblivion, and did it all while ""high functioning"" because asking for help would've been out of the question. In a desperate and depressed need to find control, I spiraled into a drunk with very little of that. I'm not blaming my parents for the choices I made, but I am aware of how this affected my stability. 

I refuse to put my son through this. I want him to respect his body, push himself to succeed and be great. I want him to accomplish his goals with work ethic and integrity. Grit. But I also want him to know that it's okay to take the moment you need, your sanity matters, loving yourself is important, and mommy is here to support you  - and your spirit. 

No one supported my spirit growing up, and my mental health was deeply affected by this. So today, my son got an unexcused absence and I broke the cycle of emotional and mental abuse in my family unit. I'll take that.

5-6 years ago alcohol took me to jail and to rehab. There were countless AA meetings. The girl I’d been with for 8 years kicked me out, and our relationship crumbled. A large part of that failed relationship was the result of my drinking. 

However, now I’m engaged to be married to a beautiful woman who’s the love of my life. I have so much to live for. But on the 20th she found out I’d been lying to her for months and drinking hard liquor behind her back. She knew something was up but found out on the 20th. She hates when I drink liquor, and knows all about my past problems with alcohol. She thought I was drinking beer and wine only but she found empty mini bottles of Jim beam hidden in the closet. 

Anyways I thought my engagement was going to be called off, and that I’d destroy another relationship as a result of my drinking. 

Thank fucking god this did not happen. This was a new emotional low point in my life. I have not had a drink since 1/19. I do not crave alcohol and I am not tempted. I feel like the urge to drink has been removed from me due to the fear and sadness of losing my fiancé. I’ve heard a bottom defined as the point where the next thing we’re about to lose as a result of drinking is more important to us than drinking. According to this definition, I hit rock bottom again. 

We are going to be married at the end of February. I am so excited and happy. This is the best time of my life. I cannot ruin this because of alcohol. Alcohol has cost me so much and is a huge black spot on my life. I need to stop drinking not only for myself, but also for my soon to be wife so we can have a long and happy union. 

Alcohol turns me into a person I hate. A lying, deceptive cynic. This is not the person I truly am. The benefits of drinking alcohol are an illusion. The momentary relief and comfort I feel after drinking is not worth losing the love of my life, and not worth sacrificing my values and integrity.",15

I know alcohol has sugar in it but I figured if I mixed my shots of rum with coke zero I'd at least be ""alcoholic-ing"" somewhat healthy (stupid I know.) Cut to this past week my parents came to visit me and my gf at the farm, the night before I told myself that that would be the last bottle I drank for awhile. Woke up the next morning and went to feed the cows with my dad when I got the worst dizzy spell of my life. It felt like someone rolled dice with my eyeballs, and I started dry heaving both of which lasted the whole day. My dad told me it could be my blood sugar seeing our familys history and the fact that he has diabetes.

I felt sooooo stupid, I knew what I was doing was wrong, I knew my higher chance at the beetus because of my genetics yet I still drank. The next day I went to the Dr and knew on the way there that that would be the last time I would be diabetes ""free.""


I get to the Dr he runs some tests and to my surprise my blood sugar levels are normal! But what isn't normal are my triglicerides which are double what they should be and the cause of my dizziness and dry heaving. So my Dr told me if I lost weight and changed my diet around they would lower to a normal range,

I got some pills for the dizziness and some pills to lower my triglicerides and here I am 8 days later, 8 days sober and 3 lbs lighter. I was given a chance, and I need to take advantage of it. I nearly wrecked myself before I could check myself.",12

I spent the last couple of months trying to taper down - partly because I was worried about withdrawal and partly as an excuse not to stop, to be honest.

But I managed to only have four last night, which means I can have two tonight and zero tomorrow. And I don't have an excuse not to.

In the end, the real problem is alcohol is everything I want. I'm 28 and have hardly progressed in life at all, and that's partly because I could always just look forward to surviving another day and drinking in the evening. I can't imagine anything like the peace I feel when I've had a few.

I know a lot of alcoholics would scoff at five to seven drinks being a problem, but the money is another big factor. It's expensive in my location - the best you can do is the equivalent of $2.78 USD for 17oz of 10% abv. That's $2029 a year or $169 a month and I'm in no position to afford that. Not to mention that wanting ""just one more pint"" leads to going to the bar when the liquor store is closed, which is expensive as hell.

The battle I'm having is over whether I can afford to have one can a night. Maybe I could just keep it there and occasionally have a 7% can as well as a treat. But I guess I know that's an excuse.

Lyrics:


I tried to talk to my piano
I tried to talk to my guitar
Talk to my imagination
Confided into alcohol
I tried and tried and tried some more
Told secrets 'til my voice was sore
Tired of empty conversation
'Cause no one hears me anymore

A hundred million stories
And a hundred million songs
I feel stupid when I sing
Nobody's listening to me
Nobody's listening
I talk to shooting stars
But they always get it wrong
I feel stupid when I pray
So, why am I praying anyway?
If nobody's listening

Anyone, please send me anyone
Lord, is there anyone?
I need someone, oh
Anyone, please send me anyone
Lord, is there anyone?
I need someone

I used to crave the world's attention
I think I cried too many times
I just need some more affection
Anything to get me by

A hundred million stories
And a hundred million songs
I feel stupid when I sing
Nobody's listening to me
Nobody's listening
I talk to shooting stars
But they always get it wrong
I feel stupid when I pray
Why the fuck am I praying anyway?
If nobody's listening

Anyone, please send me anyone
Lord, is there anyone?
I need someone, oh
Anyone, please send me anyone
Oh, Lord, is there anyone?
I need someone
Oh, anyone, I need anyone
Oh, anyone, I need someone

A hundred million stories
And a hundred million songs
I feel stupid when I sing
Nobody's listening to me
Nobody's listening",6

Honestly. There's a lot of little quips and phrases in the recovery community that those new to it will quickly find out. This one never made much sense to me, because what's a miracle anyways? Well, they do exist.

I was a problematic drinker for many years. Like most people, I also had some really great years where I'd get shitfaced, would have a blast, wouldn't piss people off, would meet awesome people, and had literally zero repercussions or at least any that would come close to making me even consider quitting. But like most everyone here, that didn't last, and then I had years of both good and bad nights, then good and bad days, and then the majority of days and nights were just bad until I hit bottom and had no choice but to tap out and surrender to giving it up.

I had several starts and stops where I tried to moderate or quit on my own and it never stuck. I then decided when I was doing really bad and I was losing friends and relationships that I better get serious. I secretly went abroad to rehab where almost everyone thought I was going on vacation.

It was pretty tough at first. My whole life had changed, my old places I went to and some of my fellow alcoholic friends had to go. I had to find ways to spend my time as drinking became my hobby. I had to get new activities and reactivate old ones. The first six months were completely upside down.

I ended up finding community through Refuge Recovery, began to meditate, learned mindfulness techniques, and got interested in Buddhism and learning who I was at my core and things began to get better.

After around 9 months or so things got MUCH easier. I no longer felt that drinking might be a decent option, I looked better, felt better, and was overall much happier.

But what's the miracle? First, I was able to repair a really poor relationship with my mom. That's something I never expected. She quit drinking about 2 years before I did, and with us both sober we found out that we actually liked each other. But the most major miracle is that I am now in an awesome loving relationship that I know I won't destroy through my drinking. I can't believe it.

So for those that are new to it, I can only recommend that you do whatever it takes to stay sober. It sucks so bad at first, I know. But it doesn't stay hard forever. Healthy choices and taking care of yourself will pay off.

Another cliche I hated in recovery was this thing called, ""the grateful alcoholic,"" meaning that people didn't live in regret of their past because without it they wouldn't be where they were now. They were grateful they went through the shit. I finally get it. Because I'm so stoked where I'm at now, I also wouldn't change my past. I'm in the best place I've ever been and can now look on my past and while I'm not proud of my behavior, I understand where it came from.

Best of luck to everyone who's walking the path.

I have general anxiety and am feeling generally overwhelmed in life, and started seeing a therapist about a month ago despite years of telling myself that I can handle my own problems and that its too expensive. Frankly, it is still fretfully expensive but its been one of the best decisions I've made. When I was looking for someone, I was looking for someone that could help with general life transitions/anxiety, but was also looking for someone with addiction experience.

&#x200B;

I've met with her a few times and discussed the fears of living in a new place, starting a new job after leaving one I loved, moving from my mother's house to my husband's house, etc. But yesterday I finally opened up about my drinking which I've known for years has been at the root of all of the problems that nag at me everyday. Like, what is it about being too ashamed to even bring this up with a professional? Its scary to see how deep the hooks of alcohol are in me, and its daunting to think of a day when that's no longer the case. But, I'm seeing that the first step for me this time around is honesty.

&#x200B;

I've tried freeing myself of drinking before, but honesty is what is making it different this time. I'm seeing that I'm actually becoming honest with myself about it. When my therapist asked if anything in particular brought on this decision to stop, I realized...not really. I got a little more than my ""regular"" drunk a few nights ago and just broke down after months of thinking ""this isn't sustainable and I don't even want to be doing it"". I think I hit a tipping point with myself that's allowed me to be honest with my husband for the first time about this- as well as my paid professional! Its a baby step, but I need to accept the responsibility to THINK honestly for MYSELF. It has to start with myself, and I'm grateful to finally have the support to get through this on the homefront- and here too. :)",5

But non-drinkers or ""casual"" drinkers don't know how big a deal that is to us. I can't even remember the last time i went a single weekend without drinking... And it's already been FOUR weekends.     
I'm a casual heavy metal musician, and i have about 4 or 5 gigs a year, plus, rehearsals every couple of weeks where there's usually heavy drinking... I've already been through a couple of rehearsal sessions without giving in, no big deal, and this saturday is the first of those gigs. I'm sure i can make it... I think i can have a beer or two, but then i'd just lose my streak, so i'm just not gonna drink at all. Wish me luck. The best for you all as well.  IWNDWYT",1440

I played it cool. I actually met him through my sponsor, and although he’s not aware I’m doing recovery work I think down the line it would be safe to talk about.

He was open to hiring me at the same rate I’m at now, even though its pretty high for an apprentice.

Yesterday I received a call from my friends wife, who was my ex-boss that I worked for over 12 years. She had asked me to go their house and check on him because he was not answering her calls or texts. I said sure thing, since they live 2 blocks away.

I get to the house and pound on the front door and no answer, I then go around to the back door and everything is locked and pound on the glass door and only see the two dogs, as I look around the house and look in the bathroom I see my friends legs and he is not moving, I then called 911 in panic mode, they came and we broke the dog door to get in the house. It was to late my friend had passed.  It was the 2nd shock of my life, my 1st was loosing my son. But finding my friends body was worse, after dealing with the fire, police and EMT, his wife shows up.

I had to tell her that her husband was gone and her reaction was obvious. In a way I'm glad that I found him then his wife. Our Friends then showed up for support and after the funeral home came and took his body and everyone still in shock a friend grabbed the bottle of Jack Daniels and several shot glasses and I had just one small shot because I was a nervous wreck and needed it.

It was just one. I have been very strong up to this point and I will reset my badge and start over.

Thank you all, this it sub has helped a lot.

I will not drink with you today.",38

I'm 31 years old and been drinking, or around alcohol since I turned 13 years old! Actually my first drink was when I was nine! luckily I did not like the taste at that time. I believe there's two types of an Alcoholics, the one who goes off the rails and do a Marathon drinking session and the one I believe fits me. I'm the weekend warrior, can basically go without drinking Mon-Thu and live a pretty healthy lifestyle, workout, eat healthy stuff etc. Then the weekend starts and it completely different. I literary daydream about Friday night and hitting the bars and hang out ""drink"" with buddies and friends. 

I have a good job, great team at work and I manage to separate my private life and work life pretty well, never got to work drunk always on time, however too many occasions had to call in sick due to sudden illness , which everyone knows it's just excuse for Hungover. To be honest for all these years I was fine with that, the injuries, the shame the unknown of what had happened. 

All changed 2 years ago when I met the most amazing woman I could ever dreamed of love of my life thru and thru. At the beginning was great. drunk on love so to speak, I managed quite well to cut back on going out and partying, opting to spend more time with her, vacations together, meeting her family ect. Well I cannot say that for the last year though, I've been steadily going back to my old habits week by week, month by month. 

Making plans with her and then passing out in my apartment without sign of life for whole day.

Getting drunk in front of her family and embarrassing the shit out of her.

Hide booze, lie about booze, sneaking booze under the table during dinner you name it i did it all. 

Last weekend something happened, that stuck out and I got scared! and scared pretty bad. 

After night of boozing as usual when I was by myself (my GF was visiting her parents at that time) I called her middle of the night and basically called her all kinds of names, started spilling my guts that I'm actually jealous of her recent promotion and how many great friends she has and so on and so on. I on the other hand got promotion as well few month back but although with more money I was moved to different sector and practically different team in which I knew no one and had a pretty rough time getting settled in the new position. 

Well after the phone call I apologized as usual and made fake promises of change. but this time it felt different, she wasn't mad she wasn't screaming or yelling. she just brushed her shoulder and said whatever I dont care anymore, and she looked at me like a complete stranger! I've never seen this look in her before. It scared the shit out of me! 

I decided then and there enough is enough, time to quit my bullshit and man up. I told her my plan, I explained to her what I intend to do and who will help me with it. I booked a visit with a addiction specialist and Psychiatrist (thank god my insurance covers both). 

I quit eating meat over a year ago and it was effortless I was surprised how easy it was to give up one thing that was so essential in my life (amature bodybuilder here) but when I just think of giving up alcohol it turns my stomach and makes me physically sick to even consider it. It's been a part of my life for so long and who I am. I will have to change my life from the ground up! find new hobbies , get rid of whole bunch of toxic friends, it will be hard but I cannot lose her! that I'm sure of.

It's day 2 and I'm scared to the bones.

I know that’s not true, that scenario for me does not exist. I think what’s happening is that I’m grieving the loss of alcohol and steeped in the bargaining phase. I have not allowed myself to grieve, I’m not sure I know how. I only know how to distract and numb. Great tools, mind you, but they will only take me so far. 

Any advice on how to grieve the loss of alcohol? For me, personally, I know this is key to staying sober.

I'm just now realising that 'socialising' was a euphemism for drinking. A few months ago I found myself in a hole of payday loans. I was going through a hard time and drinking a lot. Spending massive amounts on it. I told myself (and other people) that it was because I was living alone and having a hard time - what do you expect me to do, stay in by myself and be miserable?! I need to see my friends! Realistically, there was a multitude of other things I could have done to hang out with my friends, which would have been free/cost little. The drinking was the important bit.

I thought I couldn't go for a couple of days without seeing friends. I would feel really low and lonely. Now that I'm not drinking, I can see that it was actually an itch to drink (I had a rule against drinking alone, that would make me an 'alcoholic'). Now I'm not drinking I'm happy to spend days on end alone. Drinking was the important bit.

Even when I would hang out with people, I was never truly present. I couldnt remember my evenings. Now I spend real quality time with people. I'm a better listener. Now I'm not drinking I can see that I used people as an excuse to drink. If they were having one that would be reason enough for me to have 5. I'm shocked now at how little the people around me actually drink in comparison. I would be totally shitfaced while they were nursing a second drink. I was transparent and looked like a twat and I didn't care, cause drinking was the important bit.",6

Sometimes my thoughts scare me cuz the world seems so unfair to me It's good my dad was a fairy (true kerry the fairy) cuz he was just as nuts as me but better at kicking butts physically . He's now in heaven nothing like 711 i forget how long he was drug and booze free(all my life)  He now inspires me .  Now my mentalitity is challenging because my natural look currently is scouring maybe to some overpowering and I can't seem to let my truth out for I wanna fucking scream and shout I'm free oh wow but damn I gotta feel . Damn I miss beers n buds with my buds and bro's and OMG do I wanna go make sweet love with awesome women I refuse to say that 3 letter word but you can guess that rhyme. Anxiety I never ever ever had it b4 and now It's trying to handicapp my score I gotta stay LION and ROAR * hanging with cats who meow weekly and blah blah blah meekly creates energy so I choose to act weakly. Freaky occurrences occur very randomly with me sometimes swiftly I search for progress not perfection to carry me through my mental obsession . Yes of coarse I may battle depression but not currently in this Poetry session .  The experience of brother JIMMI plus the alchemy of Paolo with a little bit of Irish luck got me feeling like what the fuck and the flows comes and goes depending on how much oxygen I take up my nose when I rise the scores froze and when I flys all naturally untethered other birds become unfeathered. My minds animalistic canabilistic simply simplistic maybe a·rith·me·ticisticly purely empatheticly physically diabetic 😉but I'm not trying to eat other mental meat= I don't trust fools or random uneducated strangers . (wonderful people who try to fill my head up with bologna soup or McDonald's delicious food ) that shit's usually way to simply sweet and I struggle to conform with the blind and uninformed I don't wanna dance with horses when I feel uniformed. Not trying to be corny that's for mice and men (book I didn't like) if I talk bout my education I may do it all again . It's hard for me to trust who I can speak my peace with . Most look at me like a Cyclops (I'm a normal handsome man I look like I could be some famous actors cousin actually 🤣😂) because my big eyes are wide open I wonder if It's like this for all when they stop doping . I don't wanna touch the poison and so far I've been real good but damn It's hard in this old Birchwood <-------(Name of the place i grew up )The happy times were many the high times were great and surely I'll figure out aWay to let the horse run from the gate I'm not about racing but sometimes It's fun to run . My body gets electrified(I get excited it feels good to speak freely ) when I currently write like this I wonder where the energy's from maybe Mr Tesla or the OG RAM DAS maybe God's gifted me with blessings or this liguistic poetry/journaling is simply self created to get me out of self with my words I'll never be some dusty book upon a shelf.  I'm planning on continuing my education to become an Author.  I don't wanna be like Santa or some doofy Christmas elf I'm not trying to put my words to use to increase my poor ass I have Zero $ wealth but they owe me a paycheck😉 I'm currently afraid to admit I struggle with mental health. I forget almost everything once I put it down then I'm walking in circles and It's nowhere to be found . I swear I'd lose my feet if they weren't attached and on the ground . I promise I know I'm sure I'm not to lost to be found . I wish I new somebody to help me amplify my sound .

Real simple truth = early childhood trauma +++++ I can't or won't speak about it here .  I became a loud extrovert with a vivid immiganiation and an inherited gift of story telling maybe inherited from my gifted grandpa who loved to  tell me bedtime storys .  Oh no may parents divorced wah wah wah😉🤣😂👍 I understand it completely now at age 38 but in my third year of elementary school i may have started misbehaving and it effected or affected me negatively life goes on  5th grade summer after DARE class sweet Mary Jane where you educated with  a drug roller coaster video what kid wouldn't wanna try a roller coaster ?  I found my first true love. (Weed or wine ) Hmmmm middle school was great I was a class clown who got lot's of write ups I'll never forget the day the principal tossed me out of an assembly everyone laughed .  That principal was all about his recipe for success.   Years later I was a CHEF and I worked for some BAD ASS CIA chef's too.  Then some other super cala un-fragile realistic great chef's when I gave college a try at age 23.  Oh yeah high school I graduated I was nice to most of my teachers I worked at the best restraunt around for most of my high school career .  I even missed senior Prom because I chose to go to work .  I partyed much in high school and was accepted into that great cooking school the CIA in Hyde Park during my JR year so senior year I didn't care about school work . I had a shadow day at that college it was fun . Oh yeah by this point in life I was in the hospital 3 times because if you party to much .......... these things happen .  I may or may not have used my college $$$ on a rehab .  My first rehab was state run and I learned how to I don't even remember I did read some books called conversations with God all 3 of them .  I also got beat up by the biggest boy in the place after he called me a lil bitch while playing hacky sack outside I punched him in the face he knocked me out a few times TKO he was going to stomp on me too but some GREAT Philly boys had my back thanks Eric  and Larry I helped one read letters in english and treated them both  like we were brothers. I looked up to then because they were bigger stronger tougher harder and mire bad ass then me .Philly slang calling everybody young bull the Philly kids surely were I was just a country bumpkin from the sticks. (age 13-15) I went to another place like that at 17 with a fake mental health diagnosis .  I have since learned It's almost impossible for a shrink to diagnose someone coming out of a drug induced psychosis.  Psyche meds rocked my head and may have taken 3 prime years of my youth.   The Dr's were only trying to do the best they could let's Depakote him heavy walking zoomby status 😂🤣✊ I had no idea what was you going on most of the time but I listened to my mother more .  My father felt sad he list his son to a pill pushing Dr (Much like a medical drug dealer.)  I'll never forget the mantra from that psyche ward = I'm here get-ting bet-ter.  I also wouldn't stop doing push ups one night because I was terrified I would die so this kind large man decided to attempt to wrestle me and choke me I may have body slammed him then ran behind the nurses station and dialed 911 then a Kind large police man restrained me and he was also choking me quite severely untill I took of his watch and threatened to break it and then a nurse or whomever  needled me in the butt and strapped me to a bed .  I didn't like it in the hospital .  I also may have ripped open a locked door because a nice young friend of mine kept screaming for help she was terrified so they locked her in a room to scream untill she was tired of screaming .  I was a pretty strong country boy I wrestled from ages 5-13 and played youth sports too.  I loved football! Out of the hospital on to a plane to a fancy pants rehab in Tenaseee.  Oh yeah to get to the hospital I smoked weed with wet or dust or whatever that shit was (very bad) for a week or so and WOW shit was bad .  I stopped using everything and had my uncle and his friend take me to my fathers home .  In the car on the way their I wanted to jump out the moving car. I had so much drug induced psychosis or something  I was raking leaves in my backyard naked .  This was in Nj with a regular neighborhood you know sidewalks and all that .  I was off the stuff for a few days but I was umm going through drug withdrawl somekinda heavily . @ the rehab in tennisee We got to go see films and bowling and all the teenagers got to go fuck in the woods at night .  I was a prude so I didn't .   I did get to go to a big convention at the 4 seasons and tasted warm bacon raspberry vinaigrette that salad dressing helped inspire me to become a CHEF.  My councilors were cool there everyone was nice I couldn't accept the fact that I was an Alcholic/Addict in my teenage mind I was just like all my friends I just went a lot harder then they did.  We all did the same stuff I may have sometimes partied more then them because umm I LOVED PARTYING.  I got out and got clean for a while life was always much better not drinking or drugging and I always felt unacceptable/hated/ not part off even when I was the center of attention . I'm going to stop journaling now like my therapist suggested. and call a bro who has the same problem as me and you but he has a little less consecutive days in a row off Booze or Whatever.  I currently have almost 4 months off drugs and alcohol I'm not going to count the medical relapses when Dr's forced me to take pills after sticking Needles in me to sedate me I was angry and ajitated due to the fact that I was treated not like an American citizen untill I called my Emergency Contact then all of a sudden the hospital employees started to treat me with respect .  Maybe If I wasn't treated like a POS but treated with kindness love and compassion I wouldn't have felt like I was in a jail or a kindergarten for developmentally disabled children .  Sock puppets all the nurses talked like they had sock puppets for hands and that's also what my very strange guidance councillor Had in kindergarden do-so the dolphin .  He made all the children uncomfortable with his strange ways I remember that.   He was also the wonderful man who tested me to see if I was a genius I do remember failing that test on purpose the test became boring .   He also tried to help me cope with my family's divorce so the school choose to segregate the children from divorced homes and makes us talk about stuff wow talk about adding more levels of uncomfortability but we got ICE CREAM after we were forced to talk about our family problems with other children. Thanks educational system I wonder if things like this still occur or is our educational system better in 2020 I HOPE SO. I wonder if these elementary school life events helped me or hindered me 😂🤣 I can't even worry about silly stuff like the past. ",3

I know that it'll all blow over soon but, right now I could use some motivation. 

When I drink I tell myself just one bottle. But, I keep chasing the buzz and becomes 6 or more. I don't have any moderation. Can you guys help me out? Im really sad right now and disappointed with myself. I drink to feel powerful but, right now I feel powerless. 

I hate how I act when drunk and want to put a stop to it. 

Please tell me your stories r/stopdrinking I feel so alone right now and thinking I should just pick up another bottle. My family is disappointed, my girlfriend is crying, and everything happened last night. What can I do?

2020-01-29 01:13:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/evixr3/ready_for_a_change/,Ready for a change!,"  I've been following this sub for a while now. And I finally think it's my turn to introduce myself. 

I am a 29 year old stay at home mom. Strong alcoholism runs on both sides of my family. My mom always let me have a sip here and there throughout high school. My dad, who was a severe alcoholic at the time, thought he was cool to buy us drinks in the few times we ever saw him. 
That started a horrible track for me. I instantly fell in love my first drink. I always gave myself the excuse to drink a lot because of ptsd from severe child abuse  and anxiety.  One excuse to drink became another excuse as well as reasons why I deserved it. I also have an autoimmune disease  and a weak heart and every time I drink I think I'm going to die of a heart attack. But for some reason my brain just wants more. So I continue hurting myself.

 Because of this addiction I've lost all money to my name, a dui , lost my passion of art and music as well as creativity, lost good friends, lost my memory, gained 50lbs, I'm irritable. I feel like I've lost who I am. My brain is so foggy to where comprehension is difficult at times. I'm always thinking about my next stupid drink. Night is a trigger, weekends are a trigger, movies, songs, pictures, billboards, family, my husband. 

 I have an 8yr old with autism, and twins, one with autism & epilepsy.  I'm tired of living sick, weak and tired with no motivation. I need to be strong physically and mentally for myself and for my family. I am ready to change and learn how to love life again! Learn who I am again, to love and accept myself for who I am! 

What are ways you learned to find yourself again? To reignite passions for hobbies? To simply enjoy life and hold conversations with people without feeling like you need a drink to do it? And HOW DID YOU STAY SOBER WITH A SPOUSE WHO STILL DRINKS?

Thank you to everyone in this sub. It has helped me feel like I am not alone in this.

-----------------------------------------

**The Good:** I got rid of the big, loathsome Citroen I rented back when I arrived in England. A couple of days ago, I drove from Hampton Court Village to Gatwick and dumped the thing back at the rental agency. (Never have I seen a more welcome sight than the sign saying “Rental Car Return” at the south terminal.) Then I flew back to the US and arrived safe and sound—and without a stupid French car!

**The Bad:** Nothing like staying in a sparkling clean hotel room to make you realize, when you get home, just how dirty your house really is.

**The Amusing:** I think the stand-up comedian Jim Gaffigan is funny. Talking about a period of sobriety he had a while back (because he was working so much), he says, “When I didn’t drink, people would overreact. They’re like, ‘Oh, you don’t drink? Is it okay if I drink?’ That doesn’t happen with, ‘Oh, you don’t use mayonnaise? Is it okay if I use mayonnaise? Should I use the mayonnaise outside?’”",30

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I was a slow learner and had many ""Rock Bottoms"" before I finally stopped.  This quote comes from a great man, a legend and mentor to thousands of us here and fondly remembered/known as ""CC"".  His statement became my mantra and is still taped to my bathroom mirror as a reminder of how far I've come:

>> ""*We get sober and stay sober when we realize that the pain and consequences of drinking outweigh any reservation we have about our alcohol dependence or alcoholism.  I wasn't able to get sober and stay sober until I fully accepted that there is nothing left in the bottle for me.*""

I thought this was appropriate for ""Hump Day"" because once I got over thinking about ""moderation"" or ""only on special occasions"" and finally *Accepted* that alcohol could never again be an option for me, my recovery became a lot easier.

Please join me in *Accepting* that alcohol is simply Not an option TODAY.",70

I have nightmares of me binge drinking and wake up sweating and almost in tears until I realize it was just a dream. I’m perfectly content on never drinking again. I’m hoping this is the moment of clarity but I can’t stop from crying from thinking about everything I’ve done to my family and not only to them but to myself. How could I almost drink myself to death? I put poison in body for so many years and for so many years I was a depressed, suicidal person and now that I’m starting to love myself again I feel so covered in dread bc I hurt not only my family but myself.

When I was drinking, I used to play this little ""game"" most nights, *especially* work nights. I would set a little timer on my phone to go off every 15 minutes. When it went off, I would take a shot of whiskey ([exactly 1 ounce](https://i.etsystatic.com/7557985/r/il/b83382/911699185/il_794xN.911699185_325t.jpg)). Most nights I would end up drinking about 8 shots before passing out. Some nights more than that. 8 shots in 2 hours. That was of course on top of whatever I had already drank before this little nighttime ritual, which was usually quite a few beers or glasses of whiskey.

Often I would do this late into the night, which meant I was getting about 5 hours of sleep with a belly full of whiskey before heading out to work in the morning, which meant I was often still drunk when I drove in to work, still drunk when I started work, and that meant that I would start to get a hangover at around 10 or 11 am.

Looking back it's a miracle I didn't get caught and fired or something. And I just thought of the whole thing as ""business as usual."" Nothing weird about it.

I don't know where else to turn but freaking Reddit. I have a support system around me, and yet I feel so alone and helpless right now.

My dad has been sober for 25+ years. Today, I call him as I normally do on my way home from work (we live states apart), and his phone is off. I call my mom, thinking he just fell asleep on the couch, and she tells me my dad picked up drinking again and checked himself into rehab that afternoon.

There were no warning signs; my mom said nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I think the jig was up when he was having virus-like symptoms all week, and we kept urging him to go to a doctor and make sure it wasn't something that needed an antibiotic.

I keep thinking of all the small signs I took for granted. My mom said he was sleeping for long periods of time; something we attributed to him not feeling well. But sleeping during the work day (he's an attorney with his own small practice, so he calls the shots). He was sleeping through the whole morning and going in at noon the past week. Didn't have an appetite. His energy seemed low the last few days we talked, but personality-wise, everything seemed par for the course.

He will be in inpatient for the next seven days. He gets two outgoing phone calls a day. I won't hear from him likely until tomorrow afternoon, as he cannot contact anyone for the first 24 hours while he detoxes.

I suppose I am just looking for guidance, advice, words of encouragement, anything for my pops. He is my best friend, and I feel so helpless and alone right now. I just never thought I would see him pick up again. I know he is in the best place right now, where he has doctors and nurses monitoring him around the clock, but the fear of the unknown is absolutely debilitating.

Been lurking and lightly commenting here and there for a bit. This group has been really helpful in finally deciding to commit to giving alcohol up for good. 

Today is day 31, and officially the longest I've gone without alcohol in probably 20 years. I did three (individual) sober months in the last year and a half, as I was gauging the prospect of a life without alcohol. About 2 years ago I promised myself that if I couldn't moderate to a degree I was happy with, I would be forced to abandon it completely.  Obviously that day has come. 

The sneaky part about my situation is the sort of ""high functioning"" nature of my addiction. I've always kept it mostly together, functioned relatively normally, albeit barely at times. I probably dodged more than a few bullets along the way. For the past 5 or 6 years I could feel it creeping in. The first indication of how normalized I was to the consumption was when the doctor asked how many beers I drank in a week and I finally counted - 43. 43?! A six pack a day on average for seven days - holy shit. And it's not like I'm getting drunk really - a 12 oz beer an hour for 6 hours is a decent buzz at best, but the long term damage of doing it every day was starting to show. 

Long story short - and the thing that helps me stay committed to this long term right now - is that alcohol isn't even enjoyable anymore, despite what my brain is trying to convince me is true. Cravings for craft beer are constant, but a false hope. Sort of like feeling nostalgic for a childhood that can never be reclaimed. It was a moment in time. A thing I did and enjoyed at times, but now it's over. It's time to refocus on other things. I like to think of the weight of the struggle to abstain as a daily payment for a better life. Even if I did drink again, I know it wouldn't actually bring me any real joy - and so it's time to move on. Don't get me wrong though, this path is fucking hard, but I'm glad to be on it. I'm glad all of you are on it too.

Oh, and in just 30 days of sobriety I saved enough to buy a brand new 55"" 4K TV - so that doesn't suck either. At this rate my monthly student loan payment is all but erased. That's a reason to stick with it on its own. 

That's it for now. Thanks for the inspiration. I will not drink with all of you today, tomorrow, and beyond.",5

I'm not too sure what triggered my mood to take a shift because last week I felt like I was on cloud 9! And then sunday night hit and I just got really bummed out. All of yesterday and today I've felt so apathetic and it's making me want to drink because I just want to feel some sort of emotion other than depressed or anxious.

It's really sad to admit but alcohol was what I looked forward to every week. But, I see a psychiatrist on Friday and then will begin addictions counseling after. I have not gotten the courage to go to a meeting yet.

I guess I just wanted to feel not so alone in this, and if anyone has some positive quotes or messages to please pass them along to me! I dont have a lot of friends where I'm at so it's a mixed bag on if I'll get support or rejected if I reach out.

Instead, I'm trying to work on the underlying reasons for my drinking. I'm doing therapy and currently listening to ""This Naked Mind"" which has helped a lot already, at least by understanding better the conflict of wanting not to drink and wanting to drink simultaneously - I consciously want to stay sober, unconsciously I want to get in the comfortable place of intoxication. 

I have noticed I can get along pretty well without drinking for a week or 10 days apprx, but then I just need that new dose of the addictive drug that is ethanol. Currently I haven't been drinking for a week and the craving starts to kick in. 

I have liked this sober week so much. My mind is clearer, my productivity has increased, I feel calmer and have less anxiety, I generally feel better and I feel that my self-worth increases, even my depression symptoms have lessened (they often come back in full impact after drinking episodes). I need to be sharp and feel good on Saturday and Sunday, as I need to work on some very important projects this weekend, I had planned them weeks in advance. I would love to stay sober this Friday and continue this sober streak as far as I can. 

Yet all this reasoning seems to fade away when I think about Friday and how good it would be to get wasted. I will need to go out this Friday. It's my favorite bar, there are going to be lots of my friends, perhaps my crush will be there, and I will meet my best friend there who will have finished and incredibly difficult three-day project, and she will definitely finally get wasted. I am so afraid that considering all these circumstances + my increasing craving, I will give in. Although I really really don't want to. 

Any tips on how to stay sober this Friday? An option ""just don't go there"" won't work this time. Are there some things I could repeat to myself? 

One of my go-to tricks is to sometimes get high instead of drunk, but I have noticed that in bars it often doesn't work like that - I get high and then want to drink nonetheless, and I end up being high+drunk instead of being just drunk, and self-hate kicks in even more.",2

The poor judgment, dangerous behavior, the fights... The upset, anxiety, pain and anger ive caused in the people closest to me because of alcohol. This all consuming guilt, embarrassment, shame. Hard to focus on much else. And knowing that in committing to not drinking, I am committing to not shutting these feelings and memories down. That's terrifying on its own. 

I can't wrap my head around how I could make amends for the horrible things ive said and the hurt ive caused. Seems impossible. 

But. I keep telling myself this will get better. Day by day. There's probably fallout and consequences I haven't faced yet. And I'll square with those when they show up. Guess thats what they mean when they say one day at a time...",6

Then I got to thinking, maybe I shouldn't. The positive benefits have been overwhelming. Of course no hangovers, no risking drinking and driving, better digestive system, more energy, save money, and calories. I was worried socially about how different it would be, but it's just as cool. Seen a few friends that aren't supportive of it and want me to drink with them so it's eye opening to see who truly has your best interests in mind.

Part of me would like to be able to enjoy a beer every now and then, but I have an addictive personality and think one would lead to three. Usually I would drink six to twelve beers a day five times a week or so. This is the longest period I've been without it and seeing this community is making me lean towards staying sober.

Another thing I've noticed is there isn't much discussion on the method that really helped me. I won't mention the organization or website, maybe it's taboo.

For me Addictive Voice Recognition Technique (AVRT) really helped me. I found the crash course online for free and started reading. It's a simple, *rational* approach that really worked for me. It's a common sense, tough love approach, tough self-love if you will. It didn't work the first time, nor the other tries over about eight years. But each time I would come away stronger. Eventually I was able to quit. 

Is there a reason it's not discussed more? I know it's not for everyone, but neither is AA, that's why I haven't been, yet. For me reading each bullet point made me stop and look at myself like I was a fool for drinking ( I was. But it really opens your eyes to how badly our minds have been altered by our addiction). It really simplifies things. I realize this method requires a certain amount of willpower and inner strength, but we all need all the help we can get.

Bottles of wine a day, and she's a mother of two small children. There was a failed attempt at an intervention and I guess his sister hit his mom. This is all very disturbing to him and has decided to rescind her invitation to our wedding obviously. 

I finally opened up to him about my thoughts/feelings surrounding my decision to take steps back from alcohol. I was very vulnerable with him and said that I am trying to take steps to be healthier and improve my life. And I kind of poked him about his daily alcohol and marijuana use, (once a day for each) I just asked him why he does it religiously, and he said ""it's to slow down his thoughts"".  I do not intend on controlling his behavior, I know for a fact that I can't. It hasn't lead to anything negative, but I know working in the medical profession smoking of any kind is bad. 

He listened and said he's supportive and then he kind of joked about ""how I'm having a mid life crisis"" and for whatever reason it really hurt that he was in a joking mood after I shared something really raw that I hadn't shared with anyone else. He said that he deals with uncomfortable feelings with humor. I'm hurt. And honestly I'm really questioning everything right now because this isn't the first time this has happened.

I realized I had an issue a few years ago. I had gotten into a habit of drinking after a bad relationship during grad school. I'd go down to school, work out, go to class, come home around 11 pm (I had a long commute) and I'd have a drink afterwards while playing overwatch competitive. I only had two classes a week, so it seemed a light thing. 

After a while I just became known as the ""Drunk Reinhardt"" - the player who somehow got better while with a buzz. It was fun, and I got more and more requests to play. Which led to more drinks. Somehow I kept this going during grad school and still got a lot of work done. I've been out of grad school for a while now and I've been wanting to quit drinking. For two years after grad school, every night I'd have at least one large rum and coke. I hated it. I was sick every morning. Hell, I took vacation to just not go in to the office feeling like that.

So I'm trying - no, I'm doing. I finally admitted to a friend a week ago about my problem. I asked him for discretion - I can't let my family find out. I know them; they'd panic, get worried, try to help, but in the end it would feel like I'm being treated for a problem. Their approach to problems is to go all in and overboard, which I've learned for myself isn't the most effective way for change. Just because you throw out all the alcohol doesn't remove access - it just provides a barrier for entry. It means more to myself to have it available and not desire it or partake than to pretend the substance doesn't exist.

I tried to quit last year. Went a week, then fell back into the habit. I'm not making that mistake again. This time time, I'm enlisting some support with my friend. I told him to give me shit over direct messages if I fall off my path.

So far, I went last week with only two drinks. This week, I'm aiming for none. I want to have my first sober month in five years.",7

Will I ever find companionship again and if I did what would that look like as someone addicted to alcohol. Awkward conversations about my past and a life free from alcohol. I wouldn’t even know where to start. The thought of being alone for the rest of my days is very depressing. Made worse by the fact that my great loss only wanted to see me get sober and live a health life and understood the depth of my struggles. Just having a hard time seeing the light from the bottom of this hole that I have dug. Some may say that I will never truly be alone because I have a child, but while that is true I would never want to burden her as she grows up and strikes her own path in this world. And it would never be the same as a true connection with another soul. 

But like the title says it’s a fleeting thought as I have to take this journey of Self healing one step at a time.

""I don't drink"" is sufficient, if anyone even notices that I tipped the bartender 5 or 10 for a bottomless Sprite with a twist. 

I'm a remote worker, same crew for six years. I'm known as a drinker. We're doing a week long meeting in San Diego, a mile from the beach. 

It's not more pressure. I am well liked and no one would wish ill. It's more temptation.... in a subterranean way. I'm actually consciously looking forward to remembering all the conversations, and not shutting up because I know I'm too buzzed to open my mouth. 

Typing this out, ""I don't drink anymore"" invites scrutiny. Humans are curious. ""I'm not drinking right now"" invites less.

In any event, I'm not going to drink addictive poison to impress a bunch of professionals.

Sleep- much better.  First two weeks, the dreams were super intense.  I notice I'm sleeping through the night more frequently, whereas I was waking up a lot throughout the night when I was drinking.

Money-  holy shit drinking is expensive.  I never even went out much, but I guess those trips to the gas station for a 12 pack and ordering beers with dinner really add up over the course of a month.  Saved hundreds and its only been a month.

Family-  getting along great with the wife.  Its marriage, so theres gonna be arguments, but theyre marriage arguments, not ""I was drunk"" arguments.  It's nice to forget to take out the trash because I really forgot, not because I was so drunk I forgot what day it was.

Work-  more productive, i always liked my job, so booze never really affected work much.  I do feel a lot more motivated when I don't have that groggy post-hangover weighing me down.

I don't miss it.  The times when I had the option to drink, or when one was offered, I simply asked myself some variation of these questions:  
   
Do I genuinely believe that drinking will make this better?  
   
Do I genuinely believe that the good time I'm having would be any better if I were drinking?

Do I genuinely believe the bad time I'm having will get any better if I start drinking?
   
Is there any chance I'll wake up tomorrow regretting staying sober today?
   
Is there any chance I'll wake up tomorrow regretting it if I drink today?


   
The thing is, I've tested those theories so many times over the past 2 decades, I already know the answers to all of those questions.",10

Not just for the money but it’s seems logical with a fresh start. Had a shave this morning and have found in the past that if I “let myself go” it adds to my depression somewhat.
I’ll probably take some breaks from the job hunt and clean my vehicle and read through some of the things I got from my first AA meeting. And of course stalk this place lol.

Since quitting I've been able to make some pretty big lifestyle changes that I never would have been able to do with drinking, mainly intermittent fasting.

Quitting has given me my discipline back. Because I was able to accept ""feeling uncomfortable"" while quitting alcohol, it's given me the power to accept feeling uncomfortable in other aspects of my life, and to deal with them in a natural way. As a result, I am more effective at home with my wife and son.

I am off work until late April for parental leave, and being able to have this time to commit to change is a really important thing for me.

Today is the first Day 2 I've had since March of last year. I'm pretty pleased with myself, but I also need to check my excitement. I've been internalizing the first part of this statement over the past few months. Drinking a bottle+ of wine per day is simply not sustainable. I would wake up every morning feeling bloated and icky and tired- I don't know why I was drinking other than the fact that I knew I couldn't stop. What is the point of threatening my life for seemingly no reason? I think part of it is that I'm in my 20s and still feel like I'm invincible. Which I know to be false, but alas...I've internalized that too (for now).

I've failed myself so many times. Like many things in my life that I want to accomplish, I start to dream really big. Part of me is saying, ""wow this is amazing! You're going to live a super sober and fulfilling life with a clear head, you'll get your skinny body back!"". But I have got to reign that lady in. I need to take this one day at a time and understand that its okay to feel uncomfortable and part of the process is releasing the hold of alcohol. Of course ""it still has me"". Its only been one day. After reading so many recovery posts, I know that it will still have me for awhile. Its scary and overwhelming to not know when I'll be free from it.

I finished Laura McKowen’s *We Are the Luckiest* last week. It was very good. Usually when I start a getting sober memoir I suspect that 1. The author can’t have been as bad a drunk as me and 2. The author can’t have loved booze like I did. While I think my alcoholism was in some ways worse than Laura M’s, in some ways hers was worse than mine. And she managed to make it pretty clear that she loved booze like I did. She uses a metaphor of being buzzed/drunk as being on a sexy and romantic and jovial island and describes how in early sobriety she was so sad and angry that she could never go back to the island. I was amazed how similar to my own metaphor that was. My own had been that being buzzed was a garden of eden from which I’d been banished for abusing it and the angel at the gates who barred me from ever returning held a sword called “Kindling”. (Yes, I was that melodramatic about it and it was utterly without irony and my despair was real.) 

I’m pretty over alcohol finally and have no desire to ever drink again, but I don’t think I’ll ever tire of getting sober memoirs. While I’m not 100% sure that I agree with LM that “we are the luckiest”, I definitely feel that we are the most interesting. Alcoholism doesn’t totally define me, but I feel a kinship with its other sufferers like I’ve never felt with any other type of person.

Three years ago I got sober for what I thought was the last time. During those three amazing years my husband and I bought a house, had a baby, I got a new job and then was promoted in that job, I quit smoking, I ran half marathons like it was nothing and I had peace. I had security. I was safe. 

Then I fucked it all up by drinking on a work trip bc I stupidly thought I could do it while away and come back to my beautiful life like nothing had happened. 

That was four months ago and since then my world has been turned upside down by my own doing. I’ve been hospitalized twice. My husband is an inch away from leaving me if he hasn’t decided to already. And there are other minor consequences, but my marriage is what’s truly at stake. 

Starting last week I began going to AA meetings again, I have new sponsor and I also began working with a new therapist who I’ll be seeing once a week. I’ve put ALL the pieces in place for a successful recovery, yet I still give in to impulses and drink. 

What am I doing wrong? Why am I hell bent on sabotaging myself? I know it’s a disease that’s ruthless and cunning, but why is it running my life?

Anyway I guess what I’m looking for are stories of hope. Were you me once? How did you break the endless cycle of giving in, then starting over again and again and again? I need something to cling onto.",8

It's not that much different from alot of books I have read, and trust me I have pretty much read them, all.  This one however comes with a bit more of a new age slant, which in the past, has made me sceptical, but i decided to keep an open mind.  One of the things she recommends is meditation, with some simple breathing exercises to get you started and get you through the cravings, so I think, why not just give it a shot.

So there i am lying in the dark, just silently concentrating on my breathing - in the book she notes that things will push their way in to your mind, and you should just gently push them back out again.

So...

In breath....1...2...3..4.. Out 1..2..3...4..5.. In....1..2...3...4 KARL! wtf? just concentrate on breathing johnny.

Then I cant I'm thinking about Maggie and her baby, and how she was a good actress and has she left the show now?

Come on! FOCUS!

In breath....1...2...3..4.. Out 1..2..3...4..5.. In....1..2...3...4 hershel's farm.

huh, wtf am i thinking about this, i havent watched since Karl died

OK I'll give it some thought....

And then suddenly it hit me.  I dont watch TWD anymore, why?  I wasnt enjoying it, how long have i been clear of TWD?  turns out the last episode I watched was on 25th Feb 2018.  702 Days ago.

Wow, I feel the same way about alcohol, with TWD i have done 702 days without even thinking about it.  Why cant alcohol be the same?

Im not stupid, I know there are differences, one is an addictive drug the other is a silly TV show but there a few similarites.

Me and friends got hooked on it years ago, it was nice getting a weekly fix, it was and could be entertaining, but for me a while ago it stopped being fun, so i made a concious decision to never watch it again, and I havent looked back and have never missed it, I have asked some people who are still in the throes of TWD addiction if it has gotten any better, and nothing they have said could entice me back.

I've never looked at this way before, and it kind of excited me.

Much like the early seasons of drinking could be exciting, at the end of the day the writing gets stale, the storyline never changes and eventually you have to find yourself a new show.

There have been countless moments that should have been wake up calls but quickly got pushed to the side when a ""good time"" presented itself. Last week I had a wake up call that finally got my attention. I stopped drinking for a few days but decided to let loose for my birthday and I realized that I wasnt happy unless I was drinking. That realization really scared me. I dont want my happiness to be controlled by my alcohol consumption. I am going to my first AA meeting tomorrow and I'm kind of nervous. I dont know what to expect and I dont know if it will help me be sober but I do know sobriety is something I have to do. I want to improve my mental and physical health. I want to be in control of my happiness. I want to be the best version of me and I have finally realized that alcohol has been severely holding me back from achieving anything. I dont have much of a support system so I know this road is going to be difficult but I'm a very stubborn person once I've put my mind to something and my mind is definitely set on this.

Today I mark 1500 days sober. To be sure, it is nice round number. I passed through the four year mark in December, but I was away on holiday and the milestone went by quietly along with Christmas. I am a writer and publisher sustained in the main by sponsors. Later today I will sign a contract with a leading bank for another three years of support. This extends my relationship with this bank to 18 years. Truthfully I could not have covered this distance if I were not sober. Truthfully my life is fuller, more meaningful and abundant because I stopped drinking 1500 days ago.

If there are any thanks due, this corner of the internet must take a huge bow. I have been a lurker and a contributor. I thank you all for the love and support I found here. I know how to take each day as it comes – one day at a time. To those who have just started out – keep on keeping on, I’ll be watching. To the old fogies here – thank you for your company.

To all fellow non-drinkers alike: if only for right now, today, this week, this month, this year, last year, or last decade. Whoever you are, I’m glad you’re here. 

Tonight I can’t help but think about how many nights I could have back if I’d never drank. All of my youth. College. Days when I’d actually had time to do nothing. So many hours and $s spent on nothing. Yes there are some “fun” times in there but so many cut out after the first few drinks. It blows my mind to think I kept doing it.  For years i kept doing it! 

It sounds so crazy to me at 32. To think I willingly put myself though the crippling anxiety. Staring at the ceiling the next morning. Wondering if I’d lost anything or how I’d made it home. It wasn’t a weekly or even monthly occurrence when I drank but it happened enough. Hell, even once is one time too many. So much shame. 

I remind myself how far I’ve come and that it’s something to be proud of to know I’ll never have to fear those words from something I’d done recently. But even then, I’ll never get over the feeling of knowing there are things said and people and places I’ve been to I don’t even remember. What a sobering, terrifying thing to know.

Well, I injured my shoulder the first week of January and fell out of my schedule. I started to go to bed later and later and wake up later and later where I'm currently in a funk where I don't go to sleep until 2 am.

I'm still injured, but I've decided to get up at 6am and go in and do stuff I can do that doesn't involve my shoulder. I really need to get back on a routine. It's crazy how easy it is to fall out of a healthy routine and into a lazy one.

I know it wont last, and I think I need to come up with some quick responses when I get urges. But her idea that alcohol has no place in civilized society is the simplest, almost obvious idea I have heard of in my life! To understand the drinking AT BEST is a risk that can lead anyone to abuse and addiction, is freedom.  Undertanding that alcohol is a poisonous, addictive drug that has no redeemable qualities outside of an antiseptic is to take away all its power! To see a cozy, attractive bar (which I did just Saturday night) as a propagandize lie, and a clever trap, is to take power away from drinking! 

Her message speaks to my personality as an antagonist, so maybe thats why I’m excited too. I can look at those bars, the drinkers and think, “you suckers. You are engaging in an absurd practice!” Being able to think that lends itself to my personality as a contrarian, but at least it gives me great reasons not to drink!

It feels like a year has past since then because I feel completely different now & I have found myself in a position I never thought I’d be in.

It is now HARDER for me to go pick up a drink and say “Fuck it” than it is for me to do what I’ve been doing & continue to abstain from alcohol. Which is fucking amazing and great, yet a totally weird and alien concept to me.

It’s a total 180 degrees my mind has done in such a short period of time. Not that long ago I was stuck in this pathetic self-pitying mindset & so dead-set on the idea that I would and could never quit drinking. Fast forward a bit, and it’s the total opposite, I literally CAN NOT see myself drinking again, at least not for the foreseeable future. 
Not to say that I have beaten my problem, because it is still there without a doubt, but things are looking on the upside finally. Things actually seem achievable now.

My biggest mistake was convincing myself that I was doomed to drink til the day I died, that there was no point in trying to quit because It was inevitable. And hey, who’s to say that the last time was actually my last time? Well it’s me— I am the only one with the say so, it’s my life. This disease is chronic, & we as alcoholics have to treat our disease on a daily basis.

Much love,"I've copied an Alcohol Recovery Timeline. (The original OP's account has been deleted so I can't give them appropriate credit.)

I have seen the desire expressed several times for a timeline of recovery similar to the one available for quitting smoking. The following is my attempt which is cobbled together from various studies and websites. I'd be interested in any corrections, additions, or improvements. I did not get into the liver beyond fatty liver since the rates and prognosis of recovery vary so greatly between people. Enjoy!

•	⁠Hour 22.5: Alcohol from consuming 5 pints of lager is no longer present in the blood.
•	⁠Day 1: Cell proliferation increases across multiple brain regions.
•	⁠Day 2: Visual, auditory, or tactile hallucinations (if present and not DT related) usually end. First burst of cell proliferation, which is widespread, particularly in the hippocampus and cortex. These cells will largely differentiate into microglia in non-neurogenic brain regions.
•	⁠Day 5: Alcohol no longer detectable in saliva or urine tests. Symptoms of delirium tremens peak.
•	⁠Day 7: Second burst of cell proliferation, which is regionally specific to the dentate gyrus subgranular zone. In the dentate gyrus, proliferating cells will differentiate over several weeks mostly into neurons.
•	⁠Day 14: Neural progenitors begin to differentiate into mature neurons. Cognitive deficits regarding distractibility, mild confusion, and irritability are generally back to normal levels.
•	⁠Week 4: Cortical gray matter volume increases. Fatty liver disease is typically reversed.
•	⁠Week 5: One month after the Day 7 burst in neurogenesis, there is a two-fold increase in new neurons formed. This increase in neurogenesis during abstinence from chronic alcohol exposure may be related to the recovery of brain volume deficits and cognitive deficits in abstinent alcoholics.
•	⁠Month 2: Cognitive deficits regarding attention and concentration, reaction time, verbal learning ability, verbal abstract reasoning, and verbal short-term reasoning are generally back to normal levels.
•	⁠Month 3: Increase of white and gray matter as well as a decrease of cerebrospinal fluid. Alcohol no longer detectable in hair follicle tests.
•	⁠Month 6: Alcoholics who drank late into life, but with at least 6 months of abstinence can exhibit normal cognitive functioning. Alcoholics who were abstinent for less than 6 months performed worse in cognitive functioning than the control group.
•	⁠Year 5: Cognitive deficits regarding verbal abstract reasoning, verbal short-term reasoning, nonverbal abstract reasoning, visuospatial abilities, mental flexibility, and nonverbal short term memory are back to normal. The recovery rate of cognitive function varies greatly and is influenced by age, length of sobriety, and presence of interim drinking. Recovery from cognitive deficits can occur as early as a few months.
•	⁠Year 6.7: There is no statistical difference in cognitive test results with a control group, except in the area of spatial processing.

If you're needing a reason to not drink today, notice that the brain starts healing within just a month or two and Fatty Liver disease is typically reversed.",404

This doesnt stop when i drink either the angst and stress is still there. 
At night i can actually relax and watch tv alcohol made my attention span pretty short and would struggle on settling on a task or activity. 
I feel so much calmer in general and tend to spend a lot more time of self care like a bath or stretching which makes me feel so good and great for looking after myself also.

Getting sober was something I’d been wanting to do for a long time, however being 21 and working as a server/bartender at a local sports bar is not the ideal situation for that.

So far I’m nearly 2 months sober, and within that short space of time I’ve managed to
- Complete all terms of my probation for the DUI
- Get off probation
- Make/Attract more money and opportunities
- Develop stronger, more meaningful connections
- Reduce my anxiety while increasing my confidence and happiness 

Not to mention sobriety allows me to be fully present in life and at work, free from the infamous “brain-fog” that alcohol is known for. It blows my mind how much has changed over the past couple of months and now I’m wondering why I ever drank as much as I did. 

I realize I’m not in the clear and the urge to say fuck everything and get drunk crosses my mind from time to time, but so far I’ve been successful with simply refusing to drink. I think my conscious and sub-conscious minds are finally on the same page 😂

I‘m a 53 year old woman, athletic and mostly a closet drinker.  The past few years I’ve been drinking about half a fifth of vodka a day. Every day, mostly spaced out mid-afternoon and evening so i was rarely totally drunk, but always buzzed. While doing that, I still played tennis daily, ran 3-4x a week and practiced yoga.  I started out drinking a couple glasses of wine a day about 16 years ago and progressed from there.

Since I’ve stopped:

Sleep -  I'm sleeping better, but the first two weeks were hard, sleep was still intermittent.  I just had an amazing night’s sleep last night, 8 solid hours, but it took almost a month for that to happen.   
Energy- I’m very tired. I get through my days, but am just exhausted.  I’m still doing my usual activities, but I’m spending a lot of recovery time on the couch. I think my body is rebooting after years of alcohol abuse, but I can’t find much information about this. 

Food - eating lots of junk food with absolutely no weight gain. Crazy. Had I known this, I might have quit sooner. 😉craving lots of sugar, which I rarely ate while I was drinking.   
Health - Overall I feel much better. I’m able to focus better, have more patience and feel less grumpy and frustrated.  Fewer aches in various parts of my body.   
Some days are really hard, the next day maybe not so much. I‘m not going to AA, I have the support of several good friends who are also cutting down.  Some days are hard, some days are not so bad.  I’ve been listening to the “Take a break“ podcast and I read this sub every day.  You all are amazing, and I’m very grateful for this community (even though this is my first post).  Social events have been going well, I just drink sparkling water. No one seems to care or notice.  I noticed I’m not triggered to drink when I come home in the afternoon anymore. (I used to pour myself a glass of whatever when I first got home)  
My plan is to treat alcohol the way I treat cakes and cookies.  I don’t keep them in the house because I eat them and they are an occasional treat, usually saved for a special occasion.  I hope this works otherwise, I’ll have to completely quit.   
Hope this helps keep someone motivated.  It does get better and easier.   
best of luck to you all, you’ve got this!",44

I’ve noticed we have a lot of new people coming to this sub. Whether you’re here because you’re doing Dry January or you want to stop for good, I’ve compiled a little list of the things that have helped me get sober and stay sober over the past ten-ish months. 

*I also want others to feel free to add things so please do!*

1. Therapy - therapy can be your traditional sense where you go into a professional and talk things out. Therapy could also be writing in a journal, reading self help books, meditating for hours on end. Whatever helps you clear your mind and get your emotions out. Do it. 

2. Don’t try and quit everything all at once - I know what you’re thinking. No, I am not saying that if you have a hardcore drug addiction you should first focus on quitting the bottle before that. I see people post here, “I’m quitting alcohol and cigarettes and caffeine and sugar, etc. all in one go”. Sorry but you’re setting yourself up for failure. Sobriety should come first. The other things come second. Cut yourself a break. You’re going through a tremendous change in lifestyle. If having coffee and cigarettes helps you stay sober in the beginning keep drinking that god damn coffee and keep smoking those god damn cigarettes. The other things will come in due time. 

3. Have a good support system - you got toxic people in your life? People who don’t support your sobriety? Kick them the fuck out of your life. You don’t need dead weight dragging you down. I don’t care if that toxic person is your mother or your husband. Get em out. They should have been gone five minutes ago to be honest. 

4. This one is this most important so write it down... FORGIVE YOURSELF. Forgive yourself for every stupid ass thing you’ve done while you were drunk. Forgive yourself for mistakes, transgressions and hurt. Learn from your mistakes, grow from them and promise yourself you won’t do them again. I repeat: FOR-FUCKING-GIVE YOURSELF. I don’t care if you need to tattoo that on your forehead to make yourself believe it and live it. Repeat it to yourself constantly throughout the day when you’re feeling down. “I forgive myself and I promise to make better choices.”

I was struggling and relapsing a lot and tried reading a book, as I find that I get motivated by informing myself about alcohol so I can counter my cravings, and refresh my commitment to not drink. It does an excellent job of showing that alcohol is one of the worst recreational drugs using the newest scientific discoveries. Reading in a detailed but accessible way in how many different ways alcohol damages the body is really eye-opening for me, I knew that it was bad, but now it's baffling to me how the alcohol industry is not regulated more. It's not a book aiming to get you to quit, and there's not much advise about quitting, but it does aim to make you rethink what drinking does and if such a thing as responsible drinking even exists. I'm on about a week of not drinking right now, and I think this book has really helped me in that regard. Thought I'd share this recommendation for anyone else looking for reading material.",34

So, if you’ve been following me, I’ve been working hard on getting better, with great success. I just got blood work done again this week but this time I got two tests done. Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, which I’ve been getting almost weekly for 3 months and it’s the best yet!  The second was the Complete Blood Count. Hemoglobin is 5.9 (should be 13 min) and my gastro doc wanted me to go to the ER ASAP.  

So tomorrow morning, I’ll be going for a blood transfusion. Lots of negative results on the CBC which all point to anemia and iron / b12 deficiency. 

Well see how things good. Keep you posted. Check back here for updates.

EDIT:  5:30am - Taking a shower and packing a to go bag with chargers, headphones and snacks.  Then on my way!

EDIT 2;  7:29am - Just arrived at the ER. Waiting to be admitted. Symptoms; fatigue (falling asleep randomly), balance is off, slight shortness of breath, random nosebleeds, and as of this morning, slight dizziness.

EDIT 3;  7:50am - Just had blood work. Assuming for a CBC prior to the transfusion.

EDIT 4:  Just saw the first doctor. She seems nice. They’re going to order me food already. Sweet!  The food here is actually pretty good. At least it was last time. If i get a choice and The Whole menu, I’m gonna go HAM. Anyways. Have some fluid from the knees down and in my abdominal cavity again. They asked if I ever had a paracentesis. So it looks like maybe they’ll wanna do that again. I actually wouldn’t mind that since I’ve been working out. Will bring out those abs soon!

EDIT 4:  9:20am - Interesting. Hemoglobin is already up. 6.8 now and haven’t gotten anything done yet. Got an IV in. May have to get another endoscopy in addition.

EDIT 5:  1:21pm - Just got hooked up for the transfusion.  Two bags of blood ordered but may only need one depending on how this goes.  May be able to go home after this cause everything else seems ok.

EDIT 6:  1:46pm - bloods making its way in.

EDIT 7: 4:08pm. Transfusion is almost done. Looks like I’ll be going home right after. No other news yet. I’m assuming I’ll have to get check ups.",8

You have to learn how to live.,"I see so many Day 1's on here, many of them mine, until I stopped posting about them because who wants to hear my sob story again.

I've been in the quitting business for a few years now. First, discovering that one drink leads to all the drinks. Trying to control it. Trying to moderate. Switching to beer, only while video games so I slow down, only in public, never in public, it just doesn't matter. Not the setting, not the drink. Once it's in my system, it is priority number one.

That equation has been solved for some time.

On Friday I sat on the bus - weekends are a trigger - staring out the window. My mind was clear. I felt present. Still, I doubted myself. ""Do I really have a problem?"" Googling things like ""can you learn to moderate."" NO, I resolved. Not tonight. 

So I sat alone in my apartment playing video games... no. No. No. Around 10pm I broke.

Laying in bed wallowing in pity - less and less pity over time - I realized: I need to change fundamentally as a human being. Become childlike with fascinations, pursuits, things that seem worth doing and exploring. Able to connect with others without a chemical. I need to give, love, and be happy with existing. Not numb myself to fill in the gaps between work. 

I listened to an audiobook about Ego. The Ego does not want to connect, only compare. It needs to achieve and finds no purpose in activities not designed to bolster it. The Ego is uncomfortable letting you be happy, instead preferring to insulate you in familiar misery. Your Ego is how you define ""you"" and ""them."" Most importantly, the Ego does not want to believe it is limited in some way. It will present you with thoughts like I had on the bus over, and over, and over.

It's not enough just to exist; the mission is to learn to live.",1171

Three years ago I started to realize I might have an issue drinking and joined this group. Two years later I was $10,000 in debt, losing myself, mentally not there, and physically beginning to break down. 

I went sober, cold turkey, and had a doctor’s visit due to some hallucinations I was having but was cleared. It was a struggle to find “me” without the alcohol. I had to remove toxic people from my life, get busy, start seeing specialists for check ups (I was diagnosed with a few things after). I even found out, at 30 years old, I had had ADHD my whole life, for which I am now treated and managing. 

Thanks to therapy, doctors, friends, family, my cat, The Office, Pinterest, finding my passion in writing again, and of course, this group as the catalyst, I have my life back.

2020-01-27 15:01:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eutfkk/day_1/,Day 1,"I guess this is day 1 for me. 

I never really realized how much drinking was affecting my life. But it was driving my wife insane. I would leave home to go to the bar “just need some time to myself” I would tell her. And I would go, almost every day.

I learned that she hated me going. She never knew who she was getting back. The fun, slightly tipsy me who would dance and crack jokes, or the angry me who would start a fight with her over anything. It was almost always the latter.

Last night I went on a bender. I didn’t mean to. My wife and I had gone to the bar together, and when she wanted to leave, I stayed. She’s pregnant so she wasn’t drinking obviously, but I “needed some time to myself.” 

I lost count of how many drinks I had. She had to track me down with our neighbor. I didn’t realize how bad last night was until this morning. I read through our texts, and I was, mean. I don’t remember saying all the beyond cruel things I said to the mother of my unborn child, all drunken and fueled by rage. I didn’t remember saying any of the things I said. 

I would leave me if I was her. “It’s not all bad, otherwise I wouldn’t stay” she says. But I don’t want any of it to be bad, and it seems like the bad only comes from my drinking, and my use of drinking to cope with my anxiety.

You would have thought last year would have been when I quit, after getting my nose broken because I mouthed off to some people. You would have thought all the sober mea culpas would have led me to realize I had a problem. But I always felt justified in my anger towards my wife when I was drinking. She was picking a fight with me, I would tell myself.

But she wasn’t. She deserves better. I deserve better for myself. 

Day 1 scares the living shit out of me. I’ve been drinking heavy for 12 years. I don’t have any hobbies except drinking.

But the thought of never having a day 1, and losing my wife or my unborn child is scarier. 

I don’t really know what to do with myself, or really how I’ll get through it. But I know I have to. I need to be my best so my family can have the best life. I don’t want my wife in tears, afraid of me and the things I say. I need help. And I need to quit drinking.",5

This was filled with open bars, meetups at more bars with colleagues I don’t get to see often, and the last night was a massive party with, you guessed it, lots of free booze.

This is a two sided story. The first is that of difficulty and struggle. This was my biggest challenge to date, it was so, so hard to sit in a bar drinking O’Douls while everybody slowly got inebriated, talking louder and repeating themselves. This was especially hard as an introvert that used alcohol as a social lubricant.

The other side is one of triumph. Not only did I not drink, but I woke up at 5am for a company 5k. I was fully ‘there’ for every session. And most importantly, I was confident, speaking my mind whenever I had something to say, instead of over analyzing my every word before I even said it. I showed up like a boss, and not one time did I question myself. Did I knock over somebody’s wine glass like an asshole? Yep, but I wasn’t a drunk asshole, and I didn’t wake up the next morning panicking that everybody knew how drunk I really was.

This struggle that we face is a struggle of moments. Cravings will hit by the minute, and you feel that you are missing out on a single night. But the big picture is not only more satisfying, but it is more important. I am becoming the person I’ve always wanted to be. Turns out that person was inside the whole time, but was being drowned out by poison.

Good luck to all of you, whether it’s minute 1 or day 1000. Become the person you want to be.  IWNDWYT.",9

I was blown away yesterday though.  I woke up before my wife and kid and decided to go enjoy the last remnants of the storm running through our area with a nice drive on some backroads.  After, I decided to hit the small town nearby and check out some shops.  Walking the quiet street I noticed that alcohol was *everywhere*.  Every restaurant window advertising happy hour, beer and wine specials, etc.  I popped in to a shop and most of the home decorations in there were about ""It's wine 'o clock"" or ""Why drink water when you can drink wine?"" (shoutout to r/hydrohomies).  I was a full participant in this infiltration of society before, but never noticed how pervasive it is.  No wonder the US has such a drinking problem; it's almost impossible to escape.

Its so weird to not be in control of this one aspect of my life when I'm always so on top of everything else that I do.

So, I finally came clean to my husband (we've been married for a month) last night. I confessed that I had stashes in the house and routinely drank a bottle of wine each night before he gets home. I was so afraid to tell him, but I was so frustrated with myself. He was wonderful. I showed him where everything was in the house and he poured them out for me and threw it away.

&#x200B;

I feel pretty guilty for assuming how he would respond, but there is such a weight lifted off my shoulders to know that I don't have to go through this alone. Which is good...because I can't.

I binge drank three times. The first two times I had a ""great time"" with it. Looking back now those times sucked and were a complete waste of time and money. The third time though was a completely terrible experience. I was drinking at a normal bar for a while but then got cut off so I left and ended up at the bar of a packed restaurant and started talking to strangers. 

I said something pretty racist to some dude (I'm not actually racist) and he got really mad. He yelled at me for a while and I remember apologizing a bunch and telling him I'm just a drunk idiot and he shouldn't take anything I say so seriously or something like that idk.

I should have stopped there but I didn't. I kept talking to people as if they were my friends. I just ended up annoying the hell out of them and pissing them off. I didn't realize what I was doing until some guy laid down the law and told me: ""Dude, nobody wants to talk to you. You're not interesting, you're drunk and you have nothing to say."" I guess that made some self-awareness return to me and I'm pretty sure I paid my bill and left.

I ended up back at home, and I remember not being bothered by any of what happened. But then I woke up the next morning hungover and it all hit me. I can't even describe how upset I was with myself. How embarrassed I was. How sad I was. I'm normally really quiet and shy. If my dad or sister found out how I was acting I'm not sure how they'd react. I was spending money I don't even have. I'm a complete embarrassment. I don't know why I thought going out and talking to strangers was a good idea. I betrayed my dad and my sister, the amount of times I have left the house and come home drunk they must think I don't like them. I just want to tell them how much I love them and I want to be with them forever.

It's been 4 days since that night and it still keeps running through my head. I feel so terrible about it all, and I hope writing about it will make me feel a little better. I finally just started crying about it so I hope that's kind of a good thing. I've been sober since that night.

Over the weekend I started applying for jobs (which I haven't done in years) in other states so I can move out of this town and hopefully nobody from that night, or all the other nights I said would be my last time, will ever see me again. I'm so mad at myself.

I will not drink with you today.",13

So peanut MnMs were my staple to get through the first year.     As I learned more coping skills, and figured out some things about my individual genetic makeup (I recommend the book “Dirty Genes” ) I finally stopped needing the candy.  I finally was able to purely eat healthier.  And I finally dropped 22 lbs (8 to go). And I just FINALLY realized that my fat jeans were too baggy for them to stay on my hips.  I’m glad I bought them. They helped me go out of the house with a little less shame because they fit at the time.  But I’m also glad I didn’t throw the smaller pairs away and give up.  It felt amazing to put them back on! A little victory. (The big victory is my sobriety)

I’m grateful for this sub, for people who have been honest about what their journeys were like. It helped me through some dark days.

I might even have lost a bit of weight although I've been eating a lot more sweets and crap food than I used to.

But there is something that I do miss, I don't know how to put it in words exactly, but a certain numbness and not giving a shit about anything kinda feeling, if you know what I'm talking about, I kind of miss that. I have also felt super lonely these past months. I don't know if it's because I always had the bottle beside me and now I have to think of something else to turn to.

Now I'm getting to feel a bit better in bars and parties, I do drink n/a beer all the time though, I know it may not be a good idea for everyone but the (zero)beer bottle in my hand does work as a crutch for me and that way I don't necessarily always have to explain why I'm not drinking to every single person. I have terrible social anxiety which I medicated with alcohol and drugs for decades. 

This sub has been a lifesaver for me, I couldn't have made it this far without you people. So thanks a million for being there.

2020-01-27 11:53:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/euqjt2/the_last_bender_of_2019/,The last bender of 2019.,"It is a hazy memory. I just kept drinking and drinking after I finished my last day of the semester December 10th because I didn't have to be anywhere. At first I would just buy beer and shots because I didn't want to get too wasted. But then I hated that beer just runs through me so quick and it takes so much of it to get a buzz. I saw the box wine was on sale. 5 liters for 10 bucks, can't go wrong there. Days. Go. By. 

I somehow function enough to live life and provide for my family with the help of my brother who seems oblivious but mostly because I hide out in my room and sneak out to get my alcohol when he is asleep. I start buying bigger quantities so I don't have to leave the house as often. It is almost the holidays. My mom is coming for Christmas. I know that I am probably going to withdraw hard. But I try to taper before she gets to my place. I never really paid attention to the state of my room. I tell her that I fell off the wagon and things have gone to the wayside. I hear the disappointment in her voice. Just as long as she doesn't go in my room she won't know how bad things are. I had grabbed a trash bag and started bagging up the garbage in my room. Numerous empty beer cans, beer boxes and 5 liter wine boxes all over my floor. Random empty liquor bottles all over my floor and empty soda bottles and other various drink bottles all over the floor. Some dried puke on the carpet and dirty laundry with shirts that have dried puke on them. I start picking up trash and say fuck it and just leave my room. 

I remember on reddit several months ago seeing some who had been on a bender and they showed the state of their room and people called bullshit on it. I don't recall what subreddit it was, but I remember feeling like ""yeah, right"" but no, I have been there before and I went there again. You get to a point you just don't care and you just thrown your empty shit on the floor and worry about it never. 

My room is clean and has been for 33 days. When I was still in the hospital my mom cleaned my room. I asked if she thoroughly cleaned it. She said she thought so. I told her to check in the re-useable grocery bag hanging on the closet door. It was filled with empty airplane shooters and 2 empty handles of vodka. My private shame. She laughed. I laughed too. I said I told you I have a problem. 

I feel good today. I am starting my third week of class. And I will not drink with you today.",14

And all kinds of drinkers.  I have 2 months and this time it has been easier.  See, I drank slowly and steadily , wine with dinner, around dinner, every day for 25 years.  When I was 52 I quit for 7 years, then relapsed for 2 years.  Again, when I was in my 60's I stopped for about seven years, then relapsed for 2 years again.  The second relapse was brutal.  even the nature of my drinking had morphed.  Somewhere along the line I had became the old lady asking the kid behind the counter for the stuff behind the counter- vodka in half pints or pints, which I would take home, hide, and day drink. About a year in, I added wine and beer back into my repertoire and ""came out"" that I was drinking again, which made it both easier and harder, as I continued this covert drinking thing as well.    I turned 70 this year! I'M old! I have had to think long and hard about the next decade  and the quality it might or might not have.  It all depends on drinking/not drinking.  IWNDWY today.  

The thing I learned from relapsing is that a drinking habit really can get bigger in your absence.   It was growing and getting stronger all the time I was quit.  Who knew?

The thing I learned from former quitting is that I never have to feel scared or deprived by the idea of a future without alcohol. In my first quit  I felt positively skinless in social situations.  Now at least I do not have that feeling.  I do not envy drinkers.  It is all poison. And there really is no such thing as ""normal.""   Allen Carr's  ""Easy way to control drinking"" book has really been a help.

I hope it's okay that I made a throwaway account to post this. I stopped drinking a few months ago (160 days today!) and I've been lurking on this sub for a while now. I really wanted to tell someone about this wonderful friend I have, and I think all of you lovely people will get it.

I've been part of a close-knit friend group for years. I'm the only one in it who doesn't drink. One of my friends has been in a relationship for a while, and in October he and his girlfriend introduced their respective friend groups to each other, and everyone got along very well. We all started spending time together, and we've basically been merging into one big group since then.

I soon discovered that one of the girls from the other group doesn't drink. At all. She doesn't have a problem with alcohol or others drinking, she simply prefers not to drink because she doesn't enjoy it. The way she explains it is that she neither likes the taste nor the effect, and so alcohol simply isn't a part of her life. When I learned this I was so happy! Although my friends are wonderful and supportive, it sometimes gets lonely being the only sober one. I decided to tell this girl that I'm a recovering alcoholic. I was nervous since I didn't know her very well, but she turned out to be so great about it. She didn't ask any invasive questions, just smiled and told me she also thought it would be nice to have someone to be sober with. Apparently she sometimes gets comments about how she is weird for not drinking, and she said she was happy that the two of us can be weird together.

We've been becoming good friends since then, and I really am so glad I met her. She is an awesome person, quiet but insightful, with a quick wit, and a lot of kindness. She's been supporting me just by being there, the two us sitting together when other people are drinking, talking and having fun without alcohol. One time she told me about her siblings, who do drink, and who often gift each other wine for birthdays and Christmas. She was beaming when she told me that her siblings have always respected that she doesn't drink, and instead of wine will give her these really fancy and expensive bottles of apple juice as a gift. I remember thinking that seemed pretty great, but I didn't give it much thought beyond that.

My birthday was a little over a week ago. I didn't have a big celebration, just a quiet dinner with my friends, although she ufortunately couldn't be there. I was opening gifts when I saw that someone had bought me a bottle of something. It was wrapped, but you could tell from looking at it that it was shaped like a wine bottle, and it didn't have a card or anything saying who it was from. I got really nervous, I was afraid one of friends bought me wine as a prank or something, and I swear my hands were shaking when I started opening the gift.

It wasn't wine though. Instead it was a really fancy bottle of apple juice.

I immediatley knew who bought it, and I just started laughing and couldn't stop. It was such a great gift, from such a great friend. I hadn't even expected her to buy me anything, and when I called and said thank you she actually apologised for making me think it was wine. Turns out there was a card, but it must have fallen off, and in it she had written something about the gift being her favourite and hoping I enjoyed it. I assured her that I loved the gift, and also made sure to tell her how much I appreciate her friendship, how wonderful it is to have someone I can be sober with, the two of us being weird together.

I'm just so grateful to have her as a friend. I opened her gift today and celebrated my 160 days with apple juice. IWNDWYT!",30

I didn’t see anything wrong with it. I was in my 20s having fun. I had no idea what i was really doing was just masking my pain. Not processing that I had lost the most important person to me. I never cried over it. I never faced it. 

When my daughter was born, I kept it up. Alothough I knew deep in my heart at this point I had a problem. The hangovers were worse, I was tired all the time. I was being a person I didn’t want my daughter seeing as she grew up. 

I’ve blacked out more times then I’d like to admit. Work was stressful, first time parent not knowing what the hell I was doing. 

The morning after my last black out I came here and cried so hard while, while telling my story and asking for help. 

I vowed never to drink again, If I was to do anything right in life it would be to become a positive person in the presence of her. 

I checked in here daily for the first few months. It was more help than I could have ever imagined. 

Months then passed. At first I was concerned about what people would think. I never really got any words of encouragement, then I realized no one else could really sympathize because they themselves didn’t understand the hell I was creating for my self. 

I kept going, no drinks ever. I’d meet people who said they were not drinkers but they would have a glass of wine after work, or on vacation, or in celebration. That not why I ever drank. I could never EVER have just one drink. I realized I never drank because I liked the taste, or to socialize. I drank to get my self obliterated, to be fucked up. I really really really liked the physical feeling of being completely drunk. Only to wake up and face the same obstacles. 

During this year I never missed drinking. I noticed in times of stress, my instinct was to reach for a bottle. My first thought. Heart pounding, chest tight, I just wanted to gulp down scotch until I didn’t feel it. That’s no reason to drink. 

Stress, negative thoughts, hard times, these are a part of life, and there is no refuge in the bottle. Only hiding and you can’t hide there for ever. 

Never will I literally drink while driving again. Never will I drink straight out of the decanter. Never will I drink in front of my daughter. Never will I waste another dollar on $17 cocktails. Never will I throw up and be excited that there’s now more room in my belly for more booze. 

I fucking hate alcohol. I fucking hate stress. 

I am my own person. I love myself. I will live this life without the fear of being shackled to the bottle. 

Most of all, I can now be the best father I could be to my abilities, and my daughter will grow up knowing a father who is truly present for her. At night and in the mornings. 


To the folks coming in here seeking an answer, looking for help. YOU CAN DO IT TOO! Don’t rely on anyone else but yourself. It may feel like it’s too late, it may feel like your losing a friend. Life is so much sweeter when your not drunk. Do not fret. There is happiness in your life, and it comes with out trying, day by day. Never give up. I love you and you can do it!

Thank you all for your words of encouragement, even if they were directed towards others, it changed my life for the best.",200

I've noticed one of the reasons I drank; it was a way to unwind, to rid myself of pent up frustration/anxiety. Something which numbed the feeling of being 'on edge',.

I still feel it now, even after exercising. I've packed up my weekends and kept myself incredibly busy. I have this sort of fear though, I'm kind of afraid to spend the day sitting in Reading. It's like I'm scared to just allow myself to mellow out, can any of yous relate to this? If so, how do you deal with it?

I was sad about not drinking and maybe missing out on that great local stuff, but we did not miss out at all! 

Yesterday was alittle tough. We are moving next month and started moving some stuff into storage. Also had lots of chores at home and errands to run. It was a busy and kinda frustrating day at times. We both wanted to drink, acknowledged it, but stayed alcohol free. We did quite a bit of retail therapy as well, but nothing that was outside of our budget.

Today is day 8 and the longest amount of alcohol free days I've had in a row since the middle of October last year.

Today, I've been sober and smoke-free for 14 days. When I get my cravings, I either drink tea or eat a piece of fruit. Green tea and tangerines to be precise. The tangerines are particularly helpful because they are sweet enough to act as an alternative to sweets, and they're cheaper compared to most other fruits.

The past four days were difficult. Saturday was the Lunar New Year Day. It's one of the biggest holidays in Korea, so we had a four-day weekend starting from Friday to Monday. Weekends and days off work were when I usually got more trashed than usual. I'm sure others can relate, but the desire to drink gets worse when I have to put up with extended family members. But I didn't drink or smoke. As a treat to myself for a job well done, I bought some strawberries and Earl Grey tea.

I know that this doesn't undo all the things that I did to others and to myself over the years.  Though this journey so far has helped me to feel better about myself, it doesn't fix the things that I did. That's a different journey that I will have to take at a later time.

Mondays are always terrible for me. I run my own business and monday is the bookkeeper day. I process payroll. Handle bank deposits. A lot goes on and being money it makes me very anxious. 

Typically on a Sunday night/Monday morning I’m up from 3am-6am worrying and thinking non-stop about...everything! All while self medicating with swigs of vodka, tequila or wine...yes at 6 am too. 

Today I woke up early and well rested with a clear head. I’ve already plowed through half of the daily work(it’s 7am) which I usually can’t finish until 8pm because I spend the day drinking to calm the nerves. 

The weirdest part?  I usually am anxious and freak out over little stuff. Last week I blew the motor on my truck and found out on Friday that I am facing a possible $56,000 repair bill. No warranty. No insurance.  When I first got word I thought immediately about picking up a bottle. But I didn’t. 

Just 3 weeks ago I would have been a total wreck. Up all night, worrying, panicking, everything. Granted I’m not pleased with the situation and it’s going to take some major financial sacrifice on my end but I am handling it with a calm mind while continuing to work on my business and my sobriety. 

I’m really really happy and very very proud of myself this morning. I’m damn near in tears. I hope anyone and everyone who reads my post today finds a way to battle this son of a bitch and is able to feel even just a little bit better about themselves. 

We are worth it.

Periods of controlled drinking followed by binges, missed days at work, regret, promises to myself to quit, anxiety, depression, self loathing, money problems, letting people down, missed appointments, putting things off, being lazy, and just not being engaged with the people around me.

I had a dry October and to my surprise I actually had a good time. My constant anxiety left me, I enjoyed being around people and life just became more manageable. I was shocked at how easy it was. However, the 1st of November came and within a few weeks I was a mess again. I bumbled through Christmas wishing it was over and decided to have another dry month. I decided to really assess my feelings throughout. Every day I compare how I feel to when I'm drinking, how productive I am, how I engage with people, how much I've spent, my anxiety and mood, my energy, my relationship with my partner, the list goes on. The difference is incredible. I'm just a happier person. I'm on day 25 and the rest of the month is in the bag. So I had a talk with my partner yesterday. We discussed the possibility of one weekend a month going to pub and satisfying my social need. I do miss the banter with people in the pub and the warm cosy feeling after 2 or three pints but in reality I always drink more and the next day is ruined. My long history has shown me that it won't end there. I will end up 'getting a cure' on Monday  and before long I'm very ill. So I'm going for a dry February aswell. I think it best for me to take manageable steps at total sobriety. I know I can do a month at a time. I'm feeling strong at the moment but I now things can change in a moment. I'm trying to stay real and keep comparing a drinking life to a sober one. I've got to be vigilant. Reading your stories is a great help as I can relate in many ways and it's nice to know I'm not alone in my fears and struggles.

Few days later she breaks the rule tells me about hers and asks me about mine. To which I say I am not your psychologist and I told you I don't want to know.

The stuff she told me wasn't even that bad, doesn't bother me so much, what bothers me is that she said it at all, its like having no respect for the boundaries we set at the beginning. So we all know what I did, I left her, she got annoyed that I left her saying I gave her no choice, I said well you gave me no choice telling me things I didn't want to know so I don't really think that inspires trust in the future and she blocked me as if it's somehow all my fault.

Years ago, or even in the last relationship if a girl had done this (one did, actually) and I tried to leave her but she wouldnt really let me (you know begging non stop calling at the door that sort of stuff) but when she decided that she wanted to leave a year later I didn't get any say of course! :P. So years ago, I would've probably drank because they ruined my trust and probably drank to stay with them because well 'she is beautiful' or ' I cant be bothered finding someone else', this time not so much, i have enough respect for myself to stick to what I said and walk away and it's very liberating.  
I just realise I used to drink to keep myself content in situations I shouldn't be content in, so if anyone can relate to this, I can let you know I have been way happier alone, sober and not sacrificing myself for the sake of a relationship.

2020-01-27 02:00:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eukexg/acts_of_kindness_aok_monday_devotion/,Acts of Kindness (AoK) Monday: Devotion,"Hi everyone!

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we share about AoK which have touched us this past week. It can be AoK to ourselves, to others, to animals, or to the environment we live in. It can be AoK which we've performed, received, observed, or heard about secondhand or through the media. Any AoK which has touched us is fair game.

I was browsing the Internet for something to post about for this week’s AoK, and I remembered a conversation that I’d had with a friend a while back about the high incidence of alcoholism among people who are disabled. Apparently having limited mobility greatly increases a person’s risk of developing alcohol use disorder. So I thought that it might be appropriate to post something related to that.

I was thrown for a loop when my search for news stories related to alcoholism and disability led me to the obituary of a woman I knew. I knew that she had passed away. I knew that she worked for a nonprofit. I had no idea that she was a disability activist. 

I first met her almost five years ago at a Saturday morning women’s AA meeting. Three and a half years later, she was still attending the same meeting, when I came back. She went to the same meeting as often as she could for something like twenty years.

I don’t want to paint her as some sort of saint. She was human, she used the meeting appropriately to share what was going on, and I could identify with her as a fellow alcoholic. And I don’t claim to have known her well, I just knew her from the meeting. But she left a lasting impression on me. She gave me a strong example of how I want to live my life in sobriety, and she gave me a strong example of how to face death with courage and dignity.

I’m incredibly touched to realize how much of her daily life was spent helping others. She never made a big deal about it, but she clearly lived a life of service to others. She was a helluva person.

I’m glad that I had the opportunity to know her. And I’m grateful that she was still active in her recovery, so I had the opportunity to learn from her example. She was there when I first showed up, and she was there when I came back.

This week I’d like to acknowledge the people who stay active in their recovery after they get sober. It is a tremendous AoK to others to stick around in order to pass on what you’ve learned. I’m sober today because of people who were here on SD and in real life support groups, waiting, when I was ready to ask for help. 

*’Devotion’*

*The heart can think of no devotion*

*Greater than being shore to ocean -*

*Holding the curve of one position,*

*Counting an endless repetition.*

*-Robert Frost*

So that’s me for this week, sobernauts. How about everyone else, any AoK that you’d like to share?",18

*It's sunny
I never knew how much of a trigger this was until these last few days!  It gets so hot and all I can think of is a nice cold drink. My alcohol-craving brain will find it hard to remember that a cold soft drink is just as good. 

*I deserve a drink to reward myself for the day's work.

*I'm driving into town
There is nowhere to buy alcohol where I live, but plenty of places in town.

*starting a new job might cause some emotions or anxiety that I don't want to feel.

*it's a rest day on my training programme,  and the following day is a light day.
I will try to convince myself that drinking tomorrow will not impact my next big training on Thursday.  It probably would. Also I have to work on Wednesday too, so shouldn't be hungover for that.

2020-01-27 00:45:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eujn66/strength_after_stopping/,Strength after stopping,"Hey everyone, first visit here. But I wanted to share my story here to connect with some people who have or will go through the same thing.

So I am going on a month now of not drinking. I decided on this month because January has the least number of events which I would have to fight against. As background, I live in Japan, so drinking is an ingrained part of the culture and a part of business. At an after work gathering, everyone will order the exact same drink, so there is not even the option of choice. (In the US I feel people tend to order the drink of their preference, so it is easier to skate by no alcohol)

I do enjoy a nice craft beer, and I was always good about not drinking alone. But over my many years of drinking, I have built up a very strong tolerance, which I wore like a badge of courage. So when I did go out, I would drink inhuman amounts. I noticed at a festival last year that my habit became Get a drink, dance till it’s gone then immediately go back and get another one. And it felt like my entire time at the festival was spent going back and forth between bar and dance floor because it gave me something to do. But felt wrong afterwards.

As far as other precursors, I have had nights I don’t remember the second half of. I have never had a very strong memory in general but I wouldn’t be surprised if that is in part from a long history of alcohol. 

Another thing that happened in the past year which was a bit scary was after a night of heavy drinking, I would wake up at 7 am the next day with a very rapid heart rate. This happened maybe 4 times over the year and it is definitely an effect of drinking to excess. So there were physical signs of distress from overdrinking.

So over the past month, I didn’t consider it to be hard to not drink; I found it hard to say no to the social contract essentially requiring it. The culmination was this past weekend where I was going to live shows on Saturday and Sunday in addition to my friend having a birthday party which was all-you-can-drink. A drink would be perfect after dancing around for hours. And a friends birthday: of course you have to celebrate! At first I gave myself an out: “It is okay to make an exception only for my friends birthday. What better time to finish the no-drinking period than a friend’s birthday” but when the time rolled around I was proud of how far I’d come that I wanted to challenge myself to get through it.  Sure enough, I made it through the night, even after being handed multiple drinks. It was the weekend I was most likely to break, and now the weekend that I am most proud of.

As I mentioned, the difficulties were mostly the social side. One friend said to me “Stop this boring not-drinking.” And the friend whose birthday it was said “ You better at least have one at my party.” These guys are actually really good friends and really supportive usually. So I came to realize statements like this are only an impulsive response.

It is something unusual for them which causes them to recoil, but they know it is a positive decision. Misery loves company (and honestly, so does fun), but either can be created from the environment. Not reliant on the substance.

When everyone was ready to go home after the birthday party, something eerie happened. We were all tired and ready to hop in our taxis. One fellow from the party, who has the same name as me, kept asking “Who wants to go for one more drink?” No one felt like it but he kept asking. He even went around the circle one by one to ask individually who wants to get one more. And me being totally sober, it was like looking into a mirror of what I would be doing had I chosen to partake, and it was a bit alarming and certainly eye opening to plainly see that attachment.

I’m glad I chose to do this month of no-drinking. 

Going forward I do plan to let myself drink again because I do enjoy the taste, collective ritual, and it does have a role as a societal lubricant . But I plan to approach it the same way as going to a nice restaurant. Good once in awhile- appreciate the flavor and the company. There’s no need to be in a hurry to finish each drink quickly, get back to the bar and flood myself so much that my brain leaks out of my ears. And being able to get through this weekend, where every impulse told me I should have one but at the end of the day I did not cave, will be an example I will always have to remind myself to act with intention and follow the pace right for me. 

Good luck to everyone on their individual journeys and thank you for sharing in this one.

Working out more regularly

More confidence or at least less self criticism when conversing with people

An attractive girl told me she admires my discipline

One of my friends said I look like a multiverse Spider-Man

No hangovers

My friend wants to quit drinking too

Cons:

I do miss drinking socially

Anxiety still comes up

Tobacco and caffeine intake have increased

Phone use is up

I know the pros outweigh the cons and I have no intention of drinking again anytime soon. Think are looking up.

Other times, I can’t stop myself after that one. So, I didn’t risk it and had a Diet Coke. 

I think it really hit me that alcohol abuse is something I’ve struggled with. That I could have had one but it could have turned into so much more, and I cannot control when that will happen.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

In active addiction I was living such a lie and had virtually no self-esteem.  I seemed to blame everyone else for the situations that I, alone, created by my alcoholism.  Once I started to take back control of my life, little by little, I began to feel better about myself.  Each morning when I'd wake up, especially after a particularly hard night of saying 'NO' to my cravings, I was filled with such a sense of Gratitude for not giving in to my damn demon lizard brain.  Eventually, the power alcohol had over me became less and less.  It, by no means, happened overnight but I often tell of the time I was in the bathroom brushing my teeth... I was looking in the mirror and realized I hadn't thought --at all-- about drinking for many, many days.  I actually started to cry because in that instant, I realized that I was a ""Grateful *Recovering* Alcoholic.""  I promise, if you stick with it, the chains of addiction become increasingly lighter as Joy and Happiness become greater.

Literally,"Actually, three days from now will be 120, but I seriously think I'm losing my mind and I'm not sure if quitting alcohol is connected with what I'm experiencing. 

I'm having waves of depression, and I mean serious depression. It didn't start till a few weeks ago, but last week I cried for the first time on my lunch break. I can't explain why, other than just super depressed. I did it again Thursday night, and again Friday morning. I was so depressed Friday morning, that I was late for work. Coworkers/employees notice something is wrong with me, but they aren't sure. I wrote a suicide note today on my laptop when I was having another low point. I'm hesitant to share too many details, as I'm not sure how private/safe/secure reddit is. I did try the chat feature of the suicide prevention website twice today, only to get an error when it was my turn after waiting. I just tried calling, but when they tried to connect me after hold music played, I just got a busy signal. How ironic.

I hear and see things that make me doubt my sanity (see reaching out to suicide prevention 3 times today and it not working). It's more I question reality. I hear people talk or tell stories and many times I can't grasp their point or understand their point of view. A family friend was telling me about neighbor of their's that is supposedly a pretty bad guy and the entire neighborhood is shocked by his actions. When she explained them to me, I couldn't understand what he had done that was so terrible. I've been in this position a few times now that I can tell when I am missing the point, and just kind of agree with the group, but it makes me question why can't I grasp simple points of a story that everyone around seems to be grasping. This is becoming very common, which concerns me, as people used to tell me I had the 'gift of gab' or was 'born with a silver tongue' and could shoot the breeze with anyone I came across. Now, it seems I can't grasp basic conversation points.

I've stopped talking to all my 'friends' since I stopped drinking, so my only real social interaction is when coworkers/employees. I don't have much of a family, just my dad and his GF. I talk to them occasionally, but rarely see them in person. I'm not sure if this is just a reaction to me becoming extremely anti social as I quit drinking, or my brain adjusting to lack of alcohol, or what. I wasn't a daily drinker really, as much as I was a binge drinker.  I'd drink every weekend and black out, and usually a night or two or three during the week. Pretty much blacked out every weekend since I was about 21.

Anyway, mental issues after you quit drinking. Is this normal? I don't remember being like this at all 4 months ago, but then again, when you black out often, there is a lot you don't remember. Was I a functioning mental alcoholic? Is this some long term withdrawals? Is the timing just coincidence?",6

I’ve been saying this for a while, but I’ve  reached a point to where I need to do something about it. I went to my first AA meeting last week. Unfortunately I can’t say that I have stayed sober since then. I’m going again tomorrow so the plan is to keep moving forward and hopefully start counting the days. 

The problem is, I am young. As a 26 y/o when I’ve confided in people in the past about my drinking, I would say I think I’m an alcoholic they would tell me that I was being silly. Of course hearing this outside perspective, I would believe them. The fact is, I use my face well. No one expects sweet me to be an alcoholic. I have gone into obligations so hungover and play it off as not sleeping well. I’ve gone into work drunk and no one knows because unless I’ve completely overdone it I’m pretty functional. I’ve spent money at the bar even though I wasn’t making ends meet. Once I start I don’t stop after one or two. I keep getting one more and saying it’s my last one...then I get another and say the same thing. This happens 4/5 nights a week. The nights that I don’t drink is usually because I’m so tired/hungover and upset with myself for doing it again, just to drink excessively again the very next day. The people in my life don’t see this though. I’ve hidden a lot of it. Now that I want to quit I’m terrified to tell anyone in fear that people will talk me out of it.  I’m not married or have kids, my social life literally revolves around going to the bar. The one person who knows and is supportive I’ve been too ashamed to tell that I haven’t stayed sober. 

So I guess this is where I’m at in life right now. I just really want to stop.",5

I found that since quitting drinking my sugar cravings have been off the charts. 

If you go to AA, there's always a bunch of candy on the table. Getting sober is hard and you should be able to pig out on sugar while you are resetting you brain and habits. 

I found when I stopped drinking, I loaded up on candy and sugar to combat the cravings.
But DATES (if you like them) are only 20 calories each and you can crush 10-15 without feeling guilty.

Not only that, they are packed with nutrition and are surprisingly low on the glycemic index when comparing something like twix bars or Butterfingers.

Chocolate has its place but you can buy a decent size bag of dates for about $3.50 at the grocery store.

Dates are delicious and satisfy the sweet craving and won't add a ton of calories when considering Butterfingers are 85 calories each.

Had a great time, tried some new foods and downed a couple of diet colas and lime. I feel that it was a really good personal bonding experience with ppl I should have gotten to know better a long time ago.

Saturday I was on such a high from the previous night that I decided to reach out to some friends that I basically abandoned two years ago. We met up Saturday night at a pub and I kept to the cola and lime drinks. Had a great time. 

I've been feeling pretty good lately. My face has cleared up, I've lost weight, have less anxiety and my work game is improving. 

I decided today to see a doc about my adhd. No way I would have ever considered this if I was taking the poison. 

I read posts and comments from this thread every day and it gives me extra strength. The stories are so damn familiar. I don't feel alone in this.

Or so I thought. I picked up the wrong drink by accident and took a big swig as I normally do in that scene, turns out it was real whiskey in that glass! I couldn’t spit it out as we were in the middle of a run through but, even if I was drinking- whiskey would NOT be my drink of choice! Fuck it tasted horrible. I didn’t drink any more of it and didn’t want to. Did make me wonder who was having s a real whiskey though. 

I even felt weird and woozy afterwards and went for a walk outside during the break and you know what? I really didn’t enjoy the ever so slightly loose and ‘out of it’ feeling that small amount gave me. 

Maybe I actually like being the slightly nervous, self conscious, constantly worried, mildly stressed version of me, rather than the sloppy, overly sharey, boozy, couldn’t give a fuck but can’t remember anything either, version of me? 

You never really escape yourself do you? You just forget, or black out or do something stupid, or say something you regret or hurt yourself or worse, others. 

Maybe learning to like the actual me is better than building a fake persona around a bottle of bullshit that never delivers on its fake promises.

I'm on my way home from a 100-day work trip in a country where alcohol was unavailable.  I have to keep thinking back to the night sweats and withdrawal symptoms of day one to keep me focused on why day 103 is so important. This is far from my first time returning from forced abstinence. I've been on this cycle for over 10 years. For a long time, I would convince myself that I didn't have a drinking problem, I went through month-long periods of abstinence so I could drink as much as I wanted in-between. Over the past couple of years, I started to realize that my habit was totally excessive. Most people don't drink to get hammered on a daily basis. So like any rational person, I tried to cut down on drinking when I was home. Only beer on the weekends, no more whiskey. This never lasted and always reverted back to beer and booze every day. I would only hide it on the weekdays so my wife didn't see how much I drank. I'm pretty sure my wife with over 5 years of sobriety isn't fooled in the least. So today I sit here with firm resolve that I am going to do my damndest to never drink again because I cannot have just one or 2 drinks no matter how much I think I can control it. One drink may as well be 8 because that's right around my daily average.  

I'm looking forward to getting home to my pregnant wife and daughter and being there for them, present and sober for the first time since my daughter was born. Yet even as I sit here typing this and fantasizing about how great that is going to be, I feel the conflict from my inner alcoholic trying to rationalize all the fantastic reasons why a couple of drinks would be such an outstanding idea. Even though I've been sober for this long and I've been to the meetings and failed, and I know all about my condition and have accepted it, I still try to convince myself that it is something that is within my control. My internal alcoholic dreads the idea of lifelong sobriety and is down to fight to get its way. I really hope that son of a bitch doesn't win this time. I want to be a good husband and father and I can't stand the idea of my  2 daughters growing up with a drunken dad lost in his delusions. So here's too day 103 even though right now I kinda feel like it's only day one.",8

It sucks. It sucks that even though this weekend for me was one I will always cherish, I know that I’m going to have to deal with that feeling for the rest of my life. The best we can do is confront it, tell it that it’s not wanted here, tell it to hit the road. And do it every day. For the rest of our lives. Because it’s the way it is now. It’s better.

I was also told that I look a lot like him. So I've always been conscious of how much I drink. I was unable to enjoy any social function if there was no alcohol and I was gaining weight because of the empty calories in beer and so on. 

I told a friend of mine that I wished to stop drinking completely. Since he works with people who have addictions he put me in touch with someone specialised in alcohol. We talked at length and he put me in touch with a doctor. I had already cut out alcohol completely by the time I had this conversation, but the doctor kind of panicked and told me that it was dangerous for me to stop so suddenly. I think that he thought that I was drinking much more than I really did. So he immediately put me on a medicine for a few days to ease me off alcohol. But what really did the trick was another medicine that I had read about and which I asked him for. He prescribed it. It is called Disulfiram. You take a pill every day and you are warned that if you drink any alcohol you will have a very unpleasant and serious reaction. More over you cannot stop taking the pills for a while because you feel like a drink, because they remain in your system for a couple of weeks even if you stop taking them. At first it was difficult to stop seeing friends who were more like drinking buddies. But slowly I learned to go to bars and drink non alcoholic drinks. After 2 or 3 months I felt confident enough to stop taking the pills. I had learned how to change my behaviour and enjoy social occasions without drinking. 

One of the first good things that I noticed was that I started losing weight and I could wear clothes I liked. I also took up going to the gym and you feel amazing when you see your body transform.",15

Try to figure out what it is about a whiskey that I miss. It isn’t a craving so much, not something I reach for in a triggered rush to feel numb. It’s something I miss. Something I feel like I never got closure from. Something I need to say goodbye to. I find myself thinking maybe I should have one last drink to savor and then I’ll feel at peace. But then I get all paranoid and think that that’s what my addiction wants me to think! It wants me to have one last, knowing that I’ll have a decent experience and I’ll stop at one. That time. But that positive conditioning will trick me into thinking I can handle it when I know better. I do like myself better sober. I feel more myself. But I feel like I’m in a constant state of questioning my own thoughts and it is fucking exhausting. All this over a drink? Jesus.

I love golfing, and I know myself well enough to know that I would not give the game up, even if it was an obstacle to sobriety.

I went out today to play 18.  Here's the differences between my sober play and drunk play:

Drunk Price:  Usually $25-$30 for the round, plus a couple bloody marys at $5 a pop before tee off, then around another $20 for beers to take out on the course, then another $20 at the turn to refill the cooler, then a $50 or so tab at the bar after.

Sober price:  Today's round was $20, I bought a bottle of gatorade at $3.50, and spent another $3.50 for a hot dog at the turn.

Advantage:  sober golf coming in at about $100 cheaper.

Also, I played much better, and didn't throw any clubs when I had bad shots like I typically would.  I came home with more golf balls than I left with.  Also, got back home two hours earlier than I usually would, and instead of passing out on the couch for the rest of the day, I have energy to still enjoy some weekend before monday.

Sorry, I'm rambling.  I just think sometimes it's really important to take stock of your gains and losses when you are cutting such a routine part of your daily life out.  All these years I thought booze was the enhancer, and really it was the obstruction.",87

Never thought I'd be able to quit cold-turkey, but here we are and I'm a better man for it. Here's my journey:

- Two days worth of near dealthy hangover
- $$$ spent stupidly on final night of drinking
- Realization of mistakes made
- Being open with my wife about mistakes
- Many hours of tears and figuring out the way forward
- Multiple sessions of couples counseling
- Trying to decide how to move forward with my addiction and inability to stop drinking
- Decided to go on my journey alone with no AA or outside counseling (definitely don't recommend for everyone, but it works with my personality type)
- Joined a gym to relieve stress and ensure I don't go into depression
- Opportunity to travel and work through issues with my wife; she has been my absolute rock and complete support system through it all - I owe her the world for her strength and her grace
- Found out a few months later that we were to have a kid
- Worked hard at my job due to not being in a constant fog and hangover
- Identified as a leader in my company and invited to help set the direction for the strategy of my work group
- Vacationed some more with wife before our child arrived 
- Wife gave birth to our son and I have never been more grateful for her and her support through this journey we're on (as in it's not about the destination, but a life long marathon that I will have to work at to avoid falling back into my old ways); I couldn't imagine trying to do fatherhood with how I was previously.

Last spring I was sober for about 6 weeks or so, not sure exactly. 

Over the summer and fall was drinking pretty much daily. Realized in December that even though it was not ruining my life I was sometimes blacking out, posting, texting, or saying things that were a little embarrassing, eating poorly because of hangovers, and feeling like total shit and/or wasting fulls days just for drinking - which wasn't getting me much of anything in return. 

Decided to stop in December, made it a few days, then fell off. Decided Jan 1st I was done, made it 6 days, then fell off. Now I'm at 10 days. That's the longest sober stretch since last spring. 

Next goal (beyond one day at a time) is 30 days.  
Next after that will be 90 days - probably the most I've been since I was about 17.

I'm an alcoholic and I've been drinking to a problematic degree (off and on) for the past 7 or so years. I've had periods of sobriety from alcohol but I never actually took suggestions. Every time I was clean, I was a dry drunk. I didn't get honest with myself or anyone around me. I thought that because I hadn't gotten arrested, incarcerated, fired from my job, or homeless that my problem wasn't 'that big of a deal'. I didn't realize that HATING MYSELF means that my life is UNMANAGEABLE. I didn't confront any of the issues that are the root of my alcoholism. I thought I could do it all on my own. I guess I had to fail at that about 30 times too before reaching my hand out for help.

So a few days ago I reset my badge on r/stopdrinking for the third time this month. A few days ago I also reached out to some sober friends who are in AA and I told them that I needed help. It was hard because now there are other people who can hold me accountable. People who will check in on me. People who will show up at my house and take me to a meeting even when I don't want to go. And that interferes with the narrative in my mind that I had gotten so comfortable with - that precious alcohol will be there to make my problems disappear. But fuck that narrative.

I'm in control of my own life and I'm going to treat myself and my body with kindness instead of poisoning it and betraying myself on a near daily basis. I'm releasing the idea that alcohol makes me fun and makes life easier. I'm remembering to ask myself ""AND THEN WHAT?"" when I start to think drinking is a good idea.

Most importantly I'm going to keep asking for help. And when someone reaches their hand out to help me, I'm going to take it. I will not drink with you today.",23

I knew there would be copious booze around me and plenty of people getting smashed. The temptation was very strong last night, even far enough to pour a cup of punch and stare at it. At that point I realized I had already been having a lot of fun and all this punch would add would be a shitty morning the next day and the potential to embarrass myself. This helped me realize that my sobriety is more important to me than some temporary added euphoria. Proudly on day 20 still.

But I thought I'd like to share what happened to me this weekend, so many posts here have helped me, who knows, maybe sharing this little story might help someone. It's a bit long but it's my weekend story!

Here it goes...
Much love and good vibes, coming from the heart...

Friday night, 2 beers, 3, 4, ok may as well, i deserve it, life is tough, hard week, 10 beers deep, on to harder drugs later on. No sleep. On to saturday. Get out of bed stumble to the fridge, to the shower. Need to get ready for a wedding.
Shower, gag, shower beer, rinse. Get ready. Suited up. Dont look toooo bad, I think. Eye drops and gum. Head to the bar to meet a friend, two beers and a greasy sandwich.

On to the wedding 

2 beers at the cocktail... I feel like shit, no sleep, hungover, coming down. Alrite if I just get smashed I'll be ok. Few more beers and I'll be fine.

Head to the lunch. Sit at the table. The conversation is wildly boring. A girl starts bad mouthing immigrants as what she feels is a funny contribution to an already awful conversation.
Racist. Bitch. Jesus, this... this sucks, I feel like shit and this racist making angry and bringing me down, you know what... fuck this, I know I'm better than her I just need to love myself more, I cant stand this anymore. But im not a shit person I know I'm not.

Starters. Wine with the meal sir? Hand over glass. Main meal. Wi... hand over glass. Dessert. 

The main party. An open bar. All the booze you could want and free. Whiskey, gin tonics, vodka. I have found my calling my friends... sparkling water with ice and a slice of lemon, god damn it's so refreshing. 

2, 3 of them. Bro you need to slow down. Nah man its sparking water with ice. Ye right! They know me I'd normally be black out. A wedding?? Get out of here. Really it is, try it. Oh shit, they eye me suspiciously, I'd normally be black out by now. I look back and shrug and go back to the conversation. Actually make a coherent joke, at this hour I'd be a bumbling mess drooling and staggering.

Made a new friend, exchanged numbers, let's meet for dinner next week, Mexican food. I remember the conversation. 

Had a shuffle on the dance floor, didnt fall over, didnt piss my pants, didnt bad mouth anyone didnt make a scene, did tell the bride she looked beautiful. Went home, safely.

Got home well hydrated. Slept. Woke up, I'm not feeling 100% but I'm not hungover.

Get a bad phone call, family issues. Oh man I'm not hungover, this sucks but I can handle this. 

Head outside it's a beautiful day. Sun is beaming.

Lunch, coca cola, friends, sex, music, food a fire place the sun is shining an afternoon market at the city square maybe all of these things can be enjoyed. 

Dude maybe this is life this is what happiness could be. Life. A series of events. Maybe it wouldn't be bad to remember these evente. 

Fuck drinking fuck hangovers and thank you to the racist at my table at the wedding for making me realize I can be a better person.

Planning my week around that and IWNDWYTD.

Much love and good vibes to anyone having a hard time out there. 

Day 1 here, but really think I'm going to stick this one out. 
Change in mentality.

I had been doing dry January, and had joined this subreddit to feel motivated, and also to have some support and camaraderie with everyone going through a like situation. 

One of the recommendations from you good people was to read This Naked Mind, which I have been doing, and although I agreed with a lot of what the author (Annie Grace) spoke about, I didn't agree with one thing, and that was that I didn't really like the taste of beer. 

If anything was certain, I liked the taste of beer, and even though I wasn't drinking for January, I had stocked up on some of my favourite beers.

All things were going great, I was feeling a lot better, was exercising again, losing weight, not so much snoring in bed (the wife was delighted), no headaches, no lethargy, all indicators were really really positive, but there was something bothering me.

What next? So if I complete dry January what next? It's my birthday in February, will I go out for a meal and drinks? The wife loves parties, will I be dragged off to a party and just go straight back to drinking? I was concerned that a party atmosphere or Peer pressure could put me in a situation I couldn't handle.

So I decided to test myself, without birthday or party pressure. 

On Friday night (my favourite night for getting blitzed) I decided to crack open some of those favourite beers, and see if Ms Grace was correct or not.

So after 24 days of not drinking I tasted my favourite beer.

I didn't like it. That was a surprise. I tried a second, and didn't like that either. 

However by beer three I was into the swing of it, taste buds by now probably dulled by the alcohol. So I continued to drink the bottles as I would have done last year, and the question was would I just fall back into my pre New Year binge drinking?

The answer was a resounding YES, I managed to do that no problem, drank the same amount of bottles as I used to by the end of the evening.

On Saturday morning I woke up to the knowledge that I do not really like the taste of beer, and that when I pushed past that dislike, I continued to drink completely stupid amounts.

The result is that I now know for certain, that I do not want or need to drink, my subconscious mind wholly agrees with my conscious mind.

I am delighted to have found the truth for myself, and I will not drink with you today!",28

The thing about being an alcoholic is that it becomes all consuming. How will I get my next drink starts to dominate every waking thought. And this leads to all the behavior that we alcoholics recognize and abhor. We drink instead of working, we steel money, we hide our drinking from friends and loved ones. In the end the weight of this bad behavior takes a toll psychologically and we simply talk about self-loathing without going into much detail. 

But that self-loathing is real and in my case made me feel like I didn't deserve anything. I was a drunk. I did not deserve happiness, love, material things. Sure, I maintained a professional appearance, but I never felt like I deserved something just because. I just made do with the bare minimum of acceptability. 

Well I am happy to report that I am at a stage in my recovery where I feel empowered to get stuff because it makes me happy. The other day I splurged on all new underwear. I know - call me crazy or even reckless, but there it is. Gone are the elastic waistbands with shreds of cotton I called underwear and instead a drawer full of new boxers in different colors. I did it and damn I'm proud.

She was not very receptive, called the idea ""ridiculous"", and refused to acknowledge any harm or impact on my life caused by her \*extreme\* belittling.

My concern now is, any time she has been challenged in the past, she has threatened or attempted suicide. She is diagnosed as bi-polar. I'm concerned that she will have another suicide attempt, and my family will blame me for attempting to stand up for myself.

Does anyone have any experience with this? I plan to focus on my sobriety regardless, but I don't want to lose my younger sister.",3

Well, I always feel pretty miserable, I hate myself and almost everything about my life, but now without the familiar and sometimes comforting evening fuzziness of booze.

Uh yeah I'm on meds for the anxiety, depression etc, have been for many years, one of the main reasons I'm trying again is that the doc invariably tells me the most important thing is to stop drinking & I got so embarrassed about it I stopped going to see him. Really struggling to see the point though. There's half a box of cheap wine in the kitchen still and it'd be so easy... Not doing it, mainly because I suspect I'll just feel even more a failure if I do. Sorry, just whining. I'd talk to friends instead but see above. Well, I wouldn't, really, that's a total lie.

Anyone feel the overwhelming need to shake things up and own a new life?  My life is good, I just don’t know if I’m where I’m supposed to be?   This is probably more philosophical than anything else...maybe it’s a form of anxiety?

I stopped on the way home and bought a bottle and we shared it after dinner while we watched tv on the couch.

While I drank I felt a mixture of guilt for ruining my ""streak"" (which I acknowledge is kind of arbitrary and silly, but I felt it) and confident defiance of whatever little voice that had been holding me back from drinking. I thought: why should I have to skip enjoying wine? I can do this whenever I want and it will be FUN and NOT A PROBLEM!

It was a little fun, like egging and TPing a house is fun. You have a rush of doing something you know is a bad decision and damn the consequences. 

I had probably 3 glasses from that bottle and I made sure to note how I felt. I was primed by ""This Naked Mind"" to notice my own behavior and enjoyment level. I read the book after I stopped drinking a few months ago so I hadn't had this opportunity before now. Aside from the rush, it wasn't that fun. I started being louder and more obnoxious and my jokes weren't that funny.

We had great sex afterwards, though. Sober me will never match the lack of sexual inhibitions that drunk me has. 

I woke up this morning with a head full of cotton. I need to study for my grad school program and I'm finding it difficult to focus and retain information. I feel guilty for polluting my body and mind. The only good thing is I have a renewed commitment to sobriety.

I messed up again. Yesterday I drank a 6 pack beer, three strong beers (9% alcohol) and 200ml vodka. I got kicked out of the liquor store because I was too drunk. While I was drinking my vodka I became mentally unstable and called a crisis hotline which calmed me somewhat down. Today I felt a lot of shame. Many people from my neighborhood have seen me drunk and that really bothers me. It bothers me so much that when I'm sober I rather stay inside. I don't want to be seen. I have done so many crazy things when drunk for more than twenty years. And I really want it to stop. I haven't finished my college, I lost all my jobs, I ruined three relationships , I don't have any friends besides a few drinking buddies. I still have my health but if I don't stop now, I will lose that too. I really must stop.

I hope this post will motivate me to keep staying sober. I never been very active on social media. I never really shared my experiences with alcohol with anyone. I have been in rehab, but at the time I wasn't very motivated, I didn't really see the problem. I always had a somewhat hostile relationship with social workers.

Anyway, I've gone on this cycle probably 5 times over the past 10 years: I hit a very pathetic point in my drinking, scare myself into sobriety, and start a dry streak. After about 8 to sometimes 16 weeks, I feel so much better physically and mentally that I start to convince myself that I can handle alcohol consumption.

Ive visited with therapists during these dry streaks and for some reason or another I end up convincing myself to drink again. Rinse. Lather. Repeat.

Any help or advice would be appreciated.",4

The details are fuzzy, as dreams tend to be for me, but I was traveling with my SO, in some metropolitan area, at a bar in some hotel lobby or something. I picked up a glass of wine on the table and drank it almost instinctively. My SO looks at me like I'm crazy and says something to the effect of ""you can make your own decisions but I don't wanna deal with your bullshit."" I had instant feelings of regret and deep disappointment in myself, and I was incredibly relieved when I woke up and it was only a dream. But now the thoughts of ""would I really allow myself to do that? Is that what this dream is saying? What have I missed? What is it that I need to work on more?"" Have you ever had a dream like this? How did you rationalize it in your mind? Did you feel it meant anything deeper, or was it ""just a dream""? It's been 31 days since my last drink and this dream honestly has me just a little shook, it would be awesome to hear from some of you right now.",3

So I just celebrated 9 years of sobriety a couple weeks ago.  I'm very proud of this accomplishment.  In the beginning I attended a few AA meetings and just didn't like them.  No worries-- AA works for many and that's great!

Today I told an older (and also sober) gentleman that I'm 9 years sober.  He was thrilled and gave me a huge hug.  He then asked where my home group was and when I told him I don't have one because I don't go to meetings his face dropped.  He then asked me if I had a sponsor and I told him that I didn't, but that I was doing just fine.  He told me it was very dangerous to not go to meetings and that he was worried about me.

I think his comments were coming from a place of love and concern, but it made me feel kind of shitty.  I am proud that I have done this and it made me feel like I should be doing this sobriety thing a different way.  That I'm going about this journey the wrong way.

Can others that don't go to meetings and who remain sober chime in?

I’m in the middle of my 4th step and it’s become abundantly clear that this is not just about alcohol, it’s about starting a new life you’ll be in love with. Without that, your success diminishes. That’s not exclusive to AA: therapy and spirituality will tell you the same thing.

Whether you recognize the underlying issues through the 4th step or through the myriad other paths, you’ll likely find yourself at the same knowledge: you are a bit fucked up, as Russel Brand says.

Could be genetics, how you were raised, trauma, or just that substances agreed with you way too much. Regardless, you’ll need to address them to live a happy life. 

I’m at the beginning of my journey but have hit a few milestones that point to a truth that old timers share in this thread on a daily basis: it gets better, sometimes unbelievably so. At minimum, it doesn’t get worse.

Checking back in after far too long.,"Hey everyone, it's been a while since I posted here and I wish I had kept up better.  I could write a novel about the past year of my life, so I'll try to condense it as much as I can.  But will probably still be long.

I quit drinking on Dec. 31, 2019.  It was bad, but I was still working, lived in a great city, lived with my girlfriend, somewhat functional.  But I wasn't happy with any of it, and I've struggled with depression for my entire adult life.  Long story short, it progressively got worse and worse, as it always does, and the big kicker for me was moving in with this girl, it was affecting her big time, and I kept trying and trying to quit, but I always came back.  I was lying, hiding it, neglecting her and our relationship, just generally being a shit person, which I never wanted to be.  It was an unhealthy relationship in the first place, and both of us stayed in it for far too long due to codependency bullshit, and I think it was actually a big factor in my drinking, I was using it to escape a shitty relationship that I felt stuck in and felt too guilty to leave.  So she finally had enough and she left, thus kicking off my one year of sobriety, healing, and a fuck ton of emotional pain.  

The first few months were bad, really bad.  My depression and anxiety went into overdrive, I was hopeless, I wanted to kill myself.  I gave myself 6 months to a year, and if I still felt the way I was feeling, I was going to give up.  I'm fortunate enough to have a mom and brother who love me, and they're the reason that I've held on for so long.  They helped me through all of it immensely.  I quit my dead-end restaurant job, moved back home for about 3 months, I finally went to visit my brother in China (he lives/works there) and spent a couple weeks with him.  This kicked off the idea of me going to work overseas, which I'm currently doing.  I came back home, figured some shit out, and went back to Asia to complete a teaching certification, and I've been teaching in Asia for the past 5 months.  It was the scariest thing I've ever done, but I did it, and I'm super proud of myself.  I went from barely being able to get out of bed or to have a normal conversation with a friend, to standing up in front of rooms full of students and teaching them, something I never thought I'd be capable of doing.  I feel like I succeeded, I stayed sober, I overcame so much emotionally, I rebuilt my life and I didn't give up.  I was happier in general, overall.  Still dealt with the same emotional issues, still wanted to drink, but life as a whole was better.  It still is, I should say.  But I went from ""I'm never drinking again"" to just ""I'm taking a year off"", because I still wanted the social aspect of it.  I learned that a big factor in my drinking was social anxiety, and I missed being able to be social and meet new friends, go on dates, all that.  I just wanted to prove to myself that I could at least make it a year, and I did.  On New Years Eve, I was in a small town outside of the city with a friend of mine, and because of poor planning and random events, I ended up alone in a bar surrounded by New Years partiers, local people and expats all celebrating together, while I waited on 2020 to arrive and just sat and watched everyone, meeting a few friendly folks.  I checked my phone, and it had officially been 1 year since my last drink, like, to the hour.

So, I thought I'd just try it, slowly, and see if I could do it.  I wanted to remember what it felt like, and if maybe it would feel different now that I had gotten used to sober life.  I ordered a drink and sat at that bar, rang in 2020 with all the strangers, and it was alright.  I had a few more, I forgot that I had no tolerance anymore but I didn't go off the rails or anything.  My friend came to pick me up and we headed back to where we were staying.  I didn't drink for a few days after that.  Cool, I thought.  I went out for drinks with friends a few times, got tipsy but never got smashed, also cool.  I forgot how much I loved hanging out in cool bars in the city at night and I could do that again, also cool.  I wasn't knocking myself unconscious with straight vodka every night, just being a social drinker and having some fun here and there.  And I guess that's where I'm at now.  But, I know it won't stay that way.  I've already begun to feel that calling, every time you have a negative thought or feeling, you have the option now to drink it away.  Anytime you're stressed or anxious, now you've got a solution again, albeit a temporary one.  In general, I've felt more depressed again and have been feeling more and more anxiety.  I haven't been drinking every day, and the times I have, I haven't even gotten drunk.  But overall, things just feel more dark again, that familiar feeling that if you've dealt with depression before, you know what I mean.  I don't feel proud of myself anymore, I feel weak for giving in.  I had never felt proud of myself before, but I did last year.  The weird thing is, it doesn't feel as good as it used to, but I still want to do it.  There's no euphoria anymore, just grogginess and numbness, but it still calls to me for some reason.  I want to be a person who's strong enough to deal with all of life's bullshit on my own, without that crutch, and I want to feel proud of myself again.  So I guess I fucked up, but now I know better.  Thanks to anyone who read all this, this was the place that helped me so much through those first few months and beyond, and I look forward to being active here again.  Peace and love to you guys, I admire every one of you, even if you're on day 0.  Thanks.",25

We had to walk really far in the freezing cold bc parking was shit. They corralled us in like cattle on a southwest flight in numbered groups. Then they sat my husband and I at the TINIEST little table... where another couple was already sitting! I was super hungry and they didn’t have anything i liked on the menu. I had my super cute new leather spanx on (i looked amazing but felt as though I were in a vice). the opening comics were not that funny. You get the picture. At one point, my husband asked if I was ok (I no longer fake having fun when I’m not).
At last, the headliner came on and I started to enjoy myself and laughed my head off. I left feeling happy and was glad I went. So all and all... it was probably 60 not enjoyable / 40 enjoyable.  And guess what? THATS OK!! 
It’s actually ok that I didn’t have an epic time! I enjoyed the headliner and I don’t need to convince myself or anyone else that it was more than that. That is enough. In my past life it would not have been. I would need to have the insurance of getting drunk to know that I enjoyed myself a certain amount (of course I’d have been caught in the cycle and that drink would have provided relief) in case the evening wasn’t that great. Of course getting drunk would have rendered me a certain level of numb during the part that was actually enjoyable, in addition to the parts that weren’t. I should also mention that the last comedy show I attended sober WAS one of the funnest nights of my life and I laughed so hard I nearly asphyxiated. 
When sober I am forced to experience something for what it really is and that feels like relinquishing a certain level of control to me. I think I was terrified of that before. So much of this for me, has just been a matter of growing the fuck up. For every fun and enjoyable thing there are shitty parts that go along with it and there is no way of avoiding that without just delaying the suffering.  (I feel great today btw). I’m still working on my attitude, and trying not to be a wet blanket in situations where I’m perturbed, and to also balance that with being authentic and not faking enjoyment for myself or anyone else. It’s a work in progress. 
I know now that these are things I should have been learning in my 20s, but instead  I was busy learning to use alcohol in order to escape unpleasant experience and enhance the fun (this did not work out well for me). 
The moral of the story is that if you’re caught up in addiction, and feeling insecure about experiencing life without your crutch, insurance, whatever you call it... you’re underestimating yourself and LIFE. You can do it, and the best part is that when something is great, you experience the TRUE JOY of that moment. And if it’s not...  you get to  just MOVE ON with your life after. You’re not feeling like shit the next day, physically or emotionally. No it’s not all rainbows and butterflies... but it is better on this side of the drink. Thanks for listening. IWNDWYT",8

I was arrested for DUI when I was 21, 2.5 times over the limit, at 8 in the morning. I should have taken that as a sign, but I just chalked it up to being young and stupid. I continued drinking, and ended up on meth for a while, swore that off, got into coke for a couple of years after but that was way too expensive. All the while though booze has always been there. That being said, I've still managed to make considerable progress in my life, I work in a job I love where I get to interact with all kinds of well known people, I've even shaken hands with a few Presidents, I have a pilots license, though I haven't flown in a few years since most of my money goes to alcohol. 

I've tried to quit before, and tried to control it in every way I've read about on here; only drink on days off, only drink at home, only drink with friends, only on holidays, etc, etc., you guys know what I mean. It's lead to me continuing to smoke cigarettes, which I've tried to quit many times (I'll only smoke when I drink!), I haven't been to the gym in months, and I've lost considerable progress as a result. Every time I go out with friends I black out (unless it's a holiday and someone has cocaine), friends have had to order me cabs and put me to bed. When I drink at home I always wake up passed out somewhere around my apartment, I always wake up filled with regrets about the stupid decisions, and things I said the night before. The list of negatives goes well on.

I'll be 30 this year, and I'm being considered for a position that would literally be a dream-job for me. Last night though after having a few, and smoking a joint, I needed to go to the grocery store. My buzzed-up mind figured ""hey it's only three blocks, and it's freezing out, just drive there, it's not a major street"". Yes, I know, I'm a fucking idiot. Anyway. Sitting at a red light, a cop pulls up behind me, and mind you my tags are also expired (because I need to buy beer instead right?). He pulled up close enough that I knew he could see that my tag was out, then the lights came on. Then he pulled around me, out into the intersection, and booked it off down the road. I went back home and just drank it off. Then sitting in the shower this morning I broke down with the realization of what had almost happened. I would have lost everything I've worked for over the last decade, and been put right back to square one.

I hope you are doing well! I wanted to strongly suggest googling ""near death experience life reviews"" if you want to gain a stronger sense of context and meaning to this life. The amazing things I have read, incline me and many others to grant reality value to these phenomena. Including my until recently long term hard core atheist partner who is a scientist. 

So many of these accounts I have read have been heartening and beautiful. They have given me greater insight into the profound purpose and meaning of human life, and of the type of deeds that bring joy to the Great Spirit and have weight on the other side. These can be smaller than you think. We are powerful spirit beings and our smallest actions of love and compassion are seen and matter.

I felt something click for me a few hours after reading these accounts, and it was a sense of strength, power, responsibility and meaning that had previously been absent as I felt my desire for sobriety renew. I want to help others through being sober. I have been in a pretty hopelessly addicted place recently. Now I am much more free.

Thank for reading, hope it helps.",5

Nearly 25 days in and starting to break old habits, save money and just genuinely feel like myself for the first time in years. It's not a long stretch, but this is still the longest I've gone without drinking since I started drinking.

Anyway, in a few days I'm going to a work party to celebrate the end of the holiday season. It's a rooftop in Manhattan, open bar, hors d'oeuvres, the works; all in all a really nice gesture.

I absolutely have no intention of drinking, but I haven't told anyone because my reasons for doing that are personal and many. I don't know how to explain that to co-workers I'm friendly with but not friends with. They're all talking about how trashed they're gonna get, how we're all going to go out after, how they can't wait to see me drunk. I probably should have found a way to broach that earlier but I didn't, and now I feel like I'm gonna be explaining why I'm drinking Diet Coke the whole night.

This is not something I can skip, and I know it won't be the last time I'm in an environment where the expectation is to drink, let loose, etc. How do you all deal with these situations? I know this is a low stakes problem, but this is still new for me and I'm not sure what the best way to approach it is.",3

It’s not easy and I still want to drink. Really bad! I’ve been thinking about when I’m going to get smashed next! My birthday? This show I want to go to in a few weeks? Or next Tuesday? 

Then I think about all the stuff I got done these last 25 days. I think about my belt going down a notch. The 400 extra bucks I’ll have this month. The 750 piece puzzle I put together. The shotty ass scarf I crocheted. (That I’m still going to wear!)  Cooked everyday.  The list can go on, but you get it. 

Now I’m looking forward to the hike I’m going on tomorrow. Cleaning out my car. Not feeling like shit every single day. Saving money for 2021 thru hike.  Getting my body back.  Making planters for my garden. Actually having a garden. All of this can happen if I stay abstinent.  

Don’t get me wrong, I’m making it sound easier then it is. I’m still having anxiety and bouts of insomnia. I’m not sure if the craving will ever go away. Certainly the desire to drink has diminished. But it’s still there.

Another newcomer here, I stopped drinking a week (well, 8 days) ago. I've struggled with depression, anxiety and OCD for ages but never realized the extent of the problem due to drowning it in booze, let alone grasped the role that alcohol abuse has played in the misery. I knew for the past couple years that this daily *""one bottle of wine and a few beers regardless of whether I have work the next day""* habit has to stop, but I lacked motivation and ability to do it.

After feeling the worst I've probably ever felt mentally due to a minor setback while hungover, I decided this can't continue any longer.

The shame, guilt, self hatred, self anger and general depression then keeps me clean for 2-3 weeks before I feel better then the cycle starts again. My two recent lapses where early Decemebrr and this last Thursday.

I just want to break this cycle. But I cant seem too crack it. Sober me trains 5 days a week, runs 3 or 4 and eats well. I feel fantastic and then i feel like i need a reward for it all. And that is inevitably booze based.

I started Dry January early this year: I realised I was drinking out of pure habit, rather than enjoyment.

After my first 30 days, I've also realised that withdrawal symptoms were getting more difficult each time I stopped, which is a wake-up call for me.

These are the benefits so far:

* less anxiety and emotionally more balanced (no more shame for drinking again!)

* clearer skin and brighter eyes

* 6lb weight loss

* better sleep. Still taking time to get to sleep but sleeping a full night once I do. Melatonin is helpful.

* no constant internal dialogue about whether I'm an alcoholic or not.

* more productive, especially in the mornings.


I keep in mind that it takes 30 days to form a habit which is why I'm posting today. I have a habit of not drinking now!

Booze found its way into nearly every faction of my life.  I associated drinking with people, places, events, and activities. 
It was my cure for all the feelings, good and bad. 

Celebrate with alcohol and numb with alcohol.  Do the mundane with alcohol. 
Wake up with alcohol.  
Bring alcohol to work. 
Take a drive with some alcohol. 
Drink before, during and after tense family gatherings.  
Get shit faced at that wedding or barbecue or hockey game or random night with nothing else to do.  
Spend my hard earned money on exquisite booze with fancy flavors. 
Drink ipa by the case, liquor by the bottle.  Spend my mornings hungover with my kids as they are growing up way too fast, as they’re wondering why daddy is so angry and in so much pain, why daddy is too tired to play or even pay attention. 

You get the picture.  

Tonight I had a strong urge to drink.  I did some things sober tonight that I never have done sober before.  And it feels awesome now that I have overcome.  I can look proudly in the mirror tomorrow. 

Every day spent sober is a challenge accepted and accomplished.  I plan in having a lot more winning ahead.",10

I had my last drink two days after my 46th birthday in October. Probably against all advice, I decided to white knuckle it. Even less advisable, I got on a plane to Vegas for a five day work trip the next morning. These trips are usually booze soaked, so I don’t know what I was thinking. The first two days were  really rough. Little sleep, lots of caffeine. I had a huge scare when I pissed blood the second morning. I probably should have gone to the ER, but self care has never been my strong suite. Thankfully, it only happened that one time. The next few days were less awful. I survived the trip, and I’m proud to say I didn’t touch a drop. Over the next few weeks, I began to sleep a lot better, but I definitely had bouts with the shakes and a lot of neuropathy, especially in my limbs. I guess I probably have some long term nerve damage. It’s definitely gotten a lot better, and I’m hoping it will continue to get even better.  I’ve gained some weight. I attribute this to my body craving carbohydrates that the alcohol is no longer providing. I figured it was a wash to try another major lifestyle modification over the holidays. I’m definitely eating a lot better, actually eating. I think the long term nutritional deficit in my life is the cause of the nerve issues. It’s something that doesn’t seem to come up much as a major cause of bodily damage related to drinking. Honestly, I can say I’m in a much better place now. I don’t have any cravings.

The calories from pizza and desserts don't come close the calories I would have had drinking my regular 10+ drinks. Not to mention I would have had *more* pizza and desserts if I *was* drinking.

And no matter how late I stay up, I will feel better in the morning than if I had been drinking. Even if I tried, nothing I do with my nights now could bring me to feeling the groggy dread that used to greet me every morning. It's like magic.

And best of all, I actually enjoyed the party. I felt present, like an actual participant. Not like a spectator watching a drunken asshole move my mouth. Alcohol wasn't just anesthetizing my social anxiety, it was anesthetizing my personality. Turns out I'd much rather be my functioning, reasoning, reserved self (who may take a little while to warm up to people) than be numb, loud, and forgetful. And for once I wasn't the drunkest person, throwing up and overstaying my welcome.

Just feels really good. Makes me feel very happy about my decision. I hope you're feelin' it too.

I luckily had only confined it to Wednesdays, Friday’s and Saturday’s but it wasn’t sustainable. I’m still enrolled in school and everything is moderately okay, but I realized last week I needed to stop. Drinking has made my life worse. Friday night I just went to work and hung out with my girlfriend sober, but tonight me and my friends had our monthly poker night. I was surrounded by crates of beer and bottles of wine. I brought my vape, cigs and a pack of gum to try to work through the night and enjoy my friends. I couldn’t. Every moment around them was too much. I wanted to reach out and go “oh one pbr” isn’t gonna put me over the edge. But I don’t know a single time I did that and didn’t binge drink and put myself over the edge. I eventually left the poker night after three hands because I just couldn’t do it. The mere presence of alcohol was too tempting. I don’t know if I’m going to be able hang out with people anymore because the mere presence of alcohol makes me extremely anxious and the craving kicks in. Does it get better?

Nice to be back.,"I've been active in this community for a number of years on and off, starting with lurking back in 2015 when my alcohol consumption began to worry me. I took the plunge and created an account when I started taking little breaks from alcohol: 1 month, 3 months, etc. As the return to the bottle yielded more damaging results, I began to cling to this place more and more. It was the only space I could share my thoughts with like-minded people, with true anonymity, no questions asked. Completely free of judgement. My last post on this sub was pretty rough: job loss, car crash, heading to rehab. The end of 2018. I thought that was where I would finally put down the bottle for good. It wasn't. 2019 was consumed by it. Worse than ever. I went to treatment three times last year, ended my engagement, and lost another job, and I think I finally found the fucking answer, and it's that I don't know if I will ever drink again or not. There is no magic solution. No rehab cure. Just day by day. I hate to use the sayings, one day at a time, because right now, it's fucking easy... I've been sober since December 10th, and right now that's looking pretty good to me. So far, I like where this is going. Thank you all for being here, I love this sub, it's nice to be back.

In two days it will be longer than I've been sober in 15 years by my estimation.  As this has been a new experience I thought I'd go over what it has been like.  The first hurdle was the first week.  Each day was a struggle and on day 7 I was hit with massive physical and mental cravings.  I survived those by deciding to do the right thing and I called my sponsor and told on myself.  It helped, the cravings didn't go away but they became manageable.

After that there was no issues with cravings but although I didn't feel anxious I had such a short tolerance for other people.  I talked to my sponsor about this and it helped.  I didn't voice anything negative at meetings but I was sitting in judgement of a lot of people there and I couldn't seem to help it.  Being negative like that made me feel like an asshole.  That seemed to fade after 30 days.

I got another massive craving between 30 and 60 but it wasn't as bad as the first and I got through it.  Despite not having cravings I've had the thoughts about drinking.  Currently I'm on a job search so that can be busy but it also has a lot of downtime.  Weekends are tough, so of course my mind is telling me that I can get drunk and have enough time to get straight by Monday.  I'm not doing that though because I go to meetings every day, sometimes 2 a day and I tell people about my progress.  I know that if I go back out then I'll have to tell people that and I really don't want to.  I can't lie about it either because I'd have to keep lying as time went on, plus people would probably be able to guess and I'd look like an asshole.  I also know that it wouldn't be one day and then done because it never is.  If I decide to use the weekend to get drunk the best case scenario is that I'm drunk for a week straight, but likely longer than that.  So for the time being I'm trying to enjoy the benefits of sobriety and sticking with meetings to fill my time so I don't let the bad thoughts gain traction.",10

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This Daily Check-In was my single, most important tool for my first 8-9 months.  By typing these five little words each and every morning, ""I will not drink TODAY,"" it planted a very powerful seed in my brain and set the tone for my day.  When my demon lizard brain would start screaming later in the day, I remembered the commitment I made to myself and did whatever it took to make to make it happen.  If you're new or starting over, we know how hard the first several weeks can be.  I promise, if you stick with it, it will get easier and your life will improve in ways you can't even imagine right now!

Please join me in not drinking TODAY.  Have a beautiful Sober Sunday!",68

No more horrible hangovers, blacking out in weird places, wasting money, making awful decisions and feeling like crap nearly every.single.day... for years. Didn’t take too long to realize that alcohol had really been holding me back.

Anyways, the only thing that has suffered lately is some of my friendships (with people that really don’t have an issue). I had been avoiding any interaction that may involve alcohol being around because 1 drink turns into 10 and I lose control. But I felt I was strong enough to be able to go to a bar and hang out without touching it.

Not going to let it control me without me even consuming it either.

I was right to go and have fun! Didn’t even have the urge as I know my life has become so much more fulfilling WITHOUT alcohol. Not even after an extremely stressful week.

Waking up early to have a productive day, every day, is the best feeling and that is what keeps me going.

Last night I had dinner with a FWB who I've been seeing for the past few months. I didn't drink but she had a glass of wine. I was definitely jealous and seriously thought about ordering one myself. Dinner was fine but once we got back to her place I suddenly got panicky and started to feel a bit sick, which spiraled into more panic, and I ended up blurting out something about feeling nauseous and basically ran out the door and got an Uber home. I like this FWB a lot and I enjoy hanging out with her but without drinking I can't get out of my head and let myself have fun. Almost every time I've been out with this particular FWB we've gotten quite drunk, even to the point of blacking out a few times.

I have always been bad at committing to relationships so most of my dating history has been recurring hookups or casual flings...for which I'm now realizing I was almost always drunk (or making a speedy hungover exit in the morning).

I know I have underlying issues with relationships that I need to sort out but I've been sick with anxiety and existential dread all day over how I acted last night.

I feel like I'm hopeless at dating and I'll never be able to have so much as a casual hookup again without the looseness I get from alcohol.

I was heartbroken to discover that he continued to drink. However, I reminded myself that people only make true change when they're ready to, and so I just prayed and wished that one day my dad would want better for himself.

This evening during a visit, my dad proudly announced to me that he hasn't had a drink in 15 days! I could have cried from happiness, but I didn't want to spook him so I played it cool. I enjoyed a wonderful evening chatting with sober dad. He's brilliant and well-spoken and his charming personality (the one I remember from my childhood) is shining through again.

A week ago I was up all night worried about my dad having a painful early death. Tonight I'll sleep well, knowing he's going to bed sober and on the way to health. I'm damn proud of him.

This would be a day I normally would have sipped wine to calm my nerves until I got a good buzz and go to sleep early. But I didnt. Honestly, I realized it wasnt even tempting. I might be exhausted, but it isnt from a hangover. Whatever is going on, pouring booze on it has never helped. I might not have been productive today, but I was sober. And right now, today, that's enough. Played with my baby, watched a movie and cuddled with my husband. I was a bad I influence on him again, but not to drink! Just to do nothing with me. Bless his heart, even though he has so much to do, when I'm having anxiety through the roof he cancels it all to just sit by me. I am so grateful for all I have, and grateful to not be drinking.",15

He was a collegiate athlete and has more discipline than I can imagine, including with his drinking. I just don't have it. He has witnessed addiction in his family and a friend and has mentioned to me how he views people in A.A. or recovery as weak. I hope he will support me, but I don't want his view of me to be tainted. I wish I could just fast forward a few months before I tell anyone so the benefits are more obvious, but I know it doesn't work like that.

The first weeks, 
I told everyone I wasn't going to drink because I had put on a lot of weight (i had gained 19 kgs since i had turned 19) i didnt tell everyone the underlying truth that i was scared i would become dependent on booze because it was my only stress relief at the time, a lot where supportive wishing me well saying goodluck, others where not, my room-mate would constantly put me down and make fun of me when ever I would order a coke or a lemonade at the bar, it became a nightmare, I had my doubts and I thought about going back to the bottle but I stood strong I held my head up high and did not drink

2 months in,
Holy shit I can't believe it, I have lost 10 kilos, my pimples are gone and I don't wake up with a hangover every weekend, I was so proud of myself and I was determined to never drink again until the biggest challenge came, my dad, my relationship with my father is rocky to say the least, the only form of communication from 12 to 16 was drinking beer on the sofa or screaming matches about something utterly pointless and he up and left just after my 16 birthday to England, so we never really had the father son bonding later in my teens ( I'm 20 now), now he had come back to Australia for a holiday, I was so scared I would slip back into my old coping method and just drink till I couldn't register his yelling anymore, it was so difficult and testing but being sober though that month was the best thing for me, I was able to make positives in the negatives, think clearly and be there for my younger siblings 

Right now: 
Its Australia day here, and I'm about to attend a bbq with 20+ mates all supporting me and others joining me and having a sober day as well in solidarity, I have no urge to drink, and I'm so happy with the progress that's been made 😁

2020-01-25 20:38:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eu04px/day_3/,Day 3:,"Hi everyone,

I posted a long story of why I started drinking and really appreciated that anyone would even take the time to read it. Since I can't talk to anyone about my drinking problem in person, I've decided I'm going to post what I'm going through each day as a way to keep me accountable and document my journey.

Last night I decided to get some healthy food from the grocery store, mainly salad, hummus and some crackers because I didn't want to risk eating anything that would make me nauseous. I haven't left my house in about a week, so I ended up just walking around the grocery store for an hour, just being in the presence of people (avoiding eye contact).

On my drive home I broke down and cried. I've been keeping my life on pause with alcohol as I've been getting older. I've been trying to avoid the feelings of being a failure and feeling behind in life by isolating myself, waiting for some glimmer of hope to pop up out of thin air. Rather than dwelling on the thoughts of being a failure, I started thinking maybe I can be okay, what if it's not too late. This combined with an overwhelming feeling of loneliness and wanting someone to just be there for me and understand what I've been through and tell me it's okay that I ended up where I am made me break down in tears.

Normally I would force myself to eat a small meal every day because I figured my entire diet shouldn't just be alcohol and juice/pop. Eating different foods used to be one of the few things in life that have me joy but since becoming dependent on alcohol, it has lost its appeal and I haven't been able to eat much. For the first time in a long time, I started to feel hunger.

I ended up staying up most of the night. I went to sleep for what I thought was a long time which only ended up being 2 hours. During that time I woke up covered in sweat and had some crazy vivid dreams.

When I woke up, I looked in the mirror and my face looked like I had an awful hangover. I'm not sure if this is just what I look like now after the alcohol abuse. I didn't want anyone to see me like this so I canceled my plans for the next few days telling people that I'm sick.

I ended up going back to sleep for most of the day, having multiple vivid dreams, waking up covered in sweat to the point I had to change my clothes multiple times. I even woke up terrified I accidentally drank (I might have dreamed it) and rushed to make sure none of my liquor was less full than before.

Hopefully I'll be able to sleep better soon. Maybe I'll get myself something nice to eat for dinner today as a reward for my 3rd day.

It was getting worse.. and I was starting earlier.. to the point where I was waking up and starting the day with a ... not even a double vodka.. a triple? Quadruple? I convinced myself that I could deal with d-bags at work unless I was drinking.  I tried (half-assed) to cut back or stop and that never lasted more than a day. I knew I had a problem but the alcohol was more important to me than the associated problems. It had become my total focus. I don’t even go into the trips to the ER from drunk injuries, or the numerous times people had to wake me up from toilets in bar restrooms. Fck thats embarrassing to admit.  Long story short, I got really sick with some sort of E. coli or other organism and ended up in hospital this week with severe dehydration, etc. to be honest at first I thought I was just hungover as usual. Doc put me on several meds, including 2 antibiotics, one of which (Flagyl) she said I’d get violently ill if I drank any alcohol while on it.  That’s 8 days.  The thought of going more than a day without drinking normally strikes fear in me but maybe because I felt so shitty I wasn’t as daunted as usual. However, I was still pretty effing scared.  I mean, I can’t remember the last time I went 2 days without drinking let alone 8!?  It’s been probably 25 years since I went a week without drinking. Possibly not even then. Anyway.. I’m on day 4 now and I am actually doing ok and feeling good about this and I’m wanting to use this as a springboard to keep going with this whole not drinking thing.  I want to get my life back.  The only thing is that things are starting to surface that I’ve been pushing down in my constant state of numbness and that’s scaring me.  Doesn’t anyone have advice on how to keep those ghouls at bay? I don’t want to go back to how I was. I mean, I’m getting a little cocky here.. “how I was” was only 4 days ago but this feels real this time.  What’s disappointing is my best friend/drinking buddy has an alcohol problem and in the past when I’ve mentioned stopping she wasn’t supportive at all, so I don’t even want to tell her.

As promised, my story; past and present","I'll try to keep it as short as possible, but as promised in previous post, once I reached 30 days I was going to share my story.

&#x200B;

As a young teenager I had my first taste of alcohol with various friends. We used to steal it from our parents and get drunk on the weekends. Fast forward to to the end of my teenage years and I was drinking heavily and blacking out at parties every weekend.

In my early twenties it was more of the same, except it was actually legal to drink now. I was going to bars at least three times a week, going crazy, partying and blacking out every time I drank. Since everyone else was doing the same as me it was just the norm, a regular occurrence and I never thought anything was wrong with it. I simply thought it was just the what people did, go out, get fucked up, have fun and black out. I'd wake up the next day not remembering shit and we'd all just laugh it off even if we did something stupid or fucked up.

Fast forward again into my mid to later twenties. A lot of people I once was getting blacked out with on the regular were now either married, in a serious relationship and/or so consumed with life and work that it wasn't their norm anymore. Even if they weren't one of those three things, they just grew out of the getting completely fucked up and blacked out stage. Mean while I didn't. I just never saw anything wrong with it. I just thought that was the point of drinking, to get as blacked out as possible.

Over the last 5 years (I am 31 now) is when things got really bad for me. I started drinking by myself at home at least 2 nights a week, sometimes even 3 or 4. I would drink at least 18+ beers over the span of 12 hours straight, sometimes even more. I got really depressed and spun into this insane cycle that I couldn't break. The more I drank the more depressed I got. The more depressed I got the more I drank. I found somebody online 3 years ago that I truly connected with. Somebody that was going through depression and anxiety. Somebody that I could share everything with and things were great, but when I drank I always became some person that i'm truly not. In the end, I ended up screwing it up and that person chose to stop speaking to me and ghosted me. 

That happened 8 months ago. The last 8 months was me at my absolute worst. I can't even tell you how many days a week I was drinking, to complete excess. I was blacking out, reaching out to that person constantly through e-mails and even messaging friends and family via facebook when I was absolutely blacked out and would wake up with no idea what was said. Most of the time it was the craziest or just straight up mean shit. Of course this is completely out of my character. Alcohol was turning me into a monster. I was becoming mentally unstable. There was a point that I thought I was the devil. There was another point when I convinced myself I had mouth cancer. I was literally spiraling out of control. My mind was taking the biggest hit out of anything. 

I tried to stop and quit MULTIPLE times in the last couple years and it would NEVER last. Alcohol had taken over and it was my fault, I let it. A day or two after this Christmas something just clicked and I decided I was done. I didn't want to be that person anymore. That person wasn't the real me. It was some sick, twisted asshole that had taken over my mind and soul. 

The first 3 days was the worst because of the insane withdrawal. But after that first week I felt great. Fast forward again and here I am at 30 days clean. Urges to drink still creep in my mind every now and then, but it's really just a trigger from my old habits. Little things like bad weather, or boredom will spark the thought/urge of having a drink. But I don't want to become that person again. I love who I am again. I don't want to wake up feeling depressed, feeling regret or any of that anymore. 

If you're struggling, which I know many of you are, stick with it. Your life can always get better.

I guess I had never articulated it like this. What I said was: “I don’t know if I’ll achieve my dreams if I stay sober. But I definitely know 100% that I WON’T achieve them if I use/drink again. I stay sober so I can at least have the opportunity to reach my goals.” 

I hope that helps someone. Thanks for reading.",69

Before I get into that, anyone else notice how common it is to see posts coming from people in their late twenties and early 30’s? Obviously alcoholism, alcohol dependency, and general alcohol overuse aren’t unique to my generation, but damn! What the hell is going on with us? How’d so many of us get stuck in this trap?

So, I’m on day one again. Late night bender put me in a weird way today, and I’m sick of the all the other symptoms that accompany this disease. I want out, desperately. I need to get out.

I read so many posts from people who successfuly managed to put down the sauce for good, and seeing their progress is inspiring. But, I’m scared of not having alcohol be that dependable go to fix for boredom, loneliness, depression, insecurity, anxiety, and other daily pressures I face. I look to tonight, tomorrow, and the next day with horror as I consider how painful it normally it is to have to endure those things. And I think of how difficult progress typically is, and I fall back into the routine of regularly drinking WAY too much. I have responsibilities that are not easy to take care of, and a life that’s not easy to maintain without a little “lubricant”, so to speak. 

I see the trap, I fear the trap, I walk into the trap, and now I’m stuck in the trap. I wake up, get out, back up, and stare at the trap again. Rinse, wash, repeat.

A little support from some of the best humans out there would be much appreciated. It’s a long road ahead.",5

I wanted to go since my best friend's band was playing, my whole house was going, and I knew I would get sad spending a Friday night alone. To blend in, I wanted to get some NA beer. It just helps to have something in hand, you know? And I didn't want to be the person who shows up with LaCroix.

Well, did you know you have to be 21 in the United States to buy NA beer? I thought the cashier was joking around at first. I just wanted to scream at them!!! *I'm not some stupid kid trying to get a buzz with 0.5% beer! Do you realize how many times I've come into this store and bought several handles at a time? Do you realize I threw my fake ID away to protect myself?*

Then I saw and had to make small talk with a coworker (She's 50 and just saw the little intern get turned away at a liquor store, what must she think?). Then I got a text from a sort-of ex. Then I saw that someone had taken my parking spot at home, so I had to park 2 blocks away. All these little things just sent me over the edge, and I came home in tears. First time in these 8 days that I felt I really *needed* a drink.

My 21+ friend went back and bought me the stupid fake beer, which was very nice of them. The party ended up being really fun. My anxiety was through the roof at first, but it was nice to know that I could drive home whenever I wanted (no more huge Uber bills!) and that my friends all had my back. I think I spent more time outside smoking than actually listening to the music, but I'm still so proud of myself for making it through a party sober.

Whew, this feels nice to type out. I just feel like I have to explain so much to everyone around me. It seems ridiculous to most people that a college kid, 20 years old, would be in recovery. I get that. I just wish it could be a little easier.",12

I now see that I can't just have one or two. I need the whole bottle, and then another one - and before you know it it's 8am and I'm throwing up, shaking and nearly crying, covered in shame.

Today is the first step. Again. I am going totally sober - not just 'no binges, no heavy nights' - I am stopping entirely. I need to own my own mess and take responsibility for my own health and my own choices.

I've been alcohol free since Christmas Day and things are moving along well so far. 

I had a big test this past week. My favorite band came through and I went to see them for the 12th time in my life. It was, however, the very first time I had ever seen them sober. I knew this would be a difficult test and to be honest I was very concerned that I wouldn't make it. My date ended up bailing that afternoon so I went solo to the show. 

I started by going to my favorite restaurant and ordered a non-alcoholic beer while sitting at the bar. I ended up chatting up the woman next to me, things were going well until her date arrived. She commented that she thought it was really nice to see a man who could go out and not drink. Cravings were present but manageable there, and I left shortly after dinner to get out of the environment. Then, as  I was walking to the venue, I ended up chatting with another woman walking there solo and we ended up exchanging numbers and we're going out next week. We hung out a bit before the show in the lobby and she drank a beer or two, my cravings were somewhat present there as well. I drank a coffee. It was a really nice conversation between two people over a band they are both passionate about. I know in the past, at this point I would've typically been trying to slam beers and focusing on how many I could bring to the floor with me without having to come back for more beer before the concessions closed. Some real mental calculations and planning, because God forbid I ever run out of alcohol while my favorite band was playing. What was the real focus and priority on those nights then? 

I mentioned to my (drinking) buddies in a group chat later that evening that I saw the band sober and they couldn't even believe me. They thought I was lying! 

 The show itself was great! It was a little different seeing them sober, like I was noticing a few more subtle parts of their act that I never had before. I really enjoyed the experience and once I was actually on the floor watching the show, I wasn't craving alcohol whatsoever. 

The evening was really nice overall. It was nice to meet someone that shares a similar interest like that, and I wonder if I had spent my dinner getting wasted in 'prepare' for the show, would I have even been open to meeting this woman? Or, would I have been drunk and sloppy and turned away from the opportunity knowing I would've been an instant turn off in that condition? Would alcohol, the depressant, have convinced me that no woman would be interested in a 'loser' like me because I had nothing to offer, so why bother? 

I was concerned about that evening in particular for a while and I am very grateful to report I am still alcohol free. I have a new job starting next Monday and I'm very committed to focusing on that, I don't forsee any challenges like this past week in the near future.

After multiple depressive episodes and a trip for mental evaluation, I decided it's time to take a break. Maybe until March, maybe for much longer.

Because of the severity of my mental situation(I am doing okay and about to start some outpatient care!!!), I moved back in with my parents who do drink a bit. They have promised not to offer any alcohol which is something to celebrate in itself! 

Besides that, what are some things to do with or without friends besides drinking?! I desperately need the company of my loved ones while I am healing. I also would love tips y'all use when you are in the mood to have a drink. Ginger ale has been my goto so far.

I told myself and my circle that I am quitting for one year to soften the blow. But I know in my heart it will be for longer, if not for good - because I’m not sure there’s anyway to prevent the pain alcohol caused besides removing it from the equation. 

The first few months were hard, but I felt excited and proud. The romance is now dying and I am missing it — missing the easy high from a couple glasses of wine, missing being part of the group, missing the numbing and loose feeling - how it switched off my monkey mind. 

I know it hurts me and I know overall my life is measurably better without it, but I find myself now having psychological cravings stronger than ever before in this journey.

I’m actually kind of looking forward to the conversation when I DO tell her because I know she’ll be embarrassed and we’ll have a good laugh together over it, and she’ll be 100% supportive once she knows.

My real point though, is how eye opening it is that alcohol was such a large part of my life that there are people who still instantly think to share drinking humor with me when they see it. A lot of the times I did see this friend, (the whole group, actually), social drinking was there along with us. I’m happy that I’ve grown into a comfortable and healthier headspace where these jokes no longer apply to me, but I also feel no longing for that old life either.

I HAD a plan for this weekend, that I was really going to hustle doing doordash, as I've found that's an awesome outlet for me, and a way to stay sober. Can't deliver food and make money if I'm too drunk to drive. But of course, my car decided to be an Ahole and is now in the shop for new brakes, rotors, calipers, and a new u-joint.

At my worst it was when i was unemployed - spirits or beer 4 days a week and only after 6pm. It didn't really make a dent in my health, at least physically.

But my problem is that I can not for the life of me moderate my drinking when it really matters. I never think wether i want one more drink or not - it's always how much more can I drink before i am a total mess. And I misjudge that quite often as well.

The other thing that I think is obviously wrong with my drinking is the fact I don't treat it as a bonus when doing other things. I almost never have a single beer with friends, or when watching a movie. When I drink, then the drinking is the main course; main attraction; it's my focus.

I think both of those bad habits came from these aforementioned times. It was always going to the store, buying a set amount of alcohol, then drinking all of it over the next 8 or so hours. And whenever i bought an amount i couldn't drink in one sitting, then i had all the attention in the world to monitor closely how much i drank. I also could always grab a glass of water with electrolytes and have a lot of that an hour before going to bed so the hangover is almost nonexistant.

That kind of drinking was a breeze to handle in comparison to going out drinking. I am fine with not drinking alone (or even with close friends) anymore, but i still can't fathom how I could not drink at least a little in the more challenging social situations with people i barely know. My brain tries to justify it, saying that I am going to get it right this time; that I can teach myself how to drink responsibly. But reading through this sub made me think that it is just not possible for some people.

So yeah. I'm sick of apologizing for getting too drunk all the time. I'm sick of not remembering the previous night and dreading what i might've done. I'm sick of my first and sometimes only impressions of me for some people being ""that guy who can't handle alcohol"". I'd much rather be the boring guy who sips on coke instead.

When I first quit, I was a wreck. I was having some serious withdrawals. I had nightly night terrors, GAD symptoms like depersonalization, and some peripheral and auditory hallucinations. I should have got professional help but I didn't know how and I didn't have a lot of money. Plus, I've always been sort of afraid to show a weak side to the people I love. Anyway, I believe that movement was a big contributor to my success. In the early days, I was still in college and I had to walk a mile or so to get to class because I parked off campus. My backpack was at least 10-15 pounds from all the overpriced books and materials, but I just listened to my music and walked. There was one day, about 3-4 weeks into quitting, I was almost to class when I took one of the biggest breaths that I had taken in years. It was euphoric. I was like the first time I could breathe! I should mention that I was a heavy smoker when I drank. I use to think there was no better combination that alcohol and cigarettes. I've been proven wrong multiple times since then. But I believe those walks were super important. I was feeling stronger with every day. I started to pay attention to how sweaty or out of breath I was when I got to campus. I started taking stairs as a challenge/interest of my personal health and improvements. Then, after 4 months, I started to jog. It was maybe a mile or less in the beginning. I wasn't tracking anything. I just liked music and moving, being outside! I would fantasize about being a BADASS MF yet I would feel so childlike and playful. It's been two and half years since I've drank and smoked. And I still love moving my body. My advice for this stuff is always start slow. There's no need for overkill in the beginning. Be patient but be consistent. There are lots of ways to do it too. Just go for a walk, get on the ground at home and stretch. I know a lot of people who do yoga through Youtube. So, when you can or when you need, take a moment to move around. Celebrate the fact that you can move your body around!",10

**Blackouts, empty wallets and hangovers used to be the absolute norm...**

**Guys, I want to take a few minutes to share with you exactly what life used to look like...**

Because although I look (and feel) pretty healthy now, I know what it’s like to be at the absolute rock bottom of life due to alcohol...

After building a successful personal training business whilst in my final year of university, I actually went through a relapse.

The relapse started very small. A few drinks here and there. The odd piss up.

For the first few weeks, you could almost say my alcohol use was ‘manageable’.

I thought I had everything under control. I thought I had cracked the code.

Because I was drinking, being a PT no longer suited my lifestyle, and everything slowly crumbled away.

However, I found a new path - London. A place of money, parties and fancy bars. Maybe this was where I should go next...

I was 25 and had just finished my degree in marketing at Oxford Brookes, and was ready to ‘make it big’ in the city.

Well, it’s safe to say London, alcohol and the rest of it chewed me up and spat me out...

Well and truly...

I thought I could manage it. 

I thought I could keep it under control. 

Once again, everything spiralled out of control and just started going downhill.

All-nighters, calling in sick and being ashamed to speak to my family on the phone...

Well as those of you that have been following my journey so far know, my life is no longer like that.

Since getting sober, I moved to Thailand, work with a great company doing video marketing and have an amazing girlfriend.

The only reason why the change happened, is because I got sober and committed to self-improvement.

Alcohol promised me everything and gave me nothing. 

Sobriety promised me nothing but gave me everything.

My life is ten times better than I could have imagined 513 days ago.

Hope you guys have a great weekend. And just so you know - I will not drink with you.

Speak to you soon.

Been here before but I made a new account to start over.  Tired of living the functional alcoholic lifestyle. Don't go out to bars anymore so my rationale of ""it's cheaper to drink at home"" was an easy way to continue bad habits. 

I'm overweight and I tend to over-eat when I get drunk so I'm never going to make progress getting fit if I don't quit drinking. I used to jokingly say ""I only had a pint...of vodka."" and that was more often than not my daily routine. I never had hangovers because I mixed my vodka with energy drinks. Must be the b vitamins.

There are other factors in my life that I tried not to think about by getting obliterated nightly but I'll save those for further discussion as it seems appropriate. Working to understand and deal with triggers is part of my plan.

This is also the first time that I **really** set my mind to it as well, I've had multiple shorter ""pauses"" in my drinking but they usually never lasted for more than a week or two. I go through those classic excuses that every alcoholics seem to face, especially in early sobriety, sometimes I try to convince myself that I'm not really an alcoholic because I never had a rock bottom moment (I know this isn't true, I'm still an alcoholic) and that all of my peers are drinking and partying hard every weekend (no they don't, I just choose to see those who are as an excuse to indulge in the same behavior without any guilt)

I still wonder what happened, how and when did I become addicted to alcohol? It all happened so suddenly.

That's completely fair. But I really do think I may be at the catalyst of a serious problem that might get worse. 

To start, some background. On my dad's side of the family, alcohol has never been a problem. My dad's never struggled with alcoholism and he barely even drinks, and when he does, it's one beer and then he's done and moves on. My moms is a different story. Her brother struggled heavily with drugs and alcohol and some of my cousins on her side have struggled with alcoholism before but gotten past it and can drink now with little to no issue. When my mom was a teenager and a college student she definitely drank too much and would be the first to tell you. 

I have an anxiety disorder and become depressed easily. I'm naturally a perfectionist and thus very hard on myself. I have an addictive personality. I just turned 21 last December; I'd be lying if I said I didn't have alcohol before then. I was always careful though; it was never very much, I never really got drunk, and nine times out of ten, it was social drinking. Well, now I can legally buy alcohol. Without going too into detail, I'm studying abroad right now. I have a long distance girlfriend and that is definitely taking a bit of a toll (I miss her and we're both struggling with the distance), there's some family turmoil going on and I just miss the comfort and familiarity of my home country. I'm stressed out about all the work here and all the new things constantly being thrown at me. When I got here, I went out and got some beer, basically for the hell of it. Figured ""I can legally buy alcohol, why not?"" I thought I could keep it under control. 

To you, this isn't going to seem like a lot. But yesterday, I just got really down and stressed. And I decided to get drunk to just... forget for a little bit. So I had a couple beers in the course of less than an hour and I hate to admit it but it helped. I forgot. I still felt bad but it was numbed a bit at least. Now I'm a lightweight admittedly so when I tried to leave my dorm and go get more, I couldn't do it. I felt a bit sick, I was dizzy and just so tired. 

But I'm still stressed. I'm still worried. And all I want to do right now is go get more beer and have like three or four in an hour. I just want this worry, this pain, to stop and I know that the beer will do it.",15

I did 40 days dry last year but I think subliminally I had already decided I would drink over Christmas, and, well, let's just say it wasn't the best Christmas I've had.  So now I want to start again, now I know that I can't moderate and I can't just drink one/drink socially.   All those roads lead to the off licence and the sofa and then the self-loathing the next day.  


So, I have identified my weak point, or trigger point, which is generally around 4-7pm when I'm at home, either on my own or with my children.  Usually this is the window of time when I would crack open a bottle of something or another. If I get through to 7pm then I'm good and I won't think about drinking nearly so much.  But at the moment it's like I obsess about having a drink during that time window. I have children so just ""getting out of the house"" isn't an option.  What techniques or strategies have you used to beat a craving that comes in waves?  


All advice and suggestions will be read with an open mind and with gratitude.

Overcame several temptations, to be rewarded w/ rested mornings and little break in momentum. Despite loneliness from not going out, am enjoying some calm & enduring consistency like I haven't had in years—even tho not much life progress, feels steady & stable.","I'm really doing a Dry January as a sneak-attack to be sober much longer, just trying not to scare myself with the big-sounding “threat” of “never again.” When I've been super lonely, bored, or ruminating on my big long-standing failings in life (no romance, few friends, few & bad jobs and inability to stay put and work thru challenges at decent jobs), I've certainly had thoughts of saying “fuck it, I'm going out,” or “can't wait until Feb 1,” or “X number of weeks has been a good enough lesson.”

But having joined this sub before the new year, and seeing all the beautiful effort and authentic suffering (like Phish sings, “The beauty of a broken heart”), seeing so much of my past (and current!) successes and challenges among the folks here, I've been able to stay focused on the maturity, clarity, momentum, and legit personal development I know can be had by staying sober. 

It's hard being without any kind of community - no real friends or family support network, and in this smaller city, Meetup isn’t very active, AA isn't my jam, and Refuge Recovery or SMART Recovery which I do dig aren't really active. 

I have done a lot of personal dev work over the years though, and now that I've got 3 weeks sober, some of those tools, perspectives, and feelings of potential are bubbling back to the surface. Like so many of you say, why risk these gains, however small, just for one fun night that won't lead to any more connections, but will only result in a hangover of several days, feeling back at zero, and needing another number of days or weeks to get back to this small yet growing place of tentative success and cautious optimism?

Sure, I could see my barfly buddies and \*feel\* connected, share some laughs and convo... but those folks, however nice and fun, are never there for me, and not down for real talk and mutual support. They're good people, but doing their own thing so ultimately hollow relationships for me.

I do hate the loneliness, but I finally see I can handle it for a time until I can figure out how to find healthy, authentic friendships, even if they're only small or simple at first. Like, for the first time in years I feel almost up to posting/hosting a Meetup group to do something basic like a hike or dinner & a movie for a small group.

A few things that have paired really well with dry January so far have been Couch-to-5k (building a small exercise habit routine at first, but sustainable and steady increases to run a 5k after ten weeks), and also the Wim Hof Method (daily breathwork and gradual cold water exposure [cool showers!], which surprisingly are both energizing and lend great clarity and mental un-stuck-ness). Intermittent fasting ain't bad either, and have also been more on track with my low carb, (mostly) vegan diet which is all very nurturing and empowering.

Hope you're all finding your stride, learning lots about self and others, and are generally finding your mojo again.

I’m not sure what I’m looking for. I’m scared I’m going to do it, and I really don’t want to, but I really don’t feel like anyone would consider me for a serious relationship because of the way I am/my struggles so I think — this is who I REALLY am, and everyone knows it, no one expects me to be better or is willing to love me when they see my trauma, so why not self destruct? What does everyone else do when they feel that want to drink not just to soothe the pain but because it confirms the belief that you aren’t capable of being better?

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens - good or bad - and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

**Our last word of the week is “TODAY”. What does this mean to you with respect to our pledge?**

Instead, I started to panic. I was this close to breaking, but didn't. I made a sort of mumbling, awkward excuse about training for a 10 miler. I think she could sense my discomfort. Things were pretty awkward. We sat talking over glasses of water for a while. She ended up leaving in 30 or 40 minutes. For what it's worth, our first date was over coffee, and it went very well.

The guy that picked me up was suuuuper nice. He and his partner briefed me on what to expect and asked me a few questions on the way . He introduced me to a bunch of people, one of which was his sponsor, and she’s now my temporary sponsor! :) I’ve avoided help for so long that I knew it was now or never and all or nothing. Everyone was so incredibly nice and it’s honestly overwhelming how much support I was showered with. I was so so starved of that kind of love and support.

When I first started drinking outside of social events, I always saw it as an enhancer. I thought an activity was fun, it would be even more fun while drunk. The main problem with this was that I could never set a limit. It always felt like I wasn't drunk enough so I kept drinking until I got blackout drunk.

I grew up in a very conservative household where drinking was looked down upon, so when my friends would drink and I wanted to join them, I had to be very secretive about it. I think that led to a habit about me being secretive about my drinking in general. I got very good at acting acting sober while drinking until I got blackout drunk.

I suffer from anxiety and depression, which definitely hasn't been helped by me drinking. When I drink at parties, it helps me forget about my anxiety and depression, and I feel like I'm more fun to be around. Eventually I started associating drunk me as the best version of myself that other people liked more.

I also struggle to open up about problems I'm dealing with because I don't want to be judged or pitied. I started using drinking as a crutch for emotional pain, because I can't think too much while drunk and generally forget about what I was going through the next morning.

All of these things eventually led up to me drinking every night until I blacked out and fell asleep. There have been countless times where I've had to ask people what I did last night because I was genuinely worried I did something I'd regret and had no recollection of.

Eventually it wasn't just the nights I would drink, I started drinking on days off starting when I woke up because I felt like I would have a better day that way. I have a family history of alcohol abuse, and I knew it was beginning to be a problem. I don't have any kids or anyone that depends on me, so if the only person I'm hurting is myself, it doesn't matter.

One of the most pathetic feelings is my fear of running out of alcohol. I would plan my day around the time the liquor stores were open to make sure I never ran out.

This week was kind of a wakeup call for me. I was drunk for the week straight, drove when I wasn't completely sober (I hate that I did this) and puked every day with my biggest worry being that I'm wasting alcohol by throwing it up.

Yesterday morning, I ran out of my usual liquor and decided to drink a bottle of wine so I could remain drunk. I took a nap and woke up with awful stomach pains in the afternoon. I had the worst nausea I've ever felt. I couldn't take a single sip of water without throwing up. I decided then that I need to stop.

I started looking things up like how to quit drinking, and alcohol withdrawl symptoms and got freaked out. I was worried about quitting cold turkey so I decided I would just drink a little so my body wouldn't go into shock. Every time I tried to drink I just immediately vomited it out. I was scared to fall asleep not knowing if I would wake up in the morning. I made sure to give my pet a few days worth of food in case something happened to me.

I was so scared to fall asleep last night that I did not sleep. But that was also marked my first 24 hours of not drinking in.. A while. This morning i was actually able to eat a little bit of food without getting sick. I slept all day, constantly waking up covered in sweat.

Tonight, the thought of drinking makes me nauseous, and I do not have any desire to drink. 

TL;DR: This is my day 2, IWNDWYT",9

130 days alcohol drink-free and just got back from a 1st date. She had a beer, I ordered a normal diet coke. I took a strong sip of the Diet Coke and tasted a very very strong cranberry vodka taste and \*internally\* started freaking out. This was a 1st date, the girl doesn't know yet I don't drink, so didn't want to make a scene and ask the waitress if there was alcohol in the drink or not.

I then ordered a water to drink, but throughout the rest of the 2 hour date/conversation I slowly drank the rest of the ""diet coke"". Not because I felt the physical compulsion/craving for alcohol, but because I wanted to keep tasting the drink to see genuinely just see if it had alcohol or not.

The diet coke made me feel very midly buzzed, but honestly I think it might have been a panic-placebo reaction. I did not feel the physical reaction to alcohol (didn't feel the numbness, or tingling in throat), and didn;t feel the urge for a true alcoholic drink.

I feel like the diet coke did not have any alcohol in it, but I am still freaking the f\*ck out and it is a true phobia of mine to accidentally be served alcohol.

Reasons I think the diet coke had alcohol:

\-tasted exactly like a cranberry vodka.

\-felt very very mildly buzzed

Reasons I think the diet coke did not have alcohol:

\-did not feel numbness or tingling of throat. Stomach felt normal

\-did not feel urge to order a 2nd/actual alcoholic drink

\-The water I drank there also had a really strong cranberry flavor

\-The date had to show her ID to the waitress. I did not. The receipt said I had a ""NA bev"". Showing the waitress did perceive my order correctly. 

Can someone give me an honest opinion of what was wrong with my drink? My diet coke tasted just like a cranberry vodka. The water also tasted like cranberry vodka. Was this establishment's liquid supply diluted somehow?

Sorry if I seem like a neurotic crazy person but in our community I think it is a legitimate reaction to be freaking out over having a Diet Coke taste like a cranberry vodka.

Opinions please on what is going on....the rational part of me is telling me this restaurant just has something funky going on with their diet coke and water, the recovery/addict inside of me is freaking the f\*ck out.",9

I can struggle in front of my husband. But I don't want to in front of them. The concert is held in a basement dive sort of bar, a place I wouldn't like to be struggling in front of my husband's nice-enough friends (but not mine, and unaware of my sobriety). And in the future, I hope to be able to go to a place like that and be okay, because I want to have fun with my husband and whoever else, enjoy live music again. 


My husband and I saw so much music together before. It was special, and we bonded through those experiences, and I miss it so f u c k i n g much. And I want to cry thinking of not going with him tonight because I can't foresee my sobriety being safe in a place like that. I feel like I miss way out on quality time with him now. It makes me want to drink. (And before this 300ish-day sober streak, I broke another streak because I wanted to get pizza and beer with him, go out together just us because I missed it so much.) I have cravings tonight. I haven't in a while, and I'm just struggling. I guess what helps is remembering all the times that those nights before, even seeing music and having a fun time just us, dissolved into ridiculous fights because it's what I did when drunk.

Healing begins quickly.,"If you're needing a reason to not drink today, notice that the brain starts healing within just a month or two and Fatty Liver disease is typically reversed.

I've copied an Alcohol Recovery Timeline. (The original OP's account has been deleted so I can't give them appropriate credit.)

I have seen the desire expressed several times for a timeline of recovery similar to the one available for quitting smoking. The following is my attempt which is cobbled together from various studies and websites. I'd be interested in any corrections, additions, or improvements. I did not get into the liver beyond fatty liver since the rates and prognosis of recovery vary so greatly between people. Enjoy!

•	⁠Hour 22.5: Alcohol from consuming 5 pints of lager is no longer present in the blood.
•	⁠Day 1: Cell proliferation increases across multiple brain regions.
•	⁠Day 2: Visual, auditory, or tactile hallucinations (if present and not DT related) usually end. First burst of cell proliferation, which is widespread, particularly in the hippocampus and cortex. These cells will largely differentiate into microglia in non-neurogenic brain regions.
•	⁠Day 5: Alcohol no longer detectable in saliva or urine tests. Symptoms of delirium tremens peak.
•	⁠Day 7: Second burst of cell proliferation, which is regionally specific to the dentate gyrus subgranular zone. In the dentate gyrus, proliferating cells will differentiate over several weeks mostly into neurons.
•	⁠Day 14: Neural progenitors begin to differentiate into mature neurons. Cognitive deficits regarding distractibility, mild confusion, and irritability are generally back to normal levels.
•	⁠Week 4: Cortical gray matter volume increases. Fatty liver disease is typically reversed.
•	⁠Week 5: One month after the Day 7 burst in neurogenesis, there is a two-fold increase in new neurons formed. This increase in neurogenesis during abstinence from chronic alcohol exposure may be related to the recovery of brain volume deficits and cognitive deficits in abstinent alcoholics.
•	⁠Month 2: Cognitive deficits regarding attention and concentration, reaction time, verbal learning ability, verbal abstract reasoning, and verbal short-term reasoning are generally back to normal levels.
•	⁠Month 3: Increase of white and gray matter as well as a decrease of cerebrospinal fluid. Alcohol no longer detectable in hair follicle tests.
•	⁠Month 6: Alcoholics who drank late into life, but with at least 6 months of abstinence can exhibit normal cognitive functioning. Alcoholics who were abstinent for less than 6 months performed worse in cognitive functioning than the control group.
•	⁠Year 5: Cognitive deficits regarding verbal abstract reasoning, verbal short-term reasoning, nonverbal abstract reasoning, visuospatial abilities, mental flexibility, and nonverbal short term memory are back to normal. The recovery rate of cognitive function varies greatly and is influenced by age, length of sobriety, and presence of interim drinking. Recovery from cognitive deficits can occur as early as a few months.
•	⁠Year 6.7: There is no statistical difference in cognitive test results with a control group, except in the area of spatial processing.

So one day of not drinking by choice instead of because I absolutely can't find a way to feels great.  And Wednesday felt good.  I spent all evening with my best friend and afterwards she said there was a not subtle difference in just how alive I seemed.

Then yesterday I got all antsy and crawl out of my skin feeling and had a couple of drinks last night.  I still waited until way later in the evening then usual, didn't follow my usual pattern, and kept it to significantly less than usual.  It feels like almost success more than it feels like failure.  (This sub wouldn't exist if it was super easy to quit anytime, right?)

This was my day almost every day.  And then I would wake up in the morning hazy or with a headache and suffer through the morning telling myself “next time I won’t get beer after the bar.  I can moderate!”

And then the cycle would repeat, not even to mention the weekend bender every week.  Most of my closest friends are heavy drinkers and when I had talked about quitting in the past I actually heard the words “I don’t think that’s the right move for you”.  They just didn’t understand how much damage I was secretly doing to myself, while also protecting their own disease.

I had a goal to stop on 12th jan, at the end of my holidays and start of my marathon training. On 19th,  we had a working bee at a group I volunteer with.  We worked our arses off, and there were beers and ciders to celebrate.  I had one. And then grabbed a bottle of wine to take home.  

On Thursday, I realised that our local bar was open (it's once a week), our kids are away,  and it was a gloriously sunny afternoon (we're in New Zealand). It seemed rude not to indulge.  I'd had a big run in the morning,  over exerted myself and still didn't feel right.  I knew it wasn't a good idea,  but the pull was too strong. I ended up feeling ill that night  and clearing Friday to feel sorry for myself. 

It's 6am Saturday now. I had planned to go for a run,  but I haven't rehydrated yet,  so I'll push that back. My kids come home today,  so I'll use that time to tidy up.  I had great plans to do some decluttering while they were gone,  but I haven't even tidied up (thanks hangovers). I'd like to think that I'll get on top of things when I'm sober,  but I remember last time I had to clear my schedule and focus on not drinking.  Often that meant taking myself to bed straight after work.

We have a party to go to tonight (would've been better on day 13). One of my best friends.  I've always planned to not drink (because I was quitting on 12th), and I'm driving,  so I don't think I'll slip. I could get sucked into 'just 1', but I don't have much interest in 1, so probably not. 

I think tomorrow will be harder. That will be when my brain starts trying to convince me that it's okay.

Recently, due to things in my family life, I’ve been thinking a lot more about alcohol and why it’s so popular.  And I’ve currently wondering if this is an issue bigger than just people as individuals. Why is it so heavily marketed when it’s actually a poison? Why are you ‘boring’ if you do not drink alcohol?  

Is it a way to be kept down? By ‘the powers that be’? Is this a way of trying to keep the population down? I read last night the WHO says 3.3million deaths are related to drinking alcohol. How is this ok? 

It makes me sad. It also makes me not want to participate in this.

I should feel happy that I shared two glasses of wine with a friend whom I haven’t seen for awhile, yesterday, and I should feel happy that I had a romantic evening with my husband later that evening, where we enjoyed two more glasses of wine. It’s so strange how a few days of sobriety can feel like a month, and there is this infectious sense of entitlement that sinks its teeth into my willpower after those first few days of success. 

I went to bed early last night and had a relatively good night’s sleep. Until 5 AM rolled around. For no reason at I am absolutely plagued by anxiety. Anxiety about all of the future plans I have made with friends, when I should be excited. Every single drinking occasion for me feels like this:

laughter, dining, and dancing with friends at night. Waking up hating everyone, sad, and reclusive by morning for ZERO reason. Usually the middle of the day is me canceling all of my social engagements all the way down to my dentist appointments for the next couple weeks because to go out and do ANYTHING feels like an overwhelming, undesirable idea. It’s ludacris. Alcohol turns me into a shell of a human being and I can’t even articulate how far the dominos of one night’s drinking topples into my week. 

It’s really sad when this moment hits where I’ve realized that alcohol has turned me into a completely different person. And it’s not even about how much or how often I drink that is the problem, anymore. The way that alcohol makes small shifts to the choices I make. Even if it’s just being to excited over a glass of wine and overcommitting to engagements that my sober doesn’t actually want to do. Over time I don’t feel, looking back that I I have been exercising complete control of my free will, -by that I mean that I haven’t been my authentic self. I’m rambling now... thank you for reading.

2020-01-24 11:20:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/etckaq/selfishness_drinking_and_routine/,"Selfishness, Drinking and Routine","So when we’re drinking all the time, we’re constantly displaying selfish behavior. We drink because we want to and because we want to feel good. We think of it as self care. If I do this thing for myself, drink, I’ll feel good (wrong). For most of us, we need to stop drinking, not stop taking care of ourselves, or being a bit selfish to do so. Also, for many of us, drinking is a routine that we look forward to. I know for me, when I felt down, even if there wasn’t booze around, I had faith that booze would eventually make me feel better. And I became dependent on that routine. 
Now in sobriety, we still need to take care of ourselves. And the truth is, to do that, we need to be a little selfish with our time. We had no problem doing that before. So I’ve finally gotten to a place where my new routine of self care is starting to provide me the same level of comfort as my old ways. I start my day with a walk. Ideally in a park, but just anywhere outside. I breath the deep air and I take a minute to do a small bit of gratitude. Usually just, Thank You Universe that I’m not drinking right now. But it’s also a time for me to think about problems or dance/walk to my favorite music. 
The take away here is, if there is something that you know makes you happy, I propose scheduling that activity into your day. Maybe just 30 minutes or maybe more. But try to find a time where you can always depend on having that opportunity to engage in something that gives you pleasure. And with time, be mindful of how that enjoyable time fuels you up to get through the rest of your day.

I am here today 30 days later. Healthier, sober, and happy. I just finished my second week of school. I am glad to have started the new year sober. I am the matriarch in my family, I am the glue that holds us together. I get stressed and pained and I fall apart instead of asking for help. My family needs me and I need them. 

Don't be afraid to ask for help. I have been medically detoxed so many times I have lost count. I have detoxed at home so many times I have lost count. I am probably getting to the point that I will probably start to have seizures from withdrawals from the amounts I drink. The kindling effect is very real and very scary. Alcoholism runs in my family, I had a relative die at 21 from cirrhosis because he started drinking vodka all the time. That is my go to drink because I hate drinking beer because it takes too long to to get a buzz and it runs through me so quick I just have to pee all the time. Anyway, I don't miss it. I miss the time wasted. I miss the moments lost in my drunken stupors. 

But upwards and on.

This all started when I was reflecting on my life one day and realized I've been drinking almost all of my adult life, though I started way before I was 18. I remember my mom giving me wine coolers on Christmas Eve when I was 13, so if that's not clear enough, I come from a family of heavy drinkers. I grew up thinking it was normal to drink every day, and continued to live my life that way. 

My mid 20's were the worst. I ended up dropping down to 95 lbs and drinking about five 750s a week. Liquid diet. I was always hungover & terribly sick, vomiting every day, passing out each night (no food + vodka). I had to have a drink on my lunch break just to make it through the day. Then things started to change. I met my husband, moved from Houston to Portland and started a new life, but alcohol stayed right by my side. My pregnancy was my largest break from alcohol, but with a baby on the way, I just couldn't wait to drink again. I have a birthday next week  on Feb. 1st- also celebration for completing my first month, which adds up to about 19+ years spent (or rather, wasted) to alcohol. Now I have a beautiful three year old daughter & a wonderful husband, but I kept missing out on beautiful moments because I was drinking & couldn't remember or I was just mentally not present.

Over the years I've made some horrible decisions & carry the weight of painful regrets, but enough is enough & I'm not missing out on another day I could be spending with my family. My daughter needs a sober mom and my husband needs a sober wife. My family is my world & I started fearing I'd lose them. I wasn't healthy & was so ashamed of my drinking.  I'd have a few before getting home from work, so while it looked like I drank 3 beers a night, it was actually closer to 6-7. I hid so much of it over the years. My health and my family weren't been taking seriously & I got tired of always feeling ashamed and neglectful.

That's when I decided to quit for good. I've already noticed so many positive changes, and I'm excited to find out who I really am, but I'm scared shitless too. Life without drinking is uncomfortable and lonely at times. Sometimes I literally don't know what to do with myself without alcohol to hide behind. This has been a strange, scary, exciting but very difficult journey- and it's only month 1! So I found you guys. I need to know I'm not alone and that there are others out there that know firsthand what I'm going through. I hope to eventually find some inner peace, accept my past and live a sober life, but I'll need help along the way. I'm entering uncharted territories, but let the adventure begin...",19

Today is the hardest day I’ll have staying sober!,"Just wanted to share a quick story with everyone. I am 120 days sober and it has gotten much easier as the days have passed. I still occasionally have cravings or might want a drink when doing certain things that I used to always do with a drink. But I always think of the time I have put into this and how much better I feel and say to hell with the drinks. 

That is until today. I’ve dreaded this day since I quit drinking. Today is the 2 year anniversary of my dad losing his battle with cancer. 

I told myself when dad died that every year on this day I would drink a 12pack of his favorite beer and remember everything we used to do together.  I got up really early this morning and instantly started trying to justify drinking “Just for today.” 
My boss, who is also a very good friend of mine, gave me the day off. He also quit drinking. He’s at 75 days sober. I got a text from him today that kind of surprised me. He told me that I was the reason he quit drinking and that even though it’s a shit day, it’s just one day. Why throw away my sober streak for one lousy day? 

So, I won’t be drinking my pops favorite beer today. I’m going to compromise and get a 6 pack of Non alcoholic beer and go up in the mountains and have a few with pops. I’m going to spread some of his ashes up here in the Black Hills and go to bed tonight sober. 

Thank you all for listening. I hope you all have a wonderful day!

One part of this was him sharing his story about alcohol addiction and he said “I used to just drink to make the days pass quicker.” And that hit me hard because that was my attitude to alcohol a couple of years ago when I really was struggling with my issues. I’m so thankful that I had a support network around me to pull me from the brink, which is what this guy needed more than anything.

I did taper off my drinking two days in a row by drinking half of a bottle of wine on each day and once the wine was gone I decided I could quit. It’s been hard to go to sleep but thankfully I don’t have serious withdrawal symptoms. 

I felt so embarrassed this week because we’re doing a biggest loser thing at work and because of my drinking I haven’t been keeping my calories low and I’m letting down my partner in the contest. I think that was what gave me the additional kick to at least spend a couple days not drinking an enormous amount and then spend one not drinking at all. My biggest culprit so far has been going to the grocery store by myself coming home from work and not being able to resist getting something. I think I’m going to have to be an overgrown child and not go to the grocery store without my wife. 

The semester is starting so the consequences are dire if I slip up. I’m hoping I can get through it one day at a time. 

Thank you everyone, I will not drink with any of you today.",15
2020-01-24 08:09:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eta774/thoughts_on_60_days/,Thoughts on 60 days,"I’ve lurked on this sub for probably two years. Two years of wondering if I had it in me to stop drinking. Years of waking up wishing I didn’t drink nearly an entire bottle of wine, waking up feeling like I’ll never let that happen again, followed by night after night of giving in to the wine witch telling me I had it under control and could have one..which led to four sometimes five before finally falling asleep. I know I’m going to sound like a fangirl but the day I downloaded This Naked Mind audiobook was a game-changer. If it wasn’t for this sub I never would have been interested in checking it out. I was skeptical and felt like I knew it all already. And deep down I did know, as alcohol has been a major definer in my life. My mother drank herself to death when I was 13 years old, around the same age I am now. I also have a 13-year-old son, so the universe was screaming at me to finally wake up to what I’m doing to myself and the people I love. As a teen, I had the same thoughts about alcohol as I do again. I’ve known it’s a poison, that it lies, that it’s progressive and it destroys lives- I saw it happen. I knew. Part of me was justifying my near bottle per night habit- “at least I’m not like my mother” who was drinking straight vodka all day and night right up to the end. I felt like because I have a job, no DUI’s, no serious medical issues (just lots of minor ones!), no blackouts, no serious consequences, no rock bottom, that all was right with the world and I could continue my nightly chase of oblivion. So Annie Grace’s experience as a professional woman working in a drinking culture spoke to me so clearly. Especially the part about wine ceremonials, pairings, and tastings being utter bullshit. How can you say something tastes “oaky”?? Really hit me between the eyes and I can’t believe I didn’t see this myself. 

So I started. The first day was tough, and the next one was a little easier. I would say to myself when a craving hit- “How strong are you?” and that was enough. One week seemed like a small win, two weeks was even more of a win. Three weeks seemed significant. After four weeks I felt like I was really happy with this new way of living. My skin started to clear, my eyes are brighter, and my sleep is solid. Went with the family on a two-week overseas vacation with free booze available at multiple times and I passed each time. And in the past two weeks, I’ve successfully managed to take two business trips that would normally be wine laden, especially the lonely nights in my hotel room, but I’ve managed to not give in. Perhaps most encouraging, I actually USED the workout clothes I packed for both trips. I’m getting my steps in. I’m eating within my calorie range on most days. I’ve dropped 10lbs. I know I have a long way to go, but with help from this sub, books, and podcasts, I will continue to be able to say IWNDWYT. Thank you all for being here.

2020-01-24 07:38:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/et9ves/rough_day_for_a_young_alcoholic/,Rough day for a young alcoholic,"I’ve had a hard time coming to terms with being an alcoholic. After all, to the outside world I’m only 17 and I barely drink. But I think about it all the time. Anytime I’m inconvenienced, every time a problem comes up I just want to drown myself in a bottle or five. I’ve given in a few times too. NYE 2017-2018 I had a glass of cava among friends, before I’d realised what I am. That night I came home and downed the majority of my mother’s big bottle of Bailey’s while everyone was asleep. She’s not a drinker, never was but this one time she brought something home I ruined it. I told her I’d baked brownies with it the next day, and I think it fooled her. Maybe she just didn’t want to consider he prospect of another alcoholic son. Similar thing happened the time I found out one of my closest friends had gone to a party and drank more than anyone else there. He was one of my few sober friends, and he felt like an anchor to me. I spent that night with the bottle of wine my mother had brought home so I could cook risotto with it. Like I said, my parents don’t really drink anymore for my father’s sobriety’s sake, so bad timing got me both these times. That friend is still in my life and he barely drinks today, and has been one of the greatest supporters of my sobriety. If you’re reading this for some reason, Albin, I love you man.

My family has quite the history, both with and without alcohol. Dad’s parents drank themselves to death and put him on the same path, he’s been drinking and smoking since he was 12. He’s been sober all my life, but I know he can never drink again. It hurts me to see his health failing him, his teeth falling out after all those years of drug and alcohol abuse. I guess I see what awaits me. My mother had an alright home life, but she’s had abusive partners and still deals with the anxiety from that. She’s had it rough, but I know she’s very proud of me, probably because I’m the kid most like her. It would break her heart to know I’m like her eldest son and dad. My parents don’t have the greatest, most loving relationship, but they’re both great parents. If it weren’t for them, I wouldn’t have much of what makes me happy today. 

I have five siblings, two younger and three older. My eldest sister is mentally ill and has spent time in a psychiatric ward where her boyfriend killed himself, the second to eldest is a liar and a psychopath and my older brother is an alcoholic and a pill junkie. Quite the draw, I know. I don’t get how we got dealt this hand, my parents aren’t abusive or destructive in any way and as far as I know mom got dad out of his drinking before they raised the kids. Maybe we just got a bad hand. 

Today I had a rough day. My closest friend group that’s on the verge of collapse is planning a party for the weekend, and at this point I don’t know if the girls in the group have any interests but booze. It’s all they’ve been talking about for the past few months, and it’s been painful each time but today it really got to me. I didn’t know if I wanted to down a bottle of vodka or never hear the word again. For just a moment, I felt like maybe death was he only way out of these feelings. The awful paradox of alcoholism, I guess. I talked to a few outside friends who calmed me down and I decided to go home from school. I already feel better away from those guys and I’ll take a quick nap now. Later today I’ll go to figure skating training (unique for a guy, I know) and go home and cook me a real nice dinner. My family’s away for the weekend, so I’ll invite some friends over for board games or a movie. Tomorrow I’ll meet the kids I’m teaching to skate, one of my great purposes in life. They’re kind, funny, talented kids, and a reminder to stay on the straight path. I can’t wait to see them again. Will I go to the party? I don’t care much right now to be honest. If I don’t, I won’t drink. If I do, I won’t drink. And I know some of you probably don’t consider me a “real” alcoholic, and that’s okay. But I know I will be if I don’t leave it be, for now. One day, I want to be normal. One day I might be able to have just a drink or two. Today is not that day, that much I know. But maybe one day I’ll be okay. IWNDWYT.",16

Currently on day 11 without a drink (after years of sinking way too much). Despite the first few days being horrendous, I'm now feeling much better and quite healthy in general. I feel like I may just be winning at this.
My only issue is that I'm yet to be able to get a good night's sleep. I have tried laying in bed hoping to fall asleep, audio books, mindfulness apps and nothing is working.

And all the while I was chipping away at the part of me that was believing the lies my inner drunk was telling myself.  I was learning to listen. I was becoming teachable. It took some time to overcome the momentum my drunken self had achieved. 

Eventually I didn't pick up THAT drink or the next and the days started to pile up - and I had something to live for - and my recovery became too important to lose over a hurt feeling or a stupid rationalization.

I learned to accept help (in AA (which is not the only place to get it (though it still works and is free and probably convenient to you)))  I got promotions at work because I was better than 'functional'. Life got a lot better because I wasn't lying - to myself and the world.

And now - the fruits of recovery # ? it's a big number.   I am packing up this computer because in three days I'm leaving on an epic road trip, fleeing winter - taking wife, dog and camera - and all because I am sober - and more - the more is (condensed greatly) I am comfortable in my own skin.

I am getting married and staring a new job in a few weeks. I have been debating as to whether or not I should drink during the honeymoon. It would be fun. It would be fine. It would be outside of the country. It would be outside of the norm. Then I read here about the folks who decided to drink again for a one-off and then got back to their old ways very quickly. I think I will hold off. I know what the beer tasters like. I know what the wine tastes like. I know how it feels. I do not know why I think it will be a different experience outside of the country. Drunk is drunk.  Buzzed is buzzed. It is the same everywhere. If I do not want to do it at home because it does not give me what I want why do I think it will be different somewhere else?

I’m not sure if this will be helpful for anyone but so far it’s been helping me. I decided to start the whole30 diet Sunday and for anyone not familiar it basically means I have to cut out eating everything but meat, fruit and vegetables. Grocery shopping is a chore and I constantly have to say no to different items. It involves resisting temptation on such a large scale that it has made saying no to alcohol just another part of the challenge. I’m getting so much practice saying no to cravings.

This is the first time in about 7 years I've gone thirty days without alcohol. I was 22 or so when I started, and probably like many - it wasn't an issue. I drank at parties and events, nights out, etc.


In December 2019, I decided I wanted real change. I read This Naked Mind and only drank 6x in December. At that point this was about a 80% reduction in my drinking. 
  
I've now beat my own record, and at 30 days sober a lot has changed. I've started a new job. My anxiety has improved so much, and it's easier now to see real triggers instead of booze clouding everything. 

Ive lost a little weight and a significant amount of bloat. My sleep is still rocky but I'm writing this after a solid 8 hours with no waking in the middle of the night. I now manage to get up early and run myself ragged during the day, without naps or alcohol. 

I'm starting therapy again. I am eating healthy again, and starting to look for a gym. I read a lot again, and journal again. I haven't done that since I was an undergrad (10 years almost!) There's a lot of 'agains' happening for me!!

I'm looking into trying new hobbies, and it's exciting. I've done several nights out and a work trip with no booze! And I survived! 

I'm very proud of myself amd I'm looking forward to more benefits of being alcohol free.

I'd love to hear the ways things improved for others. Nothing helps more than hearing all the big and 'small' things that changed when you quit.

And finally, a big thank you to this sub. I wouldn't be here at 30 days without all of you!!",10

Sure, I drink often and overdo it fairly easily, but I have never become angry or emotional to the point of becoming an issue to those around me. Worst case ill either black out and be done for the night, or ill get alittle crazy and start acting kind of reckless, generally the latter. However, even at my most reckless I have never continually acted in that manner when the people around me are obviously getting mad and telling me to stfu. I would do something reckless, they would get mad and tell me to chill, and I would chill (for the most part).  

Probably worth mentioning that I have my fair share of mental health issues; it seems easy to blame it on some sort of mental issue, insecurity or something of that nature. 

There are certain people that I drink often with that always seem to become either angry or emotional when very drunk, sometimes alittle of both. My brother and I used to drink often together, and whenever we see each-other now usually get drunk together at least once. He has a habit of getting angry drunk towards the end of the night and when it happens it ruins the whole vibe. He’ll start being overly aggressive for no reason and generally just get mad at makes it seem like its him against everyone else. 

Now this is just one example that I can describe in depth because I obviously know my brother very well; there is literally no reason to get mad. 
He is normally confident and has huge aspirations and is excelling very quickly in his field, which is ironically psychology. 

There are other people that consistently feel some type of way after drinking too much, lots of emotional crying and what not. This I kind of understand as the alcohol allows you to “purge” whatever your feeling deep down. 

Sorry for the rant, but my question is why? Id love to hear from an ex-angry/emotional drinker to understand that point of view.",0

Bullshit. I’m 16 watching this scene and annoyed at how silly it is to me. I started drinking alone. Asking some creepy 20 year old who hangs around 15 year olds to buy me alcohol. How could I possibly have an alcohol problem whenever the first time I ever drank alcohol I drank alone?

Time passes, years pass. I drink with friends, go to clubs, I never enjoy it. People say ‘Last night was great’, I regret it even though I did nothing to regret. It’s common for people quitting alcohol to dred  not being thought of as fun anymore when they get sober. When I went out people said I was fun, I’ve had bosses say to me ‘Why can’t you be more like you were at the christmas party?’ That party when I was a bottle of whiskey in and 3 lines deep? You want me to show up to work key’d up? When people said how fun I was dancing I just felt bad like they weren’t actually complimenting me, they were just complimenting the alcohol that had taken over.  

It’s not these parties that gets me, it’s being alone at 6pm in my room. I’ve been attempting sobriety for a year now. Going out to clubs is easy, it’s actually enjoyable tbh in a selfish way.

And when the clubs spill out at 2am and I see the people vomiting in the street, young lads thinking they are hard fighting eachother, the sad faces of takeaway workers trying to  communicate with hoardes of drunks ordering food, girls walking arm in arm in groups of three because they need to balance off eachother or else they will fall over, drunks walking in front of cars, people hailing cars like they are taxis, people hailing occupied taxis, women crying for some reason in the street, sweaty drunks sticking their tongues in eachothers heads, drunks talking to the homeless sleeping in shop shutters like the homeless aren’t also tired of your shit and I can walk through it knowing I’m not a part of it. Knowing I will wake up fine tomorrow and be able to get in my car and drive home listening to one of my favorite albums. It feels good but it is selfish.  

But I’m 25 now, and for all that self riteous shit about coming home from clubs I've nuked myself with alcohol every week to avoid the miserable fucking wedneday evening silence of life. Who the fuck invented Wednesdays anyway? But when I look at my alcoholism since that Mad Men scene it isn’t the type of dramatic shit you get in a sensitive arthouse movie. It’s dull and it’s a waste. There is no climax. I drink when I’m alone and I drink to avoid my feelings and stress. I look back at the Roger Sterling scene at 16 years old and whilst I obviously wasn’t an alcoholic, the seeds of the problem were there. He was right. I had an immediate problem. You drank to avoid yourself back then, it led to failures, it led to you now. The problem was there from day 1 and it was just waiting to hatch, you can plot a chart from then to now and it’s frankly embarassing how straight forward it is.  

This shit isn’t about me and alcohol, it’s about me and my inability to be with myself. Was there at 16 and is there now, you always had a problem.

Roger, you were spot on.",9

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens - good or bad - and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This post goes up at:

US - Night/Early Morning

Europe - Morning

Asia and Australia - Evening/Night

A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar.

\+++++++++++++++++++++++

This week for the daily check-in I thought I would explore the acronym we see and use so often: **IWNDWYT.**

For those unfamiliar with that phrase, it is our 24-hour pledge of intent: I WILL NOT DRINK WITH YOU TODAY. I thought it might be nice to use these seven words as a framework for my seven day hosting gig. I look forward to reading your responses –

**Our word of the day is “YOU”. What does this mean to you with respect to our pledge?**

PS - i*f anyone with 30 days or more of sobriety would like to host the daily check in for a week, please let me know.*",77

I have some questions and my dad is currently going through it as well as liver damage.,"So my dad went to the er before for this about 4 months ago he was pooping blood and they found out it was an esophageal varices and he had this clip thing put on a vein in his esophagus (sorry I’m not too familiar with what this is) and apparently he said it fell off. Then they didn’t do anything else and we’re supposed to do a few more tests but idk what for and then my dad just got fed up said the doctors the day before told him he was going home the next day and then the nurse said otherwise and he got mad and left the hospital his self had someone take him home. So now he called us and was saying how he is throwing up blood now. So my mom is taking him back to the emergency room. 

So my question is if you have an esophageal varices and the clip the vein together I guess to stop the bleeding I’m not sure does that clip have to stay on or is it supposed to come off?",3

Maybe you guys can relate. I would drink 1-3 beers. I would midnight snack. I would play smash bros till 1 or 2am. Finally I’d go to sleep. I’d wake up tomorrow morning mildly hungover. I’d be rushing my daughter out of the door to get to school on time. I’d come back home and get ready for work in a rush. I’d arrive to work disheveled. I’d have bubble-guts and the Hershey squirts. I’d be super anxious (panic attack level) about my meeting to promote my employee. During the meeting I’d get really defensive at any opposing feedback. I’d probably slur my words a bit. I’d  be a dick about receiving feedback. My frustration would be obvious. After the meeting I’d go to the bathroom with bubble guts. I’d stress-eat my feelings with a greasy cheeseburger, telling myself it would help with the hangover. I’d sit at my desk listlessly for the next four hours before coming home and ignoring my wife and children and passing out on the couch by 8pm. I’d wake up again at 11pm. Feel fucked because I knew I wouldn’t get to sleep again till 4am. Sleep through the next day, Neglecting my kids and wasting away on the couch. Eat shitty takeout and knock out ealry. Maybe Sunday I’d start to feel better again. Probably wishing I hadnt drink tonight. 

Instead im playing the tape forward with this post. Fortunately I’m aware of the extreme privilege it is to put someone up for promotion. It’s a gift to be of service and to help others grow. Sobriety helps me see that. We are going to promote this mother fucker tomorrow because IWNDWYT.",10

The absolute (*former drinker brain automatically thinks* vodka) longest I have gone without caving in to alcohol in recent years. My thoughts today have been telling me:

• ""it's okay to drink, you're not a ReAl alcoholic"" 
• ""Just a glass or two, take the edge off, it's been a long day""
• ""You DESERVE it""
• ""How about lets just not feel today and drink it away instead""

Today was hard. I almost gave in. I wanted so badly to give in. To just give up. 

Instead I cried in the bathroom, went for a long walk, let myself process how I was feeling today (stressed, anxious, lonely), had a coffee and went back to studying.  

I didn't give in today.
I'm proud that I'm writing this and going to sleep sober tonight instead of pouring myself a bottle of wine and drinking until daylight. One day (no matter how shitty it is) at a time.",10

I know I shouldn’t, but I’ve picked up my (tobacco) pipe for the time being.","Ok. I just found this group. I’m still not super well versed with Reddit and I access it from the app on my phone so I don’t think I’ve ever seen the legendary side bars. 

So after years of my daily drinking getting bad then reigning in then getting bad again I started trying to quit but didn’t want to. 1/19 I had a bad bout & drank too much. 1/20 I committed to quit. I didn’t want to at that point but I knew I would figure it out. As a trade off to myself I’ve picked my Ferndown, Dunhill & Peterson pipes back up out of storage & have been puffing on them instead of drinking. I have stopped smoking my pipes before & know that I can go without... (pipe tobacco is not inhaled directly, and the whole process is meditative like making & drinking tea). 

I know “restarting” tobacco use is not a good idea but I feel like I have made it a means to forget that (my mind/body) is craving a beer or whiskey. I’ve picked up the audiobook “the naked mind” and have just started listening to it... the author presents the case very well. I am re-examining my thinking process towards alcohol after only listing to a bit of the book. I have gone through the cognitive dissonance therapy before because of shitty (can we say that on reddit??) depression & ADHD which I’ve learned not only to live with, but to some extent harness my ability to “high function” multitask or hyper focus to get tasks completed. 

I’m not sure if I’m actually asking something or just trying to introduce myself to the community here. I have a problem that I’m trying my best to deal with. I don’t have the time or schedule to do the AlAnon programs & I’m not sure it would speak to me. I’ve been spending a lot more time in the barn with my horse & have been trying to split the other part of my time with my better half (wife) & the kidiots (kid-iots... you know kid idiots ;) ). 

The first few days sucked. I felt like I was being deprived. I haven’t been in a social situation where I’ve had to say “no” yet, but I was straightedge in high school and once I get my brain fixed I don’t think I’ll have a problem staying “no” and not feeling like I’m missing out on something.

Any advice on how to help him stay on the straight and narrow?,"My boyfriend was a pretty heavy night drinker for several years. He had a hard time sleeping for a while and would drink to pass out so he would get some rest before work in the morning. I think he honestly knew the amount he was drinking was not okay long before he actually had to admit it out loud, but aren't we all guilty of looking the other way on our own problems? 

Once I found out about his problems with alcohol, I've tried to do whatever I can to help him deal with it. Personally, I don't drink at all. I don't even do it on occasion or out with friends, so I'm a pretty safe space.

He's been doing so well these last few months. The last time he drank before tonight was the weekend before Halloween. I'm honestly so proud of him and how he's been handling this. I know it's not easy. I don't expect for his problems with alcohol to magically disappear after some time away from it. But I also have been worried about what it would be like when he fell off the wagon. I had a feeling something like this was coming, but I didn't really know what to expect.

I had been trying to encourage him to find a good AA meeting, but the ones local to us are hard for him to relate to. It seems like 85 percent of the people there are only there to get their paper signed for drug court and not there to really get or stay clean. And it's not just him saying that. I went to a meeting with him to try to better understand the process and some of what they try to teach. He was disappointed that the people there were just trying to stay out of jail. 

What can I do to help him? I've suggested counseling (outpatient therapy didn't work, the office was next to a liquor store), AA meetings, having him talk to me instead of a counselor...I'm out of ideas. He's been to rehab, but won't willingly go back because of how he was treated there. He swears I do so much to help him, but I'm not really doing anything. I'm just trying to take care of him. It breaks my heart to see him this way.

I'm hoping I'm asking in the right place. I stumbled upon your sub and thought some of you might be able to shed some light on this.",9

(I’ll explain more) ⤵️ 🥃 ☕️,"Wondering if you guys have any suggestions for healthy alternatives drinks to alcohol in the evening? I’m a bourbon drinker, but I’ve noticed it’s way too easy to fall into the habit of drinking every night when I buy a bottle for home. 

I exercise a ton, consume a lot of coffee in the morning, and then water throughout the rest of the day. I absolutely love coffee and the “bite” it has earlier in the day, and I that’s why I like drinking straight whiskey as well in the evening. 

MORNING CRUTCH - COFFEE - EVENING CRUTCH - WHISKEY. 

I really don’t think I’ll have a hard time replacing the evening crutch with something non-alcoholic if I can just find something I enjoy as much as I do as coffee earlier in the day. 

I can’t drink coffee (even decaf) past 4PM or I’ll be up all night. I know it’s a vague question, and I shouldn’t be crutch dependent to anything (even coffee), but I wish I can fill the void I’m looking for at night like I do in the mornings/mid day with coffee. I honestly look forward to drinking coffee more in the coming hours when I’m going to bed, than I do to drinking bourbon when I’m getting off work. 

Any  non-alcoholic suggestions (other than caffeinated drinks or Soda) that might perhaps have that night time “bite” I’m looking for?

To my Delite and surprise, he was also on a cleanse - 40 days without alcohol and eating clean.

We walked around the beach, around Redondo Beach, got Thai massages.
Our days began ridiculously: we had so much fun doing YouTube dance marathons together.
We got dressed up in matching white Tuxedos to go to a dance party in DT LA. Of course,  we both passed out before we made it out of the house, but that was OK with me.



Was such a chill trip, exactly what I needed.

I am refreshed - though sad to be back on the east coast - but I'm going to keep on keeping on. 


Btw, happy birthday to me: I have lost 7 pounds since I quit, despite my massive piece of chocolate birthday cake.

There is so much I agree with AA — my life was unmanageable, I need to admit my failings as a way to maintain sobriety and in no way would I want to impact another person’s sobriety.

But I’ve also never lost a job, my family is super supportive of all of my decisions, no DUIs, no financial problems...I just found that enough was enough and this isn’t the life I ever want to lead again.

I feel like AA highlights the “rock bottom” cases and it can be hard to speak up if you are on the newly sober scale. The AA “newcomers”
meeting I was at yesterday had a member where he’s got his life completely together now but 10 years ago he was kicked out of a crack house for being unruly and that was his moment. I don’t really know what a crack house would even be or able to be found.

This speaker seems awesome as a person but I’m so new to being sober and I just cannot relate quite yet, I don’t really want to relate which is why I’m in AA meetings, and I really don’t want to ever chance another person’s sobriety. I feel like a welcomed but misplaced guest in a room of great people but I worry it’s not helping me at this time and place.

I’m still using nicotine because I didn’t want to tackle everything at once and risk overloading myself. But I am really addicted to vaping and want to give it up in the near future. Those who have quit both separately, how do the long term symptoms compare?

I just now feel like I’m beginning to heal my brain, but for the first couple months without booze I was incredibly depressed and anxious, easily angered and did not feel like myself at all. Just want to know if giving up nic is similar in terms of timeline. I’m scared of feeling like shit for a prolonged period again.",3

I've been able to hang out with friends at bars, play pool solo, hang with friends while they drank and it hasn't really been much of an issue for me. Every now and then I'll see a new trigger and just think ""whoa, wasn't expecting THAT to be a thing"" but always managed to shrug it off and stay strong. I've recently accepted a position as a prep/barback a few nights a week at a local cocktail bar for some extra money and social interaction. Everyone knows I don't drink and it hasn't really been an issue.

My dream last night: I was working at the bar and it was busy. I was serving guests and feeling a little overwhelmed. Anyone who's put in time in the industry knows about these types of dreams. Anyways, my old boss shows up and tells me he wants to talk to me. I leave the bar and follow him to the office. He tells me that I'm doing a great job and keep it up. He moves a binder thats sitting on the desk and exposes a whole rack of fat lines of coke and leans in to one. He asks me if I want one.

Now cocaine was never a problem for me (just like drinking right??!) so I hesitate and kinda think about it a bit. ""Man, one quick fat one would really help out on the floor"". I thought about it a second longer then told him, ""Thanks but I'm good"" and then woke up.

While its kinda silly, I gotta say I'm pretty dang proud of myself! Even my subconscious knows that we've moved past all that crap!

Anyways, just wanted to share my story with ya'll. Stay strong friends, you've moved past that crap too and you're doing it and thats awesome! IWNDWYT!",7

Now this week I took care of the apartment, I feel like 4 years pass me by like nothing, I couldnt take care of some basic stuff.

I would arribe from work with some beers and other drinks, drop on the couch, turn the computer and drink.

Well, one week no cigarrette (I left like 3 months ago), no alcohol and no gaming... I did A TON of stuff, like practice instruments, exercise, took care of the apartment (clean, fix, order stuff), cook, organize stuff... It feels as I did more this week than in 4 years.",14

&#x200B;

Found this list on my phone today, dated Feb 8, 2018:

 *My Reasons not to drink*

*I will have a better relationship with my wife*

*I will have a better relationship with my kids*

*I will feel better every morning* 

*Our finances will be so much better*

*My health.* 

*I will be in control*

*I will stay awake for movies*

*I won’t want to leave where I am so I can go home and drink*

*I will have more time for the things I truly enjoy*

*I will enjoy my life more by being present*

*All the effort I put into my body and running won’t be for not.* 

*I won’t be a slave and be controlled by something I don’t want*

***I lived half my life in a fog. I won’t do it anymore.*** 

*Reasons to drink*

*I like it.* 

*My friends might not get it*

*I might feel awkward in social situations* 

*Not sure what to with all my time on vacations or long weekends*

&#x200B;

I'll never delete this, ever. It's too important for me to look back and understand my desperation at that time.

It's been two weeks shy of two years for me.  And because of the decision I made and stuck to I can make a new list:

*I love my wife and kids and have a better relationship now with them than I ever did.*

*I went back to university part time (and am doing really well).*

*I got a promotion at work. (and a good raise!)*

*I do yoga and love it.*

*I lost 25 lbs and kept it off (I am not a big dude so it's significant).*

*I have a significant savings account.*

*I took my family to Jamaica. (first real vacation in 9 years)*

*I've run my fastest races in the 5K, half marathon, and full marathon (all past the age of 40).*

*Our house is old, and now it's old, amazing and feels alive because we take the time to do the right things to/for it.*

*We adopted two dogs and are good/responsible dog owners.*

*I no longer want to leave places so I can go home and drink (hence being present).*

*I feel so good every morning, I forget what hungover feels like.*

*Oh, and I now have seen the end of most movies we watch!* 

&#x200B;

It's not all roses. The first couple weeks were horrendous. I won't lie. And I've had my share of pity-parties along the way.  **But everything was worth it. This is by far the best decision I've ever made.**  Some of my friendships have suffered - I am OK with that. I still have a desire to drink, although less and less.  We go out with friends still, but on my terms (I'll drive so I can leave when I want). My wife took out two pint glasses (the only two I kept that have sentimental value) this past weekend, and put them where I could see them. That lasted for 5 minutes.  I couldn't walk by them without thinking about how I wanted a beer, and 'oh why am I cursed in this way'? So is it all great all the time? Of course not.  I mean, it's still real life. But it is so much better than I could have expected or asked for.

The events that led to me quitting are typical, so I won't bore you with details.  But suffice to say, I was on the verge of losing it all, including my family.

Also, even though my wife may never read this, I can't thank her enough (I'll do so in person when she gets home!).  She doesn't have an issue with alcohol, but completely stopped drinking as well to support me.  And I love her dearly for it.  I could never have done any of this without her.

&#x200B;

Anyway folks, sorry for the long post.

I have bills that are due, I have the money to pay them thankfully. But I’ll just pay them later. Now there’s late fees. Ok I’ll pay them I guess. Maybe. Maybe tomorrow. 

It’s Saturday, I didn’t eat breakfast. I’m pretty hungry but too lazy to go get fast food and of course there’s nothing in the fridge. I’ll just start drinking so I’ll want to order pizza later. 

I have friends I haven’t seen in a while, I should go out with them. No, I’ll just drink alone at home. Why go to all that effort when I can just drink here. 

I’m on vacation, kinda tight on money and the airfare and hotel cost a lot, be careful not to be spending too much and buying things I don’t need. At the airport on the way home 3 $15 rum and cokes is a fine way to spend my money now. 

I went to that liquor store yesterday, I’ll drive a couple miles to the next so they don’t see I’m out already. 

Please don’t drink. I don’t want to be doing this anymore. I hate everything about this drink. I’m tired of feeling this wand and being hungover and of liquid shits and of having no motivation and being so alone and doing nothing and being so depressed. All as I pour a drink and start drinking. 

I just woke up and have no idea what I did last night. Who did I text, what did I say. Oh fuck I deleted the conversations so I wouldn’t have to see what I did in the morning. Now I’m too ashamed to ask, I just won’t talk to anyone for a while and hopefully they’ll forget.


It doesn’t make sense. Why did I do all these things? What else in life would I ever hate so much and just keep doing. There is nothing. There is absolutely no reason to keep doing it. I am so glad I am on the path to thinking clearly again and seeing all the insanity alcohol caused. I am so thankful I can see it now.",182

I’m asking because I went to a work happy hour with the CEO of our company and all 30+ employees were drinking alcohol. Our CEO was sitting next to us when ordering, so I did not want to say “water please” or a “coke with light ice” and have to explain to everyone why I don’t drink. I’d rather not get into detail that my parents are alcoholics and also talk about the destruction alcohol has caused me. I don’t want to put everyone in a somber mood(talking about my problems)  when everyone is happy. 

I’m not strong enough to refrain from having one drink during social events. I value my sobriety, but I also feel that one 4%-5% light beer would be okay during occasional situations.  

Perhaps I could make an excuse and let my company know that I’m training for a Triathalon and that alcohol affects my training...any advice would be appreciated because I struggle with anxiety I’m just trying to fit in",4

2020-01-23 15:19:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/esyrb6/not_giving_up/,Not giving up,"Over the last month, hell, the last few years I have made many attempts to quit drinking.  Some have been more successful than others.  I have gone days, even weeks without having a drink.  However I always ended up caving at some point.  Today, as I wake up with a hangover for the thousandth time I seem to be at another crossroads, yet again.  Give up trying to quit?  Or quit drinking?

There are no guarantees in life.  Obviously if I continue drinking things could go fine, but in all likelihood I will end up binging again and regretting it all.  Alternatively, if I decide to quit, and it sticks, it will be the best decision of my life.  So today, I have decided to quit drinking.

I believe in myself that when I make a commitment I can stick to it, and past failures are not indicative of future success.  I have quit drinking before and I will do it again.  I will stop the excuses, the ""one more time"" nonsense, and take responsibility for myself.  

Today I quit drinking.  I will look back at this post one week, one month, one year from now and realize this was my turning point.  And what made this time different?   I can tell you what made it different.  The realization that alcohol offers no benefits whatsoever, that trying to moderate is more trouble than it is worth, and I want to be the man who sticks to his word.  When I say it's over with alcohol, it's over.  No exceptions.

Day 1.  Here we go.  I will not fail.  If any of you are religious or spiritual, please send your prayers out.  I will also pray myself.  I can and will quit for good.  Mark my words",5

In addition, I had a sex dream last night, and since I used to be such a stoner, remembering my dreams period wasn’t happening. It was detailed, nice dream where I had a loving partner. Then I woke up and felt utter horror. 

I know what will be said - delete instagram. I am one of those people that genuinely uses it for work and cannot so easily divorce myself from it. I have muted the posts and stories of every single woman that I know, so the only way to see a woman is for them to come up on a male friends post - at a certain point I can’t avoid seeing females, you see them in magazines, billboards driving to work, you can’t block/delete your way out of seeing the female figure - I need to get stronger about resisting the initial urge though so I have downloaded a couple apps that I think will help me with it, limiting my usage.

Now that I’m doing keto and exercising daily, it’s becoming a little more difficult to not be tempted.

I (25M) have been in a relationship with my SO (21F) for 6 months.

Financially my best option is to move home from Texas to California in the next week and find a job in California while my GF finishes college in Texas.  

While my entire family resides in CA and my younger brother has around 50 days sober, my parents love to drink and keep bottles of wine and liquor all over the house as well as beer in the fridge, and encourage me to drink with them.  On top of that, all my friends in CA drink and drinking is embraced  in my occupation as well (finance).

Not drinking has been relatively simple for me so far, only because my SO is so supportive.  She is the only person to make me feel whole enough to make me not need or want to drink, and I can envision a purposeful, joyous and fun life with her and without alcohol.  

here is what I need help with;  while in CA without her around to help, what can I do to encourage myself to stay sober through cravings, anxiety, and peer pressure and if my SO decides to leave me or cut me from her life while I am out there, how can I keep from relapsing with so much temptation around me?",1

I have good insurance I'm just not smart enough to figure out how to pick one.

All I want is to say fuck it and go insane. I told him I'll probably want to be alone that day. Totally alone. I want my 200 day chip and then I want to go across the street to my bar which supports my sobriety and get shitfaced. Alone. 

I also Hate AA so the fact that I want to goto a meeting is surprising.

If I drink, at least it confirms that I'm a fuckup.

What I'm trying to say is, I made it to the 200 days, ALMOST Getting sober was and is definitely the hardest thing I've ever done in my entire 28 years but I thought it'd be different. I'm still tired and cranky. Last night we went on a late night Kroger run and as he stopped by the frozen chicken aisle I glared at the row of alcohol parallel to us.  I miss wine so much. The heavy feeling in your shoulders after your belly is full of it. Feeling cuter. I wasn't a good drunk but as my 200 days approaches all I want to do is drink. 

It's not even better, it's just different. I cannot remember the last time I made a plan to goto a bar with a friend and hung out on a barstool and talked with the bartender. I can't remember the last time I had a full conversation with a bartender about anything. I miss it. I do miss the drinking culture.

I haven't drank in close to a month, which I am quite happy about, but I am curious on why I haven't lost an ounce since I quit. I was drinking usually 6 to 7 days per week, 6 to 7 beers each time. I figure that is about 5000 calories per week in beer that I haven't been consuming for close to 4 weeks. I don't think my diet has changed drastically. It seems to be about the same amount of food consumed, maybe even a bit less at night since drinking would also make me hungry, and yet, no changes in weight. 

It's not really discouraging and losing weight isn't the reason why I stopped drinking. It seems to be something I can't quite wrap my head around. I guess my question is to people that haven't been drinking for longer than I have, what is your experience with weight loss, if any?",7

Anybody else finding that their friends get a bit weird about them not drinking? I gave up for a few months last year, and ended up caving, because my mates on my birthday really insisted on my having a glass of wine. This year, with all your help, I'm determined to stick with it, almost a month down.

We've been to the pub, a few times even at my suggestion (I just have a diet soda or a tea or something) and so much of the conversation is about me not drinking, which is getting boring.

The mates (who mean well and I love dearly) talk about *moderation* and *just get through Dry January then drink* like it's just a small thing, like I'm **fixed** just by giving up for 31 days. But whilst not feeling like an alcoholic, I have abused alcohol as a coping mechanism for anxiety and depression, which coupled with my OCD and self control issues means I have formed an abusive relationship with it.

They talk from their own point of views, and I feel some of them have a lot of unresolved issues with drink they haven't acknowledged, a lot of people who drink at lunch every day (work in media, very much a chilled environment).

I also know they might well be able to moderate and control themselves, and accept that. So why should I have to explain myself for wanting to not drink at all, for not having the ability to moderate?

My long term goal is to possibly reintegrate alcohol once I have dealt with my personal issues, but am aware that might not be a compatible issues. One understanding mate joked ""with or without drink, you're still the same loud dickhead, and I love ya."" And that off-the-cuff comment keeps me powering on, along with you guys.

I've been at the exact same weight for 18 months, up a couple pounds from where I was most of the year before that, and more than I was four years ago when some shit happened that made me have to temporarily cut activity and stress made me eat a bunch of bad stuff.   Decided this year to join the ""dry January"" thing, mainly to get out of the habit of squashing job stress with after work drink(s) out of habit and to encourage myself to be more productive after work, but also because I've had friends who cut back, even temporarily, and described the significant weight loss.  Sweet!

So, since 12/31, I have only drank once.  Most days it is pretty easy, I sleep better, and I have cut out a good 400-1200  worth of calories out of my DAILY diet. In addition I've also cut related calories, like the nachos and pizza from those evenings I'd be meeting folks for drinks after work or on the weekend.  At the same time, in the spirit of the New Year I've been better about bringing healthy low cal lunches to work instead of getting lazy and grabbing something, along with making less heavy meals for dinner.   And the result has been.....NOTHING.  Have not lost a pound.  No change to fit of clothes.  Everything else is pretty much exactly the same as my routine that kept me at the same weight for 18 months, except no drinking = significantly fewer calories.  So, how is it that if drinking is so caloric and I quit, it has zero effect on my weight?  

I don't mind not drinking (temporarily), and will probably go into mid-Feb, when I have a trip planned.  But I am surprised.  I guess I should be glad, because when I do start drinking again I guess I don't have to feel guilty about the calories.  But I wonder what gives--I know calories are what make weight come and go, and I know that drinking makes you fat.  How come subtracting this many calories in alcohol DAILY while keeping everything else the same or less caloric has had zero effect?  Is there something weird about alcohol calories that I am not taking into account?",1

And then I stopped because we had to go home. When I got home I didn't drink anymore, instead drank water and had dinner. 

Later on I felt the urge to drink but then took a moment to think about why I wanted a drink. I was tired and trying to clean up. Drinking would have given me a little kick to get things done, then probably would have started something else while i was finishing a drink, then gotten caught in the circle that normally spirals out of control.

Instead I went to bed. This morning I've spent a lot of time thinking about why I normally get drunk and it's the wrong reasons. I don't see an issue about why I had some drinks yesterday and don't feel the urge to drink today. For me it's also about being mindful of the drinking.

I realize this could be a slippery slope but being mindful that it wasn't out of boredom or frustration it didn't take me down the road I usually go.

Over the past 5 years I have a ton to be grateful for. My girlfriend (wife..as I refer to her) saved my life. I have 4 kids, a house (which I thought I'd never have) and good health...sort of.

These past 2 years I've really gone off the path. I can easily drink a bottle of rum in a day and I don't like who I am when I do that. I get aggressive, angry, hateful... basically the worst version of myself.
***Note: I argue with my partner but I am in no way physically or mentally abusive to her or my children.

I feel like I have the drinking under control. I never drink when I have appointments or school events to attend because I went through that embarrassment when I was younger and I can't burden my family with that. Instead, I wait until night (usually) and drink then. Often going to bed at 3 or 4 am and waking up totally drained and feeling awful.

In the past 2 years I've gained 100 lbs and feel embarrassed looking in the mirror. My career has gone stagnant and I've now gotten to the point where I need to hide my booze to not upset my partner. 

I'm not looking for a savior but advice. Meetings aren't for me. I created the problem so I know I can fix it. I just don't have the perspective or blueprint of the how.",4

I was planning on just one drink as a “reward” for making it a week without drinking for the first time in months. I woke up 2 days later in a hotel room we had apparently rented on Monday night to continue drinking. My friend informed me that I didn’t sleep the first night and at some point went out and did coke. Then we went to the liquor store at 8 am Tuesday and drank through the day... a day I have no memory of. When I woke up on Wednesday morning I was confused and felt like I had been hit by a train. My friend started freaking out when he saw that I was awake because he had tried waking me up during the night and I was completely unresponsive. He told me he shook me as hard as he could but I wouldn’t wake up. My eyes were open and just rolled to the back of my head. He thought I was going to die but I was still breathing so he slept next to me to keep an eye on me. Overall not a great time. Back to sobriety I go.,6

I have embarrassed myself in many ways from being drunk, so much so that I would even be embarrassed to share them someplace like this. I am lucky, but my luck will run out. Drinking is going to ruin my job, my health, my marriage, and my relationship with my kids.

2020-01-23 09:08:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/estl6n/partner_of_an_alcoholic_looking_for_advice/,"Partner of an alcoholic, looking for advice.","I (29F)  hope this is an appropriate subreddit to post this.

My husband (30M) of 4yrs, partner for 8yrs, is an alcoholic. It hurts to write this. I don't even think I've admitted that to anyone before; he has never admitted it. All of our friends/family knows he drinks a lot and a few have heard about incidences that have occurred when he has crossed the line. 

Over the last year, things have come to a head a couple of times. He'll drink more than usual, keep me up all night out of fear with his irregular breathing, fall on his way to the bathroom, etc. I'm furious when this happens for so many reasons. One reason that gets him to cut down for a couple weeks is that I work full time and am in grad school, so him keeping me up all night really affects me and my success. 

After one of these incidences (which happen 2-3x/yr) is really the only time I feel like I can say something about his drinking, as it affects me. My husband is very respectful of me, supports me, does anything he can to help me be successful. So, when one of these nights occurs and we talk about it, he feels very guilty and apologizes. He'll drink less for about a month but eventually the quantity always creeps up again. 

My biggest concern is the quantity of alcohol he drinks. He can easily go through a handle of whiskey over two days, while also drinking beer/whiteclaws throughout the day. If its his day off, he'll start at 11am. On his work days he doesn't drink till he gets home; sometimes the quantity is more on his work days, usually after a bad day as a stress reliever. He is highly functional day to day. 

I have fears about being a ""nagging"" wife and being ""too hard on him"" for drinking as a stress reliever after work, as he is the main financial provider for us while I'm in grad school. This keeps me from bringing up my concerns about his drinking too often, we probably discuss it once every couple of months. By the time I bring it up to him I've been letting my frustration, worry, and anxiety fester for weeks until I finally can't take it anymore. 

I've never asked him to stop drinking, I ask him to stop drinking so much. He doesn't initiate these conversations and its hard to get him to talk about his drinking with me, which I feel stems from his guilt about it. We've created routines like only drinking 4nights/week instead of every night, which he doesn't like. He's voiced that ideally he can drink every night as a stress reliever, which in theory I'm not completely against, but he's never able to control the quantity of his drinking. And it always turns into a problem again within a few weeks. 

We also tried doing ""weekly check-ins"" that were honestly more for me and my sanity, as it gave me a space once a week to ask questions and express my concerns. We discussed more than his drinking; we talked about goals for the week, different healthy coping skills (like the gym) to help with our stress, how we are both doing in the relationship, financial concerns. But over time these stop. My husband has never initiated one of these meetings and I'll have to remind him of it weekly and the day-of or he'll get too drunk to have any kind of fruitful conversation. 

He has tried going ""cold turkey"" once, about 6mths ago, which was his choice after one of the aforementioned ""incidences"". At day three he woke up to visual and tactile hallucinations in the middle of the night that completely freaked him (and me) out, and he started drinking again the next day. 

I feel like I should mention that I am a nurse, in school to be a nurse practitioner. I know that a lot of my fears and anxiety stem from my knowledge of what his physical health will be in 15-20yrs if he continues this. I'm scared for our future. We both want kids once I'm done with school (1 yr from now) but I've told him that I will not have kids with him as long as he continues to drink this much. I refuse to have kids with a man who will dye from alcoholism at the age of 50. Which probably isn't fair of me to tell him, but I definitely have before during one of my breakdowns.  

He refuses to go to the doctor in general, hasn't been more than twice in our whole relationship. Of course I would love for him to go, talk to them about his concerns and get connected to a counselor or some resources, and get labs drawn to eval his liver function (we are privileged enough to have decent healthcare coverage). Again, he states he doesn't need ""help"", not interested in  a counselor or talking to someone about resources when I ask him about it. 

I wanted to write ""How do I get him to care? To realize the horrible stress he is putting on our relationship and his body?"" but we all know that you can not make someone change. So I guess i'm writing this as a form of therapy for me. And I'm also asking, for anyone that has taken the time to read this, to give me some insight in to how I should approach this conversation with him more easily and frequently. Was there something that your spouse did (or didn't do) that was beneficial towards your sobriety? How do I navigate this?",31

I don't know if I have what it takes to help him through his own recovery. I am so tired. I just want peace. Quiet. I want time to exist without feeling like I owe him something and I have to take care of him and his feelings. 

Last night was day three and when I got home from work he was in the kitchen cooking and listening to music. These are signs that he is happy because he is planning on drinking. I knew right away. His car was left out in front of the house instead of put away in the garage because he was planning on going to the store to buy beer. I knew this right away as I pulled into the house. I knew I was in for a night of putting up with his moods.

I contemplated taking my daughter and myself to a hotel room if he decided to drink. Because I am not going to be an enabler but I will also not be his babysitter anymore. If he wants to continue destroying our family and our lives then I am pulling out and removing us from his decision making. 

I took off my coat and boots, walked into the kitchen and even had a hard time looking at him in the face. I left to say hello to our daughter and went back to the kitchen to be greeted with the signature phrase used for over ten years, every time I try to get him to quit, ""I am having a hard time tonight."" This is code for ""I want to drink tonight, please drink with me so it makes it okay.""

All I could say was ""nope"" and walked away. I will not mentor him. I will not enable him. I will not be his babysitter saying whether he can drink or not. I can't do it anymore. I know he is trying, he is putting in effort, but he relies completely on me and I can't handle it anymore.

I watched him out the corner of my eye as I helped prepare dinner, he was making a big show of how upset he was when he threw some cardboard in the recycling. Puffed out lips, long sigh, exaggerated movements. I knew he was trying to get my attention so I would feel bad for him and give in. But the truth is, he has the freedom to do what he wants. That nope was more for me saying NO to being his mother, enabler, babysitter, etc. Not anymore. I refuse to feel the responsibility of making his mind feel more at ease. I am not responsible for his feelings. He is responsible for himself.

This is his Friday. He already told me he is going to have a hard time tonight. I know he will try to get me to say yes to drinking. He will bribe me, he will offer me a bubble bath with a glass of wine, he will offer to spend time with me with cold beers and whiskey.

I am not strong enough for this right now. I am trying to quit having 1-4 beers a night myself right now. This is codependent alcoholism on both of our ends. His is more extreme than mine, but mine is a direct result of his actions. Does that make sense? 

I have nowhere to go tonight unless I pay for a room.",1

This is my second longest sober streak in decades.  My previous one was 76 days as I was studying for an exam but was craving drinks so bad.  Now I’m not even thinking of going back to drinking. I’ve been oddly satisfied with cranberry extract (I get the real stuff, not juice) or lemon and seltzer. 

January is usually the hardest month for me, with it being cold and dark, but I’ve been in a better mood this year and my anxiety is much lower.  

So, on this morning, I’m home with a nice cup of espresso, listening to some Mahler (conducted by Leonard Bernstein), purple skies outside and am grateful for my “new” life.

I've done awful, shameful, embarrassing things while drunk. Things I'd NEVER do sober. Mean ""Gretchen"" I call her comes out.

Today I stumbled upon this forum watching videos on YouTube and several ppl said this forum in their opinion is better than A.A. So im giving it a shot. I've done the embarrassing AA. I've become an emotional mess while in attendance, or I would completely introvert myself. 

My boyfriend has stuck around battling this with me WAY longer than he should or deserves. My drinking has gotten me a cpl stints in jail. You name it. I've done it.

I've even taken an anti alcohol drug. It worked for a cpl of months until I decided to accidentally forget to take the meds..... 

The hardest struggle for me are the cravings!!!!

What I believe compelled me to drink, more often than not, was the feeling of missing it when I wasn't having it... And what I believed I was going to miss most was the opportunity to mix different flavors and create cocktails of ingredients. The notes, the spices, sweet and sour. I think the accumulation of tastes along with the woozy boozy unwinding feeling definitely was the hook that got me caught in a drinking loop that I felt I was never going to escape and, quite frankly, didn't want to. I mean, why live in a world without those flavors? It's like asking to live in a world without color, right? 

Well, at least to my addicted mind it was!

Nowadays, I can peer into my Instagram or Facebook feeds and see pictures of people with drinks looking sexy, smart, delicious... And not feel compelled to drink. It's a blessing to be free of the spell I was clearly under -- To look but to not touch -- and be at peace with that.

This got me wondering about the rest of you, and what you believe is, or was, the whispering call from the addiction that sends you teetering over to the dark side when you're on the fence and trying to stay strong? Please feel free to share your experiences.

But here's the thing: the past 7 days I have been at a conference and visiting relatives. I had 1 drink during that whole time. And no trouble going to sleep.

So, certainly medically I have a drinking issue (problem?) & in my weight loss effort, I am undermining myself. 

It's just hard to wrap my brain around saying I have a ""drinking problem"". ... But it shouldn't be any harder than wrapping my brain around saying I cannot eat the way I have in the past if I want to lose weight & get healthier.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens - good or bad - and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

For those unfamiliar with that phrase, it is our 24-hour pledge of intent: I WILL NOT DRINK WITH YOU TODAY. I thought it might be nice to use these seven words as a framework for my seven day hosting gig. I look forward to reading your responses –

He sent me a video from the event and it looked like a good time (it kinda made me wish that I could be the type to still drink at work dinners). Later that night, he called me and we spoke for awhile. During the convo, he told me that he couldn’t find his AirPods or bag (how do you lose a bag lmao) which reminded me of why I was happy to be sober.  We also talked about a lot of personal stuff (like my fear of never finding love lol). Then today I ask him if he’s found his bag and he asks how I knew he was missing his bag. I tell him that he told me last night and he says that he forgot we talked, which means he probably doesn’t even remember what we talked about. It made me kinda annoyed. Like how did I spill my heart to someone who wasn’t even fully present ya know. It also makes me sad for him. I think he knows I’m kinda upset about it.

So, since I’m sober, and facing some really tough times, I thought I’d share.

Because I am sober, I’m able to wake up clear headed and face the emotional toll of the day.  Lately, that’s been reading the midnight emails from a sister detailing next steps to help my brothers wife cope with widowhood.  About how to organize things.  What I can do, etc.  It’s a lot to unpack, the enormity of the immediate and distance future.  Glad to do it without the added depression/anxiety/shame of foggy headed, exhausted, hungover me.

Not being hammered at 8, 9 or 10pm as friends texts come in asking how my brother died.  Drunk me is even more blunt and flippant than sober me.  I didn’t text anyone he had a seizure and bled all over the bedding.  That I cleaned the blood up.  

..... Or the details of the 911 calls, or the morticians coming and me sending the wife to the neighbors while I held a sister outside so we didn’t hear the thunk of the body coming down because my brother was a big man....

Just small, simple answers, because people want to know but they don’t WANT to know.  So, that helps.  I’m not adding to people’s daily, with my own spin on the drama as a flippant drunk moron.

Being angry at work and recognizing I’m angry because I’m in a state of grief.  Not letting myself snap at the one person who gets under my skin.  Knowing that the little I did while at work is enough, if not more, than me on a hangover Friday.

Crying in the car when I think of my brother.  Crying a moment before I decided to write this out.  Actually feeling it.  Truly, truly, FEELING the weight of his loss.  His goofy, “Okay, //question//“, when he’d try and ask me a hard question politely; or when he’d help me out with things and I’d thank him and he was always waving me off with shouts of, “teamwork!”

For me to actively be living the principals he taught me, to truly dig in and own up to my end of teamwork, I have to recognize that I can only do that sober.

And yeah it’s hard.  And yeah on Friday after the service I’m sure alcohol will be around and a LOT of people will be drinking/getting hammered.  What a better time to be the team player than making sure everyone stays safe, and my sister-in-law doesn’t get trapped in people’s drunken grief, and making sure the kids are okay than simply being sober?

I don’t know if this helps anyone.  But living someone’s hypothetical, there is no “what if X”.  

X happened and it hasn’t driven me to the drink.  Because I needed to be 7 days sober and clearheaded the day my brother died.  And I need to keep being that as we go through everything.  Because I’m not sure Id be surviving otherwise.

Now the moment of truth is here. Im gonna do my best to swim and not sink. I owe it to myself to be healthy again.

I will not drink with you tonight.",21

He introduced me by the wrong name numerous times - this would be ok but I’ve known him for over five years and I’m married to his best friend. 

He kept repeating himself- A LOT. To the point where I felt embarrassed for him.

His slurring was out of control. 

He was boastful, egotistical and only talked about himself. 

He kept trying to talk to people on the subway who didn’t want to talk. 

He got trapped in the train doors because he ran ahead of me and tried to jump on a train that was already leaving. 

And this was the worst bit...
He was unbelievably rude to the nice and clearly fed-up guy serving us sandwiches in a late night cafe. I nearly died of embarrassment and I apologised profusely for him.

He then tried to argue with some people who were clearly up to illegal stuff (dealers) and put us for a while in a potentially dangerous situation. 

I am not judging my friend, and I love him but it was definitely an amazing reminder of what I DO NOT want to be and where I do not want to end up,

Lots of good things have happened since I quit drinking (and a few bad.) I've been able to stay on course without struggling too bad.

My sweet dog, Zoey is very sick. She is 16 years old and has liver cancer. Despite being elderly and having a serious illness she has been doing alright for the past few years. She has taken a turn for the worse. Her organs are starting to shut down. 

I had to make the decision today to call an at home vet to come to the house on Friday. We will be saying goodbye to our loyal, loving, longtime friend. It's the worst part of being a pet owner, but I know it is the humane thing to do for a member of the family that has been by my side through everything.

My kids (12, 15 & 18) are all upset, but I think they understand that this is what has to be done. But we are all devastated; knowing that we only have a few days left with our sweet girl.

AND I JUST WANT A DRINK! I have never - even when drinking at my heaviest - wanted/craved/desired a drink so bad. I want to numb all of this sadness away. I keep thinking about how being drunk would make my brain slow down, so I wouldn't be so on edge about the prospect of saying goodbye to my best friend in two days.

For now I am drinking a lot of coffee, smoking a lot of cigarettes and doing what I can to stay busy, while also tending to Zoey and loving on her. I don't plan on drinking and probably won't, but this is a serious struggle right now.

Today was my first day back in classes (I am a grad student). I was feeling really good about starting my first semester sober since I was a freshman undergrad. 
But, I found out this morning that I had been passed up for a position at the archaeological site where I have spent the last few summers. I didn't know why (although I'm sure you all can guess), so I went to the dig directors office (he happens to teach at my school). He basically told me that I had been hungover for the last three summers, and although I have never been a problem and have done my work, they want to give someone else a try. I didn't want to make excuses, to tell him I'm doing my best to stay sober. So I didn't and thanked him for telling me.
I was down in the dumps, sitting in the departmental lobby, listening to music, and a very cute girl approached me, saying she was waiting for someone and asked if I wanted to talk. So we talked for a long time about various things. Turns out she is from Pakistan, and I (white male) know a bit about Pakistan because my aunt is Pakistan and my aunt and uncle and their children have lived in Pakistan and Bangladesh for my whole life. We bonded over some Pakistani music and food. She talked about going to bars a bit, but she is very halal, so she doesn't drink. At the end of our conversation, she gave me her number and asked me to go get coffee with her. I am just amazed at how this all played out. I feel strengthened and grateful.

I'm the super high functioning type, business owner, money, family etc.  No DUI never ""rock bottomed,"" able to keep relationships.  Nevertheless I was a daily drinker with a strict regiment.  A pint or more of vodka an evening, followed by my daily hangover, which pretty much lasted until I started to drink again.  I did this for 10 years.   Although I could keep my personal and social life intact, my health has now become a concern to me.  No major medical issues ( that I'm aware of), just fat, tired and really out of shape.

I joined a gym that is hosting a 24 day fat loss challenge.  I was an athlete in my younger days.  Baseball, football, hockey all that the high school level.  Nothing to write in the paper about, but was in great shape.  Fast forward 20 years, I head into the gym 3 days ago.  I begin the workout.  I realize how out of shape I am.  The trainer asks several times, ""are you alright"" and ""You gonna make it, you sure?"" I reassure him I am 180 pounds of pure athleticism and am fine.  Half way through I glance in one of the mirrors and catch a glimpse of myself.  I look like Edward from twilight, white as a ghost.  I'm sweating pure vodka mixed with shame.  I smell like a pot of boiled hot dog water.  This is my new rock bottom.  I go home without having a drink.

The next morning I have to commando roll off of the toilet.  I'm too sore to stand.  Dispite my soreness I can see my mood at the workplace is considerably better.  I decide to attend another gym session that evening.  As I'm leaving for the gym, my wife brings in vodka preparing to relax.  I go to the gym anyway.  I do the workout this time with some limitations in mind and have a much better session.  I get in the car and decide I have a pivotal decision to make.  There are two liquor stores on my way home from the gym.  I think, ""maybe I can just grab a couple shooters, I earned it.""  I drive past both liquor stores, something I rarely do.  I get home and there is leftover vodka my wife didn't finish.  I eat a piece of chicken and some squash.  I go to bed without having a drink.

My point to all this is my behavior the last few days is quite out of character.  The choice not to drink especially when in the house and readily available is unconventional to say the least.  The choices I made were not easy, but perhaps I can turn my unhealthy addiction into a new healthy one.  My rationale being one day I'll say ""I can't drink because I'm addicted to fitness"" instead of ""I can't play sports because I drink.""  I have a long way to go on both sobriety and fitness but i'm going to give it a shot.",14

I'm Irish. I'm sad, I'm mad, I'm anxious, I'm happy, I'm celebrating, I'm bored. My kids are exhausting. I'm broke. I'm overwhelmed. I'm blah blah blah blah......Let's DRINK!

Then cancer came. I was diagnosed with Follicular Lymphoma on October 9th, 2019. Wow, what a GREAT reason to drink. Who cares? I'm dying. I had a few more benders until the week before treatment was supposed to start. My first chemo was January 16 and I haven't looked back. I know I am really NOT supposed to drink during chemo, but I am sure others have. I just knew in my heart that I had to gain control and prove to myself that I wasn't addicted and could use this time to focus on my kids and my family. And me. Finding a new routine at night that didn't involve hiding a bottle in the couch cushions or a drawer, or getting stinking drunk on the weekends while my kids were at their dad's. And then the anxiety. The crippling post-bender anxiety. That's when I really thought I was dying. And I probably was....slowly.

If this cancer is going to make me realize what's really important, then it's a blessing. I am praying and reading more. Trying to be in the moment. Yes, I am exhausted from the treatments, and yes there will be very hard times ahead. But knowing this aspect of my life isn't controlling me right now makes the hard times worth it. Even after a less than stellar night's sleep, I still wake up feeling 1000x better than I ever did after a pint of vodka or two bottles of wine.

I don't know what will come when treatment is over in May. My cancer isn't curable. I might get into remission for a while but it'll come back eventually. I can't think that far. I have to do this day by day.

Trying to find my peace with being alone is my journey right now. Re-finding my passions again that I set aside when I though wine and vodka were completing me. They lied to me for a very very long time. I know they'll lie again. Right now I am beyond grateful that the cravings haven't been hard to overcome.

I hurt my kids so much over the years. I hurt my family. And many friends. I made horrible decisions and have so many blacked-out memories I am thankful I can't recall. But I have to forgive myself...and my family and friends who have stood by me have forgiven me. Now it's time to heal.

I wish you all peace on your own particular journeys. And tonight when I am home for a few hours alone....IWNDWYT!",8

One breakfast beer if leftover (early lunch if not), one or two lunch beers and then a bunch more beers after work until I go to sleep.  I don't know other women who drink like this.  I have long since given up wine and mixed drinks (my moderation) ... I purposely only buy 6 beers at a time, knowing I will simply go to sleep rather than drive, and that is exactly what I do.

The day after Christmas, my boyfriend of 2 years (as divorced parents in our mid-forties, the word boyfriend makes me cringe, but we're not married and we don't live together) entered rehab for alcohol abuse after a two month bender during which I did not drink at all for a month (longest ever) as I tried to get his some help.  In the span of 60 days he lost his father (triggered it) and then custody of his child, his job and his license due to drinking.  

Once he was safe and sound at rehab, I decided ""beer only and only on weekends"" (having stopped for a month) ... and it lasted a single day.  I have been drinking beer all day for the 4 weeks since.  Not only do I feel like crap and can't seem to quit ... I'm rarely what anyone would call ""drunk"" (more like ""a little buzzed"") ... there's no enjoyment and it's obviously worsening my depression.  

Not only have I gained weight, I'm tired all the time and feel like crap .. I seem to be unable to stop.

The reality of it is, I'm an alcoholic too ... it took a month alone to realize that. 

I am not at rock bottom.  Not even close, I suppose, but I have to stop.  It is a huge impediment to me being the best person, mother and partner I know I can be.

Last night I went to a meeting, then directly to the store, and right into 5 Hoegaardens  (have to leave one for breakfast).

Tomorrow, I go to pick him up from rehab.  Having had some family counseling and weekly visits while he was in there, I know roughly what to expect.  I know his mental state and progress, I know his goals and ours for our future family. I'm hopeful ...

 .... but I'm consumed with dread at the thought of never drinking again.  I'm already mourning the beer like a dead loved one.  

How do I get past this?",4

I almost died from withdrawals, etc etc. But I got sober, stayed sober, moved all around the USA and the world (Korea, where they drink a LOT, but I still didn't drink), got pregnant, had my baby, didn't touch a drop, but then in 2017 my dear friend died. And I drank. It was a shitty choice but that's what I did, and I've been drinking ever since. Not every night, but definitely to excess 2-4 nights a week. I can't justify the financial cost or the cost to my health. Soon my daughter is going to be old enough to figure out that wine is not ""coffee"", and I'd rather die than negatively affect her in any way.

I hate that the ""mom drinking wine"" culture has been taken up by my stupid brain as a way to justify drinking. I *know* I'm just drinking to numb myself out. I have kind of a hard life. I'm a single parent, we're pretty poor because I'm going through school to become an RN. Nursing school is so hard. I'm pretty smart and I probably spend 60+ hours a week just doing school.

I’d thought I’d share some thoughts on how my life has changed in the 42 days of sobriety I have under my belt.

For starters, I used to drink around 4-6 beers every day with that number going to 12-16 on nights where I didn’t have to work the next morning. I was doing that regularly for 6 years ever since I turned 21. 

42 days ago my gf gave me an ultimatum. It was either I quit drinking and get my life together, or she leaves me. I chose to quit because she is the foundation I so desperately need.

To say that these 42 days have been easy would be a lie. For the first two weeks, I was bitter. I felt like my gf was controlling me and it made me uncomfortable. I wasn’t able to go to my parents house for Christmas because I know I’d be tempted to drink with them and my brother. But it did get easier. 

Video games used to be boring without drinking. Now I am regularly playing Minecraft with a friend from back home and instead of drinking beer while playing, I have tea or sparkling water. I love video games again like I did as a kid w/o alcohol. I never thought I would be able to enjoy them. I’m actually jonesing to play it right now but alas, I am at work.

I am starting to step foot into a career that I really want to be in. I’ve always wanted to do some sort of computer programming. I love computers and stuff like the Matrix made me want master programming when I was a kid. However, I would never be able to learn programming if I was still drinking. I used to prefer sitting around and drinking all day than learning something to better myself. Now that I’ve quit, I’m enrolled in a coding boot camp that I am making consistent progress with. This goes into the next thing that has changed for me.

Focus. I have so much focus and clarity in my mind now. When I was drinking, everything was so foggy and it was very hard to concentrate. Now that I am sober, I’m able to more clearly understand coding topics and my thoughts processes are a lot sharper. 

Energy. Good lord almighty do I have a lot of it now. I have so much that my gf thinks I have ADHD. When I don’t go to the gym, I’m bouncing off the walls.

Gym. This is one of the major ones. I’ve always wanted to get my body in peak physical shape. I watch things like Pumping Iron and Generation Iron and I want to be as strong as those guys. Maybe not as big as some them, but I want to be big. If I was still drinking, there is no way in hell I’d be going to the gym as much. Now I can slowly start making progress towards my fitness goals.

All in all my life has taken off since I quit drinking. I am involving myself in so much stuff that I don’t even miss it. I finally feel like I’m going somewhere too. When I was drinking I felt like I was stuck in a stagnant rut, like I was never going to do anything with my life. Since I’ve quit and started coding and lifting, I feel like I have a good future ahead of me. Anyways, if you guys/gals have made it this far, thanks for listening. 

As always, IWNDWYT.",40

2020-01-22 13:02:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/esfnpk/accidents_in_north_american_mountaineering/,Accidents in North American Mountaineering,"No, I'm not a lost redditor, so bear with me...

Every year, since 1948, the American Alpine Club has reviewed every serious climbing accident, and published a book detailing every fatality and serious injury - along with an explanation of **why** it happened. The book is called Accidents in North American Mountaineering (usually referred to ANAM). It would be exceptionally boring reading for non-climbers.

The idea is to learn from the mistakes of others. If seven different people broke their legs in the last decade on the second pitch of the ""Your legs will love this"" route, it's best to know that before roping up. What's particularly educational is that even highly experienced climbers are killed regularly through careless mistakes, such as not tying stopper knots in their rappel lines.

I think we should bring the same level of scrutiny to relapses.

If a relapse happens, it didn't ""just happen"". One of us encountered a series of events, and made a series of decisions, which led to drinking. Some are typical, such as people thinking they have a handle on it and could moderate, particularly for a special event. Others are brought on by psychological issues.

I think it's damaging to have the mentatility that ""relapses happen"", so just reset that counter and start over on Day 1. Even for someone who's only been sober a week or two, a relapse should be a big deal. It's not the end of the world, but it should be an educational experience.

I've looked back at every single time I've relapsed, and written a detailed account of the events leading to it, including the circumstances and my thought process. A lot of that thought process doesn't make much sense in hindsight - if I'm going to drink for this one wedding, what's my plan for the next one? But it's helped me identify the planet alignments where I would be most at risk.

Hope this helps someone, just wanted to throw it out there!",17

Grateful to have built up my confidence by being patient and dealing with the mundane from day to day without accelerants.

I’ve got two weeks of good sleep backing me up today.

I’m happy to have poured two of the six beers I was working on last night down the sink wisely anticipating amidst the rush of three down.... Feeling sick this morning!  

Grateful to be reminded the rush of ideas, physical ‘hopping’ up of excitement and lack of discernment I was so curious about and wanted to revisit was not worth the waking up early with a headache nor the lost time I could have invested in the little things I’ve been doing to improve myself.

I’m  grateful for trying to be a help to others here, and I’m happy to take support from others here.

Amongst that support is realizing that last night’s reminder of how I prefer sobriety is not a failure, it’s evidence of work in progress.

Grateful for work today then a sober get together with friends that should see me past treating this slip up with a full on slide.

She stepped off the tram and felt the cold through her thin, soppy shoes. The snow always accentuated her sense of touch, her sense of feeling.  The towering Gothic buildings around her were less imposing and she could see their stark beauty at these times; the soaring icy castles that nature had built upon these imposing edifices of man. She walked slowly, deliberately crunching her feet into the snow, rolling her foot with care from heel to toe, relishing the virginity of it. She liked the feeling of carving her own path and knowing that just for today, she alone had walked this path.

She rounded the corner and began to hear hushed murmurs punctuated by the occasional laugh and cough ahead. Her solitary imprints led to a forest of imprints well-worn; she could see their authors gathering outside a humble grey building. The world was too much for her sometimes and the arrival of the snow marked a softening, a muffling of the sensory, allowing her to focus once again on crisp notes that had brought her to this place. This was her church, a place where the folly of man and the divine coalesced.

Her eyelashes fluttered involuntarily a little as snowflakes kissed her and eyes leapt up to meet hers. A door swung open and she stopped, hesitating. The small tribe streamed into the building and she turned to leave; where was her faith? A voice called out “First time?” The words seemed to hang in the still air and she winced. She wondered how many times she had been here before. Countless times and never she decided. “Coming in?” She turned and offered a meek nod and a thin smile to the voice. There was the kindness of pain in the eyes of the man before her and she held onto that as she entered the sanctuary. He guided her to a chair. “My name is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and I’m an alcoholic.”",2

A year ago I was in Germany and came across a very good Kapuziner Akkoholfrei - ON TAP!

 I think due to their beer culture (toasing with water is, well... poor taste?).  It seems they have been [working very hard on making NA beers](https://www.dw.com/en/germans-are-drinking-more-alcohol-free-beer/a-50012362) that their general public will drink, and my collages would say they will often drink a regular and then switch to the AF types when driving.  Once I had this one I then asked at each meal and realized every restaurant had one on tap   You see major sporting events in Europe sponsored by some of the brands of AF.

So when I came home I went looking for this same beer, it is not imported, but was surprised to find a much larger variety of AF beers... Sober Carpenter and Athletic and Glutenberg (yes a gluten free beer co, but their NA is pretty good).  So far I have tried about 10 types, 3 or 4 I do really enjoy.  ( Also found some other interesting options like Lagunitas makes a [Hops Refresher](https://lagunitas.com/beer/hoppy-refresher) \- Ok, good on a hot day and a little more substantial, than seltzer.

The ABV values are 0.1 to 0.5% - so many are not truly AF, but I have been enjoying them with a steak, or after a round of golf, etc.

So what is the general feeling about these in this sub, and have any of you also found a particularly good one?",7

Bodily fluids, vomit, excrement and blood. Her phone battery was dead. She was cut off, miserable and alone. My Sister and I are both in recovery for this disease. For that reason we knew as long as Mom continued to drink, that we wouldn't be able to have much of a relationship. For me and my sobriety, I had to distance myself from her. Mom really didn't start drinking until she was in her 50's. She rarely ever touched it. Then something changed. And it changed her into someone I never knew growing up. Watching the hero of your life slowly become transformed by this drug called alcohol, and the disease of alcoholism, really breaks your heart and affects your mental health.

There's a huge relief that comes with that honesty.

I'm moving forward in life and have some attainable goals that I'm excited about achieving and I believe without alcohol in my life I'll really be able to accomplish them. 

I've been remembering a lot of times when I drank heavily or just periods in my life where I was aimless/depressed and I'm so incredibly glad that I'm moving away from that.

2020-01-22 10:50:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/esdunz/just_one_drink/,Just one drink.,"I was just reading another user's post about having achieved 30 days of sobriety and it took me back to last year when I was at that same leg of my journey into sobriety. I love this community, because we hear from folks who have been sober for years, and we hear from folks who are just starting out on day one.

In my opinion, every day away from that last drink gets just a little bit easier than the day before. As such, your first 30 days is a heck of a lot harder and a much greater accomplishment than my most recent 30 days of sobriety. I remember how incredibly hard it was during that first day, first week, first month for me. It was like wrestling a pit full of venomous snakes.

I also know, and I suppose that everyone is different, that I can't have just one drink. When I drink, I have a second, a third, etc. I drink with the full intention of getting wasted. When I first started this journey, every few days into it, I would decide to have just one drink. Every single time without exception, I drank until I passed out. I cannot have just one drink.

As such, I avoid having even a single drink with a meal, etc. I even make sure to get the alcohol free cold medicine when I need it even though I know that is kind of apples and oranges.

But my point is this: my mindset is that I am no longer an alcoholic, but I am literally only one single drink/sip away from being an alcoholic again. This is my victory mindset that gives me incredible motivation and I keep it tempered with that level of extreme caution. I would encourage you to search and learn yourself and make sure that you are guarded with a similar mindset that works for you.

I also understand that some folks who are of the AA mindset go on to continue saying that they are alcoholics for the rest of their lives. Perhaps some of you could share more of how that mindset works in the comments below. I didn't use AA. I was fortunate to have a private counselor via a military charity where they donate time to vets. For me, that is what seems to work the best for me and my personality is to have a mindset of victory as long as it is well tempered with caution against taking that first drink. 

The longer you get away from your last binge, the more comfortable you will feel with the idea of having ""just one drink."" So make sure that you have your heart and mind guarded with some sort of rock solid defense against that temptation.

What are some things that you've learned along the way that you would say have helped you the most? What kind of mindset do you have towards your sobriety that helps you stay strong on the journey?",8

I've been to outpatient therapy before, but relapsed and can't afford to go back. I've been weening myself down from a pint+ a night to a half pint and a 24oz beer. I'm tired of fucking up. I'm not even myself anymore. I'm scared to quit cold turkey, but at least I know I won't fuck myself or anyone else over again if I'm sober.   
I remember the last time I detoxed... I was given a pretty hefty dose of benzos by my doctor, and weened off of those going from 5 to 1 to none over a period of 5 days. I stayed in bed for 3 days straight and have terrible nightmares. I remember the thrill of having a clear mind for the first time coming out of it. I finally was getting decent sleep. I was prescribed a bunch of medicines, but nothing was working for my anxiety/depression. Eventually, I threw in the towel after taking a prescription that gave my indescribable night terrors. I was exhausted, fed up, broke, and sober... the opposite of what I sought treatment for. But then it's like something snapped again. I just wanted to go back to what I knew. I wasn't sleeping very well.. I was still depressed and anxious. I kept telling myself to be strong, and this is the new normal, and everything's going to be okay... but I stopped taking my medications.

One night I started drinking again. I hit it pretty slow at first, thanks to my tolerance being pretty much non existent for a few months not drinking, but I eventually ramped back up to where I was before. I don't want to be like this anymore, and simply can't afford to be. The stakes are too high, and I'm fucking up everything all over again. I'm nervous. I know I'm not going to sleep again for probably two weeks, and when when I do nod off, it'll be a nightmare. I've been going back to what the inpatient therapy taught me, and giving myself positive reinforcement by talking myself up. 

I *can* do this. **I** ***WILL*** **DO THIS**. Or... I ***WILL*** die a slow miserable death in agony.

I have a better chance of living going through a detox, than I ever will continuing drinking and further ruining my life and dying a miserable numb piece of shit. Any tips, thoughts, or positivity is encouraged and appreciated. Wish me luck.",5

I'm in my mid 40's he in his mid to late 50's. he's ex army, from el paso, and likes to play golf. I'm ex military, from texas, and too like to play golf, so conversation has been easy. we have talked about drinking from time to time, and in regretful tones, the occasional romantic wild story from our youth. i could sense he had the tendency to over indulge, as well.

so, i've been talking to this guy about a month now, and this morning he starts telling me about how he over did it on sunday, and all day monday (a day off for us) he was in terrible shape. his girlfriend made him do work around her house, telling him he shouldn't have drank so much. then he starts talking about how he doesn't want to drink for the football games anymore, and how he has a buddy who always wants to grab drinks on thursday and friday, and how tired he is of that. i was just listening, completely understanding. here is a fellow with a drinking problem, that i get. he then asks me if i had any drinks for the past weekend games, and i said, no. i told him that i hadn't had a drink in over 3 months, and felt much better. he nodded his head, said he could see a difference, which surprised me a little. i encouraged him to to cut back, and then we talked about floor mats, and phone cup-holders.

it felt good not to be bothered with the feelings my buddy was experiencing, and maybe even better that i can be some sort of role model for sobriety. how about that?",9

You can only buy booze from the LCBO. No other stores can sell hard alcohol. 

So I heard about an impending strike and had to formulate a plan in case they shut down for a day or a week. 

I went to the LCBO and filled a cart with (5) 1.75 liter bottles of vodka and an assortment of wine for other people. 

Everything was going smoothly until I got in the line to checkout and saw some older extended family members in the store. Everyone knew I was a seasoned drinker but when they asked about the party (assuming no human would buy gallons of vodka themselves in one trip) I stupidly told them I was just making sure that if the strike happened I was stocked up. They didn't say much just uncomfortable fake laughter on both sides.

To me it made sense. I was just prepping for the worst. Looking back I feel so stupid about it. I'm thankful I'm no longer that person who will fill a grocery cart with poison and pay $70 a bottle to do so...

Long story short, HR was in the process of writing me up, and telling me I would need to take a sexual harassment class. Turned out, they wrote my old name on the write up, and told me that they would send me a new one with my correct name for me to sign, along with a link to sign up for the class. That was 6 weeks ago, and I've heard absolutely nothing from them since! 

I have been letting my anxiety run wild, fully expecting they were just waiting for my review to find some reason to fire me. Although I was not entirely happy with the review (unfair declarations, based on 3rd party bullshit), I am relieved to still have my job. 

It's been a very stressful 6 weeks, and I've been trying to figure out how I got through it without drowning myself in the bottle. Recognizing that drinking only ends up making things worse is definitely part of it, but I think I'm learning that I need to stare down the anxiety, and recognize that life is never going to be perfect. Bad shit is going to happen. I may actually lose my job some day, for one reason or another. The simple fact is, if or when that happens, it will NOT be the end of the world!

* Bypass those fools waiting in the long line at the airport Starbucks and get yourself a $14 Sam Adams. (Try to ignore that it’s warm and flat, and that the tap hasn’t been cleaned since flying was invented.) Bask in the healthy glow of all those other winners saddled up to the bar at 7AM.
* Create resentments so I have a reason to drink.
* Realize that the universe really is out to get me.
* Wallow in self-pity until I can't take it anymore.

Since I stopped drinking, those interests have gone away. I'm just not interested in those things anymore. I thought of something I used to do and an unexpected feeling came over me like ""Why would I ever want to do that?""

Instead I find myself thinking and planning of other interests I would like to do. Maybe I would like to get a gym membership... learn some better cooking skills... take an interesting class... read a few pages of a novel? I have a degree in literature from when I was younger but haven't read a novel in years, I thought it was because I had come to hate novels, but now I think it is more because I was drinking.

Sometimes I felt like I didn't want to let alcohol go because I wasn't sure that there was anything else involved in ""me"" besides the drinking. What do I do if I don't drink, who am I?

I'm an extremely social person, and I have a fear of being an outcast at the many social events I attend, if I attend them sober - such as music festivals/gigs/LAN parties. Having a beer in one hand, and a spliff in the other at a festival, surrounded by my wife and friends, in the sun, dancing like idiots to a favorite band is something I just did not want to give up. So I decided to only drink in ""moderation"".

By this my rules would be - only drink at the weekends, or at social occasions. This way I'd be spending more days not drinking, than days drinking. However, this turned into looking forward to every single weekend, even if I wasn't doing anything and would spend it all online gaming with my friends - without fail, I would drink excessively - almost as if I was making up for how well I had done for not drinking in the week. The success of a sober 4 nights would give me an excuse to celebrate and I'd be going through 4 beers, 1 bottle of wine, and then whiskey straight from the bottle until I got too tired to keep drinking and go to bed in the early hours. This also applies to when I socially drink at an event. I always push it too far, and often wake up filled with regret, cringe, and embarrassment about just acting like a straight up like a drunken idiot.

Weekends would starts as Friday and Saturday only, but then Sunday still counts as the weekend right? So I'd drink then too. I'd often lapse midweek and maybe spend 10 days or so drinking, because the temptation was there whenever I opened the fridge to get some cooking ingredients, and a beer looks way more appealing than the water I was drinking. Usually after a 10 day stint i'd reset and go back to ""Weekends"" only. Never really lasts that long though.

I think it's pretty obvious what needs to happen. I've realized writing my description of dancing at the festivals, the least important part of why that is fun is what I'm holding in my hands. I will still have my wife, friends, sun, music... and i'm pretty sure I can still dance like an idiot when I'm sober. I need to give up this ""moderation"" idea - because I just cannot make it work.

I will not drink with you today, friends.",62

It just reminds me how this used to be so normal to me, but now the idea of waking up and trying to function like this is ridiculous!

Waking up fresh far outweighs any perceived benefits of a few glasses of wine.

I'm miserable in my hospital bed, but kind of grateful I've got to experience this feeling without a relapse. And i need to remember to take a minute each morning to appreciate how well I feel.

I don't know why it's so much harder to get back on the wagon. It's like the first time I was committed and scared and took it seriously. The first time was also out of the blue - I hadn't attempted to quit, previously. This time it is like I can't believe myself when I say I'm quitting. 


I'm going to have to spend a bit of time every morning thinking about why I don't want to drink and then commit myself to not drinking that day. I didn't really ""one day at a time"" the first time I got sober. I fought one urge at a time but the goal was to just never drink again. I think I have to do it one day at a time until I can get back to thinking of myself as someone who doesn't drink.",6

2020-01-22 01:56:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/es8cc2/things_are_getting_a_whole_lot_better/,Things are getting a whole lot better,"So it's been 11 days since my last drink, and over a month since I last drank more than one beer. While I'll admit I posted on here a few times in the past month basically panicking, I can safely say things are getting a lot better. 

My last drink was a test to see if I could handle one beer. I couldn't. I felt great for 10 minutes then felt physically and mentally like total garbage, with an overwhelming desire to drink more. I didn't go out and get a drop more because I knew where that would lead me and no way in hell was I wasting more money on this garbage that got me feeling this bad.

I feel so much calmer; it's such a relief not having to constantly worry about when my next drink is going to be, not having to deal with hangovers anymore, not wasting what little money I make and not hurting the people around me. I've started exercising again, I've been going to work and doing a good job totally sober (which I didn't even think was possible) Ive been going to AA meetings and despite having pretty bad social anxiety, I've been a lot more outgoing than I was when I was drinking and doing benzos.

I don't feel fantastic per se, I feel like my life is a series of ups and downs. But despite the series of downs I've had this past month (had a particularly shitty day today), I've still resisted the urge to drink. If I can handle a day like today without drinking, I feel like I can handle anything sober.

The main problem I have though, is despite how awful this stuff makes me feel, and how much it ruined me time and time again, I just cannot stop thinking about it. Every second of every day I just cannot get the thought of drinking out of my mind. I think, ""escape is just two blocks away at the gas station"", but then I think to myself, ""if I'm drinking just to escape, I shouldn't be drinking at all"". And that always seems to ease my mind. I drink because I am extremely uncomfortable sober. I drink to escape. But you don't progress through life by running from your problems. So I keep telling myself, before I even consider doing any addictive drugs again, I must be reasonably comfortable in my own skin. And I tell myself that not because I plan to drink and drug again, but because I can't seem to imagine a future where I don't do it again. I just have to take this one day at a time and make progress wherever I can. It's a tall order but I'm taking it one hour at a time and I feel confident that I might be able to keep this up.

**The Good:** It’s been such a treat to spend time in England again. Just a few years ago, I wouldn’t travel because I was too scared that in a foreign country, I wouldn’t be able to get alcohol when I wanted it—which was all day, every day. (For example, back when I lived in England, you could only buy liquor at an Off License during certain hours.)

Now that I’ve been released from the ball and chain of a dependency on booze, I can actually travel to foreign countries again.

**The Bad:** I was having lunch in an Italian restaurant and glanced at my aunt drinking a glass of red wine, and suddenly I wanted one, too—intensely.

I continued eating and, luckily, the desire passed pretty quickly. I just hate the fact that after almost five years, I still have those infrequent but intense moments of discomfort and craving.

**The Blissful:** Yesterday I bought that most British of wonderful things—a DUVET! I anticipate many future cozy nights and restful naps while snuggled under it. (Now I if I can only figure out how to get it into my suitcase so that I can get it home.)",19

The last two days I have been trapped inside a prison of my own emotions. 

I have been alternately suicidal/angry/despondent/cranky. 

It was a struggle to not go crawl inside of a bottle just to stop the mental and emotional anguish that was threatening to overthrow my willpower. 

Once again, though, a friend stepped in to hang out with me and ultimately; today was one more day of sobriety in what I fervently hope are thousands more sober days.

Anyways, here I am today 200+ sober looking at this bottle of ibuprofen wondering what dosage to take.  It says 200mg but if it doesn’t work you can take 400 or whatever the hell it is. I’m standing here seriously considering should I take 1 or 2 of this OTC NSAID. Wow.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens - good or bad - and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This post goes up at:

US - Night/Early Morning

Europe - Morning

Asia and Australia - Evening/Night

A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar.

This week for the daily check-in I thought I would explore the acronym we see and use so often: **IWNDWYT.**

For those unfamiliar with that phrase, it is our 24-hour pledge of intent: I WILL NOT DRINK WITH YOU TODAY. I thought it might be nice to use these seven words as a framework for my seven day hosting gig. I look forward to reading your responses –

**Our word of the day is “DRINK”. What does this mean to you with respect to our pledge?**",96

My friends kinda know, but I’ve really played down the issue a ton, and they thinks it’s all in the past and that the current withdrawals were just triggered by me ~being a silly goose and triggering the kindling effect by drinking too much by mistake again~ but no. I knew the risks. The first time that happened, yeah, it was a mistake but after that I knew and there are no excuses to be made. I said I wasn’t an addict but someone who isn’t an addict stops drinking when drinking becomes a game of Russian roulette. 

I’m six days sober today has been hard, this detox has been hard. Being honest with myself has been really hard. This has actually been one of the hardest weeks of my life and I’ve gone through it mostly alone. I’m a very closed off person, I don’t like to be vulnerable. I’ve been taken advantage of all my life, so being vulnerable is fucking terrifying. But that’s not the only issue, I don’t like asking for help, and I don’t like admitting to a problem because I like having the freedom to fail. I like that I can relapse with a friend and they never know I was trying to quit drinking to begin with. Telling people makes it harder to slip up because it throws some extra accountability into the mix. 



This detox has caused me to fall behind in class, and if theres one thing I fear more than vulnerability it’s failure, and if there’s one thing I love more than sunbstances it’s art. I wasn’t going to take a bad grade on a final project in an art class. So, I told my professor what has been going on. I needed to tell a ~real adult~ what was going on anyways, and he was somome i trusted. I didn’t share a ton of deatails, I was just honest and to the point. I basically just said that I was detoxing, that it had effected my ability to work, and that my project wouldn’t be 100% complete. 


The reply I got to the email lifted a very large weight off my shoulders. I got an extension, and was told my grade wouldn’t be effected, and that removed some stress but the relief that that brought was nothing compared to the offer of support that came with it. Having someone say they’d support me, and having someone handle the situation with so much compassion just really made me feel a lot better. I feel like I can stay sober now, I feel like I have reason to stay sober. I got that email and had to go into the bathroom and cry a bit, if my roommate weren’t here I probbaly would have down right sobbed. 
 I’m going to try to be more honest with myself and others going forward, Im going to reach out to another person I trust tomorrow for information on AA and such. I’m going to do this right this time.",18

I just recently posted but it’s really hard right now and I don’t want to put everything on my partner. so here I am again.

CW: pregnancy loss, abuse 

Somehow we will have to pay tons of bills and have no idea how. 
partner was just let go from the agency employing him because they are trying to sign everyone over to the actual company he is working at. they require diploma which he doesn’t have. 
I’m a SAHM but I’ve been applying for jobs too [which is hard because we have one vehicle, I’m the one with the license (almost taken care of that issue tho) and childcare is a thing.] Hopefully some place can work with my availability. 

This month is the 3 year anniversary of losing my baby, which in itself was awful, but also took place during a time in my life where I was very heavily emotionally/physically abused by my ex and homeless. Heavy, heavy trauma associated with this time of year. 

I’m in a heavy depression and the added stress isn’t helping and I’ve been a total piece of shit to my partner who is doing his best. Added guilt making me feel like a monster. 

Feeling like a terrible mom, partner, overall person. It’s been a long time since I’ve had such a bad low with my mental health. 

To top it off, I think I’ve got a bug and I’m not well enough to even donate plasma. 

Probably going to try to get back into therapy but I’m not sure how I can even afford copays. One of my copays is like, a weeks worth of okay-ish groceries. That’s with decent health insurance too. 

I don’t want to be on meds again because drinking was not my only issue, but I may require it to handle a PT job due to being diagnosed with pretty severe PTSD/anxiety. The last time I worked (this past year), I was NOT sober, and would use alcohol to cope with my symptoms and stress. So while not impossible, it does concern me. 

This whole post feels like I’m making excuses for every little thing in my life, and being all “woe is me” without putting in the work to better myself. I am trying, really. 

But onto the point: I still, will not make things worse by going to to pick up a bottle.

I will not create an additional problem on top of all of this. 

I will not numb this with liquor, I will not turn to some temporary escape to pretend I don’t care and that I’m not worried. Because I am. And I am hurting, I am depressed, and I am going to LET MYSELF FEEL THIS WAY. And it WILL PASS. 

And for that, I am really damn proud of myself, because a year ago I’d already have had 3 bottles of wine. 

So, even though things kind of suck really bad right now, here’s to some sort progress. And honestly, just typing all this out has been cathartic.

Clarity in who I should have in my life and who should be on the back burner. 

Better skin

Appreciation for life and people

Better social skills

Appreciation for food. It just tastes so much better now!!

It's been mostly great, but lately I've been feeling super down in the dumps. I'm introverted and generally prefer time to myself, but these past few weeks I'm feeling...lonely, which is a new feeling for me. Lonely even when I'm with my friends, sometimes especially so, especially when everyone is partaking in an activity that I no longer share with them (drinking). 

It's so DUMB because generally though, my friends are great, I'm in the best health of my life, I'm where I want to be in my career, etc, etc, etc, but still feeling empty, sad, alone. Part of this is because I'm single, thought I was getting somewhere with a new potential interest, but it's slowly dawning on me that it's not going to happen. I know I need to try some new hobbies, spend time outside, try to meet new people. But it's hard when I'm in a slump and I just want to listen to music in bed.

In the past, I'd drink about it, would drink until I felt okay. Not an option anymore. I've been trying to get an affordable therapist through a local organization, but can't seem to get a response. I do yoga and exercise, but lately it hasn't helped. 

I know life has its ups and downs and to ride this out - it'll get better eventually, though sometimes it doesn't seem like it. In the meantime - what helps you when you're feeling depressed, seemingly for no reason?",14

 I think for the last 10 years I’ve been a little afraid to grow up, or grow into my full potential. It feels like subconsciously, I was afraid that if I gave up the drinking-party-boy side of myself that I was trying to identify with, I would lose clout with people. But really I think I was trying to prove to myself most of all that I could have it all - a job that pays me well and I’m proud of, AND be able to party and play as often as I wanted to. And for awhile, especially when I was younger, I was able to (to an extent). But as I’ve gotten older, I haven’t had the same ability to bounce back, or focus, and it was betraying me every day. Not being able to show up fully at work, not being fully present in my life during my hangovers, prioritizing drinking over reading, or taking better care of myself. **It was always easier to drink than to take the time to put effort into something I cared about or wanted to follow through.** It was easier to drink than tell \[my husband\] what I’d rather be doing than being in the apartment when he was so content to be home with me, and I was dying to squeeze more out of life (which I poorly translated into wanting to go out and be social more often, when what I really wanted was self-development). **Drinking was so easy and resulted in me getting my little dopamine rush from my drinks, and the alleviation of responsibility** **(I’ve been drinking - I can’t cook, I can’t read, I can’t shower or workout or walk \[the dog\] or call my dad back. I definitely can’t journal, or draw, or craft, or research something I care about) that allowed me to lay back and ignore the nagging feeling that I wasn’t happy with the life I had created for myself.**  

But I’m done ignoring that nagging feeling - because I am not afraid to confront it, because I can clearly see that this feeling I had of ‘falling short’ was not based on external factors I had convinced myself were beyond my control. They were in my reach the entire time, which is why they were nagging me!! They have always been right here! I just drowned them out with booze. 

It’s changed, and just knowing I have this potential is a serious life-giving force I am so grateful to be in touch with again.",52

I can't take a shit until my first bottle of wine goes down. I cry in line at the liquor store. It wasn't this hard the first time I got sober. It just feels inescapable and if I try to quit again then I'll just be the person causing a fuss. Dying quietly from functional abuse is our MO. I wouldn't commit suicide but I dream about having a reason to live and feel defeated when I can't find it.

I'm still thankful to be here. I never thought I would have sank as low as I did, but I did and I cant express how happy I am to be sober.

I thought the first week was going to kill me. The shakes, social anxiety, sleepless nights and constantly being dehydrated. All I wanted was a drink its was crossing my mind everytime I had a bad moment. I could find a million reasons as to why I could have one. Thankfully my reasons for not having one helped me focus on why I was quitting in the first place. It was torture. I knew I was making the right decision to quit, but I didnt expect it was going to be that hard.

The second week I was sick, which made making not drinking easier for me. Even when I started feeling better I noticed my shakes were slowly going away, even though I know they'll never go away as I'm normally a shaky person anyways. With the help of my husband and my eldest sons dad pushing my son to come and visit he did. What a great way to be at two weeks sober seeing my son who stopped talking to me. Making new memories with my youngest and my step son (I really hate that term cause I love him no different then I love my own). I was getting things accomplished at work that I've put off doing for months on end cause I was always drinking and just didnt care to do them. 

The third week I went to go and visit some of my friends who work in the bar. It was way easier then I had expected it to be. They were completely understanding of my choice to stop drinking and told me if I ever needed to talk just to call, that they would always be there. I learnt how to snowboard that week, something I've always wanted to do, but my leg has always restricted me from it. It was a rough couple days and I could barely walk by the end of it, but i finally got the push I needed from my husband to try it so we can go together.

This last week I've thought about this past month. Thought that I would miss drinking with friends, that I would miss being drunk. The way it made me feel and the fact I had a way out of not thinking about my hectic life. I've begun to coupe with my anxiety issues, yes medication is helping, but with the amount of stress my youngest dad puts my child through it was easier then trying by myself. I really never thought I would make it this far, but to be honest I dont miss it. I miss making memories with my family that I can remember the next day. I miss not fighting with my husband when all he was ever trying to do is to get me to slow down and I would blow up cause I was drunk. I miss being me without a drink in my hand. I'm so glad I have the happy calm family I once had before I started drinking everyday. I've never been so thankful for being sober as I am today, a feeling I'm not willing to let go of. So heres to tomorrow and the next month of not drinking.",6

Friday was a little tense, but the rest of the long weekend and today was good. Cleaned my whole apartment, got all the laundry and dishes and recycling that had been piling up for days and weeks taken care of. Threw out the spoiled, healthy food that I never got around to cooking because I was drunk and opted for greasy ass pizza. Did a ton of errands that I've been putting off for weeks or longer at least partly because I was drinking, so therefore couldn't drive. Work has been really productive. Getting shit done. Kicking ass. Taking names. Going to have a stressful couple weeks so that's a good place to be at. 

Feeling pretty good. So of course, my brain starts telling me, ""You deserve a drink for being so productive! Wouldn't it be nice to park your car, put all the things you bought in your apartment, and then you'll be free to walk over to your nice, warm watering hole and have a few beers and/or whiskeys!""

So STUPID! So many little things I managed to accomplish the past few days that never would've happened if I had been drinking. Maybe I'd have done one load of laundry, or did a few dishes, or taken some ubers to do some errands, or even sobered up for a day to do things that couldn't be put off any longer. But several days of actually doing what I need to do when I need to do it simply doesn't happen when I'm drinking. Because if I listen to that voice that says, just drink tonight, and then you can have another week of productivity, what will actually happen is I will end up drinking tomorrow, and the next, and the next. 

Instead, I think I will take a hot shower, make some hot tea, and go to bed sober. Sleep like the dead (I've been dog tired at like 5pm since I sobered up). And get up tomorrow and keep rocking out at work, take care of more shit, and maybe I'll have the energy to read or work on some hobbies.",5

Whenever I go to parties or outings,I always limit myself to however many drinks i can have and stay in control. when I actually start drinking, 50% of the time I just continue drinking and end up way more drunk than I earlier planned. 

Also, I drink often on my own. My guess is I use it as an escape from the anxiety and stress from normal life, and I drink almost everyday, although I only get drunk (7/10 if 10 is blackout) once a week or so. For the remaining days ill take a couple swigs (maybe 4-5 shots? idk 1-3 mouthfuls) from a bottle of whiskey or vodka at night to relax and be able to sleep. I get anxious at night and alcohol is about the only thing that allows me to sleep; well except for benzos, but ive already been down that slope and wont make that mistake again. 

Worth mentioning that I recently started taking adderall as perscribed, I drink pretty heavily when im on it if I take it late and need sedation for sleep. 

So what do you guys think? any advice on how to stop? More importantly, how tf  can I sleep without having to drink? I already take melatonin and have a hydroxyzine script. the hydroxyzine puts me out for like 3 hours, then im up again and id usually take a swig or too to go back to sleep.",2

This may not seem like much. I read about members of this community who are many years into their journey. For me though, two months means the world. Mostly because I know that those two months could have easily just continued downward. I can't wrap my head around how lucky I've been to get out.

At first, making the decision was easy. I was still drunk when I told my girlfriend that I have a problem and that I'm going to quit from this moment onward. The following day was easy as well. I felt so hungover and so ashamed (I had come home and pissed in our laundry basket in the bedroom, thinking it was the toilet) that there really was no question.

The day after that, the doubt came over me. 'Fuck', I thought. 'I've made a huge mistake. How am I going to fix this?'. I would voice these concerns to my girlfriend but she would stay firm. It's best that I quit, she thought. I'm eternally grateful for that now. I was doubtful that I would be able to make it then.

The doubt lasted for a little over a month. Maybe 40 days. I wouldn't socialize much. I wouldn't dare go to a bar with friends. I would fear the beer.

Now, I feel completely at peace with my decision. I was actually at a bar the other day (playing guitar in a band) and that was a really good reminder of why I am (and we are) the lucky one(s). While others would get more and more hammered and lose more and more of their consciousness, I can easily recall the entire night. 

If I hadn't made the decision to quit two months ago, I'm sure that:

1. I would have drank at least four pints during the show. This would have had negative effects on the performance (much like it did for the other guitar player who did drink. I've never seen him play this sloppy before.)
2. I would have kept drinking as fast as I could afterwards.
3. I would have called/texted some friends in the party animal department and asked them to come out. 
4. I would have felt like absolute shit the day after. The show, the night, my relationships with the people in and around the band... It would have all been colored negatively by the chemically induced anxiety.

So... For anyone out there on the fence about quitting, I just wanna say: you're not losing anything. You're finally getting rid of something. I didn't believe those words myself two months ago. I do now.

You never realize how much of an impact or influence you make over people, even family. I stopped drinking Sept 17 2019. Much of it was done in secret from most people close to me. It wasnt until November that even shared my efforts with my family. 
   On Nov 17th I went and leased a new car as a reward for making 2 months. At that time I spoke to the financing manager about my efforts to not drink. I shared with him the medication I took to stop. He was highly interested and took down the name of the drug.
    Fast forward to today, my sister, my brother, my SIL all shared with me they are following in my footsteps and are 21 days sober. I also took my car to the dealer this past weekend. Well, the finance manager saw me and shook my hand and told me I saved his marriage. His last drink was in December and he was actively using medication I recommended.
 Never thought me sharing my story with folks would be this impactful.

I wanted so badly to be a normal drinker but I couldn't stop after I had one. All my best intentions would go out the window after that first drink. I struggled for years thinking I was a moral failure and that I could control this if I only tried harder. 

I realized I wasn't alone when I began to talk to other alcoholics. Their stories were a little different than mine but there were many similarities. ""One drink is too much, a 100 is never enough"", ""When I enjoyed it I couldn't control it, when I controlled it I never enjoyed it.""

I then saw my craving weren't the glass of wine that my friend was so casually sipping on; taking his sweet time with. My craving was the bottle of whiskey on his kitchen shelf that he got for Christmas and hasn't even opened yet! Who does that!?!? I realized my craving could not be quenched and I had to let it go. 

It's hard early on but you can do this! It does get easier. Even when life gets tough I stay sober. My Mom recently found out she has breast cancer and it didn't make me want to drink; it strengthened my resolve to stay sober. She needs me and I am so grateful I can show up and be there for her even if I'm scared.

I drank something like 5-10 beers per evening.

Also started jogging again a few weeks ago, and now my legs are absolutely killing me - in the bad pain kind of way and not the ""yay my muscles are growing"" kind of pain. During today's run I had to stop after the first 500 meters because I felt something off and started walking back. Now it hurts so badly that I kind of want a beer. I even got some in the fridge left. Also my boss played the same old broken tape as she always does which pisses me off to no end. Jesus that bitch. I definitely want a beer today.

But I'm not going to drink that beer. Before I would have. I will deal with this pain by stretching a lot today and drinking plenty of water. I'll probably have a few glasses of soda though. - Sorry weight loss program.",1

At least, 2 bottles worth of wine and no dinner. The last few hours are a mess of nothing. I spent the weekend following that Friday night in near constant panic attacks, terrified I’d done something unspeakable (got with a coworker?? started a fight? hurt someone?!!!) and it genuinely took weeks to get over the fear. It’s the incident that kickstarted my sobriety, made me confront my habit of binge drinking when I was trying to avoid strong emotions. It’s been 135 days but feels like a lifetime. 

A co-worker is leaving, one I’m close enough too to feel obligated to go but not close enough that I can explain why the venue he’s picked for his leaving drinks fills me with dread and shame and I never want to show my face there again. I should go. I shouldn’t drink. But i keep getting the waves of panic whenever I think about it. What if I’m barred and get called out on it in front of my colleagues? What if a colleague brings up something from the last time we were there that fills me with shame? How can I cope with that without drinking? 

Socialising with work fills me with that special kind of anxiety that used to drive me straight into the Sauvignon Blanc. This is another level. 

I don’t think sobriety actually improved my anxiety, rather made me better equipped to confront it but I’m struggling a lot now without my old crutch. Has anyone had to re-visit the scenes of their drinking days? Same bars? Same acquaintances? How did you survive?

It was Halloween and I was hanging out with all of my friends on my town's Main St. We were all playing Pokemon Go which I'm the only one of my friends that really does. We all went to my regular bar which I obviously haven't been to in awhile. Walking in it was just as I always remember it to be with nicely dimmed light, local artists work up, an English pub style with wood tables and walls. I loved going to that place every day and drinking my heart out. Both of my favorite bartenders were working the two that would make sure I'd get home safe every night and force me to drink water every two drinks that I'd have BUT it just felt different seeing them. We all walked up to the bar and they served them their drinks until they got to me. They asked for my ID which is just as shocking to me as I'm sure it is to you. I hand them my ID and they pull out this big book and start scanning it and ask why theres a chain next to my name and I tell them its because I'm an alcoholic. They look at me and say that I must be a psycho and ask me what I'm drinking. In my dream my feelings are actually pretty hurt by this. They were two people I really did get along with and they even told me I need to stop drinking or itll kill me. I order a water and they start telling me that's not a drink and I actually want a scotch. I stay strong and stuck with the water which I'm honestly surprised by that. Any other time I had a dream about alcohol I always took it and feeling hurt and depressed in my dream definitely would make me drink. I woke up a moment later feeling hurt from my dream but then it set in it was a dream and I actually started to feel proud of myself for sticking to my choice to no longer drink.",3

(yeah it's long with no TLDR)","I always wanted to be normal, but on some level I didn't (hello, special? (just a little)).  I spent a lot of time worried that I wasn't or, more precisely, that others thought I wasn't.

Over time my normal became pretty twisted.  Alcohol became an integral part of my day; of how I planned my day.  Drinking, yes but also recovering from yesterday, the lies and evasions necessary to disguise, hide, and otherwise mask my condition.  One of the 'benefits' of alcohol was that it allowed for loosening the rules of logic and reality and the subsequent justification of some pretty shitty behavior.  Behavior that I more or less got away with and which did not plunge me into even more warped normals. More on this later.

Someone today posted on how all their friends are drinkers - that's what got me thinking about making this post.  Back then I chose friends who drank - and tried to have someone in my circle who drank more than me so I could point to them and say, ""see I'm not as bad as...""

I also was a social worker - so I had even more - REAL alcoholics to compare myself to and I was only looking for differences, not the similarities.

So then I joined AA (a long, strange, even miraculous story you can find if you go to my profile) - and I found a new normal.  A new normal, yes, of not drinking - but also of having a history as fucked up and sordid as mine. That was important because there was an element of shame - a conviction that I was somehow fatally flawed that needed to be overcome.

That new normal saved my life.   The new normal turned out to be a much easier way of living. I had money in my pocket, no hangovers in the morning, and most of all I was not carrying around a backpack of lies and evasions that I had to keep straight.  I was no longer afraid that my secret life would be discovered - though letting go of the secret bad boy was not entirely easy.  Eventually I got promotions at work that had eluded me, well because I was 'functional' and not a lot more.  I cleared the debris of my past that included a relationship that was not healthy and could not be fixed even with me cleaning up my side of things.  All this took time.

My normal today is a circle of friends who do not drink, except one or two from Alanon who are 'normies' but for 99 percent of the time I am not around alcohol and do not think of it - or drugs.

My new normal is a life beyond any horizon I could see from a barstool.  I am retired, comfortable enough to go away most winters for a couple of months.  I am happy.  I am liked and loved by those around me, and those who don't - they do not concern me.

I am able to give back here, in AA, and in an AA meeting in prison I attend as a volunteer.  It's a part of who I am, but it is not all by any means.

I mentioned the AA meeting in prison because it allows me to speak to how bad normal can get.  The normal there is pretty rough.  The normal there is to be planning the party you are going to have when you are released ( not the men in the AA group but they are only about 3 percent of the men in that particular facility.)  The normal is to not see that alcohol and or drugs are a part and parcel of a lifestyle that is not going anywhere except for consequences city.

The normal can get even worse - I've seen people die from alcoholism, sometimes quickly, sometimes agonizingly slowly.  

Yeah, I said no TLDR but there is one - **you have the opportunity to pick a new normal today**  choose wisely.",29

I am not proud that I broke down but I am proud that I did not drink everything in the house and went to bed after acknowledging that the path I was on was not helping me in any way. I did not wake up with a hangover or massive regret but I did wake up with a clear sense of the way that alcohol has hijacked my brain and emotions to serve a false idea that it is ""helping"" me.

I drink once or twice per week, usually until blackout. I don't think alcohol is necessarily the reason that I am the way I am because I felt this way before I started drinking.

I don't care about anything. I feel empty inside.

I keep up outside appearances and I try to do the right thing. I'm vegan, I always recycle, I hold open the door and I smile at everyone. But I do the bare minimum. I don't feel enough to go out of my way. I don't keep up with hobbies because they feel meaningless. I feel like a fraud and some people can just tell. People don't trust me. They know I'm not genuine. I feel so selfish and I hate myself for it.

When I'm drunk is the only time things feel right. I care about other people's lives and feel connected to other people. I dance and feel free, for a while. 

I often think that my boyfriend, my friends and employers would be better off without me. I'm worried that they'll realise who I really am and how much time they've wasted caring about me. I've lost so many jobs now by not showing up. Wasted so many days lying in bed because I can't find a reason to get up.

These feelings are worse when I'm hungover. I've tried being sober for a few months and I didn't feel much better. I think I need to stop drinking though because I'm worried I might end it one day and I don't want to do that if there's hope things might get better. It scares me that it might not. That I'll never be excited to get up in the morning.

I started to think about how the 5 stages of grief kind of correlates with sobriety. Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. These don’t necessarily go in any order, but pretty much do for myself.

I denied I had a problem for a very long time. I was a once a week blackout type. Not every single time. And I wasn’t drinking every single day. So I wasn’t like the classic alcoholic who drank everyday, I wasn’t so bad right? But, when it was bad, it was bad. Crazy irrational behavior while blacked out. Not recalling events and making an ass out of myself. Terrible fights. Awful hangovers and going to work barely present from being so sick... I thought this was normal.

So I decided to get sober. And at first it was fine but then I was angry at myself. Why can’t I drink normally? Why can’t I just drink in moderation? Why do I have to miss out on the fun while I know people who drink just like me or maybe more? It’s Saturday night and I’m free, I’m bored and want to get fucked up! Wtf! You can see my previous posts and see the anger. 

Bargaining. I’m still in this stage at times. I’m still angry at times too. I still think maybe one day I can moderate. Maybe just drink on special occasions, maybe just twice a month . Maybe.. maybe.. maybe... it’s a dangerous mindset.

Depression. O it comes in deep dark waves. I feel like some of my identity is lost and still wonder if I can have a wild good time again. Not drinking can feel very isolating in this party culture, and it is still something I’m getting used to not doing. No longer my crutch for social situations. No longer the solution that masks a bar to be this grand time. But, I come out of these waves.

And acceptance. I accept that if I drink again, while it may be okay first, it’s a slippery slope (I feel fortunate for this sub that I have read stories that this it how it usually goes). I accept that alcohol doesn’t make me fun. It makes me stupid and dangerous to myself and others. I accept that drinking shouldn’t be as socially dominant in our culture (but it is). That so many of us have fallen into the illusion that alcohol=good time always. The more you drink the cooler you are. Or some shit like that. That there’s no fun without a drink. Also false. The best thing I accepted.

So, I experience all of these stages, but as time goes on, I’m feeling the grip loosen. I’m becoming less interested in drinking, and wonder why I ever would want to be like how I was again. It feels good to not be hungover and regretful. To be clear. To notice that social situations may cause anxiety but it passes for me. To be present. To be more on top of my shit. To not have shame buried deep inside and to seep through my pores. How, even though I wasn’t an everyday drinker, that drinking affected my life in ways I never gave it credit to. I realize that now. I respect and love myself more. I’m more confident. I feel a sense of dignity that I never really felt before. It’s beautiful. But it still ain’t easy. And I’m still tempted to drink. 

So yay 4 months. The hardest work is on yourself. Undoing all previous habits and mindsets is exhausting and frustrating and can feel overwhelming. It’s worth it. It’s necessary. 
Good luck everyone and stay strong in the fight!! ❤️

2020-01-21 07:19:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ertw07/tldr_alcohol_changes_thoughts/,TL/DR: Alcohol changes thoughts......,"I never did ""get it"" that alcohol literally changes your thoughts and personality until like the past 6 months and I'm over 40.  Holy hell does it change HOW you think.  I had heard it was a depressive - but I hadn't witnessed the Jeckyl and Hyde in my skull untill I started trying to not drink.  Day off, then day on, 4 off, 1 on.  Alcohol is my depression in a bottle.  It makes me have suicidal ideation.  Before I last drank I remember thinking ""you are laughing at the dumbest shit today - oh that's because you didn't drink.  But you want to drink?""  Then later it is ""OK, I'll just have a couple with the guys.""  Got shitfaced, next day felt like I wanted to die.  Alcohol creates the mindset that craves alcohol - it is circular.  It is NOT insanity to repeat things and expect different results - that is doing science.  Insanity is repeating things with the same results and continuing the same experiment oblivious to the fact you are doing it, not understanding why people are drifting away, why you can't keep a jerb, etc. - oh and the big one ""I'll just have two and go home.""",25

I have spent the last 2 weeks at home eating peanut butter sandwiches and drinking la crouix.. For the first time in a long time I feel like I can finally concentrate.. This is the first time I've binged watched a show on Netflix .. I have spent 28 hours over the last 5 days watching a show... Before I used to fall asleep because of all the beer.

Anyway, I want it to look like I'm doing fine... I have no idea how seeing her again is going to be.. I've never spoken to her sober... I hope she's ok with me...

Anyway, So I must grocery shop... I'm nervous about the alcohol isle.. All the closest grocery stores have one... And it's too cold out to walk further.. I don't know why I'm rambling.. I just wanted to share my feelings of nervousness .. Wish me luck.",4

I keep telling myself that I have 10+ days under my belt.  I don’t need to break the streak. And that 1 drink will lead me to a bottomless glass.  And how bad will the withdrawals be this time??? Kindling anyone???

Fuck!

And isn’t the real experience being sober on a flight???  I have only been drunk on flights in the last 20 years!  I don’t even know what it’s like to fly sober and be aware of the experience. 

And when was the last time I explored a new city sober??  Or had early client meetings without a little hangover companion tightly wrapping his arms around my head, neck and stomach?

Be a rebel and don’t drink!!!  I am an adult and can do whatever I want. Including NOT drinking.  What? Am I scared?  Am I chicken?  Need a security blanket to do basic adult things??

This part of the year is really dreary here in central Minnesota and I’m combatting it with candles and putting cut flowers around here and there. I have been reading a ton lately because of being stuck indoors and not having a lot of cash to do anything more exciting to get out of the house. 

I read Malcom Gladwell’s *Talking to Strangers* last week. It was among a selection Amazon offered me on which to use like a $5 off coupon. I picked it because for some reason I thought it would be a fun and light read. Uh, nope. Pretty heavy stuff-- good though. It had some very interesting (and perhaps controversial) stuff about drinking, especially as it relates to college campus drinking and sexual assault. He focuses on the “alcoholic myopia” aspect of drunkenness and how disastrous that can be in certain contexts, which is not a take I’d read in any recent books on the subject as far as I can remember. 

Just started reading Laura McKowen’s *We Are the Luckiest* a few days ago too. As with other memoirs about getting sober that I’ve read in recent years, I’m amazed at her willingness to be brutally honest about the things she did when drunk. Also as with other memoirs about women getting sober, those things at times are so bizarre and shocking that I’d never believe them to be true . . . except that I’ve done such similar things myself. 

She says something about her early sobriety that I really related to early on in the book, too. She says that during her first year of repeated day 1s, she was mostly pretending or hoping to want sobriety. That was totally true for me too. She says she has heard about door #1, drinking, and door #2, sobriety, and she was really just desperately seeking a 3rd door. That was 100% me in late ‘17. And I suppose if I’m being honest, I still wish there was a 3rd door once in a while. But for the most part, I am thrilled to be alive and well here behind door #2 at this point in life.

I am sure he was hoping to get me tipsy. Little does he realise that I need about 2x that amount plus a few joints before I’m ready to get into bed with someone if I’m not already that way inclined.

Anyway, as soon as he walked through the door his facial expression and the first thing he said was so offputting. Some negative shit about the charming village I live in. Ok, big city boy... suffice to say you did not make this country girl’s panties drop today. 

I couldn’t even bring myself to make it through the next hour and had a friend bail me out.

When he was leaving I kept insisting he take the wine (he had already cross questioned me about why I didn’t drink earlier) but he left it with a cryptic smile and “You’ll know what to do with it”.

I looked at it for a couple of minutes and then messaged my neighbour to see if he wanted it. No reply.

Another minute of staring at Liquid Trouble. Fuck It in a bottle. Chaos and Carnage made from the best grapes in Germany.

And then I started yelling like a woman possessed for the neighbor’s helper to come up and as I put in her hands I calmly proclaimed  “This is for Hans”.",7

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens - good or bad - and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I've eaten a few edibles, used kratom, abuse caffeine, taken an extra Adderall (recently prescribed...) etc. 

I met somebody at work that gave me her number today and was pretty forward. I asked her out and we have a lunch date planned for this Wednesday. I really like her and don't get a lot of dating opportunities. I used alcohol as a social crutch. Now that I don't drink, my social life is basically dead. I'm very active in our local AA community but you're not supposed to date those people, and from what I've seen it usually comes with a lot of drama.

I haven't thought about drinking in a very long time. The thought of being drunk is disgusting to me because I just associate it with the withdrawals and negative consequences. Basically I have conditioned myself to be rightfully fearful of alcohol and have never felt stronger in my semi-sobriety.

A lot of people say you should wait a year or wait until you work through the steps. I get that a break up can spark a relapse. But I really don't want to wait until some arbitrary time. I've been single for a longtime and I want to be with somebody.

Does anybody have any advice on moving forward? Should I tell her my situation and say I want to wait until I have a year? 

Also, when and how do you tell potential SO that you're an alcoholic. I kind of wanna get it out of the way but it seems like a bit of a bombshell to throw out on a first date.

The longest I have ever been sober (excluding pregnant and breastfeeding) in over twelve years. I don’t have a real support system in place. AA makes me super uncomfortable but I quit drinking after getting a DWI. Luckily, I have an attorney and this is my first criminal or traffic offense so I shouldn’t get too harsh of a punishment, but it was the slap in the face I needed to stop drinking. I wasn’t an every day drinker, nor did I over indulge every time I drank, but when I did, I obviously went too far. 
I’ve had a hard time getting real support since I am a bartender, most of friends and family are bartenders/servers/restaurant managers and drinking is a huge past time for most people in our industry. My fiancé has been struggling with his sobriety and doesn’t seem to have the capacity to help me with mine right now. That or he is embarrassed that it was much easier for me to quit.
But, I am proud of myself. I have lost 15-20 lbs, I am sleeping more soundly, I am less stressed, I haven’t had a single depressive episode and I just generally wake up feeling good, even when I am still exhausted. My sister and I finally started training for our first marathon today (she’s been recovering from a torn meniscus) and even though we’re slow and out of shape WE ARE DOING IT!

I did so well from September through Halloween without drinking. Then we’re at a Halloween party and everyone wanted me to take a shot with them and I did. I had two drinks that night and stopped. Felt good and was proud that I could just do it one night. That started by “one night a week, no more than 2 drinks” rule. Which I stuck to until Thanksgiving. I had lost weight  and was feeling great. Then I decided to let loose for the holidays. It was hard to reel it back in after that. Went back to a drink every night with dinner. Holiday parties every weekend. I decided that it’d be fine until NYE. Hungover on NY day still didn’t sway me. I had a friends birthday last Saturday and thought I would stop after that. Still couldn’t stop. My anxiety was at an all time high. Not working out regularly. Not getting ANY sleep. I could tell I was struggling at work. I’m so disappointed in myself that I got to such a good spot, feeling great, anxiety in check, and I just let it slip right through my fingers.

Went for a walk with a friend yesterday and admitted for the first time out loud, “I’m an alcoholic.” She is going to help keep my accountable and even sent me this link. So here I am. January 20th. I’ve got Italian soda to drink in a wine glass at dinner (my weakest time), chocolate as a dessert which helped me feel sated the first time I did this. The anxiety is killing me right now and I’m trying to distract my mind by getting this out there. It’s terrifying but I’m praying it will be helpful.

Since it was Sunday, none were available, but I got a quick doctors appointment Monday.

My doctor took my issue very serious, maybe more serious than I did. She mentioned wanting to put on medication for my alcoholism and I quickly told her no. That's something you give to old people in their 50ies who have a drinking problem, not me! My doctor then went on to explain to me that by drinking, I cancel out the effects of my sertralin, which could probably explain why I've been feeling like dung. She also told me that she had seen thid a lot of times before; young people thinking that they could just talk to a therapist or not acknowledge the problem because no one realises that alcoholism is an illness the same way mental illness is. 


I can see that now. Whenever I've heard, ""alcoholics can just stop drinking"" I've been pissed off because I knew very well that's not the case. I just didn't know that it was a treatable mental and physical thing. 

I'm just always so afraid of being in the way of other people who need help or seeing someone worse off than me and knowing they deserve help more than I do. I know I'm the most important person in my life, but it's so hard for me to accept that I'm allowed to get help too. 

I'm hopefully gonna talk to a therapist about everything as well and have the knots on my brain undone by them so I can function once more. I'm starting the medication Wednesday. It's going to be a struggle to hang in there and not touch alcohol while I wait for that. I'll try and call my mother later and ask her if she wants to help me clean and decorate my apartment so it will feel like a new chapter of my life starting. A new, sober chapter. Having her around today to help keep my urges for alcohol at bay is probably the best thing for me right now.

I'm still dreading the mail from my DUI with the sentence from the police. While I know that there is no mandatory prison sentence for driving drunk in my country, I'm still afraid of what will come of it. I'm actually so scared that I keep feeling an urge to drunk just to get rid of that fear. 

I'm pretty confident I don't want a car anymore but I feel so guilty about it since my parents paid for it and paid for my license as well, but I'm just afraid that I will end up behind the wheel drunk again and have myself or someone else killed. I don't want to cause more stress to my parents over my car, so I'm really fine with not having it. It's harder to accept the guilt I feel about it.",5

I'm in my third month of sobriety and have been attending AA meetings regularly the whole while. This isn't my first time being sober, I had six months a while back without utilizing AA. My case certainly isn't as severe as most I've met in the rooms; I had one close call with a DUI but otherwise no legal troubles, no health issues, no falling out with the family or history of trauma, etc. That being said, I've never been a normal drinker. I used to drink to get fucked up, plain and simple, regardless of the repercussions. So, to my point, I feel like I don't belong in AA. I made a promise to someone that I would continue going, and I do feel the meetings are beneficial in some ways. But, all this talk about how you will surely not stay sober if you don't get a sponsor and do the 12 steps just doesn't seem geared towards someone in my shoes. I've made it 3 1/2 months now without doing either of those things and it hasn't been very difficult. In short, I don't have a ""mental obsession"" as they say. I've been to concerts, parties, and sporting events with no issues these past few months. So a part of me feels guilty for even attending meetings or making a big deal out of taking a chip every month, because I haven't been following the program per se and have still had a relatively easy time staying sober. This feeling of being a phony also makes me hesitant to seek out a sponsor. Anyways, that's where I'm at. Just looking for some wise advice or input. Thanks a lot and happy sober Monday.",8

November was a bad month too as my best friend told me he didn’t want to be my best friend anymore-in fact, he didn’t want me in his life at ALL anymore (soooooo much more to it than just my drinking, and he was no angel either, but he did put up with a LOT from me while I would get blackout drunk).

Logically, I know this will pass. The days will become sunny again, my fridge will be full again, I WILL feel joy again.

But lately I feel like I am just in the dark, feeling fatigued 24/7, and wanting to escape what my life currently is. 

I stay at home with my stepson, and my partner relies on me to get to work, so right now our schedule doesn’t allow me to work a normal job. 
In spite of this, we really need the money, so I’ve applied at a few places on the days he is home. My fear is that this (working again) will drain me (never having a day of true rest), put a strain on the relationship, and make me want to drink even more. 

Does anyone have any advice? Should I wait this out, seek therapy again, etc? 

I have a serious guilt complex that isn’t helping. I know that I carry my weight between childcare/chores/transportation/laundry/ cooking meals etc, but I also feel that I’m letting my family down even more if I don’t get every bit of effort out of me. 
At this point I’m not sure if it’s better to work more and be stressed from that, or continue what I’m doing and be stressed from making ends meet. 

I’ve always had issues with anxiety and depression and my sobriety is very important to me. I don’t want to put that in jeopardy. 

Does anyone have advice for getting through times of darkness and staying sober? How do you cope when it feels like you are going through the motions/putting in work for things to stay the same in one way or another?

I know drinking is not the answer, but damn it would be nice to escape these feelings of inadequacy for a night. 

I know they would come back, and I don’t want to waste almost a year of working towards this.

I ended up having a great night with my friends and went home around 1 a.m. happily sober and slept great. I'm finally getting used to going out without alcohol and learning to have a good time without it. What a great feeling. IWNDWYT.

ETA: Soda water with bitters can contain a very small amount of alcohol. May not be a good choice for everyone.",227

2020-01-20 17:13:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/erknue/day_12_having_a_tough_time/,Day 12. Having a tough time.,"Hi, everyone,

It's not even that I want to drink. I really don't. I'm just having a tough time with my mood swings, particularly with feeling really pretty low. And when I'm not moody, I feel pretty bored. 

After roughly eight years of binge drinking at least once a week, last year I decided to give up my bad drinking habit. I was okay with going several weeks without drinking, and then I might have a beer or two or three every once in a while, but that was really it. I went months and months last year without getting hammered or having a hangover, and I was really proud of myself.

I started talking to someone this Fall. We got along well, there was definitely chemistry, and we were taking things slowly which I thought was a sign that I had matured and was being more intentional and thoughtful in my actions, particularly pertaining to relationships. 

Then it started getting cold out and darker earlier, and that seasonal depression starting inching back in, and it was so sly I didn't even realize it. For some reason, around Thanksgiving, I stopped taking my SSRIs. I don't know why--I just didn't take them one night, and then kept not taking them. Curiously, my heavy drinking started creeping back in. 

Between Thanksgiving and NYE, I managed to get black-out drunk every time I hung out with the person I had been talking to. Things came to a head on NYE when we got into a fight about something--I literally don't even remember what. The next couple of days, we talked periodically, she was really pissed off at me because I had seriously hurt her feelings, she told me to start taking meds/seeing my therapist again/and that for now she didn't want to talk anymore, and then she left for a semester abroad. We haven't spoken since.

After that, I stopped drinking again. I started back on my meds and started prioritizing rest and self-care to try to get back into the swing of a healthy lifestyle. I was able to socialize twice this weekend and genuinely enjoy myself without drinking. I was on cloud nine on Saturday night: I'd seen and hung out with old friends, I met another girl and got a date, and I was home and in bed early, sober, and (obviously) woke up with no hangover.

I went on the date last night. It was fine, I learned I can do that sort of thing without drinking. Of course, I'm still hung up on the first girl who is not speaking to me for the time being. But this morning, I just woke up in a funk. I have the day off for MLK day, and even though I have had all day to relax, my mind is going a mile a minute. My thoughts are heavy, and I just feel blue. Luckily, I have the first therapy appointment I've had since October tonight, so the timing couldn't be better.

But is this moodiness normal? Will I bounce back? How can my emotions ping-pong so quickly from being on top of the world one night, and then super low the next?

Thanks for listening, everyone. I hope everyone is having a peaceful night.",5
2020-01-20 17:10:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/erkmdy/six_months_sober_and_struggling/,Six Months Sober and Struggling,"I'm a day away from being six months sober. I quit drinking in July after feeling really miserable for a long time. I was mostly a beer drinker and had mostly anxiety, mild depression and was tired of the same old routine of having 4 or so beers per night (strong ones), sleeping for shit (I was a 2:00 AM waker-upper) and then feeling a irritable in the morning, vowing not to drink that night. Then, evening would come and the process would repeat. On weekends, it was more beer, stronger beer, earlier start and an occasional Gin and Tonic mixed in. Saturday and Sunday mornings were full of irritation and being short-tempered. I'm a swimmer and that helped with feeling better and reducing the puffiness in my face. 

I went two months without AA, then figured I'd try it because a friend of mine has fully bought in. I bounced around meetings until I found some I liked and I've been a two-a-week meeting person for the last four months. Picked up sobriety chips, Etc. I have a sponsor and I'm on step four. But I've just lost motivation. I haven't really made any friends in AA and I'm basically doing the same things in my life, but without alcohol. I feel better and I'm happier in general and enjoy being clear-headed in the morning. But I'm kind of bored. Has anyone else struggled at this point in sobriety?",1

After telling myself I didn’t want to see a doctor and too embarrassed to talk to family or my girlfriend I decided to join this community. The comments for each other are so motivating, so hopefully you can help me.

I’ve always enjoyed a drink. Over the last year or so I went from having a bottle of wine every other nite, to every nite, to then two a night. I’d wake up with a hangover and such a feeling of guilt that I’d done it again, then just about get through the day hung over only to have another drink at the end of the day to get me over my hangover. This cycle could last for weeks until I get a “moment of clarity”, beat my hangover and go on a stretch of sobriety. They normally only last about a week tho. I have learned that having only 1 drink doesn’t work as it leads to two bottles and then I’m stuck in the same rut for some days or weeks.  I have a great career and a young child and I just don’t want to do it any more.

I’m currently on day 4 and coming up close to my week. Feel a bit agitated and craving sweet stuff but I feel really good, and tomorrow I know I’ll feel better again. The week will be a big milestone for me and I’m nearly there.

Learning new things every time.,"The other night was my best friends birthday party at a kareoke bar. I planned on driving myself and staying sober. But at the last minute she asked if she could stop by beforehand so I can do her hair and makeup and I could ride with them, and they would be my DD. 

I asked my husband, who is my biggest supporter, what I should do. He said it was totally up to me, but her birthday was a special occasion, and he wouldnt think less of me if I drank. We had decided that after 100 days dry, we would only drink on special occasions, and he said this qualified. I dont get out, like, ever. I was an at home wine supper, not a bar fly.

I decided to not decide ahead of time what I would do, just go and see what felt natural and right. I didnt want to feel like I was planning to drink or not ahead of time. 

 Unfortunately, as soon we we walked in, they turned around and walked out. There were some old coworkers of ours there and there was some bad blood. I was totally confused, because i hadn't seen anyone in a while since i stopped working there. One of them chased us out and begged us to stay and join them. It was SOOOO awkward, and i had NO idea what was going on. I decided yep, looks like I'm drinking! 


I had two cocktails, but the lady made them REALLY strong, so i had water after both and then switched to sipping beer. It definitely hit me, between the cocktail strength and the not having been drinking. It was fun, but i would have still had fun with my friends if i hadn't been drinking. I didnt make an ass of myself, but i definitely felt like i had been drinking the next day. I was so exhausted. 

It wasnt a mistake, it was a learning experience. 

Everything was fine, but it still just really drilled home for me how much i appreciate my alcohol free life more than i enjoy having drinks. I am back at day one, but i have decided now instead of starting my 100 days over again, I will not have any until after my sons birthday this summer. 

I have decided not to look at this as a setback, but rather as another useful bit of knowledge I now carry in my toolbelt. My husband didnt drink, and he is really enjoying being alcohol free with me. We are still moving in the right direction, to happier healthier versions of ourselves.",7

Now I have all of these underlying feelings and I’m irritated af at everything and nothing. I also thought now would be a good time to come off my adhd meds and man I that was prob a bad idea. The reason I thought that would be helpful is because I start getting agitated when the meds wear off which also leads to me having a drink.  Which leads to more drinks. I guess I’m realizing I would use drinks to balance out the side effects. I feel pretty worthless. My feelings are pretty dull until I just feel angry and irritable. I know my outbursts are irrational. But I’m so angry af at the world. Sometimes I feel like I just want to watch it all burn. I just feel like telling everyone to fuck off and I just want to be left alone. At the same time I feel lonely and just wish someone could try to understand what I’m dealing with and give a pass for a while.

TLDR at bottom

A LITTLE history: been a daily drinker for over 20 years. Most recently (past year +) it got up to about 10-17 drinks a day. I'm a bachelor who eats (and DRINKS) out EVERY meal, the only exceptions are when I order food in and drink at home, but mostly eat it’s eating out. 

In an effort to curb/stop this ridiculous drinking (and/or better understand my relationship to alcohol), I have a trip to Central American planned to partake in multiple Ayahuasca ceremonies. I leave Feb 10 and I must stop drinking 14 days before going- no drinking, no drugs, special diet, etc. You get what you give apparently, and I am taking that plant and the process seriously. So I quit drinking on Jan 2, and made it 15 days without drinking (I only ""need"" to be sober for 14 days before going, but I wanted to do more, since I don't want to drink). The biggest issue I was having was NOT SLEEPING. I have benzo’s (Xanax), I have melatonin, I tried Vipassana meditation, I tried everything I could, but couldn’t get more than 4-5 hours of very fitful sleep. My fitness tracker marks every day as ""poor"" sleep quality. And I have been feeling HORRIBLE…..can’t focus, can’t concentrate, literally unable to compose rational and readable prose for my work (or for anything).  

Anyway, during these 15 days I haven't eaten out because of the triggers. Instead I got the organic meal delivery service (a couple of them actually), organic juices, the whole nine yards. So on day 16 I thought I could go to sushi with a friend and not drink Sake. I was wrong. I drank on Saturday, and then again on Sunday. 

HERE’S THE PROBLEM: I woke up this (Monday) morning after drinking all day yesterday and I FELT/FEEL GREAT. I FINALLY SLEPT for 8+ hours, straight through. I went for a 5 mile run this morning, and now I’m at work awake, alert, and feel better than I have in two weeks by a WIDE margin.  

I’ve READ and re-read Naked Mind, Alan Carr, Alcohol Explained. I know and understand intellectually that alcohol is bad; the science behind alcohol being a poison isn’t debatable, at least not in my mind. That said, in this instance this truth isn’t translating to ***experience***. And I think everyone understands that knowing something experientially is what matters in life- you can “know” whatever you want in your mind, but until you experience it it’s not “yours.” This is how it is with yoga, meditation, sky diving, LIFE! So I’m stuck- this experience of feeling SO much better after drinking yesterday just reinforces that alcohol DOES help me (despite me knowing it does not). What do I do? I’m asking here because certainly someone has gone through something similar. Do I just “tough it out” and go longer than 15 days and eventually I’ll sleep and FUNCTION and not feel like a constant piece of crap? Exhausted but can't sleep. Awake but not alert. This is even scarier because I HAVE to go back to not drinking, which I will, in prep for the journey, but I can't even fathom feeling how I was for those 15 and then putting myself into a situation with such a powerful plant for a week straight. 

Really appreciate any suggestions or insights from those further along than I am, or even those who maybe used Aya to help them stop drinking. 

TLDR; Stopped drinking for 15 days in prep for Ayahuasca, fell off the wagon and feel better than I have in 2 weeks. Why do I feel so horrible when not drinking? Just need more time? Any tips for getting more sleep?",4

I made an honest to god effort last week to stop before that day, and the withdrawals were so incredibly scary and painful... I know there is no other way at this point aside from going to detox, but I'm terrified to be trapped with these symptoms with no way out.

Just stumbled across this page and I've never really spoken to anyone about it so I thought it would be good for me, since being 13 days sober, to speak out for once and let it out. 

I'm 27 and I started heavily drinking 3 years ago. I was always a drinker from 18 but it was I'd say in the average range, you know going out on a Friday and have 4 or 5 pints and going home. There was obviously the odd occasional bottle of vodka and whatever I could get my hands on binge, sort of drink till you drop house parties but we've all been there am I right!? I suppose I've always had phases of things. When I was maybe 19/20 I used to smoke weed every day for about a year and over did it and had to stop. It had a severe effect on my mental health due to the excess, giving me my first panic attack and anxiety disorder (which has all stuck with me to this day) so I stopped altogether. The year after I went through a harder drugs phase sort of snorting pretty much whatever at least every weekend for just over a year. This again had a damaging effect to the anxiety side of things and all become to much and I booted that too. I was just back to regular old drinking. 

It was every weekend. 
Then it was every other day. 
Then it was every day. 

Started just with regular strength beers 5% was my preferred and the quantity I had to drink gradually went up and up. I moved on to white cider. Which was 7.5%, but I could get a 3 Litre bottle of it for £3.75. If I'm not mistaken there was 26 or 27 units per bottle. I was drinking one of those every day. There'd be the occasional time when I would drink a lot less and the times where I would drink a lot more when I'd gotten my hands on a litre of whisky or something. But I kept doing it like it was normal. A functioning alcoholic I think people call it as I did have a job and I never drank in work hours or went to work drunk. 

Unfortunately because of cutbacks I was let go from my job and I just continued drinking every day. It was the volume I could drink without getting drunk which was probably the most dangerous part. I'm a big guy and my tolerance was so high I was consuming 40 units a day at my worst point. When I drank normally I never got hungover because I'd be drunk on a lot less and in turn drank a lot less. But every time I was getting drunk now it was taking so much I was waking up desperately desperately ill every single day. I broke my foot last February very badly and had to have surgery and I gave various blood samples for their records and pre surgery checks. I never knew what the blood was taken for though. Because the injury was so bad I am in constant pain and walk differently and this is permanent. But another thing was that I knew I would need other operations on it. The time came this year 2 weeks ago. So I had to do my pre surgery checks again with the nurse. She asked how many units of alcohol I drink a week and for some reason I just broke down and told her honestly (for the first time!) About my consumption. She got me all sorts of alcohol help numbers and contacts and checked my bloods from the surgery a year ago. 

This is where she told me they tested my liver and there was about 6 different things they test for within my liver. 5 out of 6 of the things they tested were in the abnormal and high range all highlighted in red on the computer screen. I can't remember what they were called but one of the ranges was supposed to be between 0 and 20 and mine was at 126. It really scared me. But what scared me more was this was the first time I realised there was genuinely serious damage I was doing to myself and it was also a test from a year ago so God knows what further damage I had done in the meantime! 

It's from that day that I have completely cut out all alcohol and am feeling the best I have in years. After literally 13 days! I couldn't believe what I was doing to myself and I just felt like it was absolutely normal I never thought it was wrong or anything. It really affected my mental health but it was depression not anxiety and I didn't really realise because I was always drunk or drinking. I feel so so much better for stopping and I'm so glad I did before further damage was done. I just kinda wanted to let people know especially people who are trying to stop too because even if you don't know it you are doing serious damage to yourself. I guess it's one of those 'If I can do it so can you!' Sorta messages too because if this helps even 1 person cut down I'd be happy knowing that. I just want to finish by saying that if we try really hard we can kick the drink for good. To anyone needing any encouragement today: You got this. Keep it up and you will beat this! Do it before it's too late. I never thought at 27 I would have done the damage I did. I always thought it was the 50 or 60 year olds. That's not the case at all. Keep on trying everyone and I know you can do it. I'm so thankful I did.

Thank you.",3

But I was able to overcome my loneliness by drinking. I seldom ever went to bars with people. Most of the time, I went there alone, drank a couple of beers and downed a couple of shots. Then I started to socialize and mingle with people. I became more comfortable in my own skin, and people generally stopped being annoying. In fact, they started being fun to be around.

But now that I'm on the sober bandwagon, I once again don't have any friends. The people that I had the most fun with are some of the heaviest drinkers who I've ever met. I never did anything fun outside of drinking. To be honest I don't know what is fun anymore. People go to the movies, art galleries, yoga classes, etc., and I assume they do so because they find those activities enjoyable. But I don't know what is fun, and I don't have any friends. Not anymore.

While I'm glad that I started this journey, I must confess that this road is lonelier than I had anticipated.

It's Monday and, as most of you probably know, it can be a rough day of the week for an addict.  Stepping back into the real world after two days away from it all can leave you feeling refreshed and ready to take on the week ahead.  You tell yourself, ""This week will be different.  I'm going to be productive and not let negativity get the best of me."" and try to begin the day with a positive attitude.  Then, reality hits you in the face.  Nothing has changed.  In an instant, that refreshed feeling has turned to anxiety and frustration.  Trapped for another five days and begging for a way out.  The same old triggers are still there, just itching to be pulled. 

I believe these are the moments that define us.  Will I simply let the feelings pass and move on with my day?  Or, will I drown my feelings in an attempt to escape from them?  We all know the easy way out all too well.  It would be easy to say ""fuck it"" and make that trip to the liquor store.  It would be easy to spend the rest of the day in a fog, numb to it all.  It would be easy to let all that progress slip away for a moment of relief.

70 days ago, I made the easy decision to down a bunch of Vodka, skip out on the rest of the day at work, get high, and go to a bar until it was time to come home for dinner with my family.  Given my state at the time, I was lucky to have made it home at all.  The next morning, I faced my decisions head-on and made the very difficult decision to come clean to my family and friends about my addiction.

My circumstances may have not changed since that day (I'm working on it), but my state of mind has.  Now, when I get those same old urges, I decide to let them pass.  I make the hard decision to live with my feelings and process them until they don't affect me anymore.  I keep in mind that a fleeting feeling of discomfort strongly outweighs the feeling of guilt and disgust in myself that would inevitably follow if I were to choose the easy way out.  Over time, the negative feelings pass more quickly and choosing the hard way becomes a little easier, day by day.

They say nothing in life worth a damn is ever easy and they sure aren't lying.  However, I can see a silver lining in all of this...

It gets easier.

I have something going on with my health. Stomach issues, dizzy spells, just above normal blood pressure. My dr did a bunch of tests and everything game back good. I figured it was just my drinking and smoking that caused the issues. My wife thinks it’s anxiety or panic attacks. Im still getting them while I am sober. I know I am not going to be cured after 3 weeks sober, but i thought they would let up a little by now. Normally when i was having these episodes, a couple beers would fix it right up. 
I enjoy being sober and all the money i am saving, but these episodes are getting bad. I have no answers to what they are and if it is anxiety i dont want to be on medication for a long period of time.

It was only after losing weight and their interactions with others became more positive that they found the answer to the question they had in the first place. Why were they being treated ""like fat girl""? They realized that it was not the fact that they were overweight that was driving these negative interactions with their peers.  It was their OWN perception of themselves shaping everything around them..  It was only when their OWN perception changed that they were even able to comprehend this.  These interactions were now positive because their perception had changed with their body.

Remember folks, perception is reality. Just as in a dream your body responds as if it is reality, your mind-body connection must not be put to the wayside, but rather acknowledged and leveraged to your advantage.  If you actively change your perspective to someone who simply doesn't drink, as opposed to someone who needs to fight a battle at all times, your reality will become that perception.",5

Getting better at loving myself,"A sincere and heartfelt thanks to everyone in this community. This is the most supportive group of people not just on Reddit but quite possibly on the entire planet. The positivity and strength I have witnessed here got me through my hardest days and keeps me going today. Y’all are truly the best.

When I think about two years of sobriety I cannot help but focus on the changes I’ve made in that time. The first was the choice to stop actively deceiving myself. I was inspired by a friend’s marital separation in which he realized that he couldn’t possibly have been honest with his spouse because he was too busy deceiving himself. So on January 20, 2018, I sat down with my partner and went digging for blind spots. I didn’t have far to dig - I had been drinking and smoking pot every night for 20 years. Because I was “high functioning” I never considered it a problem. And I guess for me it never really was until I took the step to consciously want something better for myself. Mere hours after deciding I didn’t want to lie to myself anymore I had what would become my last drink.

For me sobriety paid immediate dividends. Within a few days I sat down with my therapist and had a cascading catharsis where I actually let myself experience the pain I had internalized from my parents’ divorce when I was two. It made me realize the extent to which drinking had just been a daily attempt to hide from myself. As I sit here today I feel very blessed to actually get to spend quality time with the person I know as me.

Soon after this catharsis came a deep realization of the extent to which we are all just projecting our shit onto other people (an amazingly liberating truth when you realize you don’t have to own other people’s shit), and how in any conflict the only thing we can actually have any influence over is whatever emotional state is triggered within ourselves. I have found that by practicing these truths I can achieve greater emotional clarity and that this removes barriers to trust and intimacy. Armed with a growing love for myself, I’m no longer as afraid to let people in to see me for who I am.

In my second year of sobriety I started to become obsessed with self-improvement. Waking up early for a daily exercise routine, limiting media intake (sorry, Reddit), journaling, Getting Things Done and a dozen other little things to improve my efficiency and effectiveness. But I still had a nice little dependency simmering, a lever I could pull to quell anxiety that is more addictive than crack cocaine (or so I’ve heard): got. damn. SUGAR. A nightly ritual of baked goods and ice cream that made sure my beer gut never actually went away and picked up on destroying my liver right where alcohol left off. But, as of January 1 of this year I’ve kicked that, too (“that” being added sugar. Three weeks in, but I’m hopeful it’ll stick). 

I think the most challenging thing about living sober is figuring out how to talk about it. At first it was so awkward. I didn’t know what to say or how to tell people and I was afraid of their judgement. As soon as I got over that I started becoming wary of other people’s issues being projected onto me when I told them. I learned how to navigate that by just working it casually into conversation rather than making it like some big announcement. But it was still something I thought about every time a friendship started to develop, like it was some shameful thing I had to tell a potential friend sooner than later so they could “be forewarned.” Forewarned of what, that I could drive them home after a night of drinking? That the bill at dinner will always be a few drinks lighter? I suppose all it took was time but now it’s something I don’t consciously work into conversation at all. I just talk about it when it’s relevant and I don’t when it’s not, just like any other thing. 

And I’d say that’s the biggest difference between 1 year sober and 2 years sober. I’m just more comfortable with it now. 

That, and my appreciation for life continues to grow. What a beautiful opportunity we have to be kind to ourselves each and every day.

Stay strong y'all. IWNDWYT",5

Tired of feeling like shit all the time, tired of feeling bloated, skin looks like shit, I look like shit.  Feel like I binge drink during my days off and spend my time when Im work trying to get back to feeling normal only to repeat the cycle over again.  Its hard to enjoy your days off when you have a massive hangover.  Its hard to enjoy anything with a hangover.  It only gets worse the older I get.  

Not going to say anything to my wife because we have rode this horse before.  I'm just going to stop drinking until she notices.  It will be hard because she likes to go to a restaurant to drink and talk with friends.  I am sure as hell not going to ask her to stop.  Its my problem not hers.  She can control her drinking. Day fucking one man.  Wish me luck.",166

I wanted to post here so I can have something to come back and read when i inevitably forget what alcohol does to me. I always forget. Then I drink, and it comes rushing back. 

When I drink, I drive around when I probably shouldn’t. I’m not talking about being 3 sheets to the wind, but 3 beers in an hour and a half and then saying “hey I’m probably fine”. I haven’t gotten caught. I haven’t killed anyone or even had an accident. But this is a risky behavior I can’t accept. I can’t live with being me when I do this. I don’t want to be this person. 

I hide my drinking. I go buy extra cans of white claw, so when I’m out I only order 1 beer but really I have 2 more drinks in my purse. I take great care to not let anyone find out about this. I police up my cans. I drink in the bathroom. I can’t live with this either. I hate secrets. I hate deceiving my husband.  I hate the way I feel when I wake up and realize I’ve done it again. I don’t want to be this person either. 

I am a good person. But when I drink, I make dumb decisions. I hurt my family. I lie and I sneak around. 

I just want to be a person I can live with being, and maybe even some day like to be. So far, this picture I’m painting doesn’t seem to include alcohol. 

I cave when i overwork myself, or I have to experience an emotion I don’t like. I need some practice with managing my emotions. But it’s hard when you don’t know what’s happening until it’s too late. 

Thank you for all the support here. I appreciate this sub so much.

Now, I have a routine that involves meditation, prayer (no clue what I pray to exactly, but I got desperate enough to let go of my science-minded ego to try praying, and it works for me) and vigilance throughout the day to manage my emotions. When the ol’ brain starts churning out anxious and fearful thoughts, I have two options - fuel the negativity with more horrible thoughts, or separate myself from the negativity by pausing and just let the thoughts and emotions run their course. If I fuel the thoughts, or act on a thought out of impulse, I steer the boat right into the rocks and things are much more difficult. If I pause, and let the emotions run their course, I save myself more strife, and get stronger and more capable of handling life as it is.

Just my two cents - maybe someone needed to see this. Have a great day everyone!",8

Namely, massive depression, complete lack of motivation, and it was destroying my marriage.  I recall the first few days being difficult, but somewhat easy as the rewards of not drinking were nearly immediate.  Depression fell off like dirt in a shower, motivation came storming back, and my marriage saw instant positive results as well (my wife stopped drinking the same time I did).  I felt invincible to be honest.  We took what we would have spent on alcohol and put it into home updates.  I was getting up early and just getting things done.  Checking projects off was my new pleasure.  

After a month, the dreaded thoughts came back however.  I do not know what changed in my head, but everything I had done in the month prior seemed to no longer matter and I was back to where I was in the beginning of November: sad, angry, frustrated, unmotivated.  Why did this happen? I couldn't figure it out.  I had numerous discussions in my head that lead me to think, maybe a drink will help.  Maybe a quick shot will just calm me.  Maybe one night a week, and I can just forget all of the bad.

I'm happy to say I didn't cave in, but boy did I want to.  I suppose the reason I'm typing this out is to visually see the difficulty I went through in regards to temptation, but also to share with anyone whom may read, that it isn't just easy, like anything you do have to work at it, in this case sobriety.  If you, (or I), go through a dip in progress, just remember, the cycle will climb again and hopefully over time the dips will not be as long or as severe.  Keep on keepin' on.  IWNDWYT",5

I have stopped making a stop at the liquor store on the way home, and I have generally seen my cravings go away. Anxiety is still roaring way, and I am trying to work on that as well. I have found some support and strength from reading these posts and I hope to return the favor to some of you.

My next goal is to schedule a physical and get my blood work done, I also plan on discussing my excessive drinking with my doctor and developing a true plan other than cold turkey. I come from a family that is well entrenched in AA/recovery and I feel that I would be a failure if I go down that same road. I do not consider myself spiritual and that is my biggest hesitancy with The Program.

I have to say listening to Marc Maron and John Goodman talk about their struggles with drinking/substance abuse is one of the things that really hit home. ""It never stops at two drinks"" was a topic they discussed repeatedly as well as the idea of not ""knowing how to drink"". This is me. I could rarely have a casual glass of wine or one beer. I never understood the point. It always felt like the point was to get fucked up. If you don't feel a little wobbly at the end of the night what was the whole point?

Like I said above, I hope someone gets a positive reaction from my post. I hope you feel encouraged to continue your own process of not drinking, and hopefully self improvement. My wife and tow kids deserve a lot better from me, and I deserve it too.",5

But then the drinking that was just happening on the weekends was now happening everyday until two days ago. 

 It's been two days since I accepted that I have a drinking problem. It's also been two days since I've had a drink.  It definitely hasn't been easy but I knew that was going to be the case.

One very damaging message is that AA is guaranteed to “work if you work it”.

There is NO treatment for ANY illness that is guaranteed to work for everyone who tries it. Period.

AA works well for SOME people. Other people need a different approach. Recovery from alcohol CAN include AA, but it does not HAVE to include AA to be successful. If AA doesn’t help you, it does NOT MEAN you just didn’t try hard enough or believe hard enough.

Don’t let anyone guilt or fear-monger you into thinking there is only “one true path” to sobriety.

*Edit: Every single time I post something like this I get tons of AA people crawling out of the woodwork to insist it works for *them*. I GET THAT. No one is saying it DOESN’T work for you. That is *not the same thing* as saying it doesn’t work for everyone and reminding people that they have other options. This is the problem I have with AA. It is NOT THE ONLY WAY TO GET SOBER.",27

I was the ‘guy’ when it came to beer, whiskey, you name it. So, in a sense, I had to kill big part of who I was.  Starting out in January helped as there really isn’t anything happening in the Midwest, so social events aren’t really an obstacle to stacking days. 

The times that were really difficult were the changing of the seasons, vacations, and the most recent holidays. At a couple points throughout the year I felt false confidence that I had beaten the cravings only to be reminded of how false that was. 

As I sit here typing I may be at one of those false confidence places again but it feels wonderful not to crave it, and to simply not want it at all. I know I’ll battle the cravings again but I’m ready, as I know they are only temporary. They will pass no matter if they last an hour, a week, or a month, they will pass and I’ll get back to the place that I am now. Feeling great, at peace, drinking coffee...

I tried it and it actually worked. I had a limit and I stayed within it. I wasn’t drunk, I wasn’t buzzing. Nothing. 

Oh, but the fun stuff afterwards was still there!  Brain fog, feeling down and out. 

This is a learning process for me. I have learned that I am still suffering the effects from a past toxic relationship. I turned to heavy drinking at a pub during this time. When I go to a pub now, all I want to do is drink pint after pint after pint. 

I have learned that I can have a bottle of wine in the fridge, and it will stay there for a long time. If I’m cooking dinner or visiting with my grandmother, I will have one glass of wine and be content with that. This happens very rarely. 

Right now I am in another somewhat toxic situation, not a relationship, but something else I cannot simply get away from. I do not want to turn down the path of going to a pub and slamming pints. I do not want to gain the weight back. I do not want the effects of alcohol to contribute to my already feeling upset and stressed out. 

This is a learning situation, and I have learned.

I have been mentally feeling like crap for the last week and haven’t been able to put my finger on it. I quit alcohol one time. I did really well for myself. It was over a year, maybe two, ago. I realized one day that I had to set my life in order. Married, one kid, great job, had a shitty apartment in the ghetto, lots of stress surrounding that environment. I have been a “drink 2-5 beers” kind of person every single night for as long as I’ve been with my husband, fourteen years. 

So this day of my revelation (two years ago) I decided to start exercising, stop eating crap, and use a more positive outlook toward myself and life. I was determined as well and stayed the course. I didn’t drink as much, if I did it was one or two. But my husband stayed his course as well: eating terribly, never exercising, just work, watch tv, and drink about nine beer- every night. 

I tried my hardest to get help him. I tried everything. I went to therapy for myself then once I realized I was doing okay I tried using therapy to help him. But he refused to go. I got him numbers, I got him resources, I gave gentle encouragement, I left notes and reminders. Soon, he became defensive any time I brought it up. I had no choice but to give up to trying to better him because I was being sucked into a vortex of depression and my own self care was starting to slip. 

I considered separation, discussed in therapy. Neither of us had anywhere to go if we did separate. I discussed it with him and i cried so hard I took it back and we promised to work harder on us. He promised me he would start getting annual physicals and teeth cleanings and start working on himself. He didn’t 

I spent the next year focusing on my personal goals, lost over 20 pounds, self esteem on the rise, alcohol still consumed. How does one spouse change their life so drastically and be successful when the other spouse refuses and provides alcohol every night? I am human and I am addicted. I couldn’t fight this one thing I needed to change. 

I gave in and started drinking heavier again. I am not proud. 

We bought a house, got out of the ghetto. I bought a treadmill and continued running. Things were great for a few weeks then right back to normal. 

Turns out, it doesn’t matter if you are in the ghetto or on a few acres of beautiful land. Your habits follow you. Your problems follow you. 

It’s been over a year since I tried to separate from my husband because I wanted space to continue working on myself and hopefully encourage him to work on himself. 

We are still together and I just realized this morning I have been feeling like crap for the last week because I am starting to resent him. I continued to fight for him, I encouraged him to eat better, I make healthy food every day even though we both work full time, I plan menus, I provide fruits for snacks, I run then encourage him to run. I encourage him to see someone about his depression. 

I got him to get one physical after a year of trying and the dr put him on cholesterol pills. My dr told me I have the best cholesterol she has ever seen (thank you, almonds). 

I don’t have the energy in me anymore to hold myself up as well as him. I love him so much. I just want him to be well. But right now, I need me to be well. One day at a time. 

I just want to be held accountable for this one day, to not open two beers and drink one then pour the second out. I don’t want to open a single can. 

Is there anyone out there who is willing to hold me accountable twelve hours from now? Just this one day, that’s all I ask. 

Thanks for reading",11

The end of my naltrexone script coincided with the start of the silly season and silly me thought I could just have one or two since I tend to drink less with others anyway... nope. 

Still binged and made a dick of myself, then once the holidays were over I went straight back to my old ways, scraping up change to buy two of the cheapest bottles of wine and drinking them both in one night... for five nights straight. 

I want to say it was worth it because my holidays were so fun, and I met an amazing guy (who is a state away from me and also has a drinking problem he isn't dealing with, yay) but I can't shake the shame I feel. I know it could've been even more amazing if I were sober. Things could've been said or done differently and I hate feeling the regret of my actions and words.

I preached my sobriety too openly on social media and to friends and coworkers that now I feel sheepish when anyone asks how's it going. Nearly a week sober again but it feels so much harder.

The withdrawals feel doubled because it's stupid hot and humid where I am, and I have a lingering sniffle, plus side effects from naltrexone has left me with a coldsore and headaches and fatigued.

It just feels so much harder to get my life back on track.

The only other time I've made any effort to stop was this past summer I went about 2 1/2 weeks.  I used to drink a 1/5 of jager and 6-8 12% tall boys about every 2 days up until about a year ago.  The liquor was getting to expensive so I switched to just beer, drinking a 30pk every 3 days.  The problem was once I got that first beer or shot of liquor in me there was no turning back.  I couldn't turn it off until I was blackout drunk. I'd wake up every single morning feeling like shit.  Replaying what I could piece together from the night before hoping I hadn't done or said anything out of line to my family.  I lost my job of 10 years a few years back now thanks to my drinking.  Partly because I got gout flare ups in my foot from the malt liquor I was drinking so bad I could barely walk.  Also partly because I was getting older and couldn't get out of bed and work through the hangovers like I could when I was younger.  The first couple weeks sober were the toughest for me.  I had cold sweats in my sleep the first week.  I also found it really hard to occupy my time in the late evenings when I would normally be drinking.  I still struggle with that sometimes.  When I tried getting sober last summer I found taking walks around the neighborhood in the mornings seemed to help, even if it was only a mile a day.  I've lost about 15lbs of that beer weight in the past 3 months.  I still have no energy and feel tired most of the day I'm hoping getting back to walking when it warms up fixes that.  It's for the best though.  I dont want to go back to being hungover every single day.  I already know that I'm not a person that can drink in moderation I have to cut it out completely.  It's kind of tough sometimes because my wife isn't very supportive.  She hasn't even really acknowledged me quitting drinking aside from some weight loss comments.  I'm not looking for an atta boy everyday, but a good job would go a long way.  Anyways, sorry to ramble after 20 years of drinking almost every day I never thought I'd make it 3 months sober.  It feels good, I hope I can keep it going.",19

I'm in my 50s now and have realised over the years that most of the crap I'm supposed to want/need is nonsense so I've stopped buying it. Here's a list of things that marketing has sold me over the years to make me a 'real/attractive/good/healthy' woman:

* expensive creams and lotions
* expensive designer perfume
* fashions in clothes, shoes and decor
* designer handbags
* fancy gym memberships
* luxury spa treatments
* diets
* glossy magazines

I could go on and on but you get the picture. And 'women's alcohol' is right up there on the list of things I'm supposed to need. Wine, prosecco, girly cocktails: all will supposedly make me happy, sociable, attractive, *popular*.

And it's all a lie. I don't neglect my appearance and health, nor my home. I buy stuff if I need it. I go out running with my dogs. I eat mostly plant-based etc. And I'm a bit smug that I no longer fall for the advertisers' tricks, except (for fuck's sake) I didn't see how alcohol was being sold to me, and how much I rationalised that I was  *choosing* to drink.

Damn, they are clever, but we can be smarter. A 200 dollar handbag won't make us happy, and neither will a round of Cosmopolitans.

Did A.A., therapist , rehabs, etc. 5 years ago I was in complete liver failure. Yellow from jaundice in a hospital with my abdomen full of fluid. Was told that if I didn’t stop drinking then I’d die in 1-3 months.

Flash forward 5 years, multiple failures in every way imaginable.  The one thing I didn’t do was quit trying. With the support of my support system (which for me is A.A. but it’s not the only way I know of lots of others that use other programs) I have finally gone a whole year without drinking. Super happy but trying to also keep focused and not let it get to my ego. 

Just wanna tell anyone struggling that it’s absolutely worth it to keep trying to quit. If a drunk like me who was next to death and had no hope can turn it around, anyone can. I am honesty more happy on the inside then I have been my entire life. Never thought that is what sobriety would bring me.

I’m approaching 6 months sober and I have no doubt that I’ll get there. I love hiking, going for walks, working out and yoga. All these activities help me get calm and I am feeling the benefits mentally and physically. 

I also love cooking and eating and reading and watching tv but at the end of a long day I rarely read my book even though I’m really into it. I sometimes listen to podcasts and mostly watch tv. Having baths is another one that Has really helped me. 

I also have to say that I’ve had lots of fun times going out to bars or for dinner without alcohol so it’s not that I’m still in the mindset of needing alcohol to have fun ay all. 

I’ve found being sober has made me less stressy, calmer, more fun (cos I’m not always wondering where my wine is) and just in general my mood is more balanced. 

My question is... what ways have you found to help you ‘blow off some steam’ without alcohol (as well all know that alcohol only gives you more steam). 

It may be a psychological barrier I have to get over but I need more tools in my arsenal that aren’t stuffing my face or drinking sparkling water that I can do at the end of the day to help me unwind that aren’t too taxing. I can’t constantly jump on my yoga mat cos that’s just not fun.

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we share about AoK which have touched us this past week. It can be AoK to ourselves, to others, to animals, or to the environment we live in. It can be AoK which we've performed, received, observed, or heard about secondhand or through the media. Any AoK which has touched us is fair game.

This week’s AoK comes from [a group of firefighters in Michigan](https://www.wkrn.com/news/firefighters-ring-up-customers-after-clerk-falls-ill/) who stepped up to run a convenience store after the cashier fell ill and had to be taken to the hospital. 

The cashier had called a coworker in to cover, but the coworker hadn’t arrived by the time the ambulance got there. The firefighters, who were the first responders, saw that customers were coming in just trying to get gas and snacks, so they stepped up to cover the cash register until the other employee arrived. 

The guy who got sick didn’t even know what they did until coworkers showed him the security footage the next day. They just did the job until their help was no longer needed and then left.

What I love about this AoK, aside from the very charming description of trying to figure out how to use the cash register, is that they saw what needed to be done, and they did it. It wasn’t glamorous work. It wasn’t heroic. It wasn’t exciting. It was what was needed under the circumstances, so they did it. 

AoK’s don’t have to be big or exciting. Life is not usually big or exciting. But it is generally the humble activities of daily life that tie us to other people and bring us together, and it’s often the type of help that is most needed.

Anyway, that’s me for this week. How about everyone else, any AoK’s that you’d like to share?",18

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens - good or bad - and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I decided to make an account and start a journey to sobriety because I need help. I'm trying to get professional help in real life as well. 

I typically find that hearing and reading other people's stories helps me to cope with my own problems. I'd love to read you guys' rock bottom stories and if you know any YouTubers or documentaries that you think could help me, please, PLEASE, send them this way.  

Yesterday was the day after the worst night of my entire life. I was supposed to talk to a therapist about my suicide attempt but since it was Sunday, nothing was available and the emergency psych center straight up told me that the only option was to have me admitted. That was the last thing I wanted. Having autism, I struggle with unfamiliar situations and strangers so I decided the best thing to do, was spent the day with my mom.

I talked about a few things with her and tried to explain to her that I need professional help. She admitted to me that she too used to have a drinking problem and that there is a history of drinking in my family. I didn't know this, I was the first person she ever told. I knew my dad used to have a drinking problem because he had a giant beer belly when I was a kid and today, he always brags about how many years it is since he stopped drinking. It's 23 if I remember correctly and he stopped suddenly one day so of course, I thought I could just do the same. 

It has been so hard for me to realise that I had a problem. I kept telling myself, ""I'll quit on Monday"" but then Monday came and I felt an urge to drink, even after drinking for four days straight. Eventually I sank too low and it took a DUI and suicide attempt to make me finally face my issues.

These past two days I've been trying out meditation and yoga for the first time in my life. I balled my eyes out when I tried meditation but I feel like it helped. At least I no longer feel like I can't look my family in the eyes anymore. 

I'm from Europe and the worst punishment I will be facing for my DUI is having my drivers license taken and a non-mandatory 20 days prison. (Meaning I won't go to prison but within a period, usually 2 or 3 years, I can't do anything criminal or the 20 days will be added to a prison sentence.) I'm fairly certain that I will loose my license for the next 3 years or be able to have a blow lock in my car. Thing is, I don't want a car anymore. I don't even know if I want to take the tests for my license again when I get the sentence. The fuck do I even remember from them? What humiliation will I face if I fail them? I talked to my parents about selling my car and getting a bike instead. My dad doesn't seem to understand why, and part of me feels bad about it because my parents gave me that car when I was 21. I just don't know what to do about myself. I'd rather not get another DUI down the line and I've been somewhat of an irrational driver. (Speeding a lot.)

This last paragraph was a big ramble. I'm still trying to cope with everything. I feel like shit mentally and like I'm constantly on the verge of tears. I don't think I've ever felt so small in my entire life. I used to think my most embarrassing moment was when my friend called my mom at 6 am because I'd passed out drunk on a strangers toilet in the other end of town.

I had woken up in a hospital. Not the ""we care for you"" kind. The ""shit dude, you can't be on the streets anymore"" kind. I was on the floor, with little more than a yoga mat and a small pillow. My clothes were on, at least. I looked around and saw homeless, drunks, and meth-heads. I asked myself ""how did I get here?"" in an existential way, the memories of the night prior came flooding back in like water into a basement. I knew how I had got there. Years later, what I did remember was swerving all over the roads. Hardly fucking conscious. I remember the lights behind me, blue and red. I had pulled over to let them get passed, but it was me they wanted. I had the sense not to argue, thank god. They confiscated my licence, my vehicle was to be impounded. I gathered my CDs out, and my shoe. Yes, shoe, not shoes. I kept asking the officer for my licence back, I clearly had no idea what happened when this stuff happens. No cuffs, they drove me to what was essentially a drunk tank. I had woken with one of the worst feelings of guilt, dread, what-have-you. I contemplated suicide for the second time, my first serious attempt, because of my drinking. 

This was it for me. I was 22, no girlfriend ever (hadn't even been kissed), college dropout, and on suicide watch. All because of drinking. I walked home, the city I was in wasn't even mine. The cities are separated by a large river. I hit the liquor store, because of course I would. I made my way home and kept drinking until I was ""asleep"" again. If you thought this would stop my habit, you are wrong. I somehow managed to keep my job and kept drinking. I kept asking ""why me?"" while I drank. I was bad news. The friendships I forever lost or tainted. I didn't try to seriously quit until October 2016. But I just couldn't. I'd go to hockey games completely plastered. I'd go to work feeling like death. I cried once a week every week. I went to a party and woke up with a hole in the host's wall on my Snapchat story. I blacked out and thought I had done it. I cried because I was alone. Alone and destructive. Everything I touched was worse for having me. I quit seriously March 2017. Those 5 months were some of the most enjoyment I've had til then. I switched jobs, started again. Shit started hitting the fan again. I don't even remember most of it, but it was bad. I fear that people look at me and see an idiot, a fool, a clown. The truth is, I don't know what I am.

I do know what I have, but not quite who I am. I have an awesome, beautiful girlfriend whom I now live with. I lost weight during that 5 month period. I am going to school this year to get a career. I know what I want. I want a family. I want to have children, and a wife I adore. I want to have a house and a nice life. I am 4 months sober today, and I am scared. Today, I got a big craving. All it takes is one. One to go all the way back to that shitty life, in which I am the biggest asshole anyone has met, and everything I touch goes bad. I see a craving, and I picture the life I am building around me crumble. I did not drink today. But these things scare me. There is no moral, no message I send. I'm just here to tell a story so I am reminded of what I used to be.",42

My mom works from home so she would have a few each night.

On NYE, I was at my friends house and she asked if I wanted to do Dry January with her. I have tried in years past, but failed as soon as Sunday lunch with my Mom rolled around.

My friend had me download the app and I texted my Mom to ask if she wanted to do it with me. She said yes and we check in daily with each other. 

Today, we went shopping and instead of grabbing some wine with lunch we went to a place with no alcohol at all and just had salads and iced tea.

I’m happy to report that within my friend circle everyone is sleeping better, less anxious and getting more done. Ive also lost weight and feel more motivated than ever.

My mom told me today she may never drink again because she didn’t realize what it was doing to her mood and Crossfit ability!

I would highly recommend using the app to track its very motivating.

These three things will ruin my life for good if I don't stop. Can anyone else relate or at least not berate me for having multiple addictions?",6

I made it almost 15 days alcohol-free recently, but as of today I have had alcohol again for 4 days in a row.

I’m not quite sure why I jumped back in, but I’ve been ramping up again. It started on Thursday with just 2 shots. Friday was 4-8, and last night was 9-12. I can’t be exactly sure (because of having very regular blackouts over the last couple years), but that’s the sense I get from checking my debit card transactions (this is an old refrain by this point. I stopped buying pints or handles in order to try to keep better track of what I’ve been drinking, and because a blackout after 10 drinks is easier to handle than a blackout after 20-40 drinks.).

Anyhow, I’m at 4 drinks for the day today and if I go out again for more (somewhat safe since stores are only open for 2 more hours in my time zone), I’m sure I’ll purchase at least 2 more shots.

Normally I’m okay with tapering off but I think I might be heading into “kindling” territory because ever since about 8AM this morning, I have been completely overcome by MASSIVE (almost literally crippling)  fear, anxiety, delusional/obsessive thoughts and I felt like my only real choice was to drink just to get rid of “The Fear”.

I’ve been lurking here in this sub for about a year at this point, but I’ve never had the guts to post yet. I have to go back to work tomorrow, where I manage a team of professionals, and I’m really scared that I’ll be gripped by the fear again and count down the hours until I can relieve it by another drink.

TL;DR: I relapsed this weekend and felt like I had to drink in order to deal with the profound anxiety. Any advice or encouraging words are appreciated. Thanks!",6

2020-01-19 16:32:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/er2oem/my_shooter_collection/,My Shooter Collection,"On August 20th this year, it will have been 5 years since my last drink. I'm rather proud of myself.

I was an alcoholic for ~18 years of my life. I started drinking at age 11, and quit drinking at age 28 in December 2014.

I didn't just suddenly decide to up and quit drinking. My sleep medication changed―I have Bipolar Disorder―and I was told by my psychiatrist that if I drank while on my new medication, I would likely die from the resulting interaction between the alcohol and my new medication.

I had three relapses after I initially quit drinking. But the last relapse was purposeful―as dumb as that may sound. It was my 29th birthday and I wanted to 'tie one on.' I'll skip the story about the close call I had that night with getting what would've been my second DUI.

Shortly after I had quit drinking, my youngest brother went on vacation to the Black Hills. When he got back, he gave me a souvenir 750ml bottle of Sloonshine from The Full Throttle saloon. I thanked him and went about my sobriety.

The next time I saw my psychiatrist, I mentioned the Sloonshine my brother got me. Instead of viewing the bottle as a potential ticking time bomb, I decided I'd consider it proof I'd overcame my addiction to alcohol. When I mentioned the Sloonshine to my doctor he said, ""that's a hell of a thing to gift to a recovering alcoholic."" I kept the bottle and, to this day, it remains unopened.  Moonshine was my favorite drink towards the end of my drinking career.

I can't remember exactly how my shooter collection began, but over the past few years I've slowly acquired 14 shooters of various liquors. Each one of the 14 is a liquor I used to abuse/drink consistently. I put down a few watch + cologne cases on the shelf in my closet and arranged my shooters neatly.

To me, it's a way of showcasing the power I have over alcohol. Considering none of the 14 shooters have ever been opened, it goes to show how good of a grasp I have on my recovery. The old me wouldn't have any of those shooters left after 24 hours. I have since stopped collecting shooters, as I now own a shooter of each of my favorite liquors.

I was going to upload a picture of this collection, but it seems r/stopdrinking only allows for text posts. So I'll put the link to it in the comments.

I made this post to let anyone who needs to hear it that, yes, **you CAN quit drinking**. Yes, **you CAN exit alcohol culture**.

**It's not easy, but nothing worth achieving ever is**",8

She stopped drinking before I was born and has been going to AA meetings since she gave up. 

I’ve been drinking since I was about 17, at first it was just at parties in high school and uni. Now I drink whenever I’m having a big night with friends which might be once a month, or I just have 1 or 2 at after work drinks or with dinner on the weekend. 

My issue though is that I have anxiety and I’m insecure. I went through a phase where I was drinking and taking a lot of party drugs and realised probably 2 years ago that I was doing these in excess to mask my anxiety. My tolerance is pretty high as I used to drink a lot every time I went out. I thought I had gotten on top of these issues through conversations with my therapist, until last weekend. 

Everyone was getting ready for a big night with work friends and everyone was drinking a lot, before I even realised I was doing it I was drinking to mask my insecurity that I didn’t really fit in. Predictably this ended with me blacking out for about 3 hours and although I don’t think I did anything stupid I can’t imagine I would’ve been great fun to be around.  

What this also meant is a few days of extreme anxiety post the night out. 

So while I feel like I can have 1 or 2 drinks and be fine, and I never have wanted to drink in a non-appropriate setting, whenever I have a big night out and everyone is drinking a lot I frequently end up too far gone. I’m thinking it might be good if I just make the decision to only drink with food and never go above one or two. Can any of you relate and do you have any advice?",2

I don't want to do this anymore. I actually detest myself for what I've let myself become. I go to sleep at night telling myself that tomorrow will be different. I'll stop it all tomorrow. I wake up each day saying the same but still planning how I can get a drink later.

I’m so excited to start this journey in the open and not have the extra difficulty of hiding it from people closest to me. Wish me luck guys.. Day 1.",15

I live in a house with my partner, a housemate, and our herd of children. my housemates partner is my former neighbor and we have a very close relationship. while he doesn't live here, he spends a lot of time and contributes to our household endeavors. our house is pretty big and we have decent land so we entertain often. we're all late thirties to mid 40s.

I've hit the bottle pretty hard for much of my adult life, but the last 7 years have seen my drinking hit unsustainable levels, resulting in development of a fatty liver and gaining a bunch of weight.

my reality is that if I don't stop drinking I will die, plain and simple. my daughter is profoundly and completely disabled and I'm her sole caregiver, chauffer, secretary, nurse, entertainer, smoocher, and giver of tickles. my love for her is immense and unwavering, but my life is fucking hard. i struggle emotionally. we're housebound a lot and many of my dreams and desires for my life will go unfulfilled. so I drink. to take the edge off, to be a little more patient, to loosen up and get silly. 

my partner and housemate and everyone else pretty much knows this. my housemate and her dude are alcoholics; my partner is not. I made it through my first 6 days fine - there is booze and beer at the house, I have not even really thought about drinking as I know what's at stake and if I'm good at anything in life, it's quitting stuff. then day 7 happened. 

we had bad weather so my housemate and her dude started drinking by noon. the whiskey came out, there were beers flying around, and I was stuck because of the weather and my daughter. my housemate is a rather ornery drunk so saying something wasnt really an option, so instead I made myself scarce. they got hammered. I came out to make a dinner that I ended up not even eating because I was so wound up and that little voice in the back of my head just kept getting louder and louder. as did they. it was awful, and it went from noon until when they finally went to bed around ten.

I spent most of the day just hanging out with  my daughter and hiding from the household. my partner understood what was happening and eventually encouraged everyone to hang out in the garage, which was appreciated. 

I have no expectation of other people changing their lives just because I did. I will not judge or try to force anything on anyone - this is just a really fucking hard thing that I absolutely HAVE to do.

I guess I was just hopeful that the people with whom I am sharing my space and life  would have a modicum of respect for my situation and feelings, and maybe not dangle it right in my fucking face when I'm not even a week out from this, and when there is so much at stake. I will talk to them about this when i am a little less raw.

the positive side of this is that I didnt drink yesterday. I had rationalized it in my head, I had excused it, and I was ready to say fuck it just to ease my discomfort, but I didnt. I felt so deeply miserable, but I didn't. I'm proud of myself.

I want to thank this sub because I spent A LOT of time reading your stories and your triumphs and your hiccups. I did not drink with any of you yesterday, nor will I today.",11

For the last month, I've been drinking everyday. I haven't really kept track of the numbers but i probably average around 6 drinks a day. A lot more if I go out on the weekend which i've only done like 4 times in the last month.

I honestly just want to quit it because I know it's unhealthy. However I don't want to have a seizure and bite my tongue off.

Can you get seizures from drinking just after a month? If there's a high chance I will I am going to either taper of have to go to the hospital which would really suck

This is one of the longest periods in the past 10 years or so that I haven't drank. The first week and a half was quite rough. A lot of depression, anxiety, feelings of disassociation and hopelessness; it was difficult to put it mildly. But then something happened last Sunday. All of those negative feelings stopped and I started to feel good, very good in fact. I woke up each day last week with energy, ready to go to work. No nausea, no headaches, no anxiety, or feeling overwhelmed by the thought of facing the day that I would get when I was drinking almost every night. And during the day, no little frustrations eating away at my energy, no negative thinking, no feelings of overwhelming stress, and no counting down the hours until I could get home, sit around with a 6 pack, and waste the night mindlessly watching tv. 

Instead I hopped out of bed each morning, got to work early each day, was productive and excited to talk with people. All week I was happy. And most importantly when I got home, I didn't shut myself away in a corner of the house to be alone and brood. My wife I spent each evening together, making dinner, talking, watching tv together, going to bed together. 

When drinking, every single day felt overwhelming but also meaningless. Alcohol was something to get me feeling ""normal"" for a few hours each night but was making life miserable. It destroyed my motivation, the joy in each day, any sense of accomplishment or optimism. But for the past week, I have seen what life can really be. For the first time in years, I feel a sense of hope and purpose. I know there are still challenges ahead in staying sober but I have found that I can be happy again, and I don't want to ever go back.",9

In the early fall, I met someone newly sober (about eight months into recovery); we’re both in our mid-20s. While I’m familiar with the rule/recommendation that people in recovery wait a year before dating, I didn’t want to press him when we started going out. (I’m not sober but drink very little.) 

We kept things fairly casual—fine by me, I’d just ended a long-term relationship—but things quickly escalated. We slept together early on, started opening up to each other, and then took turns pulling back/shutting down. Communication was a problem on both sides, but it was clear we cared for each other on some level.  

Eventually, when he was about a year into recovery, he told me via text he’d met someone else. I replied that I had strong feelings I’d been suppressing, and that while I respected where he was at, I hoped he’d reach out again if things didn’t work out with this new person.

Immediately he asked to see me. He looked devastated and repeated that he was so confused, that he “has no idea what he’s doing,” and that it would probably be best that we not see each other anymore but that there is no one else aside from someone he saw a couple times and hasn’t talked to since. He said he never should have been dating in the first place. I told him I understood and respected that, and then he asked if he could kiss me. I told him I didn’t want to add to his confusion, but long story short, we ended up getting intimate one last time. He kept repeating that it was a bad idea, so I tried to walk away, but he told me he didn’t want that. In hindsight, I should have put my foot down, but we’re both very attracted to each other. 

Then he said goodbye. He said he didn’t want to hurt me, that I was a good person, and that I deserved someone less emotionally unavailable. He said we wouldn’t see each other again. That stung, but I accepted it. Then, before we parted ways, he told me we’d probably run into each other often because he’s in my neighborhood a lot. I just sat there, nodding, taking everything in. He seemed frantic, upset, lost. I feel so bad. 

I’m not trying to change the situation or win him back, so to speak. I just want to understand what he’s been going through. He’s talked to me about his recovery but not about the role dating too soon might have played in making things difficult. I hate that I might have affected him and/or his recovery in a negative way. I’d like to make sense of the situation so I can process things and empathize with this man, even though we won’t be seeing each other again. Would it be appropriate if I went to an open meeting once or twice (far away from where he attends meetings, of course)?

Any input, feedback, and personal insights would be appreciated. Thank you so much for reading this, and please know that I have a great deal of respect for people in recovery.",2

Slept a lot to make up on lost sleep
Listened to new wholesome music instead of blaring through old dance classics
Left some constructive comments on reddit
Made a few nice self care gestures like lighting incense, drinking a healthy tea instead of first-thing rum, actually took a bath for the first time in several days and cleaned said bath.
Ate some actual breakfast/ lunch albeit yesterday's junk food
Made some sober plans for during the week instead of meeting up with the random who approached me in the pub last week. I could see us developing a friendship in my typically quite drunk suggestive state of mind that would not have been good.
Didn't meet up with anyone I presently have a dodgey relationship with
Sent some nice non-drunk messages 
Went out for coffee by walking to the place, yay exercise, and started a new drawing while out. I never actually 'do anything' when I drink despite feeling like it helps me in this area so this was good
Going to the cinema later with my saved cash to watch an actual good taste film (1917) instead of watching something relatively junky on netflix. And I will remember it. Oh and learned some interesting physiological facts listening to 'Alcohol Explained'. :)",9

Think and act positive. Empower yourself with knowledge. Identify your triggers. Practice self love and learn to love yourself!  Forgive yourself. You are not your circumstances.

I got home and immediately had to go back to my brothers house because his daughter couldn’t find a stuffed animal and I had left the bloody bedding in a bag in the backyard.  I dig through it and didn’t find the stuffed toy, but was able to take the bag home.

I couldn’t have done that if I did get black out drunk.

So I am thrilled to have lost the weight and back to a weight I have not been in 25 years. Is it due to my metabolism/liver now working more efficient?

I've 'quit' before for my mental health, but always ended up caving to peer pressure. After a scary night in November I really started to reflect on my drinking and how dangerous it was getting. After cutting back and then failing miserably to moderate on New Year's, I decided enough is seriously enough.

I've been trying so long to get my life in order and pull myself out of a depression using exercise, diet, meditation, whatever -- but nothing has done the trick like cutting booze. I'm realizing now that drinking was making it impossible to do those other things with any sort of conviction or consistency.

I'm still taking small steps to get healthy, but I consider every day I don't drink a huge victory. My relationship is 100% better, my skin is glowing, I've been dropping weight despite eating like an animal  half the week. My confidence is up, my bipolar mood swings are down. Everything is just a bit crisper and I've been noticing the birds chirping. 

I still have a handful of bad habits to tackle, but cutting drinking is like eating the frog. Just had to get over the worst of it to make the rest seem manageable.",9
2020-01-19 10:32:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eqxngf/on_rock_bottom/,On “rock bottom”,"I’ve always liked the quote “bottom is wherever you stop digging”.  

One of my problems with AA was that I didn’t match their description of an alcoholic. According to AA logic, that meant it was fine for me to keep drinking, because you’re either an alcoholic or you’re not. 

But I do think AA gets a few things right for me. One of them is the idea that some kind of moment of truth can be the thing that helps you finally find sobriety. 

I had many quit attempts over several years, but none lasted longer than a couple months at most. What made the difference was suddenly seeing very, very clearly what my rock bottom was going to look like if I kept drinking. 

When I had that experience, I had been sober from alcohol for a few days and was smoking weed to help with the transition. It was like a classic stoned insight that you think is meaningful at the time but usually isn’t, except this one was. I was able to picture and feel what rock bottom would be like so clearly that it was almost like I was experiencing it. It was terrifying.

That was a turnaround for me. I didn’t even have the urge to drink at all for weeks after that because I was so horrified. It was also what I needed to get to this point, which is more than a year sober from everything except coffee.

I’m sharing this in case my experience with imagining rock bottom is enough to help someone else have the same experience and find sobriety on the other side.",14

Things are getting better I am sleeping almost normal although my energy is still shit.  Despite that I woke up this morning and did day 3 of P90X3 workouts. Thankfully it was yoga today.  I got a puppy about a year ago he had parvo and distemper missing an eye and a cataract in another with a seizure disorder.  Due to the fact that he grew up in quarantine he was never housebroken.  Which has resulted in my house turning into a pee filled grossness... please don’t judge in the worst of my drinking days it was a toss up of whether I would drag my ass to work or just stop at the 711 and get drinks and start early.  In the movie don’t worry he won’t get far on foot the guy says  “ ihad two pairs of pants, one with shit in them and one without. And I didn’t care which one of them I was wearing.” Yup i truly related to that situation that’s how down I was. So of course my dog at 5 minutes left of the workout decides he needs to pee right in front of my yoga mat... figures so I move my yoga mat back finish my workout clean up the pee and get ready for work.

I regret it, and here is a warning for you to heed.","After I-have-no-idea how many years of drinking that got progressively worse and included day drinking as a matter of course, I finally gave it up completely last week. Monday started a new journey, and every day has been better than the last. I've been feeling good about myself, the temptation hasn't been too strong and I've even poured drinks for my wife while I stuck with tonic water for myself.

Overall, I find myself to be far more productive and it is amazing.

Fast forward to Saturday, I am doing some tasks around the house that I've put off for a long time. But it isn't going very well and I'm getting frustrated. For the first time in the week, I'm craving a drink. I push on, and push on, and then out of frustration I cave in. One shot, just to take the edge off. 

5 shots later - I feel horrible. I've let myself down. I make it through the night and fall asleep. I sleep terribly. I wake up with a headache and taste the disappointment in my mouth. Today, I am back to being sober. Yesterday I slipped, and I wish I hadn't, but I think it has also firmed up my resolve to stay sober. 

If you are in a similar boat and feel that temptation - don't do it. It wan't worth it, it didn't take the edge off, it just made me feel worse about myself. It realigned my frustration from being about the task I was trying to accomplish to being about failing myself. 

Don't get tempted. I though I would have one shot, but I see clearly that I can't just have one.

I've spent more time recently trying to figure out why I drank and I've realized that very often my immediate urge is to check out and alcohol was the easiest way to do that.  ""I don't want to be here, in my head, or be part of society for now"" really was a driving factor.

Now, in January, I wanted to start again and it's more difficult this time. Last night, I met with a really close friend. We cooked dinner, played cards, talked, it was really nice. Wanted to go to a party after. Since I am moving away soon and her boyfriend is gonna stay with her for some time before that, we realised it was probably our last night going out only the two of us.
So I said, let's have a spritz in the club. Expecting for it to make the night more awesome.
Anyway, we were in the club, she bought the drinks. Upon the first sips I said ""hey I feel so good rn, I don't even need this."" but it was already there, so I drank it. Funnily, both of us said we were more motivated before the drink. For me, it kinda dragged me down. Had two more seccos over the night nonetheless. Because once you start it kinda has to be worth it, right.... Crap.

I wasn't super drunk and drinking didn't ruin the night. But it didn't make it better either. Maybe even a little worse. And sure as hell I woulda felt proud today for not drinking today instead of kinda guilty and annoyed with myself like now. Hangover is not bad, just a little headache. But still. Not worth it.

Last night I stayed up all night drinking and had to call in sick, I really didn't want to do that to my colleagues but its something that needed to be done. I need a restart on my life. I'm 24 and been using alcohol as a coping mechanism for too long, I've spent the last X amount of year spending all my money on drowning my emotions out.

There are no answers to be found at the bottom of a drink just further misery, I've opened up to my girlfriend and we are both gunna try support each other through this journey, I know its going to be rough but ultimately it's for the best. 

Being young and surrounded by a heavy drinking culture in the UK I know it's going to be hard but from now on I'm going to be saying no to a pint after work, no on special occasions, no at at the weekend, no when I'm down, no when I'm bored.

I do not like coffee and have never felt pressured to consume it, even when sitting in a coffee shop with a bunch of people drinking their crazy gravity fed, Chemex, $10 cups. 

I've never been given a dirty look when everyone else orders soda and I choose iced tea.

I've never looked down on people who come with me to Sushi restaurant then order cooked food - that is their preference, and that is alright. 

I shouldn't feel guilty or pressured to drink just because others are. 

Whether it be because I have stuff to do afterward, don't like the taste, don't like the feeling of being buzzed, or am an alcoholic, it doesn't matter. Folks should order whatever they want to drink, regardless of my choice, and pay no heed to my selection.

I know this is not always the case but it is helping me grapple with the question of 'Will my friends not like me as much?' or 'Will they stop inviting me to events where there is drinking?' Ultimately, they shouldn't care as long as I'm still a fun person to be around, and if they can't get over it I probably have better places to be anyway.

Let me set this up a bit. 

For 8 years or so I drank pretty much every night, anywhere between 375ml of liquor up to 750ml of liquor,depending on my mood. Every now and then I would take a day off because I was sick or wasn't ""feeling"" it. 

Out of all the grief I've put on myself and all the shit I've put loved ones through,ya know what seems to be helping me ween off the sauce? Calories... That's right! Calories..  Selfish right!? 

I started messing around with intermittent fasting a few weeks ago and eating one low calorie meal a day to lose weight. 

The first few days I would drink like always, then I started thinking of all the damn calories my rum has in it. So I took a few days off, then I drank, but not as much as normal, this has continued a few times and now I'm up to 4 days! 

I have a feeling I'm breaking two addictions at once, food and booze. 

This time I'm going to go for even longer,maybe forever. 

They say different things work for different people, I just wanted to share what seems to be working for me so far. 

I know I've got a long way to go, and I will never be able to have a healthy relationship with alcohol(or food) but these few weeks have been really encouraging.

I'm not going to drink today, and I'm going to lose weight and be healthier because of it.

I wrote this initially to vent, but I think now it's a good reminder of the path we're all walking.

Story Time:

I went over to my friend's house to kick it and play video games, watch movies, etc.- the weekend usual. I was just expecting a couple of us until my friend's brother (A) comes over. Typically I avoid A as much as possible because he's one of the worst drunks I know, only compounded by the fact that he makes a lot of money. He is the single smuggest, drunkest individual I know. He's gone to rehab, worked the steps, and eventually at one point decided he simply likes drinking more.

Things are going fine so I stick around and we settle down to play poker. What ensues was one of the most patently ridiculous things I've seen (besides when I used to walk down the middle of streets barefoot at 4 am trying to find my way home coming out of a black out). Individual A begins to go down the poker table dissecting every person's life and how much better his is because he makes money. He pays particular attention to his brother and me, because he knows I make the least money out of anyone at the table who isn't still in college. I take it in stride and we all laugh at A because of how absurd it is for him to be giving out life advice. A person whose mother begs him to stop drinking because she knows he'll probably be dead in years. At one point he eventually throws his phone at me, splashing poker chips everywhere and making a scene. I start to get hot, but I simply said ""I'm out"", grabbed my shit and left. 

It's a simple enough story many of us have probably experienced, but if this was me 2 years ago I would've easily been as drunk as A or worse. I would've either assaulted him or screamed at him, broken things, and eventually gone to the liquor store to put myself into an even greater hole. Maybe even upgraded the night to a DUI. After I calmed down on my drive home I came to the peaceful and satisfying conclusion that I wouldn't trade a day in my two years of sobriety for what he has. I'd rather be a middle class, lonely, sober guy than a rich drunk fat asshole.

It's certainly not easy being sober and it's especially difficult at times to manage our emotions when provoked. But I take comfort in the fact that when I wake up tomorrow, no matter how long I stew over this tonight, I will have remained sober and clear minded. I will not have resorted to violence. I will remember my actions and I will be able to take responsibility for anything I have done, and ultimately I know that I am a better person than I used to be. For anybody struggling out there, remember why we walk this path.",448

I suppose I'm just impatient but I feel like it isn't clicking for me at all. I've had a hard time fighting off cynicism and suicidal thoughts despite going to therapy, taking medication, and having a support system comprised of a few friends. It doesn't feel like I'm worth the time and resources I'm using up just to feel ""good"" or ""normal"". I've been to a few AA meetings with great people, but I strongly dislike the format. I joined a gym but I couldn't get out of bed until over an hour after it closed. I feel completely useless when I have any days off of work. I feel like I'm taking up space that just about anyone else could more effectively use.

I know I'm not attracting any positivity by being this way but I don't know how to change. I know my brain is used to immediate gratification but I don't feel like I've made any true strides in 167 days, just depriving myself of a particular chemical and being a burden to those who care about me.

I'll try to keep it short for everyone's sanity: I have stage 4 cancer along with an assortment of other physical and mental health problems. I've had to deal with 3 different insurance companies over the past few months and medical bills are pilling up.

After a particularly rough day, I decided to stop by a local and very good chocolatier for a box of my favorites (buttercreams dipped in milk and dark chocolate). The price tag was $18.50 but I bought it anyway. 

I felt enormously guilty on both the ride home and once I got home that I blew $20 on a box of chocolates.

Then later that night I realized that I used to throw down $20 at the store for hard liquor for a night of binge drinking without feeling too bad. (I usually felt bad the next day but never felt bad immediately after purchase.)

While ""coping"" with $20 of chocolate is rather extravagant when you're pinching pennies and not that healthy for you, $20 of alcohol would have been so much worse physically and mentally for me.

I just don’t know if i can take this any longer, and i know drinking isn’t going to fix any of my problems - in fact i’m sure i would be so disappointed to lose my sober date. but god am i bored, and just want to feel the relief of a beer (or 6). 

i’m living in a small town where i know pretty much no one and i haven’t really found meetings that i like. i isolate really intensely. I don’t leave the house at all and just use television and shitty food to numb out and i don’t know how to get myself out of this pattern. my world was so small when i was drinking, pretty much everything revolved around it, and now i’m not drinking but my world is still tiny. my life is really boring, and it’s my own fault because i don’t go out and do things, the energy and drive just isn’t there - and the anxiety definitely is. i still do the same lazy and avoidant behavior as the days that i was hungover. without drinking its really a challenge for me to be social so in a way it feels like my world has even shrunk. i sometimes try to break out, for example i went to meet a friend of a friend the other day for coffee (first time we had met) and i just didn’t want to be there frankly. i felt awkward and full of anxiety the whole time and just wanted to return to my cave. 

i’ve put myself in my own prison and feel paralyzed by my depression and apathy. i feel like i’m just here aging when everyone else is living (dramatic i know) and i just don’t want to be stuck anymore - how do i “unstick” myself? this is all very “whoa is me”, i do have many things to be grateful for i just needed to rant. *thank you, this sub is amazing*",2

Today was a day like that. I think that's a big reason why I drank - drinking was the time when I could relax and just let myself be okay with being me. I'd bitch about what I didn't like in my life, get buzzed enough to laugh it off, and then forget how I got to bed. 

Tonight I journaled (a habit I've replaced drinking with), and ended up realizing a different way to look at things when I was feeling like a failure. It was inspiring and actually clicked with me, rather than my mind just degrading the thought. 

And I also realized that if I were still drinking, I would have just bitched about it, drank too much, and gone to bed.

I was worried about facing my demons sober. I'm starting to realize that I was just hiding from them drunk.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens - good or bad - and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Part of me feels sad about that and it makes me want to go drinking with them, but then I remember that one more drink and my life is over.  I quickly realize that it’s not worth it.  I still have the urge after ~5 years.  It only flares up on occasion but it’s definitely there.  

When I first quit drinking it was only going to be for a year.  One day about 6 months in I realized that I didn’t miss having a beer or glass of wine, I missed an entire 6 pack or an entire bottle.  It was that realization that made me quit forever, and that feeing is still there to this day.  When I get that little voice telling me that maybe drinking again wouldn’t be so bad, I remember that it’s not just one - I want it all.  That sort of snaps me back to reality.  It doesn’t happen very often - maybe a few times a year - but it does happen.  Like when I was at a wedding a few months ago and I almost put my hand in the cooler to get a beer out of instinct.  I didn’t even plan on drinking, nor did I want to, but I almost grabbed one out of habit because it’s still in my brain.  Crazy what alcohol does to you.

Usually this is a messy affair and wasn't sure if I could handle it, I hadn't told any of them I was steering clear so was expecting to have to answer a tonne of probing questions and be met with disapproval.

Wasn't what happened at all, turns out my whole group is doing the same thing! Individually, we all came to the same conclusion! What the hell?

So it was strange at the beginning, probably the first time we've hung out sober since we were teenagers but we got past it and had a great night full of genuine conversation. 

No idea why I'm writing this here, it just bamboozled me and I'm incredibly grateful for my two newfound sober squads. 

Stay dry folks!

I’ve been sober for close to a year and a half, and after the initial detox/pancreatitis that I went through, I’ve been pretty healthy. 

I’ve got a nasty cold/flu thing going today and I went to the store to get some medicine. NyQuil always knocked me the fuck out, which is what I was hoping for, but as I was reaching for it , I thought about the alcohol content. Not much in there. I’m out of rehab, my probation isn’t directly monitored anymore. I wouldn’t get in any trouble. 

I think for some people it wouldn’t be an issue, but I decided to go for some theraflu/tea kind of thing. No alcohol. It’s been a while since I’ve had a serious craving but that bottle of NyQuil made my brain go “Hey! Yes please!” So I decided I shouldn’t. 

I don’t know if this means anything to anyone else, but I just thought it was important for me to share it. Hope you all have a good night.",57

I saw that I used to take Sundays off simply because I'd be hung over and miserable. But a few weeks back I decided I'd take appointments on Sundays if a customer wanted to meet. 

And its been pretty good, I go to my appointment I close a deal, I'm sober. I feel great, I make money. All is good in this world. Its an advantage that I never considered before. 

And another note I've noticed as I'm gone longer and longer without drinking its become easier and easier to not even rely on my coping mechanisms. Early on in my journey I relied heavily on candy, sugary foods, and lots and lots of soda. Naturally that's not healthy but I'd rather down 4-5 cans of coke then a 12 pack of beer.

2020-01-18 22:12:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eqqyuw/today_was_a_good_day/,Today was a good day.,"I haven't had a drink in almost 2 years now.  I rarely miss it, but technically I wasn't an alcoholic.  Don't jump on me for that.  My husband is one, so I quit with him.  I rarely drank before that - unless you count a year or two in college when I would get blackout drunk and make an ass out of myself.  That was like 15+ years ago, and I got that shit out of my system early.  But I could see the potential for alcoholism in myself.  I was the occasional drinker who didn't know how to stop on those occasions and couldn't estimate the effects until it was too late.  So I was a pre-alcoholic in the sense that it mirrored something like a pre-diabetic or whatever.

The thing is... Now that I don't drink anymore I do feel the heavy weight of societal norms - and see just how normalized and out of hand alcohol is in day to day life.

I stopped the day (plus maybe a month because I hadn't had a drink in a month) when my husband FINALLY admitted to his drinking problem.  He was lying to me a lot of the time back then because he didn't want me to judge him.  But I found evidence of it that I couldn't deny and couldn't push the feelings down inside anymore.  I am a yeller.  I didn't even yell.  I looked him square in the eye and told him he had a problem and listed off the stuff I had just found - empty bottles, etc.  My quiet anger was worse than any yelling I could have done, and he knew it.

He just looked up at me meekly and said, ""I do have a problem.""

He started AA the next day.

Today we sent my kids off to a sleepover at the grandparents house and worked around the house together.  Today for the first time I had zero anxiety that I would find another one of his hidden bottles.  He had them hidden in drawers, drop ceilings, fishing tackle boxes... You name it.  We pulled out the basement drop ceiling a couple months ago and more came falling out.  The anxiety of wondering if those really are old or newer is real.  Raw.  Painful.  I still ask him how he's doing with it and make sure he's not drinking in secret.  But actions speak louder than words - and he's so much better at being there for us, so I can truly tell he's being honest every single day.

I am grateful for each sober day.  It's one more day that keeps me away from moving towards alcoholism myself, but it is also one more day to enjoy the life we have now versus the life we had then.

Today was a good day.  Probably one of the best.

Stay strong, one day at a time.",8

She was an addict and an alcoholic. 

We met in treatment and kept in touch afterwards. Spent an entire day at her beautiful home making juice and listening to music. She was a giver. She got me my first diffuser and oils and was always willing to share with anyone who needed something. Selfless and kind. 

Our conversations because shorter and further apart as she began drinking again with her husband. I was concerned but told her I loved her and would always be here. 

Unknown to me she got into drugs. This cost her her life. She overdosed. That’s all I know. 

I am overrun with waves of sorrow and grief. I think of her family, mostly her child. The little one who won’t understand why her best friend is gone and can’t come back to her. I’m devastated for the wasted life. She could have done so much. Continued to impact so many people. I am sad and I am angry. I’m angry that no one could save her. I’m angry she died as life is just getting good. I’m angry my friendship was enough. 

I know this will get easier. Today it is close to unbearable. I miss my friend. I mourn her life.

Tonight I had planned to attend to a party even though I wasn't super keen on it and due to having a really infected relationship with my mom that came up I felt super angry and sad before heading out, even cried for a bit because I was so angry that I wasn't like ""normal"" people and could be able to drink tonight so that I could forget about my problems for a brief moment and almost cancelled my plans on leaving the apartment. But after some really ambivalent negotiations with myself I decided to go, and you know what? I DIDN'T DRINK! Sure, I was boring as hell and left early but right now I have other, more important problems to worry about than that.   


Also, I went out for a jog this morning? I have absolutely no idea were I got the idea from, it just popped up in my head. It was even raining outside. I haven't been exercising since 3 years ago so I have no idea what flew into me?

2020-01-18 18:04:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eqnymb/worrying_about_tomorrow/,Worrying About Tomorrow,"I just need to write this out. I’m so close to 2 weeks of no drinking, and I have plans to spend most of the day with my family tomorrow. I love them, but alas, they are my biggest drinking trigger. 

I had opportunities to hang out with them last weekend, which I turned down (making a lot of excuses) because I knew I needed to focus on me during my first no drinking weekend. I haven’t told them about my choice to stop drinking yet. I know that I should, but I’m so worried about how they’ll react. They ALL drink, a lot! None of them see it as a problem, as they all hold down their jobs and have never been effected in the way I have (I have 2 DUIs). 

During my last DUI when I HAD to stop drinking by law, my Dad was the only really supportive one in the family. (My mother acted like her life was over, but that’s a whole different story.) So I’m planning on finding some kind of opportunity to tell him tomorrow, which is a start. My husband is my biggest supporter, but he’s working tomorrow. He offered to be my life line and call him if I’m feeling tempted, which is great. I’m also going to offer to drive myself to the event because I have at least been strong enough to not drink and drive in the past 5 years. 

I’m so proud of these past 13 days, and I just keep reminding myself that I am strong enough to make it through tomorrow and every day. I don’t want to cut them out of my life. But if they’re going to continue to drink while I don’t, I know I need to make it through tomorrow without drinking to prove to myself that I can. To prove to myself that I can still enjoy my family without the booze. To prove that I’m finally making the best decision of my life and I can continue to do so.",5

I keep thinking how easy it’d be to give this shit up and just go grab some beers. My brain is lying to me no stop and it’s distresing, and it’s making it hard to stay sober. My emotions are all over the place, I keep almost bursting into tears and I keep getting moments of rage. I hate this 


I’m also having moments of just being 100% honest with myself for the first time, and I’m facing some really brutal realizations that make me fear for my future. These fears also make me want to give up.",3

About 2 or 3 beers in I found myself frustrated that I couldn’t follow the quick dialogue or jokes of the tv show we were watching. 

Had a couple small little arguments with my fiancé about nothing (nothing major but we probably wouldn’t have argued at all if I wasn’t drinking). 

Didn’t accomplish anything else productive the rest of the day and haven’t accomplished anything today. 

Didn’t get up and out of bed till 2 cause I had a a killer headache. 



I’ve had much better and more satisfying days since I had stopped drinking. I was waking up by 7 and getting so much done each day. And going to bed feeling so good at the end of the day. I didn’t gain anything by drinking yesterday. I could have done the same thing (watched tv and ate pizza) without the alcohol and I think I genuinely would have enjoyed it more.

I’m feeling pretty good, definitely still struggling with the social aspect of things and the alcohol ridden culture that is being involved in a Sales-adjacent career... But with finishing up today being my 3 week marker, I decided it was time for some new challenges and new rewards.

Booked myself an intro membership to Cyclebar as a step up in my nonexistent fitness game, and I made an appointment for a 90 minute massage tomorrow. A little something to challenge the slow creep of a sedentary lifestyle my drinking habits have built over the years, and a little something to acknowledge all of the hard work I’ve put in making big changes over the last few weeks.

I finished the cyclebar class this morning, and it kicked my ass. I signed up for a package of classes per month, figuring I’ll keep at it for at least a couple months while exploring some other options. I’m not overweight by any means,  just a little above where I’d like to be, but it was clear as day I’m more out of shape than anyone my age should be (30F, no kids, gets tired going up two flights of stairs...)

As I was signing up for the package, the instructor invited me to her Wednesday class, great, support and building relationships is good! And then: “Yeah we have wine down Wednesday!”

Ugh. I had already mentioned I was doing Whole30 and didn’t really feel like going into booze in general with a person I literally met 45 minutes ago, so I just repeated that. 

“Oh, well if you can’t have wine, do you drink Tito’s?? Sometimes we have...” 

Sorry! I can’t drink at all!

I signed up for a different class to avoid the temptation. I like the idea of a little after class socializing, but why is alcohol built into literally everything including health and fitness!? I get that I would have been ALL about this a few years ago, so I see the marketing appeal, but can’t we just have a few safe havens outside of meetings where there’s no expectations to drink?",10

I knew I wasn't feeling great mentally. I knew I couldn't control my drinking. I knew I needed to stop.

But there I stood, at the store, thinking to myself, ""Hey, it's Friday, get those beers even though it has only been 2 days since your last pack, go home, enjoy them and play some video games!""
Beers run out. I know I shouldn't go out to get more, but wouldn't it be so great with some McDonald's food and another pack of beer? I mean, I've done the same thing before, so why not? The roads to the McDonald's are small and empty, slow driving shouldn't be too bad while in this condition, right?

And then the worst night of my entire life happened. I've done a lot of fucked up shit but I've never felt SO ashamed of myself. I got pulled over by the rudest cops ever who kept asking me questions about being transgender, what did I want done ""down there"" and shit like that. (where I'm from, your social security number is based on gender, I had mine legally changed and when the cops looked me up, they found my old number which is how they found out.)

I felt like shit for waking my mom at 4 AM and telling her to come get me in the hospital where they drew blood to see how much I had to drink. I felt like shit over telling her first thing to please not tell anyone about this when I got into her car, but mostly, I feel like shit for lying to her about wanting to be alone.

I'd JUST gotten into my apartment when I found another beer and a knife. Bleeding all over my kitchen floor, I managed to make an emergency call and they had to stitch me up. I've never cut myself so badly and I've never wanted to end my own life so badly either. I just couldn't believe that ME, of all people, got a DUI. What's worse is that I ran away from the hospital, getting sick of more nurses and doctors asking me, ""So what do you want done down there?"", so the nurses called my mom when I was gone. Great, now she knew about that as well, after I made such an effort to tell the nurses that no one needed to know. 

I feel like shit. I feel like this is rock bottom. I'm 29 years old and I've never wanted to end my life so badly. The only thing keeping me up right now is my rabbit. She's a little shit, but I don't want to leave her all alone. I fucking hate my life. I knew I was feeling terrible, but I didn't know I was feeling SO terrible.",80

Porn has been with me for 40 years, a lifelong struggle to give up.  It has ebbed and flowed in its frequency, getting less powerful as I age (one good part about aging).  Drinking - the Friday night binge drinker, who started 20 years ago, has also ebbed and flowed.  I abstained once for a year.

Porn has been going well, 3 episodes in the past 100 or so days.  In my journal though I see that the relapses are only when I was drunk.

Drinking - I keep thinking I can moderate and enjoy a glass of wine and a board game at dinner with my wife.  But the compulsion for another drink is so strong that I have more than a few times ended up with one too many (4).

I want to cry.  My life is a bit joyless and stressful.  I have few male friends, my wife and I are starting the empty nest, my work can be stressful (is not at the moment) and I’m trying to settle my dad’s estate after he passed in November.  Wine - I put on 80s music and play a board game and chat with my wife and everything is awesome.  No problem seems that bad.  No decision seems hard.  There is no guilt to get work done.  And the song on the radio is awesome, and the conversation is great, and we don’t care who’s winning.

But then sometimes it’s a binge and the next day is a written-off piece of crap that I struggle trough.  And then sometimes I wander into porn during the binge, and that’s my other demon.  I really wish I could relax without alcohol in the first place.  :(",8

Now as I sit here typing on my 180th day of sobreity, I realize each day I've spent sober, is a day I've spent redeeming myself for all my past mistakes.

But I’m early in this sobriety thing. I’ve shared my demons with a few select people, including my SO. But I have not shared those details with my SO’s extended family, who we happen to be visiting this weekend. 

The FIRST thing that happens when we arrive is our host offers me a drink. I say “no thanks” (I was carrying luggage and greeting people, I thought that would be enough) but he fetches me a beer and hands it to me. My SO gives me a look that says, “feel free to decline more forcefully.” But instead I take the beer, thank him, and hold on to it. I carry this beer around the entire evening. No one cared or appeared to notice. Except for our host who made another strange comment when I poured myself a glass of water (“water? Cmon!”).

2020-01-18 11:32:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eqihuo/family_visits/,Family Visits.,"I’m visiting my parents as my dad goes through chemotherapy and radiation treatments for a malignant brain tumor. This comes in the heels of his going from owning 4 businesses, two airplanes, and goodness knows what else, to none of either within less than a year, being diagnosed with heart failure and losing function of one of his legs, which has made him immobile. He’s gone from a jovial, social, get-it-done person to someone very reliant upon others to do just about anything. The cancer treatment appointments are a 45 minute drive from their home, so one of the ways I’m helping is doing the driving and helping him in and out of the car. In addition, I’m trying to help sift through and subsequently pack their belongings as they move from a large house to a two-bedroom apartment. So, it’s confronting a great deal of memories and emotions as I try to figure out how to tackle *all this stuff* along with the emotions (mine, my parents’, and my brothers’) that go with it… some of which are complicated by a portion of these things belonging to one of my little brothers that passed away in 2015. Trying to find that balance of how to push forward (discarding the empty water bottles which were saved to be used later, the partially emptied honey bottles meant to be combined) while also being sensitive to the difficulty of this situation. I mean, I hate moving, too. Let alone having to get rid of so many… things.

I stopped drinking again sometime around January 2nd. After a great New Year’s Eve (drinking with friends) and a normal New Years Day (drinking by myself), I felt this great general sadness. Although I’ve been questioning my drinking since my days in the Marines (where I also go my start), since my brother passed away from addiction, it’s been a bit more of a purposeful quest. However, I’ve found it remarkably hard to deal with other people. That is, when I turn down a drink, it’s such a big ordeal. Some of this has been helped by reading more about how our culture uses, accepts, or demands alcohol use and then how its use is compared only to the worst-case = alcoholism (e.g., you have to be nearly dying to have your desire to change your ways be cheered on by others). It’s also been useful for me to look at how I am around alcohol and how I’ve been only too willing to hang on to certain aspects of my “social personality”, such as drinking. But, with the start of the new year, and the increased popularity of “Dry January”, I’m off to a new running start. Also, my partner and I decided to give Whole 30 a shot, just to see if there’s anything else in our food choices that isn’t great. (Big hint, waaaay too much sugar.) 

Now that I’m with my parents, the Whole 30 is mostly out the window. I’m not in a great position to start pushing against so many years of habit on how they eat. I mean, I could, but that’s not exactly being a supportive child. I’ve let go of that and am eating things which I haven’t eaten since I was a kid. The strange thing is, there’s no comfort in it. And that’s okay. What I am struggling with, and why I’m here, is that everyone else in this house drinks. A lot. As a kid, I never really noticed my parents drinking. I mean, I guess I knew they drank wine, but as I wasn’t drinking, I wasn’t conscious of it; didn’t track how much, how often, or where it was stored. As an adult that was drinking, I did notice my parents drinking and enjoyed their company as I did so too. “It IS okay!”, I’d say to myself. On the loss of my brother, I knew something wasn’t right. During one of my non-drinking times (over Thanksgiving break), My parents and brothers came to visit my family (partner and kids) and stayed nearby. Suddenly, I saw how much everyone was drinking. Then, just this past summer, my parents came to stay with us and the true totals were striking. No, they were never fall-down or blackout drunk, but after a 5 day stay, seeing the number of empty 1.5L wine bottles and 750mL Jack Daniels bottles in the recycling was astounding.

I had high hopes that I’d visit them during this stressful time and at least my dad would have curbed the drinking. But, that isn’t the case. I had the same hope for my brothers, but that isn’t the case either. That my mom still drinks isn’t a huge surprise, given the amount that she’s been put through. It doesn’t make drinking okay, but it makes not quitting a lot easier to understand. In fact, after my first day of showing up and trying to help by asking what needs to be done and starting to do things that I thought need to be done, I felt more like drinking than I had for quite a while. Mostly, this was due to the frustration that it was clear that my “help” wasn’t the help they needed or wanted; my presence is more what they’re needing now, and that’s okay (but a great challenge for someone that takes after their father as a do-er). Still, as I watch the rest of the family drink themselves into not caring each night and undoubtedly having that vacant pleasure awaiting them at night that encourages them to get through the day, it’s definitely harder not go with the flow--to check into that routine of, “Let’s do what needs to be done today, so that we can go away tonight.” 

And so, I continue to fight that urge. I drink as much water as I can handle (the dry midwestern winters are killer when you’ve acclimated to the constant moisture of the PNW), and way too much coffee, and just look for things to keep me busy. I hang out in front of the fire, ask what needs to be done in their eyes, and move through the days. Additionally, I’ve restarted my yoga practices and have caught up on some TV that I’d been hoping to watch for quite awhile. Next week, we will most likely be moving the first round of furniture to their new place, which I believe will be a rude awakening. But hopefully that’s counterbalanced by the lack of stairs, lower energy bills, and lawn care included with monthly rent. Plus, having my adult little brother being forced to move out will also help relieve some stress, I’m sure. 

That’s it for now. I mean, there’s also the awaiting the results of a job interview two weeks ago and figuring out if my family will be making a move to a new state, but that decision isn’t here now. Instead, I’m only going to focus on this decision: I will not drink with you today.

It’s good to be back.",6

I have stopped a couple times for short periods.  Went from a six pack might kill me to some days averaging 16 in a day.  I'd say the average has been 12.  It's been worse too.  I'm basically functional and don't do the normal drunk people things, though it does catch me sometimes and I become way too wrapped up in my thoughts and emotions and friends online take the brunt of that.  I've dealt with a few huge issues in the past couple years and it's been very difficult.  Fraud victim, unforeseen career loss, realizing I'm 38 and I was so close to having what I wanted just five years before and now nothing...those innate life things like relationships, owning your own place, kids, etc.  Times have been hard.  I also internally beat myself up a lot over it.  I guess the stress of it all has kept me drinking...it was something to kill the time that was painful.  I've dealt with a few medical issues that have been my biggest motivators to quit drinking honestly.  They were related, and basically slowing down or stopping cleared them.  

I think the hardest thing is the feeling of comfort, less anxiety, and familiarity that comes with alcohol after this long.  It was the non-prescription drug that kept me generally sane.  I generally had that constant nagging anxiety and as long as I could keep the feeling of a drink or two in me a lot of the day, it calmed...some days better than others.  The thing is, I know I have to quit.  I don't know how to replace that feeling, at least initially.  I also have a slight aversion to getting a real prescription because I have one dream career that I have to make a decision on sometime soon and a medical background with an anxiety prescription would be bad or perhaps disqualifying.  

I'm really tired of it all and hope I can turn things around sometime.",2

He’s been struggling for decades but especially for the last five years. But for the first time, I actually believe he’s ready. He never calls me to talk about this. And we spoke for two hours. “I don’t want to die. My wife is going to leave with the kids. This is it. I’m done. I’m calling you to make a commitment. I’m done.” 

This sort of candor is a first and it’s got me cautiously optimistic. I just keep thinking about my own journey. About all of our journeys. About that moment of clarity when everything starts to come into focus. The moment when you finally see it. And sobriety starts to become something you truly crave more than alcohol. I just wish there was a way I could make him really feel what that moment is like.

If only there were a way to see the cycles we are trapped in when we’re trapped in them. Maybe, if we’re lucky, we get a glimpse. A flash of insight. A wake up call. And it’s just enough for us to begin clawing our way out. But it’s only through courage and tenacity that we can finally gain real perspective. 

The map is not the territory, as the saying goes. And those of us lucky enough to be on the sober side of an alcohol problem can, and should, attempt to make those who seek our help see what’s it’s like. What it takes to get here. But the journey can only be walked alone. And one step at a time. 

Please send your positive thoughts, prayers, or whatever you’re into spiritually to my brother. It’s all on the line for him. Today is day 2 and we are all pulling for him here.",7

I Really Need Advice,"Ok so this is my first time posting here but  I really need some advice. I've been a serious weekly binge drinker for over 5 years now, however over the past year I have cut down, (drinking heavily at the weekend roughly every other week rather than every week). Even though I have cut down I still notice when I drink I find it very hard to stop, and often 1 planned drinking session will result in me staying drunk for multiple consecutive days followed by sweating, shaking and extreme anxiety when I sober up.

Over the past couple of months I have got in contact with alcohol support services and am receiving support however so far most of the meetings have been assessments/ introductions rather than actual advice/support. 

I have been sober for the past 3 weeks (apart from 1 pint of beer at a restaurant the first week). I know how dangerous drinking can be for me however there are also occasions I have been able to control it. 

However my main issue at the moment is that I'm supposed to be going to a music event at a bar tonight. I want to be able to see my friends so much as I haven't seen them for a couple of weeks and am so bored and lonely. I also love this event so much and really want to go. However, I am also being triggered hard by wanting to drink.

Earlier I was already formulating the plan in my head of how I would sneak a flask of whiskey in so I could drink more without spending money at the bar. On top of this I received some beers from an acquaintance who does not know about my issues with drinking, and was planning drinking these at a friend's house before the event. However I am aware this is the lifestyle I am trying to get away from, and has cost me so much of my money and mental wellbeing in the past!

What the hell do I do? I feel bored, empty and lonely sitting at home, but do not want to risk ruining my progress! Should I go out and just not drink? I have actually done this succesfully before a few times and even had a great time this way, but I am worried by the cravings I was having earlier when thinking about the night ahead. 

Any advice would be much appreciated!

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the input! I've decided that it would be a very bad idea for me to go to this event at this point in my recovery. I'm glad I posted here, and appreciate the support so much! Instead I'll be having a quiet night and going to a restaurant with some other friends. More importantly I will not drink with you tonight!",5

Qpr is up 1 goal in second half. Leeds make a great play to get in the box for a 1 v 1 with the goal keeper, some guy named kelly. Kelly makes an unnecessary foul, and gives up a penalty kick. From the crowd you hear a guy yell, “ kelly, you tossa” (toaster)

And I about spit out my coffee., oh and the guy missed the penalty kick. Too funny",4

Never drank through any pregnancies and have had plenty of times when I simply didn't want to drink. About a 18 months ago, without any particular change in life, I started daytime drinking. Coupled with the usual evening drinking. Within 3 months I was completely dependant. The withdrawals were horrendous so I continued to drink. Until my daughter called an ambulance and I had a controlled detox in hospital. On her 18th birthday. I don't understand how I got so ill so quickly. I've been attending AA for 6 months, with 2 relapses so far. I continue to be mystified as to why I continue to drink. I don't want to, everything is better when I don't, I have a lovely family, AA have been incredibly supportive and it makes sense not to. What on earth is wrong with me? Why do I still crave the oblivion of drink? Will I ever be myself again, or has that gone forever?",8

2020-01-18 09:29:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eqh0cb/disgusted_by_an_old_oprah_episode_on_moms_who/,Disgusted by an old Oprah episode on moms who drink,"Last night as I was trying to doze off to sleep, I was watching food prep and recipe videos on YT. An old episode of Oprah titled ""Moms Who Drink."" I thought, ""Hm. That's me."" I clicked on it. 

My heart broke for the first mom featured in this episode. She described the overwhelm that comes from having young children and having to be and do EVERYTHING for them. It's so easy as a mom for our cups to run dry (no drinking pun here). 

She cried talking about how hard it is to feel motivated to go to the park or make breakfasts or check homework. I love my kids and I love being a mom, but I think it's also extremely boring at times. We have minds and ideas and gifts and talents, and in many cases, we shelve those things for a season while we are raising kids. It can be a bit mind-numbing to argue with a 7 year old that 8-6 is NOT 6 for the hundredth time. 

I related to her struggles so deeply. I saw that she cares a lot. That perfectionism plays a big role in drinking for a lot of moms as well. ""I'm not good enough just as I am, but buzzed me is more patient and more fun and more relaxed."" That's the lie we tell ourselves anyway. 

After this poor woman shared her heart, Oprah and some ""psychologist"" laid into her. They piled guilt upon guilt upon guilt. ""If you think your kids don't notice, you're lying to yourself!"" ""Your children deserve better!"" ""What kind of mother drinks a beer while cooking dinner!!"" It was terrible. They kept drilling her about her disease and her weakness and her failures. 

All I could think is: Why aren't you telling this poor woman that she's not alone?? That alcohol is an addictive substance, and if anyone drinks it enough, for long enough, they'll get addicted to it? (If you haven't read This Naked Mind yet, drop everything now and go read it). There are a thousand things I would say to her, but most importantly, I would say: you aren't a terrible mom. You need to quit drinking FOR YOU. 

Enough guilting about ""what will your children think???"" And ""do you know how many adult children of alcoholics are in therapy right now in America??"" 

Stop it! 

I can't stop drinking for anyone but me. I should not stop for anyone but me. You should stop for YOU. 

Your kids matter and your marriage matters and your job matters, but above all, YOU matter. You are worth the change. I'm worth the change. 

Quitting drinking will have a wonderful trickle-down effect on all of those other things. But I wish someone told her, and to all the thousands of other women watching that program nearly 20 years ago, struggling in silence, you are worth it. You aren't worthless.

Edit: thanks for the silver, and thanks for all of the awesome feedback. I'm seeing here that I really am not alone!",838

I was just wondering if its normal / common to feel little to no emotion in the early stages of the quitting process? I'm not depressed at all or anything, I just have a very limited range of emotions is all. Before I'd get excited / anxious / enthusiastic easily, but I'd also have a short fuse with certain things so to speak. Now, I have little to no anxiety, hardly ever get frustrated or angry, but the excitement / enthusiasm is gone too for the most part. I still have interest in things I did before (programming, learning Japanese), and I still do both daily, but I'm no where near as interested in them as I was. Maybe this is depression and I just don't know it? I've always associated depression with feeling sad and uninterested in anything, but neither apply to me currently. It's definitely not a side effect from anything else, as I don't take any medication. Overall, even if this is ""depression"", I'd rather go through this than the hell I was putting myself through before. In any case, thank you for reading this and for the possible replies. IWNDWYT",4

I told myself to get real and smarten up, I think I was just looking for a reason to buy some kind of close.

Last night was a typical situation for me, life was going great, I’d had a good week at work and was out with one of my best friends and the guy I (was) dating. 

About 10 pints and a few shots later I saw the guy I was dating talking to a girl we both knew and who was happily married to a woman, however drunk me didn’t register any of this information. 

Drunk me thought it was a wonderful idea to push him, threaten her and rant and scream to anyone who would listen. I am normally such a kind and loving person but whenever I’m too happy I use alcohol to self destruct and I honestly wish I had any idea why. Tonight was meant to be a date at the cinema and getting some pizza, and now he says he never wants to speak to me again. 

The worst part is the self destructing/alcohol loving part of my brain is already suggesting a drink tonight would help push the problem away for a day, but I can’t keep doing this

Let's say I averaged 6 hours a day drinking. Some days I started earlier and some days I didn't get home until later, but I was almost always drunk between 6pm and 12am. That's 6 hours of numbing during which I couldn't reasonably do anything I cared about.

6 hours a day\*365 days a year=2,190 hours. Divide that by 24 hours a day and... holy shit, it's 91 DAYS!? THREE ENTIRE FUCKING MONTHS?

No wonder I felt like 2019 was longer than usual --- it actually was! No wonder I often find myself realizing that something I thought happened 2 weeks ago was actually on, like, Tuesday!

After having my two kids I've always been around 140-150, but the last couple of months I've really put on weight. I watch what I eat, started working out resently, and I'm also in the USAF so I'm on my feet all day. I've never been this heavy and it's really depressing. Even when I was drinking everyday I wasn't this weight. I do have mental health problems that I take daily medication for. I fractured my foot so I'm unable to run rn.

We should learn from the past but NOT dwell about it & we should be confident in our future lives because alcohol and everything negative that comes with it will be gone.

The night will give you a horizon

You must learn one thing.  
The world was made to be free in.

Give up all the other worlds

I started drinking heavily in college two years ago. I always knew that I needed to stop, and I have been clean for a bit now. However, that urge keeps on coming. Hard. Too hard some days. I gave in once or twice in the past two months. That feeling came again recently, and I fully intended on giving in today or tomorrow. 

This morning, on a whim, I decided to search up casting for this TV show that really spoke to me. This morning, they announced that they were casting for new roles. Now, I am not the most attractive person or in good shape. I am not even a good actor, so I do not have high hopes. I know I most likely will not get the role, but the hell if I don't try.

It sounds dumb, but whenever I wanted something growing up, I used to make a deal with God. I would give up something that was considered ""bad""  or ""a sin"" in my religion in exchange for whatever I wanted at the time. Additionally, I would pray every single day for that thing. Whenever I did this, I would get what I wanted. 

One of the things I constantly prayed for was to become an actor. I have no idea why, but that was my biggest dream as a kid. Looking back, I think that it was the only long-term goal that I used to pray for. By the time I was in my senior year of high school, I still kind of wanted to be one, but I never pursued it seriously. At this point, I was not really religious at all. I am still not. I don't really know what I believe in honestly.

The feeling of how much I want this reminded me of my little deals with God, and I think I might make another one. No drinking starting today in exchange for the part. 

I know I will not get it, but at least it will give me motivation for now.

Feels impossible to resist.,"Edit: Apparently I looked at the calendar wrong when I made this post. 9 days not 10 :(

I’ve always been a binge drinker. Never thought I had a problem until pretty recently. Looking back on things WOW. Alcohol messed up a lot of things in my life. I wasn’t a daily drinker. I could pass it up. Unless I started and then I could never stop. Went through some pretty horrible abuse by my alcoholic ex a little over a year ago. And somehow I managed to get my whole life together and pick up the pieces very quickly. Barely ever drank. Got my own car and place to live. Did fun things with my son every weekend. And then something happened in the summer and I turned to alcohol every single day. Even in the mornings. I would drink a Mickey of vodka at least everyday and sometimes throw a bottle of wine in there with it. Sometimes I would just grab a 26er and tell myself it was for the whole weekend but I would just about finish the whole thing in one night and finish whatever was left in the morning. I lost a lot of weight since the summer. I would have times where I would miss work and binge for days without eating anything. 

So I decided enough is enough. I decided that I was done. And I’ve been feeling good. Usually can’t get past day 3 (I haven’t tried all that hard). So here I am on day 10. One thing I am struggling with is weight. I was close to 170 pounds (5’5” female) in the summer and I got down to 128. As soon as I stopped drinking I started eating again. And within two days I had put five pounds back on. I was not happy with that at all. So stupid me goes out and gets ephedrine (because I still want to have no appetite just like when I was drinking—-and yes I take way more than I am supposed to). I feel like without it I would have put weight back on and went back to drinking so I don’t know what the right answer is. Four days of taking ephedrine and I am now at 127 which makes me happy (although I have stomach bloat now which I didn’t have when I was drinking). 


tested my urine and I had high urobilinogens after a night of binging which also partly led me to decide to stop once and for all. 

But today I just want to get in my car and drive to the store. I don’t have to work tomorrow. I have nothing to do tonight which makes it more difficult. I’ve been finding lots of things to do to keep myself busy so far but sitting at home is hard. I can’t afford to keep spending the way I have been just to stay busy. Family isn’t around tonight. It seems like it would just be so easy to go get a bottle. I didn’t have withdrawals (not sure how-I never have). I know I don’t need it. But I want it. I keep telling myself if I could do it for ten days I could do it again. Maybe I could just become a casual drinker on weekends (clearly lying to myself). The struggle is real.",3

I’ve recently come to terms with the fact that I have a problem with alcohol. This was a slow, painful realization because I don’t consider myself an alcoholic based on the fact that I don’t “need” to drink. My consumption is usually no more than a few social drinks in a weekend, usually not binging. 

Here’s the problem - when I drink too much, I get very irrationally angry. It’s driving loved ones away. And although it’s not every time and even though it’s far and few in between, it is still heartbreaking enough on myself and my loved ones. I tried limiting consumption but it seems that my tolerance is so unpredictable that doesn’t help either. 

So, I’ve decided to stop drinking. 
Here’s my question - I have reason to believe this is due to unresolved emotional pain. I have ideas what they could be although I don’t know how to solve them. Not drinking is definitely a good start, but it doesn’t address the underlying issues. 

How have you addressed the underlying issues when your problem with alcohol is linked to something more but you’re not sure what?",11

The horrid nightmares that came as my sleep cycles worked to normalize..  And those awful, awful urges (beyond mere cravings, but *urges*!) to just take a drink and trade this nearly-unbearable temporary anguish for a seemingly more attractive and manageable future anguish.

I sometimes still dream that a drink finds its way into my hands--it's very seldom, but it still happens--and I wake up *absolutely pissed* at myself.  That anger is quickly subsided by the on-setting realization that I don't actually have to go through those withdrawals again.  But it leaves me shaken to my core that even 4500 days later, something deep within my subconscious allows me to take that drink in my dreams.  I need to be shaken to my core from time to time, or I fear I am going to forget.

I have so much respect and admiration for those of you who have taken the first steps on this journey.  When I see someone with 7 days.. 14 days... 30 days, I'm blown away witnessing the amount of strength it takes to be there.  I simply couldn't do it at this point.  I don't have the strength left in me to pull a Day 30 again.  It would absolutely break me.

But look at you!  Beast-moding the *fuck* out of some sobriety!  The real MVPs!  I promise if you just keep taking it one day at a time, those days are coming.  You can't stop them.  And they're coming whether you're drinking or sober.  So don't get discouraged looking too far ahead.  You can't tackle 100 days all at once, but you can tackle the only one that really matters.  Today.

I look unkempt, dishevelled and tired although I am smiling (kind-of). Seeing it made me go into a kind of panic then all of a sudden I had an incredibly strong urge to drink.

I was pacing around in my room, having a conversation with myself saying:  
""should I?""  
""no""  
""but who cares, everyone has seen that photo now""  
""why are you thinking this way""  
""ok the store will close in 30mins, you can make it there in time""  
""are you serious, 77 days and you're going to ruin it over a photo?""  


As you can see, I was barely thinking straight until I saw a photo posted on Instagram.  
It was Gary Vee, standing in the middle of a busy footpath holding a sign that read, ""Stop f\*\*\*ing caring what other people think of you"".

Once I saw that I immediately calmed down. By that moment, I was able to think clearer and that's when I told myself to just go to sleep. So I did.

Waking up this morning, I don't have the urge to drink anymore putting me at day 78. It's made me realise, I need to keep learning how to handle, cope and deal with my anxiety and situations like this.

But I do.,"I’m a 21 year old girl and I’ve had a problem with drinking since I was 17. I started drinking when I was 16 after finding myself a good group of friends after being lonely for most of my years before that. We all started drinking and smoking at about the same time, but for me it was different because I would black out more often, puke more often and do more embarassing shitty things than other people. My alcohol problem heightened after getting dumped for the first time and using alcohol as my main coping mechanism. Years passed and things kept getting worse.

I mostly use alcohol because I’m shy quiet and awkward when sober. I find that I’m more interesting when I drink and that people like me more. But after I go over my limit I start doing embarassing and shitty things and people start hating me. Then in the mornings I wake up with the worst case of anxiety, thinking about all the bad stuff I said and did, feeling fucking guilty and gross.

My lowest point was when I got banned from entering into a club/pub that I had been to the night before because of my behaviour the night before. I still have no idea what I did that night.
I’m a 5’2 small girl and no one would expect me to do the shit that I do and that makes it so much worse.

Ever since the ban I haven’t blacked out not even once. It’s been a little over a year since then and I’ve kept drinking at the same rate as before but without any blackouts. I still do embarassing things but I remember them clearly the next day. I still have no fucking clue how I managed that. The pain and shame from that ban really was a wake up call for me but it didn’t make me stop drinking, it just made me a little more aware. And I’ve kept on drinking because I feel like it is okay because now I am sorta in control of it. But I am not, I never am.

The thing is on my last two instances of drunkness I found myself slipping a little. And I am scared that I’ll go back to blacking out. In the past year I have actually stopped getting hangovers (or if i do they are manageable), i am able to drink on a Tuesday and be up and productive at uni on Wednesday, i am not puking only rarely. I have actually started bragging to people about how well I am drinking and actually scolding one of my best friends about her drinking because she’s also a messy drunk on one instance. Little did I know that I was basically bragging about being a functioning alcoholic. 

I want to quit but I am scared because my social life depends on alcohol. The only time I go out with the (very few) friends I have now is to drink. There’s a huge drinking culture where I am from and it is unavoidable, but I want to try. I want to stop hating myself, stop turning into a whole other person when I drink, stop going to shitty pubs and talking to people I wouldn’t normally associate myself to when sober (and when I say that I don’t mean alcoholics).

I said my social life depends on alcohol and it is true and that makes me so sad. Before drinking, at 15 I would stay inside all day reading and writing and dreaming of having a social life. Now I hardly read or write and the social life is not that great (it had its moments I admit but lately I’ve found not even alcohol can help and yet... if I am bored on a night out I drink even more to make it more fun). I feel like I wasted so much time of my life because of how much drinking I did but I also feel like drinking brought me so many experiences and I have met so many people through it, so I don’t know... I feel like I am thinking of quitting so late because I know I have had a problem for so long and yet I also feel ashamed that at 21 when a lot of people only then start drinking, I feel like I need to say: “i have a problem, I need to quit”. I hate myself for starting to drink but how could I have known at 16 that I would end up having this relationship with it.

I’m writing this at night and I still feel ashamed and anxious from the night before when I went drinking. Not hungover but I am going through every little thing I said and did last night, analyzing them and feeling so so shitty. For example now I feel embarassed about some things I said to a taxi driver. And i am sure he has heard worse from drunk people but I am so embarrassed about the whole thing I feel like puking. I always feel like I need to quit when I am like this, but on days when I am sober and haven’t drank for a few days I think I am fine and totally forget how real my problem is. And I wrote this whole thing on here because this time I dont want to forget.

So dear people of reddit, i need your advice. Please help me and please tell me what worked best for you. I dont think I can quit cold turkey. I have tried that with ciggarettes and it didnt work. Now i only smoke when I am drinking...",18

As I get farther away from the first day of sobriety, I've found my mind wandering toward whether I want to make sobriety a ""forever"" choice. I've been ruminating on the idea and I've come to the conclusion that the belief that I'll be able to drink in moderation or just for special occasions is just a way of my mind tricking me into reducing the finality of quitting. 

Do I want to be able to have a drink at a friends wedding? Yes!

I reset my counter with joy and clarity.,"Last week I finally felt completely ready and excited to leave alcohol (thanks to this subreddit <3) and had the most amazing sober week, not having a drink in over 6 days which was the longest streak I'd had in years, and truly not missing alcohol at all.

I'd bought tickets for my first fancy ballet gala months ago and watched it approach with apprehension. There were two factors I knew would make drinking incredibly tempting:

* Open bar. Always have to take advantage of open bar, right?
* Being in a large group of mostly strangers. I knew two people from high school but we're not very close, and I'm introverted. I was worried I'd be too socially anxious.

And so, going in, I decided that my focus of the night would be **awareness**, not **abstinence**. I didn't want to torture myself if I did end up drinking, but I also didn't want to fall into my same old patterns. I made a mental decision tree for myself if I did decide to drink:

* How are you feeling?
* Why do you feel like drinking?
* What does ""feeling like drinking"" _feel_ like?
* What about your situation is making you feel that way?
* Does it really have anything to do with alcohol?
* What do you assume drinking will do to change the situation?
* What else could you do to change the situation?
* If you can't change the situation, can you leave and find another? Who is forcing you to stay?
* If you do drink, how does it taste?
* How does your body feel now? How about your mind?
* Did the drink change the situation in any way? **Or is the situation the same, and you are now duller, less aware, and less capable and fixing it for real?**

****

At the start of the night, what struck me most was how much I _wasn't_ tempted to drink. It's a Hunger Games-esque sight to see hundreds of people pushing past each other in ball gowns and tuxes, clambering for a free glass of wine, standing in long lines looking morose and impatient until that first ""cheers!"" puts a smile on their face that quickly disappears. It didn't bother me that I was in a huge group of mostly strangers - in fact this introvert felt happy and confident. If anything, I wished that everyone else wasn't so obsessed with getting their next drink and taking pictures so we could have a conversation!

When I did decide to drink, _none of the reasons I anticipated pushing me to drink were right_.

I'm not proud of this, but I stood in that line, got that wine, and ""cheers!""-ed not because _I_ was craving alcohol, or because _I_ felt shy, but because my _friends_ weren't having fun and wanted to drink, and I wanted to help improve the overall mood by engaging in the drinking ritual with all of them instead of being the sober bummer. (Also holy fuckin hell, my feet hurt.) I probably could've achieved the same effect by ""cheers!""-ing and tossing the drink over my shoulder.

Sure enough, after that first drink, I felt lethargic and dull, and was having pretty much the same amount of not-fun that I was already having. Successive drinks didn't improve this - after three glasses, I went home and didn't drop by the liquor store on the way back.

That said, it did help with the feet pain.

****

What I find most silly about my decision is that there was almost non-existent peer pressure. If anything I ""peer pressured"" myself by assuming that my opting out of a drink would make someone else unhappy - which, even if it did, is a piss-poor reason to start doing something I hate again. In fact what ended up happening is that _while_ tipsy, I _did_ make someone unhappy. I told my friend that I didn't think this kind of event was for me, and she got defensive. Not-so productive tipsy conversation ensued.

Still, at least this felt like a **decision**, not the satisfying of a craving. And now, with the slightest bit of a headache, I feel even more resolve to cut drinking from my life and continue to be true to how I'm feeling in any given moment. Counter reset with some regret, but mostly joy and clarity.

I came to (still in the dream) to my friends informing me that I had blacked out, how embarrassing my actions had been, and all the chaos I had caused.

I woke up in a cold sweat, and it took me a few moment to realize that I am almost a month sober today. It's somewhat telling that my former frequent blackouts have reached nightmare status in my own mind, that my waking brain is so set in my resolve to never treat myself like that again that my subconscious has to resort to taunting me while I sleep.

Blacking out was a waking nightmare while I was letting it happen every weekend that I went out. Although it's still a nightmare, thankfully it is only in my head.

I decided to taper, and boy, it sure felt weird stepping away before I even had a buzz, but I did it.


It was  6am when I finally fell asleep, the anxiety kept me awake. Detoxing never fails to do this fun thing where I get a panick attack right as I’m falling asleep. It always makes me think I’m dying. I laid there last night, heart racing, chest tight wondering if it was the end.  

Pulling myself out of bed today was hard, I wanted to just go back to sleep and stay in bed all day. but I have things to do and forced myself out of bed. The anxiety hasn’t hit me full force yet today, but it’s there. My body fucking hurts, I guess it’s from being tense. I feel like shit and it sucks knowing this isn’t the worst of it yet. 


It’s weird going through this so quietly. I’ve hid this part of me very well. Last time I was back home my family even talked about how I “didn’t drink”, and one time when I got a cocktail while out with my dad he warned me of the dangers of alcohol, and reminded me of how heavily addiction ran in our family. I was of course just like “I know I’ll be careful” as if I hadn’t already become an addict.

The old timers are right. I spent a year reading their stories on this sub before jumping in, and it’s true, there is peace with the hard work it takes to get through the first hump. To anyone suffering out there, and if you’re at 30 drinks a day like I was, I can’t recommend rehab, meditation and therapy enough.

I was deep in the trenches of alcoholism from 20-21. I was routinely blacking out and waking up not remembering the night or how I got back. I would wake up in my clothes *drenched* in sweat. Sweat from alcohol withdrawal...

I'd be so weak that I had to sleep the whole day, and *then* recover by 10pm so that I'd go out and party. Rinse and repeat. I let people treat me like shit. 

It culminated in an existential crisis, which I'm thankful to have overcome. The traumatic 'flashbacks' that people refer to are now fully gone. I'm happier, I'm healthier and I love myself more.

But how did I do it? Well, it's interesting. I stumbled across as a Jordan Peterson video on addiction, and he said something profound. He said that you need an idea of a **personal ""hell""** of sorts. Something so terrifying, that you just *can't* go back. 

My hell was the despair of nihilism. Alcoholism intensified that meaninglesnes by a lot. I knew that if I drank again, I would lose everything, including my mind. It wasn't worth it.

Every time i even considered it, I'd remember the days of waking up fragile and weak, in the clutches of terror. It wasn't worth it. 

Of course exercise helped, so did therapy. But it was that personal hell which acted as a negative motivation of sorts. I can go to bars and clubs and still not be tempted to drink. And I credit it mainly due to that.

Last night I stayed up drinking until 5am, mindlessly watching TV and only staying awake because ""I have a few more beers to finish"". Then I fell asleep on the couch. After a few hours of restless sleep and crazy/scary dreams I woke up feeling like shit, with an upset stomach. 

I am now 28 and the past 12 years I have spent way too much time getting drunk almost every night of the week. I have had two  big periods of sobriety, one for over 6 months about 4 years ago, and one of about 4 months, early 2019. When going on a solo working adventure to Corfu in June, so without my friends and family around me, I tried moderate drinking again. Which pretty soon led me down the spiral again. Ever since August I have been trying again to stay sober but not even reaching a streak longer than five days. 

I have had enough. The last months I created even an additional problem, losing quite a lot money after drunk gambling. 

More than ever I want to quit, but also more than I ever I can't imagine never drinking again. 

I wish I was allready back to day 67 or whatever day far in the future, where being sober is my reality, instead of a destination. Where the first weeks of withdrawal are over. Where the first opportunities to give up on not drinking are allready far behind me. Where I am used to not drinking. Where the urges have become much less frequent and much less powerful and much shorter. Where the people around me don't expect me to be drinking anymore. 

I want to feel energized again. I want to feel in charge of myself again, making good decisions. Achieving goals. Working out and living healthy and consciously. 

It may seem stupid, but I want to 'brag' to my friends and on social media. 'Look at me, sober for a year. Look at how much I've changed. From being a fat drunk without any discipline to a ripped physique and a sharp mind.'.

It talked about the idea that one doesn't necessarily need to have drinking challenges to stop drinking. I've worked to control my drinking the past several years and feel like I've been reasonably successful but lately it just hasn't felt _right_. Like just some sort of vague tired unfocused feeling after. I don't like it. So I've reset the badge and giving abstinence another go. You all give me the motivation and inspiration now I need to commit and do it. I am thankful to everyone in this sub for sharing their journey. (Thanks for being here to read my rambling.),3

Said something to the effect of:

“Something bad didn’t happen every time I drank, but every time something bad happened I was drinking.”

This is very much the reason I’ve decided to quit. Sometimes it was fun and I had a great time getting drunk, but then there’s the nights that my husband and I would scream at each other at 4am and say so many hateful things we’d have to apologize for in the morning. 

I need the fun without the anger and I think the only way to get there is without the drinking.

I never socialise with people at work as I feel I've already lost too much of my life in bars and clubs. But suppose its blown up in my face.

Everyday I’ve had terrible cravings and have been romanticizing like a mf. I have a therapy appointment on Tuesday and am hoping I can last until then. I’ve been trying to take it one day at a time and have just been stuffing my face with food or exercising constantly to just distract myself. Just need to make it through today plus 4 days to get to therapy.,1
2020-01-17 08:28:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eq0czy/90_days_90_freaking_days/,90 days.... 90 FREAKING DAYS!!!!,"90 days ago.... 90 days seemed impossible.  
90 days ago I was a mess. 90 days ago was day one.... but there were SO MANY day ones before that, that I didn't even really believe myself anymore.  
  
And yet, here I am. And it is SO MUCH BETTER. No, it's not perfect. My life didn't get amazing over night. I feel like I have a LOT of work to do emotionally... and physically too I guess (the weight has NOT magically started coming off hahaha).  
  
Here's what's good:  
  
1) I sleep amazing. I was exhausted ALL the time before. I thought it was just part of being a mom to a young kid. I thought I was still trying to ""catch up"" on sleep from when my daughter was an infant. NOPE!!!! Within the first two weeks, I realized I was just chronically sleep deprived due to alcohol.   
  
2) Anxiety - I have some generalized anxiety, which has definitely quieted.... but I have (or thought I had) SEVERE driving related anxiety in the winter, due to a traumatic accident 12 years ago. While this isn't completely GONE, I now know it was HUGELY amplified by alcohol/being hungover. I still feel a bit nervous when conditions are bad, but not even CLOSE to what I was experiencing before.  
  
3) I signed the lease yesterday for my first OWN place. I'm 34. I moved out of home when I was 18, and I have lived a lot of places and with a lot of people over the years.... but I have NEVER lived by myself. I've always had roommates or a boyfriend.  
  
My daughter's dad (also an alcoholic) and I have been separated and living together since MAY (stuck in a lease) so.... getting to the actual separation part is, in itself an AMAZING THING and feeling great... but having our OWN place, that's just mine and my daughter's, is going to be INCREDIBLE. And something I probably wouldn't have done if I were still drinking.  
  
4) I'm more productive than ever, and yet feel like there's not enough time for all that I want to accomplish!!!! I used to start drinking between 4-5PM most days. Then the rest of evening would likely be spent staring at my phone, minus cooking supper and putting my daughter to bed. I'd endlessly browse facebook, or play stupid games for hours. Sometimes I'd watch TV, but I didn't really like to, because I'd often forgot what I watched and need to watch it over again anyway.  
  
Now, I took Facebook off my phone, deleted all my games... I haven't really watched anything on TV in weeks. I do a lot of reading. A lot of PLANNING (budgeting, meal planning... lists of books to read in the future lol). But it's often like ""oh shit. It's 10:30 already!!! Where did the day go?""   
  
5) Bedtime/patience with my daughter - This is probably one of the biggest differences that I appreciate. I think a lot of parents dread bedtime.... it drags out, and there's often things you need/want to get done. That's your ""you"" time. But this is so much worse when you're drinking.... because often you've already started drinking, and your drink is sitting there waiting for you, and every second you're sitting/laying away from your drink, your irritation is growing.  
  
I don't miss that. I'm not perfect. There are still some days where I want to get the hell out of there and ""get on"" with my evening. But I definitely feel a lot more relaxed about it now and i HOPE and SENSE that my daughter notices the difference as well, and when I AM irritated, that I'm better at hiding it than I was when there was a big glass of vodka on the other side of the door.  
  
6) Thoughts about drinking - this has now quieted substantially as well. I still THINK about alcohol every day, but I don't think about DRINKING alcohol... if that makes sense? Like I'm not debating ""should I or shouldn't i?"". It's not really a question any more. This question now only arises if I'm feeling specifically triggered, and the time between these moments seems to be growing. My thoughts about alcohol are now mostly how alcohol relates to ""my old life"" or mostly just negative stuff (like seeing my ex drinking... doesn't make me want to drink, it makes me feel judgmental and annoyed).  
  
Anyway... now that I've written a short novel, I'm going to get ready for the day, but I'm just really excited and happy and wanted to share!!!  
  
I remember hanging out here for SOOO long, and I just couldn't string more than 2-3 days together at a time. I used to look at all the little numbers besides people's names.... 14, 23, 55, etc. and I just kept telling myself ""I just need to get that number up. I just need to get a bit of time and really SEE what it's like"". And it was true. Once that number started growing and growing... it gave me something to go off of.

I feel for my mate because even though hes putting on a brave face you can see that he is scared.  I know he will be fine and nothing will come of it but it reminds me of when I was drinking heavily a year ago..

I was drinking every night after work, driving to work the next day with the booze still in my system easily over the limit, hungover to death, not spending time with my family. I would get so drunk and think I'm 10 men and start being cheeky to people and just generally being a dick. Luckily, I never got into a situation where I was receiving death threats, but it could have easily happened and probably would have if I carried on the way I was. It just takes that one wrong person to say something to even if you think you're being funny and think it's a joke, it's not.

I am so pleased I'm not that guy anymore and dont have the horrible paranoia of waking up and thinking who have I pissed off now? I was so paranoid, anxious and depressed. I was pushing my family and friends away. I kept saying to myself ""no one cares about me"", ""I feel alone"". When in reality, everyone cared so much about me, all they wanted was me to get better but I just couldn't see that I had a problem. I look back now and can see it was all just excuses so I could go to the pub and get pissed.

If there are other people like me on here who have a tenancy to say things to the wrong people when they've had a drink, and are having cravings and feel like having a drink this weekend. Try your best not to pick it up! You never know who you might come across and what might happen. Dont take life for granted and be grateful for what you do have in your life.

I know I've rambled on a bit but I just think to myself, if I go and get pissed and say something to the wrong person what's gonna happen to me? What's gonna happen to my girlfriend and son if something happens to me?

I want to keep that feeling away so I continue drinking and then faster when it starts to come back. She doesn't seem to understand yet.

This morning my youngest is sick again and is going to be home with me which means no gym and my routine is going to be out of whack along with trying to get what I want done for work. That is already stressing me and making me anxious.

On top of that my oldest had a fit because the youngest is staying home and started fighting with my wife ending with her leaving the house slamming the door so I had to take her to school and followed up with a barrage of angry texts.

And my wife is going out after work tonight as well so I'll be getting the kids to bed.

This comes after almost 20 years of addiction, in which I lost everything from friends to jobs to more days and nights than I care to even attempt to count. One year ago yesterday, I went into an all out rage while drunk and nearly destroyed both my house and my relationship with my wife. That was the last time I ever drank. People say you have to hit rock bottom before you can start to recover. Regardless of whether I believe that to be 100% true in all cases, nobody ever said rock bottom has to be a single event. I was scraping along the valley floor for years, it just took a moment of realizing where I had been all this time to convince me I had strayed too far from any semblance of stability and rationality.

I was diagnosed bipolar many years ago and can honestly say that in the beginning, I chose substances over getting external help. That was my first step on a path along which I would leave in my wake chaos and ruin. When I finally got sober, I began seeing a psychiatrist and therapist. I have come so far in the past year that it is genuinely unbelievable. I think I have worked around my largest previous mistake this way. If I wanted to get sober and stay sober, I needed to address the problems that were making it especially difficult to stay sober. The gestalt must be addressed if the parts are to be mended.

Well, that's a synopsis of my story thus far. I tried not to be too long-winded, but I can't always help that, it seems. It has been a great year full of recovery and growth. I look forward to many more and wish you all as many as I plan to have. Have a great day, stay strong and thank you for taking a few minutes to read my post.",149

My only solution that I can see is to go cold turkey. I’ve got no real risk of withdrawals as I don’t drink every day. I’ve tried moderation before but I seriously don’t have an off switch. 

Drinking is only one part of my issues at the moment and is problem just masking the deeper shit so I’m also working on all of that too. But the obvious quick action to take is to swear of booze forever. Not even one drink.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I decided to quit. I’m tapering, and I will have my final drink Tuesday night. 


Well, now I’m laying in bed and thinking about not drinking. I’m thinking about how long forever is, especially at 23. I have a lot of years of not drinking ahead of me, it makes it seem impossible. That’s such a long time to not slip up, and it’s a long time to feel like I’m missing out. It’s so dumb but I feel like quitting is like wearing a scarlet letter that just screams “this person used to be an alcoholic!!!”. And I’m embaressed, I don’t want people to look at me different when I’m like “I’m sober now” . I also am afraid I won’t enjoy hardcore/punk shows anymore, the last show I went to was at a sober venue and I really didn’t have as much fun and craved beer the entire time. All these things I’m giving up just keep running through my head. 


The weight of all this is just crushing me right now, and I’m so close to just having a massive panick attack.  I’m so overwhelmed and so lost. No one really knows about this, and none of my friends have been there anyways, they all drink. I’m doing this shit myself normally that works for me, but it’s not with this. I feel scared and I feel like I’m just walking blindly into this. I’m scared",8

And a story of dignity,"When we find ourselves sprawling at some sort of rock bottom, it´s easy to allow that low point to define us. We failed big time, right? More than most, right? A special kind of low, found and claimed by us.

I heard an excerpt from a TED talk the other day, featuring the award-winning Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Talking about how one story can come to define us, she said,

«The consequence of the single story is this: It robs people of dignity. It makes our recognition of our equal humanity difficult. It emphasises how we are different rather than how we are similar. Stories matter. Many stories matter. Stories have been used to dispossess and to malign, but stories can also be used to empower and to humanize. Stories can break the dignity of a people, but stories can also repair that broken dignity.»

This really resounds with how I speak about my sobriety. There is no one single story that can contain me and my life. A multitude of stories come together, creating a complex and vibrant narrative. I could have told a story about rock bottom, failure, loss and despair, but no, my story is really about a turning point, a fight that has turned into a journey. It´s about victory and freedom, stars in the sky and the warm morning sun on the horizon. I like that story a lot better, and, it *is* my story, being written as we speak.

I won´t let anyone think less of me for having a problem. I will be proud for handling it. I will not drink with you today!",58

Day 16 of sobriety. 

I made it to 210+ last year, when I decided in March that I could moderately drink and be okay. And this is now the longest I’ve gone without drinking since that day so clearly that worked really well ;) 

Cravings are improving, though I’ve picked up a wicked diet soda/sparkling water habit in the evenings when I do want to drink my day away. I figure that’ll be and easier issue to address later on and fade out of that habit. 

I have been so stressed and overwhelmed dealing with life that my period skipped this month entirely. I’m certain I’m not pregnant (went in for bloodwork), so this just shows me the shit my body is enduring right now as I adjust to sobriety, emotions, and life. I’m so glad I’m done drinking and need to remember this hell when I think about doing it again.

I drank more than usual on NYE, and drank more frequently than usual the two weeks beforehand.

And that brings me to my current struggle...
The anxiety came Monday. I couldn’t drink Monday night, and I was angry and anxious about it, but eventually moved on. Tuesday the anxiety was severe, I have OCD and anxiety, so I’m used to that shit, but I was experiencing anxiety levels that I didn’t experience when I was at my worst, and my worst was pretty ugly. I drank Tuesday night, and it calmed me completely. Wednesday was the same deal. Today has been the worst, I feel like I’ve been having waves of panick attacks all day. I’m completely falling a part. I’ve never experienced anxiety like this, even during some dark periods of my life. Nothing is even going on to make me anxious. I’m questioning if the alcohol could be the culprit, does anyone have any in site on that?

I was out at a work conference and did really well for the first two days despite all the vendors giving us free alcohol. 

Wednesday rolls around and I haven’t eaten anything, it’s 6pm and all the vendors are talking to us dying to get us to buy their products and services.

I started to crave it a little since I used to not eat all day, then once I got home from work 4-6 beers would hit me like a train. So there was some psychology involved in it I think.

Anyway I had 2, then 2 more, then 2 more and before I knew it I was hammered.  I spent $50 on expensive hotel food that will be terrible for my waist line, ended up with the spins and getting sick, went to sleep feeling like a failure and woke up feeling even worse.

However I came to a conclusion today, I had no desire to drink again tonight. Last night only made my demons more visible and didn’t for a second increase my quality of life. After about my 3rd beer I started wishing I was sober because I didn’t like this feeling that I lacked control and the reality of what people were saying to me and that all my conversations were fake and severely lacked intelligence. 

I needed this set back. I know why I quit drinking now and I know that I had to go through this to understand why I was sober in the first place.

This sounds like a failure, but I’ve realized it was a much needed experience. I have lost the battle but not the war.

One of the guys who has been helping me is someone I’ve seen drinking beer in the square in the afternoon and waking out of the betting place. 

Mentally I wrote him off as a bit of a derelict(my own issues I know I know).

Yesterday I put some 8Os  music on when he came over to help and we were jamming out and talking about our cultures and how family, love , community, food and music was all we needed to be happy.

Then another guy came to pick him up to go paint a house . This is one of those freaks I’ve seen drinking a single beer at a party. He kept talking about money and asking me a dozen personal questions about my friend whose house they were going to paint. It was the second time I told him that money didn’t matter as long as “your heart is clean”. But no, he just kept at it.

Another maid from downstairs also dropped by in the morning with some post for me. She told me she doesn’t drink ages ago. But recently I found out she made up some stories and I now  think of her as a snake in the grass.

Just got me thinking that the first guy was actually a really nice person. He just has addiction issues like me.

I got no problem with not drinking anything for 2 to 3 days a week though and i never drink before or during work.

After work i feel fine sober. but something is itching me to get a beer after work. then i meet people in my bar and of one beer comes another and another. 

i believe its mostly a ""routine"", in my case at least, something, that i do without even thinking. 

plus im mostly afraid/bored with a life thats 100% sober. 

i know ive got an addictive side, which shows in most aspects of life, be it work (music), friends, sex, etc.

my main problem is: i cant start and i cant stop, no matter the thing im doing. this can be very fruitfull (does this word even exist?) or very self-destructive.

i take other drugs once in a while (mdma, coke, lsd mostly) but not on a regular base, meaning not more than once per 3-4 weeks.

I truly enjoy taking drugs (including alcohol obv),
but i feel that if i want to go on enjoying substances, i gotta make some pauses, otherwise they, esp. alcohol, interfere too much with every aspect in my life.

I know most people in this sub are either nothing or all, which i respect. i asked myself if there are also others who have an addictive personality and chose to have drugs in your live, but with moderation and how their routines and rules are..

i hope to get some discussion out of this, even though i know, this might not be the perfect sub for this questions.

many thx anyway for answering.",5

I had a Dr. checkup where I was given a report that I have officially returned to a state of full health wherein you can no longer tell that I spent at least a decade kicking myself in the metaphorical dick via beverages & 2. I fixed the towel bar! Ya see in my basement bathroom the towel bar above the throne was slightly bent from me leaning on it a cpl thousand times w/varying degrees of force tied entirely to varying degrees of BAC. I left it as a gentle reminder that even the stupidest random stuff gets squirrely when ya leave the tracks. It won’t shock anyone to now learn that the basement, where the towel bar is, is also where the BAR bar is. That bar is now perpetually stocked to the gills with every manner of Gatorade, fruit juice, and water known to man. Happening upon the bend in the towel bar had lately begun irritating me as something of a borderline ocd perfectionist and, while that’s not a particularly flattering description of a man, it does feel good to feel like myself again all of the time.

I am happy for the first time in 13 years, anxiety and depression are gone and everything around me is vibrant and full of life(despite it currently being below zero where I’m at)

There’s an insidious layer of judgment embedded in that word at times, hard to detect and yet.....phrases like

“I should just be able to do this,”

“it should be easier than this,”

“I should be over this by now,”  

“I should have done that other thing instead,”  

“I should know better” etc etc 

all seem to me to take away my ability to keep the perspective that life is hard, things are hard, I am trying - and while perhaps I can do better or will do better, I am just doing my best every day.

This comes up outside of my issues with alcohol as well, in all areas of life. Especially when I’m in a sober window, even for just a short time, all the sudden I have wild expectations for myself and SHOULD suddenly overnight be doing this or that, be better, yadda yadda. How about just focusing on the fact I’m recovering from 15 years of addiction and the havoc it wreaked? That’s a big fucking task already!! I don’t need the pressure or judgement, self!

Fuck. This idea has always been foreign to me. I had (and still have I guess) all these negative thoughts about myself. Thought I deserved to be miserable, especially when I drank.

Today was hard and tested me, but someone asked me, ""do you think someone can be happy even if those close to them are suffering""? And my response was yes, because they have a life of their own too.

And I kept mulling on that. And my sober mind realized that I was feeling so terrible because I felt like I didn't deserve to be happy because my family is struggling. 

But for the first time in my life, I'm seeing that maybe there's more to this life than hating yourself for just being you, and for being a alcoholic. I'm seeing that maybe there's a different future...maybe

As you can see my quitting journey has been up and down cause if I quit when I joined that’d make me almost 3 years sober. I tried to quit and failed so many times since then because I always found ways to convince myself that I can be normal and drink like a “normal” person. 

Obviously thats the biggest fucking lie alcoholism tells us and for me to make it this far this time it was acceptance. Accepting that I’ll never be able to drink again, and to make peace with that fact. The first few weeks were rough as the cravings were very bad and the bullshit rationalizations in my head were as well but now that I’m 100 days sober I can honestly say this is the best decision I have ever made in my life, and I’m so fuckin grateful I finally got my life together at a young age, as I’m only 24. I’ve never felt so free, I cried tears of joy the other night because I thought for years I’d be doomed to live and die as a drunk, and sometimes I hoped that I wouldn’t wake up from a drunken night because how hopeless My drinking problem made me feel. 

I’ve come a long way from drinking myself into oblivion every night and spending my weekends drinking from morning until whenever I passed out. I just wanted to express my gratitude to everyone in this sub who has inspired me and for the compassion you all have showed me in my posts over the years.

I’ve gone from not fully experiencing feelings about anything, to fully experiencing feelings about everything. I’d forgot what I was missing. I’d also forgot how impatient, high-strung and neurotic I could be... which I didn’t miss, but it’s worth it. 

Today I was driving behind a car that was a particular shade of blue, a color I’ve always LOVED. When I say love, I mean that seeing this color evokes emotion, nostalgia, JOY, within me. I felt all of that today for the first time I can remember in a very long time. I’m sure I’ve seen this very color countless times in the past 15 years, but I hadn’t so much as noticed it until today, thanks to my constant numbing. Seems inconsequential on the surface, I know, but I’m pretty sure these small events are what make me feel somehow connected to the rest of the universe.... like I’m “in” on what’s happening; it’s not just happening AROUND me. 

There’s big stuff too... like REALLY experiencing my husband’s love for me, and SEEING him.... seeing and feeling how deeply he loves me and being submerged in that love. What a shame to miss one drop of that in exchange for anything. I mean what else IS there to live for if not for LOVE? I’ve always LOGICALLY known how he feels about me, but I couldn’t quite absorb it, if that makes sense. I sound high, right? LOL being sober sometimes kinda feels like that, actually. 

And then of course there are allll the things I don’t want to feel, or remember. I think a big part of this for me is just learning to finally put my big girl pants on, at the age of 38, and accept that it sucks in here sometimes... but I just have to suck it up and keep it movin.  I’ve tried the other way, and the price is far too high.

I'm going to need some surgery (I'm terrified of needles, stitches, etc), my work hasn't been going all that well, and my dog suddenly got ill and had to be put down. I've been totally, completely, and utterly overwhelmed, and I went from having the occasional one to having a couple nights in a row of waking up with a mild hangover. 

But! I'm changing my approach now:

I'm not going to let myself feel guilty about it, and I'm not going to let it negate how well I was doing, as if that progress is somehow spoiled. Getting a flat tire doesn't mean you restart the road trip; you just get things back in order and keep moving.

I'm know as someone that likes to drink and have a great time amongst friends, family, and coworkers. And most of my friends, family and coworkers also like to drink and have a great time too. I work for an alcohol distributor. We drank in the office regularly and my friends and family know I always have events to suggest, alcohol to give away or deals to get them. My life feels centered around social drinking. But my ""social drinking"" usually turns into a full on rage-fit/black-out after I get home. It's something only my husband really knows. 4 days ago, finally, I'd had enough. We'd both had enough.

But I have two questions I'm struggling with. I've been sober for 4 days now and the comments from co-workers - ""We know Rachel will be knockin' em back with us Friday!"" or ""We've got left over 6-packs, give them to Rachel""-  are already starting to feel awkward. But I've tried once or twice to mention that I've stopped drinking and it's the loudest, biggest deal when I say it so that's really awkward too. My job doesn't require me to drink or try alcohol, so that's not the big deal. It just almost seems like my co-workers see my drinking as a personality trait of mine and they can't believe I'd ever give it up. Is it possible to shed that ""party girl"" title without telling every single person I quit drinking? 

Second question - what do I do now? That feels sort of pathetic to ask but with a life so centered around beer, wine and events, I feel like I don't know what to do with myself! Do I still go to events and attend work functions or is that just inviting trouble? Again, I'm not required to attend, I just don't have much of a life outside of it all.

It isn’t explicitly about [not] drinking but has really helped me understand cravings and addiction. So far, he talks about our “predicament” —we have a constant inner dialogue and identify that as being us, however it is not us. The more we can understand we are simply witnesses of our inner chatter, the easier it is to live peacefully. 

Has anyone else read this book? I’d love to discuss as I continue reading. I’ll leave my favorite quote from it so far:

“If you want to free yourself, you must first become conscious enough to understand your predicament. Then you must commit yourself to the inner work of freedom. You do this as though your life depended on it, because it does. As of right now, your life is not your own; it belongs to your inner roommate, the psyche. You have to take it back. Stand firm in the seat of the witness and release the hold that the habitual mind has on you. This is your life— reclaim it.”",10

The stories that some of you men & women have opened up and posted have been eye opening and motivating for me to completely put DOWN alcohol. I’ve already lost a lot from drinking (money, relationships, injuries, etc) however I will no longer spiral out of control. I will be in control of my own destiny with a sober mindset. I will set my goals high and I will not let anything negative get in my way. Once again, thanks to everyone in this community that has shared their stories.

I was flown from Boston to Florida for a program, got 40 days clean then and then gave up when my SO dumped me there in FL. 2010 I got 90 days at a rehab in TX. 2012 I got a full 6 months before hooking up and moving in with someone. 2014, different city in TX,  90 days inpatient and about 3 weeks outpatient before relapsing when my grandpa died and my SO dumped me. Let's see... 2014 got a dui in Colorado, so stuck in CO.  2015 got 45 days clean during inpatient.  Strung together 20 days in outpatient. 2016 I was hospitalized over and over and over. I lived in lots of sober houses. How many? What year did I stop counting trips to detox? Trips to the ER? 2017 I moved to a rural town for a special program, relapsed after 35 days but didn't got caught until later. They let me come back a second time and I managed a healthy 5 months before relapsing. Did 90 days inpatient and went back to the awesome program in the middle of nowhere. 
That was one year ago. 
I got back into college to finish my degree in Environmental science and currently habe a 4.0 gpa.  I take non-narcoticmeds for mental health, and I attend Lifering meetings and the occasional AA or NA.

Man, drinking sucks. I'm done with it. I started drinking when I was 16-ish (now 22) on New Year's Eve. It was pretty fun the first 2-3 years. I would discuss amongst my peers about drinking secretly, at school, or whenever. It was extremely fun and exciting. Started off doing shots, progressed to beer, then drinking straight from the bottle for fun. Wake up with a hangover, recover, move on. That was that. Until recently..

21st birthday hit and it was just any other birthday. I went out with family and friends, got trashed, woke up, had a good laugh. That was it. But with each pay check I was spending more and more on booze. Now, I want spending my entire paycheck but when you start spending more on booze then self-care or food... You get the picture. Well, it started going downhill for me when I lost interest in listening to my music (which I curated for YEARS), lost interest in videogames, or just getting destructive. Or worse, I started cutting myself because I was getting depression. I have numerous areas that I'm not proud of. 

But on the bright side, I'm slowly starting to recover from it and a friend of mine showed me this subreddit. So I figured I should share so people can see they aren't alone and neither am I.

I have a kid I need to worry about, I have my future I need to worry about. And liquor won't get in the way. I plan on being sober and start working out for myself.

I myself drank for a long time and finally found my way and no longer drink. Now I know for the most part alcoholics will always want a drink and may go to their graves sober but will always want a drink.
I was thinking of setting aside four days a year in which to get as drunk as I please and plan it so I am in a safe environment and never even have to leave the house for more booze. Plan some simple things like cooking and binge watching movies and listening to music that I remember from the bad old days of constant booze. Just four days a year, every year so I never have to have that nagging feeling of, damn, I can never have another drink. 
Does this sound like a bad idea? I know I will never go back to drinking every day because I'm too happy being sober but would this be a good way to celebrate year after year of sobriety? Just four days a year and then return to the real world again. Any comments?",2

Just now I checked the label compared to the bottle I had at home. The normal one I would use is Dayquil Severe, which is non-drowsy, alcohol free. The one I've got at my desk and have been taking pulls from for the last two days is Dayquil Severe+, which is fucking 10% booze!

No wonder I felt like crap yesterday! I distinctly remember thinking when I got home, that it felt like I'd been drinking all day, and how distinctly muted my thoughts and emotions were. Again, I chalked it up to just being sick and on meds, but holy hell- how can they sell something at 10% ABV without a liquor license? EFF!!! (I know, I'm just venting)

I'm not resetting my badge, because I know this wasn't intentional, but MAN, this makes me mad that I didn't think to check the label. I was so accustomed to having the alcohol free one, that a medicine with booze in it didn't even cross my mind as a possibility.",3

I have this friend who's both parents are alcoholics. He's always been drinking a bit too much in my opinion, even when I used to drink. We have been friends for 10 years now. 6 moths ago I help him out of an abusive relationship. One of the main factors I noticed it wasn't right was because he never left the house and no one ever saw him. At that time I lived 5 min from his girlfriends house where he at the time lived. When he dumped her, he moved back home to his mom. He's dad just left like 5 years ago.
Since then he started drinking every day. And I'm talking about 5-10 beers every day. I've had the ""talk"" with him saying I'm worried. Since my history I could tell pretty early he was developing an alcoholic behavior. Even if I noticed it very fast after he dumped his girlfriend and started ""living life again"" I still waited because maybe this was just what he needed.

After 4 months he decided he wanted to quit because he was completely broke and that was the main reason for being sober. He came to me and said this, I didn't force him to this or anything. He probably felt like I would support him, which I did. 
He said in the beginning of November he would drink until the first day of 2020. He broke that promise after 2 weeks and got even worse than before. Now he started lying where he was, when he was on the pub and when my girlfriend saw him when he first started drinking he told her ""don't tell him, I want to tell him myself"".

It's now been a pretty long time since this. I also said I never want to be with him if he drinks because with my history, I can't handle people being in this condition because I've been there myself and it's nothing I want to be close to ever again.

I went home to him the other day, and the two of us where just chilling at his place. He drank 5 beers that night and when he told me what he's been up to all week it was basically on the pub every day, but he suger coated the story like ""meeting with a friend"" - ""where?"" ""the pub [name]"".

What would you do in this situation? 
He's my best friend be he obviously don't plan to quit and I can't stand being with him when he drinks. And even if I say I only want to hang out with him if he's sober he still drinks when we meet and says stuff like ""you can be sober, I don't force you to drink when we hang out, if I want to drink that's my problem""",2

On a different note, my birthday is coming up on Sunday. There are 6 places/events in a matter of 3 days I want to attend (3 of which include bars). My fear is that I'll get wasted and be hungover causing myself to stay in door recovering rather than enjoying all the events. I rather not get wasted but its especially hard when you're in a celebration mood.

Find the person I was before life & alcohol beat the shit out of me.  

It's not simple to say
That most days I don't recognize me
That these shoes and this apron
That place and its patrons
Have taken more than I gave them
It's not easy to know
I'm not anything like I used be, although it's true
I was never attention's sweet center
I still remember that girl
She's imperfect, but she tries
She is good, but she lies
She is hard on herself
She is broken and won't ask for help
She is messy, but she's kind
She is lonely most of the time
She is all of this mixed up and baked in a beautiful pie
She is gone, but she used to be mine
It's not what I asked for
Sometimes life just slips in through a back door
And carves out a person and makes you believe it's all true
And now I've got you
And you're not what I asked for
If I'm honest, I know I would give it all back
For a chance to start over and rewrite an ending or two
For the girl that I knew
Who'll be reckless, just enough
Who'll get hurt, but who learns how to toughen up
When she's bruised and gets used by a man who can't love
And then she'll get stuck
And be scared of the life that's inside her
Growing stronger each day 'til it finally reminds her
To fight just a little, to bring back the fire in her eyes
That's been gone, but used to be mine
Used to be mine
She is messy, but she's kind
She is lonely most of the time

Any advice, from those who learned to?","Sobriety has been a really tough one for me so far. Last time I posted I didn't want to admit I had a problem, but after having tried to slow down to a healthy rate more than once and failing, I know I do.

Drinking is completely wiping out the effects of the very important psych medication I'm on. Drinking is probably slowly killing my liver and kidneys, because I know it's too much, but I like this. I know the only way I'm going to stay healthy and not binge every other night is to stop completely.

But I can't get myself to want that. 

And I've tried going completely sober, I was for a few months, but then one drink and I was back to it. I'm sober right now. I manage to stay sober for a day or so, and then it's just a few, and then it's a lot. I don't know. I think I hate life, I struggle with a mood disorder and more life issues than I'd like to count and I think I just like burying them. Alcohol lets me feel okay for a little while, forces my muscles to relax when I physically cannot. 

I want to do what's right, I know logically in my mind that this will kill me one day, either by letting my psych conditions go because the meds won't work or through literal organ failure. But I guess addiction isn't logic. 

I don't really know where to access AA, and I don't know anyone else who has struggled with this. I'd appreciate some advice, from anyone who has been here and beaten it.",5
2020-01-16 07:14:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/epijmu/tuesday_night_at_the_meeting_in_prison_the/,Tuesday night at the meeting in prison - the promises.,"The guard at the first gate recognizes us, goes to the volunteer clipboard to make sure our authorizations are still valid, all business, but friendly about it. We're good and we cross over into an alternate universe.  

Several gates, a metal detector, and a frisk later... Inside the room -  it's a lot like every other AA meeting, coffee pot, slogans on the wall, chairs in a circle, a varied group of guys.  But it's not quite like other meetings, they're all wearing blue uniforms, you can see razor wire and a guard tower out the window.     

The group's leader says he wants to read the promises from the Big Book as a topic starter.  I help him pass out the books.  But before we can begin there's a chance for anyone to share a 'burning desire' this is a chance to let someone get something off his chest and is a good safety valve especially in this setting.

This man, I'll call him Rock, he's been working out in prison yards for twenty some years and there is a resemblance, starts to speak, ""Last night at 3 am I almost lost it.  I'm supposed to go home later this year and some fool almost took that away.""  He went on to say how he'd been provoked and had, to his great surprise, not reacted the way he would have not that long ago.  He was amazed, and very glad, that he found a way out of the situation that did not involve violence and another charge added to his sentence.

When he finished I shared - introducing the topic, pointing out that several of the promises had played a part in what did and did **not** go down in the dorm the night before.  

* We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness.
* We will comprehend the word serenity, and we will know peace.
* We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us.

And yeah, it was maybe a bit cross talky, but it was real and concrete and they got it.  We then went on to read the paragraphs and it was another of the promises that sparked another round of discussion. 

* We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.

Now that's tricky if you've been locked up for twenty or thirty years, and there is a lot of regret and remorse in the room.  But as one of the men said ""I can't forget what I've done, because I don't want to ever do anything like that again.  If I ever get another chance on the outside I can't do anything that would bring me back here.""

**I'm going to get a bit preachy here and address the reader.  The majority of these men are locked up because something went very, often fatally, wrong in a stupid drunken instant**  None of them picked up the first drink that night and said, 'I'm going to do something that's going to get me put in prison for 10, 20, 30 years.'  For some of them it happened in a blackout.  They don't remember.  Not many of them are career criminals - just guys for whom shit happened in a VERY BIG TURD.  They are not that different from you or me. So if you still need a reason to stop...

The discussion wandered into self forgiveness - some remarked they still were not able to... but pretty much everyone agreed that for them...

* Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change.

had happened to some degree or another - though spending time in Max had something to do with that too.

From my perspective this has happened to me too, but without the locked up for years experience (thank you very much).   I was lucky.

And then the meeting was over, we chatted a bit before the escort came to take us to the gates which would open for us and let us out into our 'normal' world where the promises have come true. On the drive home my partner and I were mostly silent but very aware how we've changed too.  And glad for it.",44

This last year has been the hardest I've ever been through. Last May, I tried to kill myself and even through that, I held my head high and continued down my path. Last November, I was diagnosed with OCD and bipolar disorder and I still kept on my stable path. 

Four days ago, I quit my job because my boss mocked my mental health. Three days ago, on my 26th birthday, I enrolled in college for computer science. I'm terrified and excited at the same time to start down this path. But for this next year, I'm taking a step back from working and focus on what makes me, me. This year, I will listen to voices that may oppose the way I think or my actions. I am so excited to still be here, sharing my story and my goals. Today, I will not drink with you. Even though I've wanted to pour vodka down my throat for the past week, I will not drink with you. Even though I am tired and feel like sometimes, my world is crashing down around me, I will not drink with you. 
 
This is not a cry for pity. This is me, holding my hands up in the air in triumph for one year sober from alcohol. I am leaps and bounds ahead of where I was this time last year, waking up with a hangover from Hell from a night of drinking when I knew I had to be up at six. This past year has molded me more times than I care to admit, but I'm still here, bottle of water in my hand with a little paper umbrella (because ya girl is fancy like that and wanted to celebrate) and my dogs at my side, living my life the way I want to, without the ball and chain of alcohol. 

My father called me this morning, midnight my time and told me how proud he was of me for taking it one day at a time. One year ago today, I told myself that if I made it to a year, I would get ""Still I rise"" on my wrist to cover up the ugly scars of the mental illness I still suffer from today as a reminder that I am rising out of that rock bottom place. 

So, to those who are 24 hours sober, or 24 years, I will not drink with you today.",797

I've been sober for 4 days so that deserves a celebration, right? Or I can dip a toe back in and by only buying a couple things instead of my usual 6+ pack I'd be doing better than before, right?

In the end I escaped straight to my car, left without any alcohol, and didn't dip into my wife's stash when I got home. So a win for sure. But I was really surprised at how strong the urge was and know I'll have to keep being vigilant against myself in similar situations.",7

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It started with me just getting high and then having a beer. I was getting high daily. It was never for a form of escapism, it was a habit that just grew.

Last year I stopped twice, once for 2 weeks and once for a week. I started getting tension headaches from the moment I woke up, and the only thing that helped was drinking. Then I started d getting nerve pain in my chest and as well the only relief was drinking. Started feeling numbness almost entirely in my left side of my body. Went to multiple doctors (idiot me didn't want to disclose how much I drank since it was never asked).

Had my new years party with friends on a remote location, the second had a chill day spent drinking my last day. Friday stopped drinking and the normal withdrawal I've been accustomed to kicked in, 3/4 days of sleeping 3 hours or less. Going to bed was pointless even if I was tired, because the moment I would fall asleep an electric shock through my entirely body would wake me. Not pleasant.

After withdrawal was complete (I am lucky to suffer minimal symptoms), my tension headaches stopped and my nerve pain went from a constant 5/10 to a 1-0/10.

I now indulge in the 'alcohol free' beers and wine just to scratch the habitual itch, but it feels good waking up without a dry mouth, even though when I was drinking I'd chug like a litre of water before going to bed every night.

I definitely still would love a beer, but thats not going to happen until my brain chemistry has adjusted to not drinking everyday.

I am not stopping forever, I was not a raging alcoholic, but an alcoholic nonetheless. I would like to be able to enjoy one drink and one drink alone, and maybe the occasional drunk shenanigans with friends, but until I have complete control this is not a possibility for the near future.

My heart goes out to all of you who have much more of a struggle than I do, please resist the urge.

My life had shrank to the size of a shot glass. I made plenty of money, and even did challenging and rewarding work, when I was capable of it. But I constantly fantasized about living off my savings in a 3rd world country to drink all day, and suicide. 

I still don’t have much figured out, my routine is actually pretty shitty, and I messed my knee up so can’t run, my diet is just ok, my new job is awesome but I haven’t done much and am feeling anxious.

I'm just so insanely thankful for this community and AA. Honestly this is changing my life one day at a time. My entire life is now in debt to this program. Because without it, I may not even have been alive to make it this far.

I wasn't euphoric, but I did feel better without being hungover and without being so hard on my stomach. The last 3 days or so though, I've been feeling super weird and not in a good way. I've got this strange hazy headache thing going on, I feel extremely...down. Kind of empty. It might not be related to drinking at all I'm just wondering if you guys have had an experience like this.

Having hit 2 weeks, I thought I'd be proud of that but I just kind of...don't care right now, and it feels weird.",4

My plan is to take the 10 dollars I usually spend on alcohol everyday and instead investing into a micro-investment service so that I have something tangible to look at as an improvement everyday i don't drink. 

I hope this gives me an incentive because the days I do drink, I won't invest.

It's 12 now so I have went 24 hours for the first time in a couple weeks after I quit quitting So I'm starting now.

So hopefully this helps motivate me.

I shall see how this plays out soon enough.

Even inspired my friend to cut way down. He said ""man, I want what you've got going."" Once I noticed the whole scene with sober eyes it kept me even further. Sure, I had a few temptations. When they got a couple margaritas I thought, ""oOo, margarita, maybe I should just,,,, nahhhh. Bad idea"" then I'd forgotten all about it in no time as we were engulfed in a new situation.

I saw the misery on peoples faces in the bar, and we were all in paradise! Incredible. 

I even met an awesome chick who let me stay at her house for a time. She hates drunks, she straight up told me: ""if you had been drunk there's no way I would have kept talking to you.""

Fuckin hell, this not boozing thing isn't so bad after all. Can't wait to see what else it brings.

Haven't smoked since 2019 either.

Plus, I had a moment of clarity on the beach. Turns out I'm not such a piece of shit after all!

I thought I would learn to ""pace"" myself, to ""count"" my drinks, to check in with myself and make sure I was still in control. I used to enjoy drinking, but now I am just traumatized. 

I have social anxiety, and I feel liberated when I let the buzz give me the courage to socialize. Over the past years, I've been embarrassed countless of times to hear what I've done the next morning. When it first happened, I just told myself, ""How embarrassing...but it happens to everyone.""

.... It is when it becomes repetitive when it becomes a problem. This does not happen every time, but I am scared of myself. I've either blacked out and had 0 memory of the whole night, or I've browned out. The scariest part is thinking I was in control the entire night because I thought I remembered everything.. but then I hear, I was being very touchy. 

I am scared of seeing videos of myself drunk and completely functioning to wake up with 0 memory. As of now,  I have decided to STOP DRINKING. This is such a huge decision because alcohol is always at every social event. The majority do it, but I have to learn to be comfortable without it. My next move is to seek help. I don't know whether or not this is a temporary decision until I learn to really limit one or two drinks or to cut it out completely. Drinking has caused more problems for me... and I just have to accept it may not be for me.",7

I’ve relapsed so many times over the past few years, I noticed the signs of physical dependency over the last couple of days emerging. Loss of appetite, inability to sleep for more than 3-4 hours without needing a drink to go back to sleep, vomiting, and my nervous system slowly deteriorating. I knew the withdraw process would only get worse if I didn’t stop now.

Now I write this laying in bed in a cold sweat, unable to sleep, and can’t hold down anything more than ice-water, but at least I’m sober. Not the worst withdraw I’ve gone through, but I’m committed to making it through the night.

Having cravings and sleep deprivation from my work schedule is a scary thing because I feel very disconnected and deciding to drink in that state feels like it’s not that big of a deal.

Today... I’ve been physically shaking most of the day.  All I can think about is a beer.  My stomach is in knots.  There’s no mental focus to be had.  It’s day one all over again, worse even.

Not sure if I posted before. But after hundreds of tries, tomorrow is again day one. I am a musician, which makes alcohol hard to avoid. Last saturday I played to worst show of my life - I had been drinking for about a month - every day - 9 to 12 beers a day. I couldn't remember the words I wrote. I couldn't remember the chords I'd been playing for years. I embarrassed myself in front of (lets be honest 10s), but people I knew. And I feel that the shame is deeper than just I played one bad show. Its the self reflection on my life so far. Its the relationships I've strained trying to maintain. 

My girlfriend gave me support after the show. She stepped on eggshells around my hangover the next day. I don't want this to be something that's expected from her. She mentioned my drinking over a year ago as something that bothers her, but seems to have come to accept it as part of me. This is something that bothers me. I both don't want to do the damage to her in choosing between me and my choices, and don't want the shame of commiserating - like this is a normal thing.

&#x200B;

I'm drunk today. I made a promise sunday that I will stop drinking alone. Today I broke that promise. I feel shitty and guilty and drunk. I'm worried thats too soon. I'm worried thats the point. Tomorrow - not the forever tomorrow I've been promising myself, but tomorrow 1/16/20 - I look into mental health options for substance abuse. 

I will not drink with you tomorrow",3

2020-01-15 19:38:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/epbe8c/dr_jekyll_and_missed_opportunity/,Dr. Jekyll and Missed Opportunity,"Fifteen years ago, I went to a concert with a friend. I decided to buy a bottle of vodka to drink beforehand to save the money I would have spent on beer at the show.

I ended up drinking the entire bottle and still buying beer at the concert.

I don't remember the show except for flashes. I remember looking for my friend when it was over and not being able to find him.  A random person saw me stumbling around and offered to help me get home. He must have pointed me walking the right direction and I got home by walking across the city.

When I woke up the next day, I noticed my room was full of completely random items that I had stolen on my drunken walk home. They included a box of chocolate bars, a pint glass, a salt shaker, a video game and most importantly- a book. It was Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.

It's not really in my nature to steal things from stores so it was easy to make the connection between the novel and my behaviour. Even though I had stolen that book at random, the fact that the story of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde mirrored my own behaviour wasn't lost on me. It was a lesson that if I drink, I am capable of things that do not reflect who I am and could end up getting me in trouble. I thought I shouldn't waste this coincidence and take a step to change my life so I decided right then and there to stop drinking hard liquor. That was the missed opportunity. I should have decided to quit drinking completely but didn't have the courage or insight yet so I took that half step. Later on, I didn't even pull the half step off and was drinking hard liquor again which is what seems to happen with moderation.

The reason I wanted to mention this is that I have read a few posts on here where people feel uneasy about quitting drinking before anything too bad has happened to them. Maybe they heard stories in a group meeting or online that sound far worse than anything they have experienced. I'm here to tell you that if you see the opportunity then take it. You don't need to wait until horrible things start happening. There is certainly no shame in being smart enough to make the change before things collapse and it's much harder to pull off.

The last ten years before I quit drinking just got worse and and worse. Each year was more painful than the last. My drunken behaviour never ceased to humiliate me and hurt and disappoint the people closest to me. My physical health was in a terrible place as well and I was so depressed and anxious that I could barely go on. That is in the past though and I feel so fortunate and happy to have been able to quit and get to where I am now. I still regret not taking that opportunity way back then because it would have saved me a lot of years of pain but hopefully my story can inspire someone else to take their step before the years of consequences start to pile up.

PS- I finally read the Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde book this week which is what inspired me to write this post. I read books again now that I'm sober.  :)",9

Coworkers asked me why I haven’t been drinking and I told them that I don’t really feel the urge to or the want to actually. I feel like my energy is coming back and I feel way more chill and at ease. I feel like alcohol turned me into a very tense person and overtime, I couldn’t relax in social settings without the sauce. I feel I even became awkward as fuck sometimes and had an inability to speak my mind in social settings. 

Now that I think about it though, when I was young like 16 or 17, it was super easy for me to socialize and just be myself. I’m getting back to that point although it’s been a such an effort. Shit doesn’t bother me as much as it used to. I thought I was just a moody ass person or that weed and other drugs must’ve fucked up my mood regulation. But I failed to realize that since I’ve been a binge drinker for 7 years, it changed my personality and the way I perceived the world. Weed actually makes me wanna engage and do shit and be more lovable (although I’ve abused weed as well) 

Alcohol made me sad about what has happened in my life (circumstances, childhood trauma etc.) and I was constantly looking to blame ppl or events or anything in the external world for how I was feeling. I constantly would tell my parents that they don’t understand what I’m going through blah blah blah. Started to blame them for not getting it. 

Welp folks, 46 days off the sauce and I’m finally realizing what it did to me after all these years. Not once did it do me any good. My parents say that when I went off to college, I returned as someone else and that makes me sad. I really used to be this happy ass kid. I just over thought a lot of situations that I went through and used substances to cope. 

I just need to heal now. We all need to heal because nothing is fun and games anymore when your mental health and relationships are on the line and when your life is on the line as well. 

I haven’t reached the finish line and I don’t know when I will. However- I know this is now the path I must continue on. I cannot go back. We out here grinding. THANKS FOR READING.

I still have those irrational cravings, not as often as in the early weeks though. They really suck but reading books about not drinking helps with them.

2020-01-15 16:40:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ep8xm6/my_last_drunk/,My Last Drunk,"My last drunk began on Thursday Jan 9, 2020 and ended on Jan 10, 2020. 

I don't remember exactly what happened thursday. I think I might not have gone to a meeting for a day or two. But that was also the day that the person who I asked to be my sponsor cancelled on me at the last moment. 

She said she had to work late. But she didn't say anything until I asked her about an hour before we were supposed to meet. It felt like she had completely forgotten about me. I felt upset. I felt like I was not worth the time. I felt abandoned...

I told myself that I might as well. It wasn't going to hurt anyone else. I used that cancellation as a excuse to grab my first drink. I had it. Later that night, I used the excuse that my roommate had a friend over to go out and get more for them (and me of course).

I passed out that night.

I woke up on Friday. I went to see my therapist. I was decently clear headed but I probably wasn't making as many connections as I could have. I probably didn't see how upset I still was about that cancellation.

When my session with my therapist ended, I headed back to my apartment. I took the bus to my front door. I told myself I shouldn't drink. I got to my door and went to grab my keys.

Something in my brain snapped. I did a 180 at my front door. I walked to the bodega. As I took those first steps, a very small voice in the back of my head said, ""you should probably call someone"". But I didn't heed it.

I was still scared to call anyone. Hadn't done it before. 

I got my alcohol. I came back to my apartment. I told myself I still had another hour and a half before I needed to start working. I told myself it would be alright to have a drink. I would be sober enough to complete my job, even if it would be to the bare minimum. 

I cracked open my drink. I drank it. 

The next thing I know, I wake up and look at the clock. It's 3pm. I have completely missed work. I check my work phone. My boss has been searching for me.

I had to make up some sort of excuse. It worked, but I felt horrible. My boss is actually a very kind person, and this irresponsible drunk version of me is not the person who I am. Not the person who upholds my values and my views on myself.

I felt shame. I felt guilt. I felt worthless. I felt like I was worth than scum. I felt like I would be better off dead.

I dragged myself to a meeting that night. I had been lucky enough to meet a person (who is now my interim sponser, and potentially sponser) at a meeting tuesday night, and had told her I would be there on Friday. Otherwise, I'm not sure if I would have just continued drowning myself in alcohol, especially since it was Friday.

I am so glad I went to the meeting. I felt like shit. My head pounded. I felt queasy. My head spun. But I was there. And people welcomed me. 

I was too ashamed that night to say that I had relapsed (even though I only had like 6 days before that).

*Fast forward a bit*: I ended up breaking down and calling my now sponsor on Saturday and telling her I had relapsed. I told her I needed to tell someone. I need someone to hold my accountable. I just needed someone. 

She listened. She validated my feelings. She supported me and told me we all have day one's, day two's, etc. The main thing is that we come back. That even if I did relapse, I am back.

She asked what I can do to prevent this. I told her I needed more than just meetings. I needed to work the steps. I needed to learn how to live, because I haven't lived while I have been drinking. 

I've been going to meetings everyday since. She's been kind enough to let me check in when I need to. And meets up with me before meetings sometimes. She's not my official sponsor yet, but I think I'm going to ask. It's still early in my journey. I don't know how or where it will go. But I'm going to do my best to take it one day at a time.

My Dry January won't be perfect, but it will still be progress.","Hey, y'all. This got long, but I appreciate the opportunity to write it in a supportive community. I hope it will be encouraging to others who might be feeling down if their Dry January isn't going as planned.

I made it 10 days into January without drinking, and then stumbled on days 11 and 12. I'm on Day 3 again right now.

I have a lot of perfectionist tendencies, and am susceptible to black-and-white thinking. I've worked hard in my life to address that, but it still tries to creep in. If I've made ANY error, it's time to throw the baby out with the bathwater, right? I was feeling fairly despondent about the nights I decided to drink again, but they also helped show me how much progress I'd already made in such a short time.

For one thing, my hangovers are back. Hooray!? I felt like absolute shit after the first night, even though I drank less than I usually do. It was easy to let that convince me to drink again the next night, since I already felt terrible, so I did. From there, it's a very small step to, ""What's the point at all?""

I couldn't let it snowball back into my old ways. It was tempting to throw in the towel altogether, which is certainly what my mental illness and addiction wanted. But that's not what I want for my life. Despite Dry January being the last impetus I needed to start making this change, I know it needs to extend beyond this month. I also know that being too hard on myself will, ultimately, hamstring me completely. If I need to mar January in order to practice sobriety in a practical way, without holding myself to unrealistic expectations of perfection, so be it.

I know I will have setbacks. That's not the important part; what is important is to try again. The cumulative effort is going to add up. I won't have 31/31 clean days, but 29/31 clean days will still be a huge improvement over getting trashed every night, even though they won't be consecutive. ANY amount of clean days is an improvement. If you need hundreds of Day 1s, that's okay. Sometimes I feel like the [Black Knight from Monty Python](https://media.giphy.com/media/bAFo2bUEfwJZm/giphy.gif), but I'll still try to embody that temerity.

The sort of person who has never met a stranger and had no enemies. Who would ask how you were doing, not as standard greeting, but as a genuine question.

After the visitation, an event was put together for friends to get together at a bar to get hammered, in memory of course. The next day, after the funeral, there was a memorial service with an open bar. I felt so much sadness that alcohol is such a large part of this all the way from probable cause to perceived solution.

Does anyone else experience this?,"TLDR: got sober in treatment. I’m one of the only ones still sober without a relapse. Is guilt over good supports and no relapses normal??

I chose to go to treatment in order to get sober. I would be able to stay sober one day but never two and very rarely just the one. 

I’ve been told that friendships after treatment don’t last and in many ways that has proven true. 

I did maintain contact with a few of the girls after treatment and we would check in and try to support each other to continue the sobriety we had strung together in treatment. 

I was celebrating a milestone I never thought possible a few days ago. I was so excited for the next day to get that next nice round number of days. 

Long story short, one of the girls reached out to me and in the conversation it came about that she had relapsed a while back. 

Her husband is and was in active addiction. He was not the support that she needed in early recovery. Unfortunately his continued use led to her falling back into old habits. 

I instantly felt guilt. 

I am so blessed with a support network. People who are genuinely in my corner and would never do anything to jeopardize my sobriety. My dad and mom won’t even have one drink around me, no matter the occasion and if I’m the one that tells them to if they’d like. (Neither of my parents have an issue with any substance and can always stop at one drink). This apple fell far from that tree lol. 

Is it normal to feel guilty for being lucky? I work hard for my sobriety. I know they are working hard too. There are only 2 of us that I know for sure have maintained full sobriety since we left the program. During the program we were told only 1 of us would make it without falling back at some point. Is it normal to feel bad for maybe being that 1?? 

Thanks for letting me air this out. 

To be clear: I am in no way trying to say people without support or any other additional obstacle can not maintain sobriety. I am merely mourning for the “friends” from treatment who are back living in situations they cried over while we were in treatment. I don’t want anyone to feel that way and it hurts.

I started the new year 2020 in a psych ward, sober as can be. I woke up Christmas morning with a plan to kill myself. I had been on a 3-week, well more like 6-week long drinking bender with a short break here and there so I could be sober long enough to get to school and back to finish my last semester. I somehow graduated with my degree and made the Dean's list. I got accepted into a University to broaden my horizons and expand my education. But Christmas morning was just my breaking point. I just couldn't handle the stress of everything in my life, all the pain, the responsibility, the disappointments just everything that wasn't right. I even wrote a note. 

My cat was sitting in the room with me and he was looking at me. I was crying. I don't what it was about the way he looked at me but I got up and I told someone and I went to the ER. I knew I was going to withdraw hard giving how much and how often I had been drinking. I spent 4 days in Observation withdrawing getting Ativan and Zofran every several hours and puking my guts out every 20 minutes anyway, hadn't eaten in over a week at that point or slept in several days. For those 4 days different nurses, CNAs, and techs sat with me to watch me for 24 hours a day and they just watched tv with me, encouraged me to eat and changed my IVs every time it emptied. I just blankly watched tv for those 4 days. I just wanted to sleep. I wanted to go home. I want to feel normal again. I wanted some food but the thought of food nauseated me like crazy. 

I was finally sent to the psych floor, or behavioral health unit as they refer to it, I was still withdrawing. But I guess they don't deal with many bad alcoholics like me and thought I was done withdrawing. I just wanted out of that room and wanted to be in a regular room with privacy and hopefully work on eating some real food. I was on a clear liquids diet and had been eating ice chips and sucking down water and chicken broth for a couple days at the point. I still had the withdrawl shits, the bad anxiety, the sweats, tachycardia and the slight shakes but at least I wasn't throwing up anymore. 

The psychiatrist was very concerned about me as was the doctor who first saw me when I was admitted that she intended to follow up with me once I was moved to the psych floor. I stayed awake until 6 pm even though by then I was really, really, really tired. They told me to nap once I got to that unit around noon but I knew it would just throw off my sleep schedule so I tried to participate in the groups they were having. I ate some dinner and I went to sleep finally. I felt better. From that point on I felt better and better every day. I was told I would be out by the 30th or the 31st. I believed them when I agreed to go to the psych unit but then I started having anxiety about getting locked up there. I had another mini-breakdown. They had already restarted my meds I went off of a few weeks before but just wanted to monitor me to make sure I wasn't going into liver failure or anything. They never really told me a reason why they thought that because I wasn't having any symptoms of it. I was put on some medication to stop me from craving alcohol. And I was released to go home eventually. 

I am going to continue seeing my psychiatrist. I have to continue therapy as I have many issues in my life that I have never dealt with. PTSD that was never treated and rears it's ugly head from time to time. Depression and anxiety and chronic medical issues that persist. I will not give up. Alcohol does nothing but put me in a bad head space and drag me down. 

I started at the University, I am on my second day. I feel good today. I am happy, I am proud of myself. I can do this. I will not drink with you today.",18

My childhood was far from normal. I'm 56 now, decent job, live by myself, have a great partner in crime I see on the weekends that actually rarely drinks, and never more than one or two. He always sees me with a Scotch in my hand, and I would rather change my habit then lose him. I've lived alone now for almost 10 years, so no, I'm not person-dependent. I actually like being alone. And drinking alone. I don't go out, I dislike crowds and loud noise. I also don't care for water, iced tea, or soda. So stupid question...what do I drink instead of Scotch?",1

I'm wondering if anyone here has dealt with similar feelings before..

I now have over a year sobriety from alcohol and about 11 months of absolute sobriety (used kratom for a bit).  It's a fuckin' miracle!  I drank for 20 years, alcoholically for a 15 years and every-single-fucking-day come rain or come shine for 10.  Consumption levels towards the end were staggering.  25-30 drinks a day, no problem.

I was pretty heavily involved in AA for the first 6 months of my sobriety and I'm grateful for the program as during that time it really helped me, gave me something to do and kept me away from the booze when I was quite fragile and new to living life sober.  I worked the steps and attended about 3-5 meetings a week on average.  As time went on I started to get a lot less out of the program.  Found it in many ways reinforced my alcoholism/prior alcoholism and in general meetings just started to bum me out (not to mention being a big time suck for me personally due to the commute).

Between months 6 and 9 I really cut back on meetings.  I would start to get a lot of ""where have you been"" and ""did you relapse"" and ""be careful"", etc.  After picking up my 9 month chip I basically stopped going.  This was also around the time my sponsor cursed me out for no reason (long story).  I however had already been getting away from the program but that was definitely the icing on the cake.  A sign from my higher-power if you will that this might not be for me..

Anyway, I've quite effortlessly maintained my sobriety since then.  No real thoughts of drinking, I'm generally happy, etc.  Here is what I struggle with though.  Like occasionally I'll get a bit depressed or lonely or what have you and it's like the AA rhetoric is in the back of my head telling me it's because I'm not actively working the program and going to meetings and I'm destined to drink again.  I mean I still use many of its principles and sayings but as time went on I simply just don't agree with much of it.  Some of the strong verbiage is what ircks me as I find it leans rather heavily towards fear mongering, i.e. *""Rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program"", ""turn their will and their lives over"", ""surrender completely"", ""there are those too unfortunates"", etc.*

At times I feel like I've been subtly brainwashed.  For awhile I tried to like just go to a meeting once a week or every other week as I do (sort of) enjoy the social aspect but 95% of the time I would leave said meetings feeling worse due to the fact that I was not ""*giving myself completely to this simple program"",* coupled with the fact that almost every meeting there would be shares from people who relapsed and they would always deflect the blame on the fact that they A) stopped going to meeting or B) greatly reduced meeting frequency (what I was doing).

Another thing I suppose I struggle with is I spend a lot of time alone.  I'm generally doing rad shit though, but again, in the back of my head there is this almost guilt that I'm isolating and thus according to AA doomed for failure.  I reassure myself that this is just where I'm at right now and I do make it a point to get out of the house daily and talk to people.  I know in due time some quality friendships will form but right now I'd rather just be alone and work on music and the like then just hang out with people because ""that's what I'm suppose to be doing"".

So yeah, sort of just wanted to get that off my chest.  Anyone else struggle with the same after ""leaving"" AA?",36

Plus, I'm proud of myself for making 30 days!

Some positive changes I have noticed include:

Hair, skin, and nails - I'm less red in the face! My hair is growing faster and my nails aren't paper thin anymore.

Weird bumps on my skin went away. Had these for years. Like zits that just became a permanent little bump instead of healing and going away, now they're going away by themselves!

Less puffy face. I don't know how nobody else can see it, but my face is MUCH less puffy. Especially my cheeks and eyelids. When I'm drinking I have hooded eyelids that kind of rest on my eyelashes (hard to explain), but now my eyelids aren't puffy at all!

Less puffy body. I don't think I've lost a significant amount of fat yet, but my water weight is definitely down. My belly is flatter. My clothes aren't loose, but they fit better. 

Better eating habits! Weight loss is an eventual goal of mine, and being sober has given me the ability to eat healthier with consistency. Instead of cramming greasy foods into my hungover body, I've been able to stick to a mostly whole foods plant based diet. 

Better pooping. Apologies for TMI, but I know many can relate. It's better in every way, but I'll spare you the deets.

Better sleep! It's amazing. 

Better mornings!!! My first thought every morning when I was drinking was that I should kill myself. I could barely function. I was angry every morning. Yelled at my kids a lot, trying to accomplish the morning routine of breakfast and getting older kids off to school. Now, although I wish I could sleep longer most days, I pop right up and get things done  without any unnecessary meltdowns or thoughts of suicide. 

I'm able to keep my house cleaner! I'll never be a great housekeeper, because I just suck at organization, but I absolutely CAN keep my kitchen sink from overflowing with dishes and my floors clean. My day to day living has become a lot more manageable. 

I'm in a better mood all the time. I'm nicer. I don't  dwell on the mistakes of my past as much and I'm less depressed. 

I can read and be fully engrossed in a novel. My addled, alcoholic brain could not do this within a week of drinking any alcohol. Now I can focus. 

My sex drive is returning. Before I could take or leave it. I mostly did it for my husband. Now I'm developing an interest again.

The whites of my eyes are whiter. My eyes are bright.

I'm saving money that would have been spent on wine and cigarettes. I had to have cigarettes when I drank, so now that I'm not drinking I've also quit smoking. Double win!

I haven't embarrassed myself in at least 30 days! And I remember everything. 

I'm sure there's plenty more...but I'll stop here. If this is all that improves in my life, then it's more than worth not drinking. However, I know that every month I'll have increasing benefits from sobriety, so instead of being disappointed that nobody can tell yet how much better I'm doing, I'll stick with it!

I don't know how to be inspired without it. When I was younger I believed this was the most important thing; writing, painting, reading the perfect thing. Also the experiences that opened up the impulses and feelings that lead to creation.

But since early on, I only ever got there drunk or stoned.  

I can't do it anymore. My body and my family are suffering. It started hitting me harder and harder: I'm killing myself.

Anyway, the last couple of years I haven't been doing much of it at all. Depression suffocated the urge.

Plus, booze is sneaky.

I would always have a cocktail or half a bottle of wine a night (which I have not felt great about for a few years now), but last year I started regularly ""sneaking"" extra hard alchohol at nearly every opportunity.

When my wife was out or even (god, it's embarrasing to write) when she would go to the bathroom while we watched TV, I would drink slugs of whatever was on the bar straight out of the bottle. Never during the day but if it was after like 4pm I would often do it. It became a habit in the sense that I wasn't even always doing it with a goal of getting drunk. I would just see the opportunity and take it, even if I didn't really feel like it. It was really fucked up. Sometimes I would hold a bottle up to my mouth and say out loud ""what the fuck are you doing?"" and then chug anyway.

It's a really stupid way to get loaded, too. You never really know how much you've consumed. I had maybe 10 nights in the last year where I passed out at 7:30pm and didn't remember going to bed when I woke up the next day.

And deep in my heart (and from reading this sub), I \_KNEW\_ she knew. She would sometimes make comments about how I smelled or that I ""fell asleep"" so early, or would talk gibberish on the way to bed. I was sneaky about hiding empties and adding new bottles but the bar is right out in the open, so I can't believe (I mean I literally do not believe) she never noticed the churn.

But she never said anything. Even when I told her I was doing dry January she didn't react much. The next day she mentioned in passing something about ""drinking less"" and I reiterated that I'm not drinking at all this month. (She has an ideally healthy relationship to alcohol.)

We have an otherwise extremely close relationship, and went through some of the most difficult problems a couple can have in the past few years (baby stuff, very sad story) and came through even closer.

And a part of me was always waiting for her to confront me (afraid of it, but wanting it) and it never happened. I'm sure she has just been scared.

So I'm here doing this because I want to. I want to for her, I especially want to for me. I used to think I just wanted to moderate but I'm not so sure anymore. The last week and a half have been really illuminating.

If anybody is reading this because they're worried about their partner, it might be scary but they also might be waiting for you to speak out.

Thanks for reading and to everyone on this sub.

We have our health, two amazing dogs, a great home, a great car, tons of travel and adventures on the horizon, and for the first time in my life I feel truly content.

So when I was driving back to my house after visiting my work's office to talk about this new role (I work from home -- it's about an hour drive) I kept thinking about how much a few beers would complement today's good news. I got that thirsty, dry, clenching feeling in my throat for the first time in a long while. But I let my mind sit on that feeling and really observe it from all sides, and realized this was a few wimpy attempts by my dying addiction monster to weakly pull me back. I let it do its worst, knowing that whatever its ""worst"" was, I was stronger than that.

 I stopped for gas, grabbed a sugar free red bull (my first in ages), and went home. I arrived home to the joyous greeting by [my itty bitty welcome home committee](https://i.imgur.com/7aOHVnA.jpg), and will celebrate tonight with some Beat Saber and kombucha.

He said he used it as an appetite stimulant. He did this almost everyday. At social events he'd go all out with his friends. It's he was hardly ever sober most nights growing. He'd stop for a bit but after a month or two you'd find bottles hidden in bus suit cases or in the cupboards.

I also lost an Uncle to alcohol. Man died an alcoholic with major liver complications. I also have anothder Uncle that threw away a massive life opportunity away because most of the time you'd find him drinking and I believe this played a part in him not taking life seriously around the time he got that wonderful opportunity in life to better himself.

A couple of months back, I found myself drinking more than usual for ""a social drinker"". I sat myself down,  reflected deeply and I told myself there's nothing valuable or productive I'm getting from drinking alcohol so I decided to take a 30 day break.

30 days has turned into102 days. I have finally decided I don't want alcohol to be part of my life anymore. I'm not sure if it's fear or what but I don't want to be lead onto the part alcohol played in the life's of my Dad and Uncles.",14

If you have seen any of my previous posts (desperate cries for help) you will know I struggled so so so hard in the very early beginning. I was almost grieving the loss of alcohol, unconsciously trying to talk myself out of being sober. I felt hopeless when presented with AA’s first two steps, not in the good way either. I didn’t want to be an alcoholic; I was in dismay over not being strong enough to break my family’s cycle of addiction. I felt so disappointed in myself that I had let my mother down, who fought tooth and nail for her sobriety for her children’s sake and taught us the seriousness of alcohol. I felt so weak, humiliated, and alone that I, a life long atheist, had come to rely on a higher power (which happens to be a weird combination of my IKEA bathmat and a locket holding pictures of my boyfriend and dog).

I went to meetings, got a sponsor, studied the literature, but I continued to feel that same heaviness that accompanies grief. As suggested by some kind soul on here, I bought Annie Grace’s ‘Naked Mind’ on audiobook. It may be brainwashing and I’m perfectly fine with that, but I don’t have the fiendish desire to poison my body with alcohol anymore. I thank her and all of you a thousand times over. My sobriety may not be as rooted in AA as others but so far this is working. It’s working so well that I genuinely lost track of time and I hope it stays like this.

Thank you all for being the most supportive community. I’m gonna get on my bathmat, locket in hand, and say the words that have been getting me through each day: “I will not drink, even if just for today.”",12

A little background:  I never really drank during my teens and twenties.  The occasional party here and there, and the occasional night out with a few beers.  However, I was a full blown opiate addict.  From 21 years old to about 24, I was addicted to painkillers which peaked at 320mg a day, 160mg in one sitting up the nose.  I stopped in 2010 with the help of suboxone and lots of pot.  So I'm no stranger to withdrawal.  I was only supposed to use suboxone for a year, but it lasted close to 8 years.  June 2018 is when I finally stopped using suboxone.  Again, had to go thru withdrawal once again.     

So around the end of 2016, I decided to finally quit smoking pot as I've never stopped smoking since 2010.  After a couple months of being ""sober"" (still on suboxone at this point), I started having a beer or two at night.  I never really got shitfaced until I met my now fiance, whose friends do like to go out on the weekends and get hammered, although they dont drink on the weekdays like I do. 

Fast forward 3 years:  My habit progressed to the point where now I drink 3-4 ipas (7-8%abv) a night, every night, and get shitfaced (lots of whiskey) on Sat.  I dont drink during the day, at all.  The only day drinking is sunday during football season.   The last couple weeks, I've been starting to feel what I would assume to be withdrawal from the moment I wake up.  No shakes, cold sweats, etc. yet, but its oddly similar to the anxiety from opiate withdrawal.  Best way I can describe it is a constant slow burn in my chest that 'knurls' and is one of the most uncomfortable feelings for me.  As soon as I felt that, it brought back all the memories of my opiate withdrawals which I vowed I'd never to go thru something like that again.  Well, here we are...back again.  

I'm thinking of quitting cold turkey, but after reading about how dangerous it could be, I was thinking how tapering could work.  Again after reading on here, tapering can be successful or a complete failure.  I would love to be a normal 'moderate' drinker, but again after reading on here, that can be a train wreck as well.  I'm just afraid with the wedding and honeymoon coming up, that I'm not going to be able to say no to a drink.  And if I quit now, its going to just suck me back in and I'll be back to square one again.  

TLDR

Former opiate addict, now an alcoholic.  For 3 plus years, a 3-4 ipa a night habit plus whiskey drinking on weekends.  Afraid of quitting with the wedding and honeymoon coming up, as it could completely make me start over the whole recovery process again.",5

It's interesting to watch people get drunk while remaining sober. Yet of us on the sober path have, through painful personal experience, learned that alcohol does not giveth, it only taketh away. 

Maintaining sobriety can be an enlightening experience, especially when you learn the terrible truth about alcohol: it is a poison. You see it everywhere - in adverts, on menus, in films and TV shows - and inwardly wonder how everyone else around you, who is still drinking, can't see it. Then you remember that you were they once before too (and may yet be again!).

Everything I do at home involves drinking.  Clean the house?  Drink.  Play video games or watch tv?  Drink.  Play with my kid and snuggle my wife?  Drink.  And I'm high functioning so it's hard for them to even notice.  And it's only at night. 

While doing my treatment plan I'm finding it hard to fill it out because most of the sample plans I'm reading and listening to deal with social drinkers.  So they are asking me how to avoid triggers.  My conundrum is... don't go home??????  Going home is my trigger to drink.  Watching tv is my trigger to drink.  Reading a book at home is my trigger to drink.  Cooking food is my trigger to drink.  Cleaning out the garage is my trigger to drink.  I can't not go home to my family at night.  I am going to treatments from 6-8:30 3 nights a week and the minute I'm out of there I'm b-lining it home to get my drink on.

Two weeks ago I also quit smoking cigarettes. My relationships with people and with my own self have improved significantly. For the first time in my life I’ve got enough courage to start accepting myself as I am.

Of course sometimes I feel sad, but I’m extremely grateful for all my feelings. Because for the first time in my life I can see and feel life clearly. For the first time I look into future with excitement but not with fear.

After spending so long drinking and either having a hangover and that taking all my time and worries, or thinking about when I can go out next, etc, I've noticed that just being frustrated or happy or whatever with something other than booze.

Reminds me when I came off anti-anxiety meds, which flattened my mood, afterwards I felt all over the place, like ""people get pissed off like this all the time over shitty things? Not because they think they're dying or hiding shit from family and friends?""

It's both crappy (spilt soup on the floor yesterday, so annoyed) but also great that there's a whole new world of shitty things to think about. It also makes feeling happy so much more... _pure_ like not just *white wine drunk* happy.

My best mate's dad passed away a few days ago, and it was weird to feel proper grief and sadness for both the father and such sympathy for him and his pain and loss. Normally I would drink to numb, to make me cry or feel nothing, but there's nothing to hide behind when you're sober.

And I certainly know that it's easier to stay sober than it is to get sober, so there is no turning back for me. Not this time. I've had hospitalizations, I've lost jobs, I've lost my sanity. I'm at risk of losing my future and my family. It seems I've come to that old fork in the road and I can either go one way and lose everything and die alone or go the other way and get clean and get a new job and be a contributing member of society with a purpose. I just don't understand why it all has to be so damn hard and why all these changes have to happen at once. I just lost my job Friday and I already have an interview and a lead on a better job. I'm nervous. What makes me think that I can do a job when I couldn't before? Oh yeah, because now I'm sober and then I wasn't. Accept what I cannot change, change what I can, know the difference. I think it goes something like that. I hope I can get sleep sometime soon. IWNDWYT.",8

I just turned 24. I’ve enjoyed drinking since I was about 15 or so, but couldn’t do it much due to not being able to buy it on my own. Once i turned 21, I would go through periods where id buy a six pack or two every week, then go a month without drinking (besides socially). I have slowly gone from drinking bud lights (4%), to maybe a couple years ago moving up to Bud Light Platinums (6%), to more recently in the past 4 or 5 months, drinking IPAs (8-12%). I now drink at a more frequent rate and haven’t taken one of those “month breaks” I mentioned earlier in quite some time. I can go a few days and be fine, and I genuinely don’t drink til I’m drunk. It’s usually just 2 a night. But I’m also only 24 and I’m not sure if I’m going down a rabbit hole. I personally wouldn’t consider myself an alcoholic, however, I do enjoy being tipsy or a tad bit past it. I feel like the real me, more sociable and enjoyable to others. I would really like to hear some opinions on this. Any response is GREATLY appreciated.",7

I turn 32 this month. 

We are talking 4-8 or more shots of vodka or whiskey or similar, about 3-4 days a week. Black out level, almost. 

On top of my judicially prescribed ssri/klonopin/recently added Gabapentin - the meds are much needed for my actually diagnosed severe depression and anxiety and more. 

The drinking started when I entered the service industry in late 2014. 

I did not realise the ppl who taught me to drink after work were alcoholics. 

From there, I got into the adult entertainment industry out of NECESSITY and I can not stop that source of income right now. 

About 2.5 yrs ago, a bartender introduced me to blow when I was really drunk. 

I realized it wakes a person up when they are wasted. 

I began to crave it when I get wasted and do it for a night once every 3 months it seems. Up to once a week. 

I hate it. It makes my anxiety sky rocket for days. 

The problem is the alcohol. 

When I stay home, I can not drink for weeks. 

I drink to loosen up for work or to unwind after work when I am pissed. 

I don't even like the taste. 

I told myself I would force myself to work sober in 2020. 

But I have already gotten wasted 3 times this month and feel REALLY DEFEATED. 

I turn 32 this month. Started drinking when I was almost 27. 

I have all the risk factors for diabetes, heart problems, and the psych meds are hard on liver as it is. 

My blood work 2 yrs ago showed my liver enzymes were fine. I worry that is no longer the case. 

I did a bunch of research today including pub med articles and I am soooo at risk for liver disease and I am terrified. 

I am terrified of setting a goal that I will fail at. 

Also, now alcohol is the only thing that gives me energy. According to studies our bodies adapt to one of the bi products (acetate Maybe?) And use it as an energy source. Similar to how those on keto burn fat instead of sugar for fuel. 

I struggle to clean my room or shower or go to my adult job without drinks now - it is the only thing that gives me energy. 

I want a sober 2020. I want a sober age 32. I am tired of being the drunk lounge lizard. I never signed up for this - it just happened. The perfect storm of events led me here. 

Again, I can not quite my job. It pays my rent, transportation, and out of pocket psychiatrist costs, and groceries right now. 

I have to quit drinking. I am terrified that I have already done irreparable damage to my body, and liver especially. Heart, too. 

Gentle replies only, please. 💜

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hello all! I’ve been in this wonderful community before, mostly just read over the posts and made a few of them myself a couple years ago from an old account. But, I am back. And I am finally ready to admit at the age of 24 (25 in June) that I am a binge-drinker alcoholic. A little bit of background... I started drinking very early at the age of 13. Maybe 12. I come from a family of alcoholics. My mom and dad are more than one year sober. (Yayyy!) Drinking has brought me so much more grief, anxiety, pain and depression than all of the fun times with friends and family I have combined. When I first started drinking, it was all fun... of course. I grew up in a household with parties every weekend and there was always booze in the fridge. I naturally hung out and got close with people that drank a lot, along with my younger sister. Drinking at family events has and still is a tradition in my family. There was a point when I was around eighteen that I drank every single day of my life. I blacked out at a work event at one point, and everyone talked about me the next day around that time.  I met my current SO when I was 19 and now 6 years later we have two children together. He’s not as nearly as much as a drinker than me, and I’ve never seen him get as outrageously drunk but boy, has drinking caused so many problems within my household. I do not drink everyday, I drink maybe once or twice a week, but when I do I cannot moderate my alcohol. I don’t need 2 beers, I need 10. I don’t need 1-2 shots, I need 7-10. And a good percent of the time, I completely make a fool of myself and black out. Then I wake up, and feel anxiety rising more and more inside of me as I check my phone and make sure I didn’t piss anyone off or Sob the entire night after I got too drunk (this has happened more than once.) and even if I didn’t, I feel nothing but guilt and anxiety for days. And once I’m over that feeling, I decide I need a break. And it’s time to drink again. And the cycle keeps continuing. I made this post and reached out because I am ready for the cycle to stop. my two biggest triggers are FOMO & social anxiety (which is usually the cause of my black outs) I already have an anxiety disorder and I know full well that drinking does not help. And although I am an active mother in my children’s lives and do not drink in front of them or around them, when I’m hungover I have to drag through the day to take care of them. And I don’t want to feel like this anymore. I don’t want to do this anymore. I want to stop, and I need to stop. And the reason I know I have a problem is because when I say I’m going to stop and know in my gut that I shouldn’t drink, I do it again anyways. Sorry if this post is kind of all over the place and thanks in advance for reading and the support! And I am also on day 4. Last drink Saturday night. IWNDWYT.",13

-----------------------------------------

**The Good:** I rented a car that seems too big for the narrow streets of London, and I am not happy with it. (As my cousin puts it, the cars in England have gotten bigger, but the streets have not.) 

Luckily, this is totally made up for by how much I love the apartment I’m renting—as well as the charming village within sight of Hampton Court Palace that I’m staying in. It’s a very lovely place, and I’m so happy to be here.

**The Bad:** Can you see that [little yellow sign](https://i.imgur.com/YS649Rc.jpg) on that lamp post? No? Can’t see it? Well, neither could I, because it’s [THE WORLD’S SMALLEST “NO PARKING” SIGN](https://i.imgur.com/EEZK752.jpg). And that’s why I just got a ticket on my car for £70.

**The Temptation:** I visited the second hand shop where my cousin works (which, by sheer coincidence, is next door to the flat we’re renting). While I was in the shop, behind a wall of old china and lamps, I discovered [this](https://i.imgur.com/5DOconG.jpg): a 1951 Alcyon motorbike. I have never before seen a bike with [a spare oil can](https://i.imgur.com/1QlqlQ9.png) attached to the front forks. (Then again, I’ve never ridden a two-stroke that would require me to mix oil with the gas.) 

What do you say, my peeps? Do I buy it (along with a pair of goggles) and take a long ride through the British countryside—only to break down, no doubt, in the middle of the beautiful and scenic hills of Surrey? Or do I resist and keep driving around the large and lumbering Citroen car (that I HATE)?",33

The housemate is an alcoholic that continues to relapse, and she lashes out at everyone and everything. 

The good news, is that she took a huge first step towards getting help today. She had me drive her an hour and a half away to a detox to get what she needs to beat her alcoholism. 

The bad news is that she had to drink herself into a near helpless state to get the courage up to make this commitment. 

It's hard to watch a close friend be where I was, and watch her not be able to break the cycle. 

At the same time, it is a huge encouragement to me continue my sober journey.

I would have a glass of wine to take the edge off and to calm down and try and relax again but then I would get into work the next day and it would be harder since I would be slightly hungover. Anyway today I seriously considered drinking and then I just went home and got into bed and ate sour worms. I went to the bottle store, to get a non alcoholic bottle of wine and now I'm feeling much calmer. Just have to make it through the next 3 hours and then I can go to bed.

About two years ago, when I was in the midst of my relapse, I was talking with my therapist about wanting to buy a house. I wanted my own home. I wanted a garden. I wanted a life.

She told me to buy a bunch of home and design magazines and put together a scrapbook of what I wanted my house to be. So I dutifully bought a stack of magazines, an oversized pad of paper, and some glue sticks. I spent a couple of evenings flipping through the magazines, cutting out pictures that appealed to me, sorting them into relevant piles, and sticking them together.

Some relevant themes emerged of things that I wanted my home to be, general qualities and characteristics, and also the kind of life that I wanted to have for myself in that home.

I put an offer in this week on a house which was formally accepted this afternoon. It is not a big house, and while it is solidly built and has a lot of cool original features, that’s because it’s an older home that has basically never been touched. It’s going to be a project, but it’s a pleasant and liveable place now, and it has everything that I want.

I’m able to buy this house because I’m sober. I can only imagine what sort of a wreck I’d be, but I’d be barely holding my shit together, I wouldn’t be anywhere *near* in a position to do something like this. 

It didn’t happen overnight. Getting sober was not an instant fix. For anything. It took me some time to get here. I had to go through some painful, uncomfortable, and boring crap. But I am able to have a life that I want to have because I’m sober.

One of the things that I didn’t put into my scrapbook was my sobriety, because I didn’t have it then. But now I do, and I value it. It’s more important to me than anything, it’s why I get to keep living and growing and having a life that I want to have. Without my sobriety I’m emotionally and spiritually dead, and I’d no doubt end up literally dead quite a bit ahead of schedule.

So one of the things that I added to the list that I wanted my house to have was close proximity to AA meetings that I like. I found an area with a lot of good meetings, where people attend who have long term sobriety, and they’re active in their recovery and living normal lives and staying engaged in a sober community. That is what I want for myself, so I prioritized it.

I figure that if I make it convenient to go to meetings I will keep going to meetings. If I stay active in my sobriety, I have a much better chance of staying sober. There are people who get sober and then just go about living their lives without thinking about it too much, and they’re able to stay sober. Hats off to them, but I know through experience that I’m not one of them. So I’m sticking to what I know works, and for me, that’s staying active in my sobriety communities. 

So in buying a house, one of my main priorities is making it as easy as possible for myself to prioritize my sobriety. I chose a place where I can get to a number of good, reliable meetings in 15 minutes or less. A couple of them I can even *walk* to in that time. That’s important. I got what I have by getting sober. I keep what I have by staying sober and helping others.

A year ago today I was coming up on six months sober, despondently sending out resumes, unemployed and feeling unemployable. Today I not only have a job, I have what could be legitimately described as a career path. I’m doing something that I *never* in a million *years* would’ve considered doing. It’s *far* outside of my skill set and what I consider my strengths. It involves making small talk with strangers all day long and selling things, for chrissakes. Not my wheelhouse.

But I’m able to do it. I have aptitudes that I didn’t know that I had. I also have the ability to learn new things and develop skills with things that I’m *not* naturally good at. Crap, it turns out that I can show up for work *on a regular basis* AND not feel sorry for myself that I’m spending my time doing something that I don’t particularly want to be doing. This is all a result of my sobriety. I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t sober and actively working on my recovery.

It didn’t happen overnight. I put some time in with a crappy job that led to a better job. I learned to keep my mouth shut and have some humility at work. I learned not to be an overachiever and to just do the job that I actually have. I’m still learning these things, but I am *lightyears* ahead of where I was a year ago.

My new job is intense. It is taking a lot out of me. I’m still on a learning curve. And I’ve done a couple of major renovations before, I know that there’s going to be a lot of stress and work involved with getting the house together, and that it’s also pretty much always going to be a bit of a project. But I have the life that I want. And I want the life that I have. And that feels really good.

I’m grateful for all of the support that I get here on SD. I love being part of this community. And if you’re new in sobriety, and it sucks, that doesn’t mean that you’re on the wrong path. It will get better. Just ask for help, and keep going.

I feel lost right now. I want to get back to fishing, camping, outdoors stuff but the more I think about it those were all things I could do while drinking. I mean who inst drinking at 8 in the morning while camping/fishing.  All the emotions to deal with and they just keep coming. I will deal with them as they come. The other day I sat down at my computer to play some games and just started crying, partly because I was eating chips and realized that I was turning to food instead of the bottle. It is all one in the same. Addiction is addiction.

Long time lurker... but now it is time. Here's my story, let me go get a beer.

Ok, got one.

I have no health issues, not fat, great girlfriend and newly a father. But I drink and it stops tonight. While I'm typing this post I am obviously drunk or tipsy. As you guys know the more you drink the more your tolerance grows. So I am sorry if some part doesn't make sense. English isn't my first language, I'm from Quebec in Canada.

Alchool has always been great to me, helped me sleep for a long time. It also made me different. Joyful most of the time. I am not the type of guy who gets violent when he drinks, I just get relaxed or sleepy if I drink too much. I have never drank in a bar, it's always alone at home. I can drink 26oz a night no problem, I wake up a bit shitty but I just need to drink a bit more in the morning and I'm great or I take an Ativan and I am good to go.

The reason I take Ativan is a year ago, precisely, I quit drinking for about a month. I have heard that Ativan helps the withdrawing syndromes and it did. Worked great. But I started again a month later when I figured out I could drink at night and take an Ativan in the morning to bring me back up...

Now it has to stop, I'm fucking sick and tired of being hazy in the morning and feeling like shit even though I try to drink as much water as I can at night to feel okay in the morning. Because I have a grilfriend and a son that merit my full attention and consciouness...

So I will go cold turkey with the help of the Ativan and hopefully you guys, it has to end now so I can fully appreciate what life has been giving to me. From now on, I won't be a lurker, I'll be fully with you guys, helping or getting help... 

Together.

This post took me 2 hours to write, sorry if confusing, but I am listening for advice on how to make it through... on that note I am going to feed my baby and I will be right back...

Even though my health and all of my personal relationships would crash and burn, I never once let it affect my work. It made sense to me. Who needs nagging family members and guilt tripping girlfriends? Why get hung up over health issues when we're all going to die some day anyway? They bring misery, but drinking makes me happy. But no matter what, I needed my job. Drinking costs money, and I wouldn't be able to partake if I ever found myself standing at the unemployment line.

Then one day it did affect my work. I only drank at night. There were days when I went in to work with debilitating hangovers, but after popping a couple of Tylenols and a pot of coffee later, I was functional again. But not this time. This time, I wasn't just hungover. I met up some of my friends from college - people that I hadn't seen in years. I wanted to live like I was 21 again.

My friends certainly looked different. There were receding hairlines, expanding guts, slightly deeper wrinkles around the corners of their eyes. I was no exception. The difference was that unlike me, the rest of them now had wives and children. None of them drank like the way we used to. A couple of hours and laughs later, they started to go home. Got to get home to the wife and kids. You're pussy whipped! I know I know. Stay for one more drink. I can't, I've got to work tomorrow. Also my wife will kill me.

One by one, they all went home. Then it was just me and the two cute bartenders. Bars don't have closing time in Korea. There is no last call. The bar closes when the last paying customer has walked out the door. I'm sure the bartenders were tired and wanted to go home. I didn't care. I was having a great time, even though I was alone. By the time I came out, it was 7:30AM.

I should have called in sick. Went home and taken a shower. But I decided to go in to work anyway. Still wearing the same clothes from the previous day/night and stinking of whiskey and cigarettes, I went to work. I messed up. I said things I shouldn't have said to the wrong people. I have been placed on indefinite suspension pending a review.

Today is Day 3. Or it will be once the day is over. Last night, like clockwork, as soon as the clock struck 9PM, I felt the old familiar thirst.  So I started listening to this podcast I just started. I was introduced to the concept of an alcoholic's birthday. It stopped me from going out to get hammered.

I've made a mess of things. I need to fix things and take responsibility for myself. I don't know if I will succeed. This isn't the first time I've tried to quit drinking. So I keep telling myself, ""One day at a time.""",7

here goes:

\-

up, dry-  

&#x200B;

I drank calmly from the lake 

sipped quietly its water 

clear 

&#x200B;

I learned to swim the lake

to gently, kick

& stroke

&#x200B;

I learned to paddle

&#x200B;

I brought a boat

&#x200B;

I sailed its water 

calmly growing 

adapting, navigating the water

&#x200B;

to an ocean

from such a simple stream 

I paddled, 

to a river,

I, fearless

as rapids pressured, swelled against me

found safety in my boat

&#x200B;

to an ocean

potent the water 

urged all attention 

blighted ignorance of its furor

mighty was the water 

the ocean 

so removed from the lake

&#x200B;

gently I became uneven

knocking storms’ wind against my paddle

cursing the water I had followed 

what lead me to these waves 

&#x200B;

pitching the spray 

wiping my eyes clean of such vicious salt 

stinging

with vision dimming and strength 

fit for the lake 

&#x200B;

but, this ocean

&#x200B;

water, the saltwater,

buoyant and blue and green and white

inching, it filled my lungs 

covered my skin 

held fast my hands 

feet 

as I tried to swim as I had learned on the lake

&#x200B;

sinking, no 

no more was a lake these waters

no stream rearward

I cannot swim

&#x200B;

for sand and stone I howl

as what water I carry inside

is added to this ocean 

&#x200B;

the salt water

it doesn’t lift me 

this day

I only came across this thread an hour ago or so, and reading through it all, you’re all extremely motivating & inspiring to me.

I don’t drink alcohol personally, but your determination is amazing. You can do it! 

I’m 23 years old and both my parents separated when I was 2 and both became dependent on alcohol. My dad for about 10 years, he managed to finally quit the booze 12 years ago and celebrated it the other day! I asked him what his top tips were and he said the below. 

- TALK. Don’t be ashamed of the social stigma surrounding those who depend on alcohol, there’s always people and support groups to discuss it with.

- If you can, substitute it with something else. In my dads case, he liked the ice cold of lagers when he got home. In the beginning, he drank non-alcoholic shandy but now has a Diet Coke. 
 
- Don’t be ashamed.
 
Honestly, you guys inspire me as you’ve opened up on such a sensitive issue. It’s very close to my heart on this particular topic as my mother lost her battle to alcoholism in early 2018 and died due to Liver failure.

I am seeking an online alcohol (+opioid addiction+little bits of everything else) recovery program/group that is nonprofit/free (or asks for only optional dues/donations). My ideal would be replicating via Skype or some other program a meeting that is regular and community/discussion-based e.g. AA or NA (but not limited to 12-step programs; I am very open to alternatives). I've been part of forums such as this one in the past, but I'm looking for something more intensive and personal right now. If you care to know the reasoning for my limitation, please see the below paragraph--if you'd rather drop some info on me straightaway, go on ahead.

I'm an American expatriate and opiate addict, alcoholic, and among various other things, and I am currently in a buprenorphine MAT program in Southeast Europe. My doctors speak English here, but no one else in the program does. I have experimented with 12-step programs in the past, and I've always dropped them almost immediately. However, I now realize I need more community than I have access too. In addition, I recently read The Recovering by Leslie Jamison and it made want me want to give it a real shot. However, because of my career, I am usually in countries where few people speak English, and there are certainly no NA/AA groups that do so. I do my best to learn the local languages, but there's a long way from being passably conversational and being able to understand and spell out your deepest feelings, urges, and horrors, so I usually have no option to attend local meetings.

I have recently fallen off the wagon after a period of semi-sobriety, and I rather feel I am underneath its wheels. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Thank you for any and all guidance.",10

The truth is - more than anything - I just liked getting drunk. It was just a plus if it didn't taste awful.

Meanwhile I really love the taste of so many other drinks: good coffee, hot green tea, ice cold lemon water etc. Soft drinks are not boring! (Although they feel like that, if all that's available is Coke). In the UK, you can buy really nice ginger beer in the supermarket which I'm making an effort to buy for parties and social occasions - then, I genuinely look forward to drinking it.

Being sober I am making time to treat myself: instead of drinking bad coffee, I go out of my way to find good coffee. I spend time to buy lemons and make ice cold lemon water (so refreshing). It feels like such a rich and nourishing treat which I saviour. I do not feel like I'm missing out by not drinking alcohol.  

What non-alcoholic drinks you do you love? What do you drink during social occasions?

I remember hitting a little past three weeks last January when when I did the ol' dry month.  When I got a bit past that three week point I actually started to think ""Hmnmmmm.  I might actually just go sober entirely.""  I really liked it.  At the time I was only trying to quit for the month and was not thinking about long-term stuff.  I totally botched it on Feb. 1 and drank way too much and kept doing so on the weekends.  Tried to take April off, failed.  Tried Dry July and made it two weeks.  Tried Sober October and failed that too.  I keep having these ideas of ""Oh yeah, I will just do Dry January in 2020 and that will reset me and I will be drinking like a normal person (whatever the heck that means).  This does not need to be forever,"" but the reality is that these few weeks have been great.  I mean they have been HARD, not just because of trying not to drink (which has been a struggle a few times), but because of work, family, deaths, wedding planning, holidays, general anxiety, and the emotions which have not been addressed for a while.  All of these, though, are real life.  REAL LIFE.  Not imagined like the intoxicated perceptions I was having.  Living my life means feeling all of it.  ALL of it.  We have anxiety for a purpose.  We have stress, and anger, and sadness, and remorse, and guilt, and regret, and joy, and humour for a purpose.  We are not supposed to live our lives intoxicated.  That is fake, unnatural.  Yes, I know, alcohol and weed and mushrooms and tobacco do form naturally, but those objects are not supposed to be the basis around which our lives revolve.  If life revolves around two glasses of wine at the end of the day, or the need to take shrooms before a concert, or do Four Horsemen shots at the bar to elevate our good time, or have a cigarette while driving, or weed to appreciate a comedy show then we are altering life to fit the drug, not using the drug to alter our consciousness.  When we do that the drug takes over and everything else is second.  I am first.  My sobriety is first.  My confidence is first.  My peace of mind is first.  Only through that can I be of use to anyone else, and I want to put them first as well.  Thank You.",16

So this month I decided to do ""dry January"" as I decided I drink far too much, usually about 3-4 cans of beer a night because it helps me fall asleep, sometimes more on the weekend and I've done this now for like 2 and a half years. I've started worrying my liver will be shot if I carry this on for another 5-10 years.

The first days of getting to sleep were so bad but I wasn't bothered as I didn't need to be at work. Once I returned to work I was already 4 days sober and my sleep was improving massively, the next 6 days after that I was sleeping so good. In total I'd done 10 days of no drinking... that is a long stint for me, I haven't done a stint like that in like 3 years!

So I was 10 days in of not having a drink until I gave into the devil last Friday as I was out with a lot of friends I hadn't seen in a long time. The following Saturday I had no drink, I fell asleep fairly easy because I was tired and hungover. But on Sunday getting to sleep was horrible, I was boiling hot because I was getting frustrated I couldn't sleep and had work in the morning.

Now the following Monday and Tuesday I've given in to the devil because I'm paranoid my sleep is gonna be terrible again and I need to be attentive and speaking to customers all day so being a tired zombie isn't ideal + I've got the drive so driving tired isn't exactly ideal... I intend to start again on the weekend, I'm really annoyed I've fucked my sleeping up again.

I'm on leave at my sister's place and she would have no problem if I was to drink my usual bottle of wine every night for the week that I am here, but I haven't had any... I feel I don't need it. I'm enjoying our dinners together, and watching tear jerker movies. The best of all, is that I will remember this quality time. 

I think she's proud of me, and so far I am super proud. I go home on Thursday and that's when I suspect the triggers will start. But I reckon if I keep working the program and I maintain my mindfulness and journal my thinking/beliefs behind the triggers, I'll be ok.

After all it's only a 30 day experiment after which I can choose which is better - a life of nothingness or one of freedom with endless possibilities.",1

I've regained all the weight I lost, feel more unhealthy than I did when I first quit in Sept. 2018, and am searching hard for the strength I had the first time around to make it six months.  I had never made it that far before, and now it seems inconceivable to get there again.  

I will hang in there.  I will make it. Mistakes are human and do not need to be the end of a journey. I just need to remember these facts.",3

Came home though and my wife was having a drink, and damn, that made me want one. I powered through it for a bit, telling myself no. Then, I went and grabbed a bottle of bourbon, a glass of ice and a coke. Took the cap off of the bourbon and took a smell, it smelled good to me. Like perfection.

I put the cap back on, but the glass of ice down, filled up my water bottle and didn't give into the temptation. But damn if it wasn't close and damn if I didn't want that glass.

I just knew in the back of my mind though that it wasn't gonna taste as good as I imagined, that I didn't want to reset the timer, that I didn't really want what a drink would do, and that one would soon be followed by an empty bottle in a day or two.

This has been happening a lot lately where he talks about something we did and I have no recollection, but this one hurt. 

He told me the restaurant we were at, a little romantic french place. We had finished our meal, and he took a gift out of his pocket. It was a necklace. He helped me put it on. He said I smiled, took his hand, and told him. It honestly wrecked me because I do remember that restaurant, but what I remember is that it took them 30min to bring our bottle of wine, and then just bits and pieces of the meal. I ""remembered"" after he told me, and some pieces I do, but not the way I should. 

I am struggling a bit on day 5, and then I started thinking about this story again. I want to live a life I can remember. I want to be a present partner.

Seems like a weird thing to say to some people... but others get it.

I only watched them once because I didn't get shitfaced and blackout or pass-out during each viewing attempt. I didn't start the same movie or episode 3 or 4 times and start drinking, only to realize later I drink so much I pass out at the same point each time. Oy.

Such a weird feeling to think back on shows and movies I used to watch (and love!) when I was drinking and realize I don't really know what happened. Friends would bring up a plot point in a show and I wouldn't know what the hell they were talking about. Game of Thrones seasons 2-5 are very, very fuzzy due to my ""Sunday Funday"" bullshit habit/excuse for self-destruction.

So glad to have a clear mind and a happy heart now.

3 days short of my 40 day mark, I had a siesta and a funny weird dream cropped up to do with the symbolism of 40 days etc involving me, the Devil, the Moderation Pixie and Drunkenness. Never let it be said that sobriety stops weird thoughts :) I wrote it up for my entertainment and to mark 40 days, which is going to come on Friday, whoever and whatever happens. If you’re into a bit of writing for fun also, maybe it’ll keep you company over a cup of tea and a biscuit too 😉 

&#x200B;

**The Devil And Me**  
 

‘What is he actually doing?’ said the Devil in an irritated tone. ‘He looks… what’s that word again?’

‘Happy?’ said the Moderation Pixie, blowing her bangs up off her forehead.

‘Happy,’ slurred Drunkenness. ‘I bloody hate happy.’

The Devil shifted his bottom along the rocky ledge upon which the three of them were perched and peered down into the desert below. 

‘Look,’ he said, filing idly at a claw with a spare Wrist Bone of the Tormented, ‘it’s not that you two haven’t been doing a pretty fair job of it all, all things considered, for quite a while now.’

‘Since the dawn of mankind, boss,’ said Drunkenness.

‘Yes, yes, but I mean, just look at him, will you, he looks *healthy*. He looks that happy thing you were mentioning a minute ago and if my eyes do not deceive me, I just saw him smile. That’s not normal in your charges, is it?’

The Moderation Pixie flicked an imaginary speck of desert dust off her green velvet skirt and chewed at the inside of her lip. Half a second later, she found herself experiencing the deep displeasure of gazing deep into the flaming red eyes of her employer, the Father of Lies and Deceiver of the Whole World.

‘Yes?’ inquired the Devil. 

‘Well, the thing is,’ said the Pixie, squirming, ‘taking everything into account…’

‘Yes?’

‘Approaching things from all angles…’

‘I’m waiting, Moderation,’ said the Devil, calmly pushing two inches of his talon tips into the bare rock surface.

‘Strictly speaking, he’s not one of ours anymore,’ squeaked the Pixie. She screwed up her face and waited for all consuming hellfire or the familiar zap of an old fashioned lightning bolt. Being immortal had its advantages vis a vis coming back ‘round again, but it didn’t stop it hurting like well, hell, just before you did. 

‘I do beg your pardon?’ said the Devil, crossing one hoof over the other. 

‘It’s not our fault, boss,’ blurted Drunkenness. ‘The cunning little sods *have started talking to each other*.’

‘What?’

‘Over that internet thingy.’

‘Oh, well, yes the internet, one of my better ones that,’ said the Devil. ‘Billions of pointless squabbles, oceans of irritation and ridiculous arguments. Single handedly made people get even crosser with politicians as if anyone thought that could ever be possible. Amazing. By the way, did I ever tell you how I invented the selfie?’

‘Yes,’ said the Moderation Pixie and Drunkness together and just a little too quickly.

There was a crack of thunder and on the horizon of the desert plain below a row of trees burst into flame. 

The Angel of the Abyss licked one of his 9 inch long canines and tutted. ‘You were saying,’ he said.

‘Erm, oh yes, sorry yer Lordship,’ said Drunkenness. ‘It’s just this Stop Drinking Reddit lot. They’re talking to each other. They’re bloody *explaining* stuff to each other.’

‘They’re being supportive,’ said the Pixie in a small voice. 

The Devil looked at the man on the floor of the desert far below. He had spread a rug out before him and appeared to be unpacking things. 

‘Now, I know I may be a little traditional, what with being the Dark Lord, the Purveyor of Disaster, the Bringer of Broken Dreams, the Herald of Heartbreak,’ he said. ‘But if that man thingummyjig…’

‘Reclaimingmydays?’ said the Pixie with a sour look on her face. 

‘If Reclaimingmydays is in torment and enduring the hardship of 40 days and 40 nights out in the wilderness, then will one of you explain to me why he appears to be preparing a picnic and whistling?’

Storm clouds gathered overhead, and more thunder rumbled in the distance.

‘But that’s the point,’ said the Pixie desperately, ‘that Stop Drinking lot have been talking to him, they’ve educated him. He’s not out lonely in the wilderness, he’s 40 days sober!’

Drunkenness pulled a hugely offended face and was sick over the side of the cliff-face. 

The Devil turned to the Moderation Pixie and explained very slowly, as if to a small child, ‘Which is where you come in, is it not, telling him that he’s done a very good job and should now have a lovely single drink, a maximum of two, to celebrate his newfound control. Then he falls down the hole and is ours again. Simple. That is your *job* Pixie; it is why I invented you. For heavens’ sake, do I have to remind everyone of everything all the time around here?’

‘But I did that Lord,’ stammered the Pixie, playing with her triangle-cut hem and wishing she could just go back to being a snake again for a couple of millennia. You knew where you were with a bit of solid slithering. ‘I did my best routine and, well…’

‘Yes,’

‘He told me to “get knotted” and that he didn’t believe in me,’ she said wrinkling her nose and causing a sprinkle of sparkle dust to fall down her front.

‘I see,’ said the Devil with a seismic growl. ‘And, pray, where did he get that idea?’

‘Stop Drinking,’ said Drunkenness. They are right bunch of sods, I’m telling you.’

The Devil drew himself up to his feet and inspected the figure below. The man appeared to be singing a song but then the man stopped, stood up himself and waved his sandwich up at the Devil.

‘Did he just shout what I think he did?’ said the Devil very slowly.

‘Surely not, Lord,’ said the Pixie, waiting for incineration. 

‘He bloody well did,’ said the Devil. ‘So, I suggest the two of you come and have a closer discussion about this with me *downstairs*…’  


As the three immortal beings disappeared in a flash of molten smoke and fire and with a whiff of eternal sulfur, the sound carried from the man, across the desert floor and climbed up the cliff wall overlooking it. It had lost quite a lot of its strength travelling that distance, but when it arrived it was the voice of a contented man, quite happy, enjoying life. And if you listened carefully, you could just make out the words which were…    
 

‘I can see you old bastards, and you’ve got nothing on me now, so now *you can all go and sod off*! Hahahah!’  


Back down on the desert floor, the man took another bite of his sandwich and grinned. It looked like it was going to turn out nice again. He chewed and he smiled and with a sip of crystal cold LaCroix, he planned what to do for the rest of the afternoon. And evening. And, yes, for the rest of his life.",8

2020-01-14 16:23:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eorr1f/alternatives_and_poor_sleepnight_sweats/,Alternatives And Poor Sleep/Night Sweats,"Just a couple of things that are completely unrelated to one another, but are both related to quitting drinking. 

Most of us by now know that the biggest struggle, or one of the biggest struggles, with quitting alcohol is getting a good nights sleep. You might be waking up with debilitating anxiety, like myself, or having very unpleasant vivid dreams, also like myself. 

I have tried in earnest to really work through the sleep issues when it comes to stopping drinking. This means I’m not taking anti-anxiety medication, I am not taking sleeping medication. Keep in mind products like NyQuil and ZeeQuil do actually contain small amounts of alcohol.

Try this, as it has really helped me: move to a different part of your house and attempt to go to sleep again. If I am struggling to sleep in our master bedroom or if my mind is too busy, I will move Myself to the sectional couch in our front room. It’s not an immediate fix, but it does seem to work. I’m not sure why it helps, but sometimes changing just your location is all you need.

Also, this is huge, add an extra blanket.

I have been recently experiencing cold sweats at night. I have been drinking heavily for at least 10 years, and I have never experienced full on cold sweats to the point that your sheets are soaked. I thought that was honestly something that people just read about in books. I’m dry now, and have been dry before. Idk why my body is now freaking out. Woke up to soaked sheets last night

I think another thing that I would like to validate is that I rarely have good dreams. At best my dreams are neutral but confusing, often times they are bad but not necessarily nightmares. Sometimes I do experience nightmares.

I have dreams of being on ships that are thrown about the oceans, airplanes that are crashing, amusement park roller coasters that I am not appropriately strapped into. This would pretty obviously point to a lack of control with my life, which I understand, but it doesn’t make it any less frightening when trying to push through.

If you need to go to sleep on a towel, go to sleep on a towel. If you wake up you can remove the damp towel and at least give your sheets another chance.

I would strongly recommend listening to ASMR videos, you can search them on YouTube. If ASMR is a new concept to you, simply type into the search bar and figure out what helps you the most. Binaural beat songs or music can also be highly effective. 

Good luck",6
2020-01-14 16:07:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eoriv0/my_interests_are_changing/,My interests are changing?,"I used to drink pretty much every night. Usually around a 6 pack each day. I did that for years but I havent drank in a few weeks now. One thing I have noticed since I quit is that many of the interests I had when drinking have very little appeal to me. I'm not really depressed, like I have zero interest in anything. However, I am very bored with my old hobbies and whatnot. For example, for the last decade I have been very interested in technology news. I have always read up on the latest updates on sites like CNET and The Verge. But suddenly, I don't care about any of that. I also used to spend tons of time watching videos on YouTube but I haven't really done that in weeks. And the one or two times I have, I don't want to watch anything on the channels I have been subscribed to for years. Same with playing video games. That is what I used to do most nights whole drinking. Now I have no interest in anything video game related. Even the music I was listening to is quite dull and I have been trying other styles and bands. Again, it's not that I have lost all interest in everything. I just don't care about a lot of the ""old stuff"" anymore. 

It hasn't been that long since I last drank, in the grand scheme of things, so maybe it is difficult to draw a conclusion but has anyone else experienced this when they got sober? It just seems like much of my ""old life"" is unappealing and I want something different. I did not expect such a thing.",5

But I'm only 6 days fresh out of rehab and am feeling pretty lost. Introduction,"Hi, I've been looking for an online recovery community and ended up here.  I really gave AA a go in my city but have found it just isn't going to work for an introvert like me.  Could just be the local community too.  Anyways I'm new to online communities but just hoping to make some friends and give/receive support.  

&#x200B;

So I was in a residential rehab for 90 of my sober days, and by the end of it I was feeling like I had gotten reasonably comfortable being sober.  But since I left I've been feeling like every day is day one all over again.    

  

I am returning to a pretty drastically different life than I had before I checked in to rehab.  After living with my boyfriend for the past 6 years, I'm in a SLE with 3 roommates, 12 housemates total. His new place is about an hour away, and his lease won't be up until May so I've got to find a way to make this SLE a home to me.   I also am used to spending a lot of time with the family I have here, we were always very close, but they have stepped away and we haven't talked in months.  They did some collective decision so it is ALL of them.  AND I had to leave my job and the company I've been at for 7 years.  Now I don't know where to begin job searching, I don't know if I even want to stay in my field.  But I have to be out of the SLE every day from 9-4pm and I'm feeling pretty weird going to the library for 8 hours a day.  

  

Like I said, I'm an extreme introvert, I miss my space and my privacy, DESPERATELY.  It is loud, all these big personalities fit in close quarters.  I am not good with crowds or making lots of new friends all the time.  I've always had a the small circle of really good friends.  Just being at the house is stressful and feels like so much pressure to me, I pretend to nap a lot to have something like ""alone time"" as possible, and then feel self conscious about whether they think I sleep too much.  

  

 I just don't know what to do with myself and everything, everywhere, and everyone, feels extremely uncomfortable.  My anxiety is through the roof and I'm having involuntary crying spells all the time.  I have no safe place.    

  

Luckily I don't want a drink.  It would only make my anxiety worse because I just can't drink the way I like to (black out for days type binge) and have somewhere to live or a way to earn money or maintain any relationships.  Drinking ""moderately"" is scarier than sobriety for sure.  And I like being in recovery, I want to get through this adjustment.   

I just got a suggestion to start hiking to break up my day, which I'm definitely going to start tomorrow.  I do have a car, a tiny bit of spending money, but not enough for a gym membership or things like that.  I can get a 24-48 hour pass once a week, starting in next weekend. 

&#x200B;

  

I just wanted to vent mainly.  If anyone has advice or can relate I'd love to hear it.  Or more suggestions for what I could do with my time, where I could go?  Looking forward to meeting everyone.  That's all!",5

Mom wanted to catch the wild west saloon show. Stood there waiting for it to start while people bustled up to the bar to grab their drinks before the start of the show. A man walks right up and stands next to me. The breeze coming from the door hit that giant glass of beer he was holding and wafted right up into my nostrils. Damn it smelled so good. SO GOOD. My mind raced. All I wanted was to walk up to that bar and get one too. I miss it. I want it. The show would be so much better if I had a beer in my hand like everyone else. But really, it wouldn't. I calmed myself. And really looked around. There was a family, like mine, except they had kids. The adults had beers flowing like there was no more alcohol on the planet. They were loud and seemed to enjoy that others were staring and watching them. The poor kids looked miserable. Glorious thrill rides all around yet these kids were stuck in this saloon with their drunk ass parents who didn't seem to give 2 sh*ts about them. The Dad interrupted the act 3 times. Yelling things at the performers and laughing loud enough for people outside to hear with his red face and bloodshot eyes. The 3 ladies with him were similar in the embarrassing ways. Loud, cackling, making snide comments about the performance. All I could think was damn. I really wanted that beer but just look at those people....that's exactly who it would make me too. One beer would turn into 3, 6, maybe even 10. I would ruin my day and more than likely make a fool out of myself. I switched spots with my sis, got away from wafting beer man, and attempted to enjoy the rest of the show while I stuck that image of the family in my backup files. I don't ever want to be like that again. I won't forget the look on those poor kids faces. I wish I could save them but that's none of my business I guess.

I woke up and forced myself to the gym before heading in to see my therapist. She already knew some of what happened but I walked through everything again.

All of the events of last week, sick kids, not being able to get out of the house to the gym, lack of sleep all contributed to a high level of anxiety to the point where I took that first drink and it made all of the feelings go away and I wanted to keep them away and continued to drink. Those triggers launched me into the spiral.  Alternatively because I knew I wasn't in the best place I shouldn't have gone out at all on Saturday night and instead stayed home to catch up on sleep.

I need to focus on allowing myself self care and forgiving myself instead of taking so much on I break. I'm forcing myself to slow down when I begin to start wanting a drink or feeling out of control.

Back then, during my first 4 month stretch of sobriety, I was overseas going through an unwanted divorce from the love of my life (a high functioning alcoholic), my Dad was dying from alcohol related liver cancer back here in USA, and I was completely isolated from anyone and anything familiar. My sobriety was the only thing in my life I felt I had any control over as my world crumbled around me, and I held onto it for dear life and made it out alive and sober, and my son and I returned home to America shortly after the divorce was finalized. 

Although losing my husband and suddenly becoming a single parent with sole physical custody of our young son was the singlemost most painful thing I ever experienced, and I'm still hurting from the loss of him as my partner and miss my ex to this day, I realize in retrospect it was for the best, since we were both enabling each other's drinking during our marriage. I'll always love him and be grateful to him for having the balls to pull the trigger on the divorce first, because it allowed me the time and space to go through absolute hell alone, find my inner strength, and metamorphosize from an overweight, entitled, depressed, unconfident, codependent, ""it's wine o'clock somewhere"" housewife, to the strong, healthy, active, happy, confident, sober, independent, employed, resilient-as-fuck badass solo Mom of a woman I am today. I'm sure I'll find a partner at some point who I can share my new life with and respects everything I overcame, but for now, I'm content being single and alone, because I finally like who I am as a person and I can be comfortable with my own company.

Although I did the whole moderation mambo thing once we returned to USA, surrounded by my family and friends who drink, with a month sober in April out of respect for my late father (the month he died gruesomely from his drinking), I managed to only get drunk maybe 2-3 times total before I cut myself off completely again in early September 2019, and have stuck with it ever since.

This time around, I chose to go back to sobriety because I had so many positive things happening in my life that I wanted to do everything I could to maintain my upward trajectory, and keep improving myself. It's not a decision made out of a lack of control in my life like it was the first time around; this time it's quite the opposite. I have complete control over my life now, and I want to assure alcohol will never have control over me or hurt anyone I love ever again. I chose to become a better person.

I'm fighting every day to stick to my guns and keep booze out of my life, and it's been paying off in spades. Even though there's still plenty of challenges and struggles in my day to day life, currently and inevitably in the future, I'm no longer just angry at things and controlling of others, because I finally have happiness I've created on my own and have control over myself. 

And that, my friends, is the best reason I've found (so far!) to stay sober. Alcohol robs you of your ability to be truly happy and to control your life; sobriety gives those back to you, free to steer yourself in any direction you please and smile through the traffic jams. I'm choosing to steer my life straight forward, and not get pissed off at the speed bumps and potholes along the way.

Here's to nearly 4 months sober for me, guys, and, god willing, many more months, years, and decades to come.

I know I should remove all obstacles from my sobriety. But I also want to support him.   Can’t go into any details without revealing personal info but where we are is very isolating for SAHD. And these types of events are the main way to socialize.

I’d like to tell myself I can stop and then just drink occasionally but I’m afraid what that might lead to. I usually just drink 8 or 9 beers until I pass out. How did any of you guys figure out 1.  How to stop drinking. 2.  Enjoy anything again because I don’t enjoy anything but drinking. 3. How to go about having a social life without drinking.

Long term sobriety, anything over a month, has been a challenge for me since I was a teenager. Though back then I was a little more cautious with binge drinking. Now, I pretty efficiently move from zero drinks a day to 18 or so in a few days.

The ridiculous part is I've been very health conscious for about 8 years. I dropped a lot of weight, focused heavily on what I eat, and exercised. During this time though, I would regularly binge drink. Slowly, drinking replaced all my good habits.

If anyone happens to follow what I've been writing for the last 3 months, you would know that I have had a LAUNDRY list of health issues because of my drinking.  In fact, I almost didn't make it...

I never plan on drinking again.  I joined a super fancy gym and have been working out almost daily.  I lost 65lbs in the recovery process (not good, all water weight, 6'3"" 200lbs down to 136lbs) so now I am working on gaining weight back and putting on mass / muscle.  I've been eating healthy, counting calories, etc...

Yesterday, I visited my primary care physician.  The last time I was there (two weeks ago), he said he didn't feel I needed to get blood work done because I was progressing pretty well... I said eagerly, ""can I get it anyway!?  Please?!""  So I did.  My levels are better than ever, even prior to being sick.  He asked if I had seen my gastro doc since the hospital, and I said no, I have an appt with him next week.  He said ""I have a feeling they are going to be shocked!""  He told me I have made incredible, almost unbelievable progress in the last 3 months.

I left so happy and excited.  Follow up again in two weeks and I asked to get blood work done again.  I told him I get excited now to see the results haha.  I know I can go at 7am and have the results back early morning the next day.  I look and compare them to all the past tests... I just feel so good about myself and how the situation took a complete 180, when it literally should've all been over for me...

I'd like to credit my gorgeous wife, my family and friends for being so supportive of me in this journey and always being eager to hear how things are.  No better feeling in THE WORLD than to be ALIVE and WELL and HEALTHY and STRONG!!!

Like many in this group I started drinking at an early age. For fun because that’s what kids do. No real problems so didn’t think drinking was all that bad. It was just what we did when we got together with friends. We never needed a special occasion to enjoy booze & it was fun till it wasn’t. Somewhere along the way it stopped being fun, but it was difficult to stop. 

Fast forward to today I realize alcohol is shit. It’s a thief that takes more than it gives. That there is no justifiable reason to drink anymore. I’m 3 weeks sober & I keep asking myself when will I feel normal again? If I’m completely honest with myself do I even know what normal is? How long does it take? What would it look like? Is the grass greener? 

I don’t post much in this group, but I’m here daily. Don’t do AA & not sure if it’s something to add to the toolbox at some point. For now SD is working so...

Last night, I was home at a reasonable hour, fell asleep by midnight, and was up like a Disney Princess all chipper singing to the birds at 7 am no problem. This is DEFINITELY a benefit. I think maybe I am finally getting my pink cloud? The first two weeks I kind of felt like low key ass. Not withdrawals or anything just tired and cranky.

Gonna finish out this Dry January and go from there. It's good to know i CAN stop drinking and it honestly hasn't been that hard. It has given me a lot of self confidence. I'll deal with February 1st when it gets here, but I definitely have a different mindset now.

2020-01-14 09:19:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eolups/new_here_input_appreciated/,New here: input appreciated.,"Hi all,


I am new to this subreddit & I guess my motivation for joining was to share the experiences of others & maybe to see the advice & assurances of you guys as well.


I feel like I am more of a binge drinker than someone that has a problem with constantly drinking. From Monday to Thursday I can abstain without much effort but from about lunchtime on Friday I am just thinking about how many beers I can put away over the weekend. A case of 500ml cans could easily disappear over the course of one weekend just sitting in at home, not to mention going out to the pub – my problem has always been one’s too many & a hundred’s not enough.


Not remembering going to bed, and not remembering stuff like locking the doors or turning off houselights because I am too hammered is getting old with me, and though I don’t get the “feeling sick” hangovers, I do find I utterly lack motivation to do much of anything the next day. And as I get older (I’m 40) I find it’s bloating me out the next day too.


I don’t think I never want to drink again, I feel like the most reasonable thing for me to do at this stage is to drastically cut back on my drinking on non-special occasions. For example, my friends and I are going to the rugby in the middle of February so I have given myself the task or remaining sober until then & then I will allow myself some pints at the match. I wouldn’t say “rewarding” myself because that implies I am only doing something in order to get the drink at the end.


Thanks for letting me get this off my chest, if you have any words, opinions or advice they’d be appreciated in good faith.",9

I work nights 7p-7a and my usual routine was to stop at one of my local liquor stores after work. I told myself it was to get snacks but I always bought the same thing. I bought sadness in a bottle and took it home convinced it was going to help me sleep. You see, I didn’t want the alcohol, I needed the alcohol. I’m a nurse and I needed it to help me sleep. I needed it to help me get through the rest of my day. I couldn’t be an alcoholic because I had a legitimate reason, to drink. I’m different. My situation is different and because it’s “so” different I couldn’t possibly have a problem. 
This was what I told myself. At least this is what my addiction kept telling me. And yesterday was the first morning that I had to face my addiction and fight for my sobriety. And to make it worse, I absolutely HAD to stop at a store (that sold liquor) before I went home because I needed to get ice for the house and snacks for my kid’s school lunch. For the first 11 days of my sobriety I had successfully managed to avoid liquor stores,  but this morning, it was unavoidable. 
Driving home from work is when my addiction started negotiating with my sober-self; explaining how well I’d done so far, how great 10 days of sobriety was, and how since I had already “proven I can be sober” for 10 days then I obviously don’t have a problem and thus I “deserve” a drink! 
My addiction reminded me that I needed to get some “good” sleep ( I had been awake for 28 hrs) because I needed to wake up early to pick the kids up from school. My addiction was so concerned about my well being. Addiction is nice like that! That is why it had become my closest and most reliable friend! 
Well, my addiction got a rude awakening yesterday because no matter how loud and how often she whispered encouraging words of relapse in my ear, I fought back. She was determined, she was convincing, & she had beaten me down. I was so beaten down that I had gone from saying (to myself), “I will not drink TODAY, to “I will not drink “THIS SECOND!” I could only promise myself seconds of sobriety, not minutes, not hours and certainly not days because I truly didn’t know if I could do it! 

I was driving home from work and I still had to go to the liquor store, and walk out without liquor! 

I was so scared! I was physically, emotionally & mentally exhausted, but I was still alive and as long as I’m alive I have hope. It was this hope that gave me an idea. I would race home, pick up my kids and take them to the grocery store with me before school! I knew that if I had the kids with me, I couldn’t buy alcohol! I knew they would ask me why I needed to buy a bottle of tequila at 8 am on a Monday morning. I also knew I was going to be too tired after dropping them off at school to stop and buy tequila. That was when I knew I was going to make it. I knew that at least I was not going to drink THIS MORNING, and, if I could get through the morning, I could get through the afternoon, and if I could get through the afternoon, I could make it through the night! 

Well, here I am, in the early morning hours of my 12th day of sobriety to remind you that the battle can be won. 
You will have to fight for it. It will be hard. But every second leads to every minute, which will bring you to the next hour & the next day.  And every day of sobriety is a victory.",340

I reckon I felt that feeling most of the time I drank for the first few years because I would only ever drink on the weekends and with people I loved to have fun with. 

As I got older I continued to chase that feeling but in isolation and with higher amounts of alcohol. By the time I stopped drinking (66 days ago) I was spending almost all of my free time chasing that feeling and I think I maybe achieved it once or twice a year while sitting alone by myself discovering new music and drinking. 

The amount of time and energy I put into drinking to just try and fill the hole was killing me slowly. It was kind of like gambling, just throwing all my cash into a poker machine hoping that one day I’d hit the jackpot and get a rush. 

Since putting down the bottle I am no longer chasing.I am learning to sit still, sure I won’t get that rush again but I also won’t waste my life chasing it while killing myself. The average day is now much better and is getting more enjoyable everyday. IWNDWYT",29

It inspires me so maybe I can try,"Hello I’m a twenty one year old female and it’s been 8 months since I quit. Drugs that is. Beginning of May, my parents took me out of my apartment and drove me to the emergency room where I had to list the substances that I consumed, upon which they immediately put me on Station 12. I also had suicidal thoughts.

I managed to get out of my toxic relationship with my addicted and Narcissistic ex-boyfriend and I stopped taking all drugs and I’m now on anti-depressants and in university 

Why I’m writing this here is because I still can’t stop drinking. I guess in the beginning I justified it to myself with, well I stopped every other mind altering substance, at least I should be allowed to drink. Life completely sober seems impossible. And it still seems impossible to me. I’m scared of being sober, for the nights to be clear and not hazy. 

But I’ve noticed how much my tolerance has gone up. I can probably easily drink 2 bottles of wine by myself. Other people have definitely noticed. And even though I try not to think about it, 6/7 days there’s alcohol in my life. Many nights I don’t completely remember. 

I don’t know how bad I am, but your community inspired me to see if I can try to stay sober till the end of this week. Thank you






Edit 1: I haven’t been on Reddit for long so I don’t know if you lovely people will see this.

But your comments made me cry. This support from people I don’t even know, it makes me feel so good. It makes me feel like I’m not alone. I’ve never encountered so much positivity on the internet without a single negative comment. 

TRIGGER WARNING 

The reason for my drug and alcohol abuse was that I was raped in 2017 by three unknown guys. And although I don’t really consciously feel it anymore, I think it affects my behavior a lot. 

I’m also sorry to say and to disappoint you all, but my best friend came over tonight with 2 bottles of wine, because I felt very depressed today. So today didn’t work. But I’m not giving up. all of your comments made me believe that I can do this. I want to. I really do. I don’t want to be subject to any substance. If I can quit drugs then I can fucking quit alcohol too. 

Ps: thankfully I’m in a European country so rehab would be for free included in my healthcare",146

Many of you have recommended Dan Harris’s books on mediation over this past year, *10% Happier* and *Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics* so I ordered the pair, which came as a set for a discount from Amazon, around the holidays. 

I don’t normally make new year resolutions. Not going along with such cultural traditions is part of my Rebel Persona (*rolls eyes*) so I just never have. But lately I’m rethinking my attitudes anyway so I resolved to start meditating this year. Also, 5 minutes +/- of sitting doing absolutely nothing is something easy enough that even I can commit to it. 

The books were pleasant, easy reads-- thumbs up from me-- and they got me going on it. I  have meditated each evening of 2020 for at least a few minutes. I’m terrible at it and my mind runs and runs but according to the author that is normal and part of the process and you have to just keep trying. So OK, I’m sucking at it, but already I do see benefits in it helping me recognize runaway negative or obsessive thoughts rather than let them just carry me off, as they are wont to do. One specific thing it is helping me with is slowing down my compulsive evening snacking. I think it would have helped me in early sobriety too. It might have helped me suffer less from the compulsion, which was something interesting Harris talked about. He talked about how meditation will probably not stop you from feeling pain or discomfort, but it is possible for it to help you suffer from it less. I found that distinction between discomfort and suffering interesting. Somehow I’d never really thought that through before.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I haven't been on Reddit for a while, and it's nice to peep these subreddits again. This is a great community. 

I need help. Please direct me to the right subreddit if this is the wrong one. 

My mom has struggled with serious mental health issues (PTSD, chronic depression, anxiety, maybe more), for a while. She's in her 50's now and had a rough childhood. Over the past 5-7 years I've seen her mental and physical health deteriorate. She doesn't drive, is dyslexic, and is physically weak from the last few years of health issues– one of them being breast cancer. She is thankfully cancer free now. I would like to highlight, she's an incredible painter and sculptor. 

She tried committing suicide recently, and has since been self medicating more and more with alcohol. I am the only member of my family not living in the same state (FL), so I sometimes detach, which is followed by guilt. She lives with my dad, who works full time, and my sister (23), who is a medical student also working at a hospital. They basically spend all of their free time taking care of her. 

I realized that I've felt like I am mourning her death, even though she is still physically here. It's been really hard. 

She calls me every once in a while while she's under the influence ranting about how useless, hopeless, and broken she is. It hurts so much and I can't take it anymore. 

Are there any resources you can recommend to me? We aren'y a rich family by any means, and for insurance she has AETNA / Medicaid in Florida, but I think we can make a financial sacrifice with credit cards? I have a good feeling she will accept treatment if it's in Florida. Are there any social workers  I can reach out to for help, or resources for finding the best treatment for her that accepts her insurance? 

Thanks for any help in advance, and thanks for letting me rant a bit. I haven't been able to talk about this with anyone, so I'm grateful for any advice or encouragement.",5

Before Ubering to the bar I killed a 6 pack of IPA. Once I got to the local bar ordered a huge 40+ ounce IPA in a growler.  Next thing I know I woke up the next morning...feeling like shit. I blacked out around 3pm and don’t remember anything after that. I asked myself “why did I have to do that...how can I be so stupid” I embarrassed myself at the bar and even went to 2 other bars and spent A LOT of $$. Things are getting really hard considering I uber’d home that night and then drove my car blacked out to get beer...I know this because I woke up with 3 empties in my car and a receipt. 

As Sunday progressed I began to beat myself up more and more, “How can I be so stupid” and “why do I have to drink that much” However, this is a horrible attitude to have. Today, I admit that I have a problem and I cannot control my drinking. I subconsciously don’t even think about the dangers of getting more and more drinks - it’s just something that happens.  I’ve realized that I’m not a person that can go out and have one drink without having tremendous urge to buy more alcohol.  So for tonight I will not drink and I will take one day at a time. I have goals to give up drinking entirely but I do not want to overwhelm myself right now....so one day at a time is my motto.  Stay sober my friends",20

I’ve been fighting this fight pretty much since I started drinking at age 19 about 15 (wow) years ago. 

And you know what? I’m only getting better at quitting, better at staying quit, better at healing, better at being a true, honest, good version of myself when sober, and better at connecting with communities of people who GET IT and help me counteract all the bullshit brainwashing society did to me about alcohol, including imbuing me with beliefs like: if I’m addicted to alcohol the problem lies within me, and not the chemically addictive poison that is present/accepted/expected everywhere we go and everywhere we look.  How’s THAT for a run-on sentence?!

I’m feeling great and 2020 is going to be the second time I go 12 months+ in a row of being sober. I’m ready, I need it, I want it, and I’m gonna work for it.

tl;dr tapering or getting sober isnt about drinking, its about safety and taking precautions like drinking things on schedule or choosing things that wont tempt you to break that schedule.  just my two cents this will prolly get removed by mods anyway im not too sure they like my tapering updates",8

Will everything reset with abstinence and return to normal levels? How long will the process take?

I have cut in half over the past week and feel fine!

Since cutting back:

1/2: 5 beers

1/3: 3.5 beers

1/4: 3 beers

1/5: 3 beers

1/6: 3 beers

1/7: 2 beers

1/11: 3 beers

1/12: 5 beers 

Today: none yet

Average 3.75 beers over the past 11 days... 

Am I ready to quit without withdrawals or do I need 2 beers to taper off the 5 and quit tomorrow?


Cut back to consuming 3 day I feel great, is it safe to pull the plug and cease consumption without experiencing crazy withdrawals?

It use to just be a cup of rice and 6 eggs, it then turned into 2 cups of rice and 12+ eggs or i get tacobell and spend 20$ and eat it all... 

This has led to some serious weight gain, i went from having visible abs 5 years ago to having a big beer gut, just last week i started going to the gym and looked at my stomach in the mirror and saw stretch marks near my belly button.. i look like im a few months pregnant... seeing that has made me go all in on losing weight at all costs.. I'm now going multiple days not eating, cutting back on the beer, still drinking but not as much. I've been hungover all day today because i drank last night but didn't eat anything. I made a protein dhake and drank a bunch of water but thats it.. 

I'm now more motivated then ever to quit drinking for good and live a healthier lifestyle, i just can't go cold turkey on the booz because nights that i don't drink the folliwing day at work im in a bad mood but the nights i do drink the following day I'm in a better mood.. i don't really understand it.

And I know 1 drink a night wasn’t much, but it was enough to get me drunk nightly at the time due to the meds I was on. 1 still gets me a solid buzz . I weigh 100lbs dammit, I’m a lightweight.. He also acted like the week of detoxing was in my head because I “wasn’t drinking enough for that” :| I literally didn’t even know what the hell was happening when I first experoced WDs. 


Today I brought up to my new therapist that I was starting to slip up with moderation and fall back on old habits. I said I kept breaking my “3 drinks a week rule” and she was just like “now is that a reasonable goal?” as if it was an uncomprehendingly small amount to allow myself.  3 drinks = 3 nights with a solid buzz or one night of partying. I went on to talk about how I needed alcohol to enjoy shows and shit, and how I’ve been slowely realizing that all my social activists that I do involve alcohol. She said it was normal for someone in their 20s and said it’d probably change once I was out of college. So, not a very good therapy session for someone who is looking for the inspiration to even want to quit. 


This is why I refuse to even give AA or anything similar a try. Like fuck me for being concerned about where this shit may lead in the future. I know my struggles are fuckin child’s play but i’d appreciate it if people a took me even a little bit seriously. But ya know I guess struggling with alcohol is just part of being in your 20s. This has all really made me want to just fuckin’ stop with trying to monitor my alcohol intake. I can’t do it alone, and I can’t get the support I need so I guess I’ll be back looking for help when things have progressed passed the beginning stages, when my tolerance has shot through the roof, and when I’m 30+ so my struggles are actually valid.",3

I would have insisted there must be someone else, that there HAS to be another girl. I hate to say it but I might have expressed suicidal thoughts to try and gain leverage.

But I didn't. I handled it with grace. I wiped his tears and told him it was ok. I thanked him for being honest with me. I told him I wish him nothing but the best.

I left. Didn't stop for a bottle even though the thought crossed my mind for the first time in a while. Went home, made a protein shake, put on my sneakers, went to the gym.

I definitely shed a few tears in the gym parking lot after my workout. But then I prayed. I thanked God that He has given me the strength the past 6 months to stay sober and become a more functional human being. I thanked Him that I'm in a place where I can make peace with this.

It hurts like hell. But we alcoholics are prideful people, and I know so much of this hurt is my own pride and ego. I'm trying to practice acceptance today. I want him to be happy. I want me to be happy. I know in my heart he did the right thing.

Thanks for listening. IWNDWYT

I planned it very early in the day after getting dealt some cards I simply don't know how to play. I didn't know how to deal with what was going on. Resentful to the fact that the universe didn't bow to my every want and need just because I'm doing something good for myself. I copped 4 24oz cans of Budweiser. My ambrosia. But when I started drinking, I couldn't pound them like I used to. And the taste! It tastes like some dirty dish water. At this point all was lost so I put on some Ride The Lightning and drank at as rapid of a pace as I could manage. When I did finally catch a buzz, I had this one split second of total serenity. Memories of old keggers and ragers came flooding. Then I started snapchatting . Always bad news when you're drunk. I never got that alcohol surging through my brain yesssssss onset of euphoria.  Just a host of effects that reminded me of those pleasurable experiences. Like when you roll down your window and trigger memories of chain smoking on road trips past. At the end of the night I felt off. Usually the lapse in basic cognitive and motor function is welcomed but I hate it now.it used to bring me comfort but it just feels horribly physically wrong now. And I felt empty. The glass I broke in case of emergency had nothing behind it that would put out my fires. The next day I felt like garbage, but I felt grateful, for the monkey might finally be off my back. Real talk I hate alcohol now and it puzzles and worries me to think why I needed it for most my life. Didn't wallow in self pity or self flagellation. Just forced myself to laugh about it and dragged my sorry ass to work on time. I'm back at it doing the damn thing, and I have an unfair advantage of my fellow SD comrades. A complete physical,  mental and spiritual aversion to alcohol. 

Tl;dr: relapsed after my longest run, hated it, didn't dwell on it, learned some lessons and reinforced my sobriety moving forward.  

Yup, coulda been worse. I coulda loved it.",28

I spoke to my wife on the phone shortly after as well as sending an email to my therapist. My wife said she wasn't mad about anything and I was actually sleeping on the couch in case my youngest woke up. She could tell I was upset and didn't understand why. I admitted to her that I don't remember much at all about yesterday. She said that lack of sleep from being up through the week probably contributed to that. She texted me a couple of times and said to just drop it because she wasn't mad or anything.

My therapist called shortly after and I have an appointment tomorrow. She was mostly concerned for my safety and told me to take it easy on myself. I'm extremely nervous for tomorrow's meeting.

I'm waiting for my wife to come home and just want a hug. I've had blackouts before but not like this and to the point where I don't remember a majority of the day, eating, going places. It's scaring the hell out of me. I'm embarrassed to ask what even did happen.

There's so much I could say, so much I want to say, need to say, need to admit. But I don't know where to begin, so I'll begin with this...

I don't like the person I've become because of drinking. I feel anxious, depressed, irritable, frustrated, sad, mad.....all the time. I've convinced myself for the last 5 years that my drinking hasn't affected my personal or work life but who am I kidding...I haven't been sober for more than a week at a time. When I come home from work, I immediately get the urge to start drinking. If I don't have a drink, I get irritable with everyone around me. I'm afraid of what not drinking will do to my social life, but I need to remember that I don't have one BECAUSE of my drinking. I don't do it during the day. I usually start at 5pm. This can't mean I'm an alcoholic, right? But I am and I need to stop kidding myself. I'm scared. But I've decided to take control. I was placed on academic suspension last year because my drinking has impacted my retention of information so badly and I failed to see that. I just reapplied to my college today. I need a clear mind if I want any hope of passing and finally getting my degree. And as a 26 year old female, I know A LOT of pregnant women right now. They all have numerous doctors appointments because they are growing a human life that they will soon be taking care of. I've had numerous doctors appointments too, but because of my nutritional deficiencies and inability to care for myself. I want to have children with my husband. But I can't do that if I can't even take care of myself. I need help and well, this seemed like a good place to start. I'm scared to admit any of this, but I just want to feel better. I don't want to have that constant itch to drink. I keep telling myself that this will be the last 6 pack I buy before getting sober, but then I just go out and buy another and feel guilty about it. I don't know how to stick with it. I don't know what I will do to pass the time. I don't know if I'll like myself after getting sober, but I know that I definitely don't like myself right now. I have no idea where I'm going with this post, but I need help, and this seemed like a good of place as any to begin.",4

After reading some of the posts and the responses she has had to hers, I thought I would give this a try.

On the advice of my psch I have started tapering as to go cold turkey now would be dangerous. I count yesterday as a success. Instead of starting drinking at noon, I made it to 3pm. Instead of drinking 12 beers, I had 6 and a half. The goal my psch set for me was 8. I am feeling proud this morning (new and wonderful feeling!). I am staying with my daughter and she has been a huge support. We both know I get tired after eating so she cooked me a massive, healthy vegie dinner and then I put myself to bed. It took a long time to go to sleep but I stayed in bed and just drank water. Sharing feels weird to me as I have only just acknowledged what I am doing to myself.

I knew that jail was an inevitable outcome, and I'm heading in to spend 96 hours in a couple days. Leading up to this, I was scared that my life would be ruined by this, that my career and relationships would tank as a consequence. But, as I approach the actual date of my sentence, the positive changes that were made in my life as a result of my sobriety has resulted in hope. I am in better physical and mental health at this point than I've ever been in my life, and I'm looking forward to getting this phantom in my life behind me. I wish I could tell myself four months ago that this is the person that he'd become, it would spare him a lot of anxiety. Best of luck to everyone who's starting their journey of sobriety this month, it's absolutely worth it.

Rock bottom... I want to be sober!","I have reached the bottom two days ago. I can't stop crying and I never felt so sad, ashamed and disgusted with myself. 

I never had a problem on controling my drinking until 3 years ago when I got in a serious depression and besides having antidepressants I turned in to a constant stream of alcohol. The problem is that I also started, for the first time ever, to black out memories from the previous drunken night. I known from others description that I became a very different person, aggressive, flirty and crazy. 

I have been getting myself in trouble because of the drinking and the blackouts. I have been raped, I have slept on the street on subzero temperatures and I have lost and hurt a few friends because of my crazynes or because I go completely ""legless"" and give them loads of trouble.

Two days ago I reached the rock bottom. I had a great night with my boyfriend. We drank a lot together in a quiet bar. On arrival at home I told him to come along with me out again. He said he didn't want to and asked me to stay. I said I was going alone. I had more drinks and after the second drink I can't remember anything. 

Next day I woke up with my boyfriend telling me I have kissed a random guy in the middle of the local pub where we and all his friends go. 

I am mortified. I can't remember anything. I truly never meant to hurt my beloved boyfriend like that. I love him so much. We just moved in together recently and my life was starting to go back to a good place. I just feel like disappearing. 

I quit drinking!!! All my recent (last 5 years) troubles were based on alcohol. All! Even being threatened by my boss of being fired (from a job I am loving) for going to work with many hangovers. Now I jeopardized my relationship. Enough! It is only day 2 but I am adamant. I want to be sober!

-renewed an old certification
-got hired on at an amazing job I love 
-strengthened existing relationships
-made new friends and caught up with some old 
-I am not living a secret life - hiding my nightly routine 
-I am open and honest and more self-aware 
-my anxiety as almost completely vanished
-I have come off of medication for mental illness and had no psychological issues 
-I have lost 20lbs 
-I could go on but you seen the point. 

If someone had told me 200 days ago that my life would be like this I would have cried and laughed and said “not mine”. I was lost, at rock bottom, and scared. I couldn’t imagine two days without a drink let alone months of sobriety. To me it seemed impossible but I knew it was necessary. 

If you have read this far, thank you. 

If you are just starting out, just keep pushing forward. Stack one day on at a time. When you need to break it down to hours or minutes. You can do this. The cravings pass, the dreams become more sporadic, and as you continue forward you will definitely new habits and hobbies to replace what you are giving up. 

I’m looking forward to my life now. I can’t wait to enjoy all of life’s successes and joys. I’m looking forward to living instead of existing.

I'm just super hurt. The last time we split up and got back together he was actually making efforts to be nicer. But that's over now. He is back to the same mean person I wanted to leave.

I even took a couple hits off a joint I got the spins and while I was walking with my girlfriend at the time to a college.. I passed out and I had to go to the hospital and get my stomach pumped with alcohol poisoning.

At 15 I got my first DUI. I was actually trying to drive a more drunk friend home and I got pulled over for my lights not being on all the way and I blew a point .03. and it was a minor that was over the limit- I was on probation for a year. Later, i got my second DUI at 17 years old this one I was actually pretty drunk I was in a lot of trouble I did my time and I got out of town after high School-probation lasted about a year..

About 15 years after that I got my 3rd DUI about a month after I broke up with my girlfriend. I blew a .11 I got pulled over for not using my turn signal while I was trying to take a girl home from the bar. I felt fine but I also knew I feel kind of buzzed. This was really frightening to me actually. I thought maybe I was going to have to do time and I new the laws were a lot more strict in this bigger city I am living in. I complied well with the cop everything is cool and I got a year probation again. My last two DUIs didn't show up because they got erased at the age of 18 so on paper this is my first DUI. I was let go a lot easier than other people because I complied with everything and also I was very respectful during my arrest. I didn't blow a ridiculous amount, so I had to do a lot of therapy and recovery and I thinking that therapy I was still not being honest with myself or the group in fear of incriminating myself further... and owning up to what I've done although a lot of the work that we did in there did help me I think.

I think you down inside I do believe I have a problem with alcohol although it might not be the overboard drunkenness that some people experience but mine is definitely hurting my life. I think drinking is something I am ready to let go and I want to come clean in hopes that it will release some sort of guilt and shame held inside of me.

As of today, I'm 323 days sober, that's 💯 true. I still work as a bartender but I am the sober bartender. I want to move on with life. And I'm going to start being honest with myself and others on where I come from from now on.

If you spent the time to read this thanks and I hope each and everyone of you find your release and grow into the people you want to be.",5

Him and his wife are visiting myself and my girl. We are going camping and island hopping. I live on Oahu. I have 12 days sober right now. I’ve done month long stretches before but this time it feels more critical. Recently as in the last two times I caved and drank every night for a week straight ( my nana passed, then family vaca) I’ve gone through withdrawals after. I’m well aware of kindling and this scares the shit out of me. The thing is I’ve always had a fun party relationship with my brothers and my younger brother in particular. We are going camping and going to partake in some psychedelics because that’s what we do. This alone is not a problem for me. In fact mushrooms are what kicked off this whole abstinence from alcohol thing. The thing is I know he’s gonna want to drink in the evenings with dinners or camping. Trust me the booze hound side of my brain is like go ahead itl be fun. But it’s held me back for far too long. I want to tell him the reasons why I’m not drinking but right now only my girlfriend knows and I don’t think she grasps the level of which I have drank in my life. I know I should tell him but I don’t need my entire family worrying about their drinking around me. I can be sober around drinkers, I’ve been at bars and out with friends during month long stretches and in the past couple weeks but somehow this vacation seems  different. Idk maybe I’m over thinking it. Thanks for listening to my ramble.",4

To everyone just starting out, I have never though I will make it this far. The fear and terror, when I was thinking about my future life, was overwhelming. But I kept at it. At first it was hard, very hard. Latter one it got easier. Now I don’t think about it most of the time (but keep vigilante!). Recently I had couple of drinking dreams and let me tell you, the feeling was devastating – that I fucked up. Oh boy, I was so happy when I woke up and understood that it was just a dream. Although I did not get the best nights sleep, the dream is a good reminder.

I think what helped me the most, was learning to enjoy myself. I’ve started to avoid (or bail early) places where the gatherings are only about drinking. Instead, I’ve started to hang out more with my friends from work. They do drink, but at least it’s fun with them. I am much happier doing what is actually fun! It took time, but it was well worth it.

Twenty percent of the time, around 4-5 hrs. a day I am happy because I'm drinking. As for the other \~20 hrs. I am sleeping \~6-8 hrs. All remaining hours are spent feeling bad about drinking and suffering with anxiety. And of course most of my anxiety is either whole or partially due to my drinking. 

I just turned 60 on the 7th. I decided to do dry January but I've already cheated 5 times. If I don't stop I know this will kill me, but as you all know, knowing that doesn't make it any easier. 

The weekends are the worst. M-F I drink after work as a reward. But S-S I drink out of boredom. I know I need to find things to do to keep myself busy, but I don't. I'm not interested in anything. I take an antidepressant but it hasn't helped me to feel more engaged with life.

To add to this shitshow I'm an amputee, left arm at shoulder. Most of the things I used to do are either impossible or frustrating to do with only one arm/hand. 

If I'm really lucky I only have \~30 more years left of my life. I've had cancer once so who knows. I'd like my time left to be joyful. I want to be happy but right now that 4-5hrs that I have a beer or a cocktail in front of me is the only time I feel happy and devoid of anxiety.

Now imagine if in the game you are playing you were given the choice to spend in game currency to waste time, weaken your character for a certain amount of time with after affects lasting even longer, and over time the negative debuffs stack, and all of this for the only buff being slightly better social extraversion for those with a lower charisma stat or whatever.

Any rational player would see this is a horrible waste of time and money other than the novelty factor. Why waste time constantly spending currency and weakening your character for massively diminishing returns when you can do more productive and ultimately more fulfilling things given your ultimate goals?

I started trying to lose weight back in July - I'm only about 25 pounds away from my goal weight. Initially, I lost 11 pounds, but quickly realized I was just using my diet program to try to offset my drinking. I wanted to keep drinking every day, and lose weight. I wanted a bottle of wine, sometimes more, every day. I switched to drinking whiskey, either neat or on the rocks. I've gained back most of the weight I'd lost. 

Today, I will get home from work and take my dog on a walk. And when I get back inside, I will not pour my first drink. I'll flip on the TV, settle into the couch, and not drink. I'll shower, and settle in bed with a book, hoping that will help me to get to sleep. I'll struggle to fall asleep, and I'll have horribly violent nightmares when I do. I'll wake up often, and when my alarm goes off at 4:00AM, I will feel like shit.

Here are the circumstances as to why I believe I should not have to reset my Day Count:
 
·         I smoked medicinal-grade THC (from Colorado) that was prescribed to a friend of mine... She's been using it for years to deal with anxiety and insomnia, *and* is a Licensed Professional Counselor who specializes in substance abuse treatment, so I trust her clinical judgment;

·         It was the first time I have smoked in over a year-and-a-half;

·         I smoked alone in my apartment with nobody else there, not at a party with a group of stoners (no judgement, I used to be one in college over 2 decades ago);

·         I smoked out of a one-hitter and took only a couple of puffs;

·         I needed it to fall asleep, not to get high;

·         I slept BEAUTIFULLY and felt fine the next day.

I had *no* desire to drink, so the gateway drug argument is moot. I have NOT relapsed on booze, despite my craving red wine on occasion.

Had I known that my sponsor would react the way she did, I would not have smoked, PERIOD.

When she said that I have to be honest about my ""relapse"" at the next meeting I go to, I told her that I can’t do that. I don't want to go back to the rooms after all the progress I’ve made in my recovery to report “defeat” when I did not drink any booze.  She said I am an adult and can make my own choices, but that she simply cannot continue to be my Sponsor if I don’t start over.

Her reaction makes me not want to go back to any AA meetings ever again because I am embarrassed about having to share this with the Fellowship. 

I don’t think I did anything wrong because it was legally prescribed THC, and it is legal in a lot of states.  Nicotine is legal, caffeine is legal, and people smoke cigarettes and drink coffee all the time without resetting their Day Counts.

TL;DR – My Sponsor broke up with me because I smoked pot to fall asleep and would not reset my Day Count.  Was it considered a “relapse” even though I did not drink alcohol???",11

Nothing crazy happened but I blacked out and passed out without remembering. As I reflected yesterday I realized something interesting. 

Up until Friday night the first few weeks of sobriety was relatively easy to be honest. It wasn’t until Friday night when my whole mood changed. All of the sudden I was snappy, short with my fiancé and the littlest things would set me off. 

Then Saturday came and I was even more moody after fighting spikes of anxiety all day long. My cravings to drink were higher than they’d been since starting sobriety 3 weeks prior. There was no stopping me. So I invited my fiancé’s dad over and we drank beers, took shots and barbecued. I blacked out and passed out on the couch. 

Now I’m wondering what I could have done to prevent that. Is it a normal thing to experience mood swings and anxiety after a few weeks sober? How do you get through it?",7

I quit for a myriad of reasons, with my physical health being one of them - albeit lower in priorities. I’ve always been in decent shape, but I’ve been carrying around a literal beer gut for a decade. I’ve dieted and I go to the gym a ton, but couldn’t get rid of it. I refused to acknowledge the real reason why.

Since I quit, the weight is falling off. Even during the holidays I lost a couple of pounds....it’s pretty remarkable, I’m the lowest I’ve been in 6 years, and I’m sure I’m more hydrated than ever (I drink an absurd amount of water, probably bordering on too much).

If you quit less than 2 months ago and are gaining weight, don’t get discouraged! Your sole focus should be not drinking, your body has a ton of healing to do. I inhaled sugar my first month to make up for the lack of booze. I also want to note that even if ice cream looks worse than alcohol on paper, it’s not. Alcohol is the antithesis of health. It’s more than empty calories, it slows your metabolism, reduces testosterone (bad for men and women), screws with your sleep - which raises cortisol levels, and slows protein synthesis. Ice cream, although far from the shining beacon of health, provides nutrition. Alcohol does not.

If you quit more than 2 months ago and are gaining when you want to lose, start figuring out a plan! The best news here is that you will be focused and ready to implement, not hungover and groggy. Where can your nutrition improve? Are you still downing the sugar? I found that the more I eat sweets, the more I want them....it’s a self serving cycle. You have all of the tools to figure it out.

Anyways, I’m done babbling on. Good luck to everybody no matter where you are in your journey. IWNDWYT!",9

I searched and found my roadside assistance number and requested a tow, and I was able to calmly wave other drivers around me while doing all of this. I had the sense to stay with the car so I didn’t get an expensive ticket if police show up to find it abandoned. If I were in the state I was in 4 months ago, I wouldn’t have been able to focus on any of this since my first priority would be scouring my car for beer cans or other evidence that I had been drinking. Most likely would’ve walked to the gas station or bar around the corner to get a quick drink to calm my nerves. I would be searching for mouthwash and gum and thinking of a game plan to distract the police from picking up that I’m drunk while driving. I know that the inconsiderate behavior from my fellow drivers would have me cursing back at them and getting pissed off at them and the world for dealing me yet another shitty hand. Drunk me would be so distracted thinking the worst about what is wrong with my car and how much it’s going to cost to get it repaired. My phone probably would’ve died during this ordeal, leaving me helpless to summon the help that was required to get out of this dangerous situation. The cops did show up to help me push my car to the nearby gas station so I was relieved to have nothing to hide for once. Even better- I have the money for whatever repairs are needed since I don’t blow every dime of my paycheck on partying and self medicating. This sober life is where it’s at. Even better than advertised.",5

Mostly for the purposes of losing weight. And damn I didn't realize how much I was drinking. Here's what I realized two weeks in.

* I was drinking a lot and it was interfering in my relationships. Now that I've stopped I've found, even in this short time, that the quality of time has improved with my spouse and children.
* I had no idea how much I was drinking. It added up and I noticed it most in the lack of trips to the grocery store to pick up a bottle or two every weekend.
* I was worried I wouldn't be able to pass the time. What did we do for fun before drinking? For a few days I thought ""well what am I supposed to do? I'm usually at a bar"". Well I soon discovered positive feelings I hadn't felt in a long time. Getting a good nights rest and filling ""drinking"" time with my hobbies was awesome.
* I just feel better as a person. 
* I didn't realize how as an adult, social time with with peers was pretty much always centered around a drink. I don't want all my memories to be tied to that.
* The urge for a drink was strong....but slowly it's subsided. I'd rather be alert and engaged that look forward to a hangover tomorrow.
* Will I give it up completely? Probably not. Will I limit when and where I drink after January...yes I will.",18

My partner’s patience is running thin.,"My dear partner has always been so supportive and put up with so much crap when I was drinking. We’ve been together for over 8 years. We both love each other dearly, but I can tell he’s finally getting tired of my illness.

It was about 8 weeks ago I was hospitalized for withdrawals from alcohol. I hadn’t eaten in 4 days. My stomach hurt so bad and I had an awful migraine that lasted the entire time. It was all so awful I was suicidal.

He visited me in the hospital everyday and I could see how much it hurt him to see me in my condition. I couldn’t hold a spoon from the shakes, and I could barely make it to the bathroom. I was making jokes the entire time though, because that’s my nature.

Fast forward to now. I had an entire month sober.   Then I decided it was okay to drink at New Years with close friends. It spiraled into a bender.

Since then I’ve had a few days sober sporadically. But he got so angry with me when he came home to find me drinking. I started hiding bottles again.

It’s been so hard to deal with feeling like this. I always feel better sober for a few days. But I feel so bad when I relapse that I’m making him angry and scared.

My performance as an athlete was suffering and I was having huge mental lapses from being borderline blackout consequent evenings.

The first week and a half were horrendous. Anxiety spiked, motivation tanked, and one evening, I spent about 5 minutes standing in front of the cooler at my local gas station. However, it seems like I'm finding my sober self again. I've begun to enjoy playing video games and making music again.

I am happy and proud. I keep it to mysef wxcept this board. I am eating way too many cookies but justify that by not drinking (one thing at a time).
Life's issues still exist but i can resolve them  now and remember what the fuck i did to resolve it or deal with it. 

The urge to drink is there. It's really sneaky right now. I have breezed through 100 days. Now The demon is telling me ""hey you know you can stop go ahead and pour one - you have earnes it"" - the recent battles have been more fierce and drawn out. I am irratible and sometimes just in a lousy mood. Then those things pass and i am feeling great again.

I'm happy this group is here and thank you for having me.

I'm addicted to alcohol and I'm trying not to drink today. This would be my day 1.

I'm 37 years old, have been drinking since I was a teenager and over the past several years my drinking volume, frequency and fallout has drastically increased.

I work from home so I have more opportunities than most to crack open a beer or something else.  I often have been waking up with the thought that ""I won't drink today, I don't need to"" but then as the afternoon rolls around I shake that off with ""I want a drink, I'm an adult, I can handle my self, I'm having a drink"".  As I've gotten older I've learned that I pretty much always can't stop with just a drink at lunch.  Instead that will be the beginning of my drinks for the day, that will, almost daily, end up in the double digits by night time.

I have a lot of stories about bad things happening because of my extended alcohol use but can simply summarize by staging that: I drink more than I don't, I drink a lot through the day when I drink - often reaching blackout BAC levels and I have a hard time remembering what happened, it has compromised my ability to be a good father and husband, I make bad decisions when drinking, I've turned from once being a ""fun drunk"" to being all over the board.

I don't want to drink today.  I wrote this help put a marker in the sand to motivate and push myself to follow through as well as to seek some camaraderie and like-minded support.

Thanks for reading this and I send out encouragement to anybody else trying not to drink today.

It's getting close to the afternoon here (East Coast USA) and I know I will begin to want to grab a drink soon.  Thanks for letting me use this subreddit to help me get beyond today and the days coming. Thanks for the read.-B

My ""falling off"" initially wasn't anything super crazy -- like so many other people, I just thought I could control it. So I wasn't drinking all day or even every day, but I started drinking occasionally at social functions and getting trashed. Then I started drinking *before* social functions by myself. Then yesterday I found myself drinking alone at noon. I went from drinking once or twice a week back to drinking almost every day. It's amazing how out of control things can get even when you think you're totally in control. 

So this post isn't me offering any insight or anything. We've all heard this story before. It's more for accountability purposes for me -- to say that I'm back, and grateful to be back. One of the most amazing things about this whole process for me, since I decided to start confronting my drinking about a year ago, is how it's full of second chances. I'm not stuck. I can get my sobriety back -- I just had to decide to try again. 

Thanks to everyone on SD for holding this space! It's been absolutely crucial for me.

* I don’t feel bloated every day
* I don’t stress about whether or not I should go to the liquor store
* I’m learning to sit with my negative emotions when they come
* I’m finding community in real life and online 
* I’m being more honest with myself

I started using the Noom app about one year ago to lose weight. It took me until November 2019 to accept that if I wanted to lose weight I couldn’t continue drinking like I was. Which was about a bottle of merlot a day, every day. I got really drunk on October 31st by myself at my house and had to call in sick to work the next day because I was so incredibly hung over. Just puking again and again. It was so awful. I was so embarrassed and I think that whole situation helped me realize I have a problem. I tried to be sober immediately after that but I effed up and drank again on November 4th so November 5th was my first day sober and I have managed to keep it up this whole time! The app I Am Sober is helping me so much. I highly recommend it. I was very very tempted to drink on Christmas Eve (my mom, also an alcoholic, brought over a bottle of merlot for me), but luckily that day was day 50 of sobriety for me so I felt proud and managed to not drink. I’m also proud I made it through New Years without drinking at all. I had my sparkling grape juice in my champagne goblet and felt very fancy! Making it through those two trials makes me feel like continuing to stay sober isn’t going to be as hard anymore. The longer I’m sober the easier it is for me to assert myself about the fact that I’m not drinking. Well anyway, I just wanted to brag because I’m finally making weight loss progress! I’m so pleased! I started gaining a lot of weight about 2014 and kept gaining until 2017 when I hit my top weight of 221. I’m down 29 pounds now and 12 of those pounds have been in just the last 69 days!

A tough month of January lay ahead. During the first two months of sobriety I was able to save about $500, and heading into December I was feeling pretty damn proud not to be desperately check to check, if only for moment. I had two and a half weeks off in December/Jan. My brother came into town from Delaware, with his family. I met my one-year old nephew for the first time. cute kid. We had a good time, ate out at some nice places, I was able to buy a few gifts - bought a few gifts for myself, and here I am pretty damn broke in the middle of the month. For about a week I fretted about this, but didn't let it shake my sobriety, and finances are a huge trigger for me. Nothing else in the world wants to make me say, ""fuck it all, lets gets smashed"" like a long, thorough look into my finances  :)

I'm over it. I had a great time, and it was worth it. Talk to me again in three weeks after i've been eating nothing but beans, rice, and eggs, and we'll see if it was still worth it.

happy to report my sleep is finally normalizing, and i hope this doesn't jinx it. I was beginning to think sleeping 6 hours a night, while waking up 3 times, was how i'd sleep forever, but without even noticing it the past 3 or 4 night i have gone to sleep at 10:30 pm, and waking up next at 6:30 am. ""rested"" has taken on new meaning.

had my first (of this sobriety push) ""drinking dream"" last night. i polished off a bottle of wine, and was really upset with myself, and felt awful, but still decided to push the bender, and go get a 6 pack, promising to start again tomorrow, like so many times before. i was so grateful when i woke up.

little movement in social life, but that's sorta expected, still a bit dissapointing.

exercising feels good, think i'll continue that. hopefully after january i can try getting out more. until then, slow and steady movement forward

I really need to get something off my chest and the anonymity of this subreddit gives me a safe feeling and I get the idea people tend to listen here. It’s a bit of a long write-up so forgive me. Thanks in advance for reading.

I’m a 28 years old man, trying to finish my degree and I live with my girlfriend in West-Europe. I have been a heavy binge drinker from 2015 to 2018. I’m an atypical student, made a few switches in degrees and when I was about 24 years old I joined a fraternity in 2015 because I wanted a taste of the ‘real’ student life before I started to work full-time. I have a meticulous and precise personality, but am also a bit neurotic. I wanted to join a fraternity to show that I could be more carefree and more relaxed. I still have these previously mentioned precise traits, but they’ve been snowed under a bit because of the drinking. 

**College drinking**

During this period of about 2,5 years I developed a pattern of heavy episodic binge drinking, meaning the last half part of the period, I was drinking insane amounts of mostly beer (12+ beers) minimally two nights a week, but often more, sometimes less. During the remaining nights I would often drink a lot less, but still a few drinks, but I also had lots of alcohol-free days. Sometimes I had to puke and always had crazy hangovers.

The binging was so ingrained in the student culture, that everyone thought it was normal and everyone did it to some extent. I always thought “I will quit drinking later and it will be okay”, but at some point the binge drinking advanced even more. 

It started to get problematic for me when I was about to graduate in the summer of 2017. My GF left me, I failed my thesis and lost my side-job. I then started to have a *‘screw it’* mentality then started to binge drink insane amounts, sometimes even a whole week of getting drunk without a day pause and constant partying. I managed to quit for some time in the summer, but quickly started getting drunk regularly again (there were even cases where it happened 4 times a week, but not often) when the school year resumed.

In 2018 I met my current girlfriend, but I still drank a lot. Financially I started racking up debt and was looking to write my thesis again, but postponed it, because I had a few problems in my family and had an injury with my finger and my ear. These finger and ear injuries have long lasting effects: my right ear hearing has been damaged and my index finger has been permanently impaired from the injury. From march 2018 I still had a few binge drinking session every 1-2 weeks, but at some point it were only monthly exceptions where I would get drunk.

**Current situation**

The last time I was drunk was in May 2019 and I’ve been completely sober since January 2020. I’m not going to be drunk ever again. I eat healthy, work out and try to get enough sleep. In my free time I like to read books and spend lots of time with people I'm close with.

I have a part-time job whilst I try to finish my study, but it’s very hard to motivate myself, because I have the feeling I’m broken. I have lost a great deal of my self-esteem and financially it is very hard, while my resume is scarred from studying this long. I feel defeated and lack perspective and this obstructs me from moving forward. I feel lost and depressed and speak with a therapist about this. 

**Health questions**

I worry about my health and especially my cognitive functioning. I haven’t had any physical alcohol related problems, apart from hangovers. I had a liver test, but did this while I already abstained for quite a while, so the values were in the norm and I haven’t got immediate, visible apparent brain damage, so my doctor doesn’t want to send me to a neurologist.

It must be true the heavy drinking has done damage to my brain. Every time something slips my memory or I can’t grasp a complex problem, I start to worry that this is because of possible alcohol related damage, whilst previously I would just try harder. I think there is some correlation with my self-esteem, but also with the drinking. I keep wondering whether I will deteriorate mentally and physically early in life and have compromised my current intelligence.

**Some questions**

To what extent can my brain recover from my heavy drinking period? And do the chances of cancer etc. reduce with abstaining from alcohol? E.g. can I get back to normal?

**Thank you so much for reading this and possibly answering my questions. Stay strong everybody.**",1

After abstaining for a week I just had to give it one more try to see if moderation is an option. I managed to sip a couple of glasses of wine, alternating with water, and was able to set the third glass down half full and go to bed. On the one hand this is an improvement over my previous full steam ahead until you pass out at all costs approach to drinking. On the other hand, without that promise of sweet oblivion the buzz just wasn't worth the lower quality of sleep and the fuzzy head in the morning (and to be honest after a week of fruit juice wine tastes kind of crappy). I'm not hungover, or even particularly dissapointed (I'm sure that'll start tonight when I realize I have to start the whole process over again), but in a way I'm glad I did this little experiment. Because now there is no unknown quantity between degenerate alcoholism and sobriety. Even if I could maintain moderation for any length of time, which is doubtful, it just has nothing to offer that is worth tormenting myself over. I'm certain I'll still have my white knuckle days, but I feel like the internal debating over whether or not and how much to drink just lost one of the legs it had to stand on. It's a new day and a new week and IWNDWYT.",7

I mean I rarely drank with other people. I drank by myself. So IWNDWYT and IWNDBMT (by myself) and in general IWNDT!

My ex left me and I decided to crawl back into the bottle. Plus it's practically impossible to be on the dating scene without going out to meet someone for drinks. Anywho I work nights and work alone so it's a good excuse to drink at work. I crashed the truck one night after a 2 day bender. Bosses didn't really give me too much grief, just assumed I fell asleep at the wheel. I paid the damages but that didnt stop me from drinking. I'd go to bars on fridays without sleeping at all and already be drunk. Who knows how many times I pissed myself. I'm a loud obnoxious prick when I'm drunk so who knows how many people hate me from being annoying. I'd wake up parked in my car somewhere not knowing how the fuck I got there so many times. My luck ran out last Friday and I finally got my first dwi. I was completely blacked out and I don't remember the arrest at all. I regained consciousness in the hospital and I realized I had royally fucked up. I really hope to get this drunken fucking money off my back. This is the start of day 9 that I went cold turkey. I miss drinking myself to sleep. This whole experience has taught me I can't continue myself. I don't know how to moderate. I can't fool myself again. The cravings haven't been too bad. I can definitely feel the mood swings though. Nightmares about my ex every fucking day. Next month is going to be my 31st birthday and I'm looking forward to this next chapter in my life where I finally act like a fucking adult and just live in my emotions instead of trying to drown them. I learned the hard way that whatever I'm trying to drown has learned to love to swim in alcohol. 

TLDR: thought I could control my drinking again, got a DWI, 9 days sober, just had to rant.",14

It's only been two years, but I'm slowly tearing my life apart. Things got bad about 6 months ago and I decided to go to therapy to start getting help. 4 months ago, things go haywire (directly because of my drinking) and in a 2 week span, I'm fired from my side job, a roommate and friends moves out and cuts ties, and I receive notice of a restraining order filed against me.

In therapy, we tried to focus on why I drink as I was always admit I was using it to cover up my feelings and to make myself better. The problem is I'll often drink just because I like it.

This month, things haven't gotten bad again. I'm on some new medication, which in general has been helpful, but it wrecks my emotions. Once I start down the spiral, I can't recover if I've been drinking. This has resulted in nights crying uncontrollably (nothing wrong with it, I'm just generally not someone who cries often). I got so upset with myself one night (not even sure over what) that I ended up punching a hole in my bedroom door and breaking a knuckle in the promise. And then finally this weekend, got irrationally upset again and this time decided I needed to drive... to who knows where. I didn't make it very far before I was involved in an accident. I'll leave the details vague but I'm lucky no one was hurt and that I wasn't arrested. Just material damage.

But being sober is very difficult in UK. I made it through Christmas, got a parent in the hospital at the moment and having to be responsible and sensitive, which I hate. I cracked and randomly got beer while we were at a pub around the 28th. Fast forward and im passing out, having 2 day hangovers, almost weekly through January.

Gonna go back to being sober again. Currently on day 2 of a hangover from 2 days of drinking. Back in work and feeling anxious and tired from insomnia. Feels bad man.

I have a problem with saying no, and have a spending addiction. Wish there was some way I could ban myself from drinking, or tell every bar in the city to stop serving me. But everybody wants me to drink, and they make it very easy to do so.

I'm not an everyday drinker, and therefore I don't think I'm physically dependant. This makes it really easy to convince myself I don't have a problem at all.

That being said over the last 18 months I have done things that make me feel like I do have a problem. I have given myself a black eye falling over. I have slept with people I don't like. I have been raped due to putting myself in awful positions because of drinking. I have done cocaine multiple times in order to be able to stay up drinking. I have texted exes relentlessly. I black out/throw up/pass out almost every time I drink. I have got black out at a family Christmas, asking my recovering alcoholic uncle whether I should go to aa. I have humiliated myself constantly, been deeply ashamed and still gone back for more.

Within the last 2 weeks I have gone out and lost both my keys and my purse one night. Another night I hit my head (badly, scarlily) and I have no idea how. I woke up with blood all over my pillow and had to go to work adsolutely stinking of alcohol. I still went out the next night. This seems to be my wakeup call.

I feel like I am not living my best life. I hate myelf and I'm realising the only time I do things I hate is when I'm drunk.

i have been committing slow suicide and alcohol is helping me in my efforts. for a year i have been trying to quit drinking but between my job and the fragile state of my mental health my efforts are in vain. the longest i made it was 3 weeks sober in november.

i don't recognize myself in the mirror anymore. it's been years since i felt connected to the person staring back at me. i need to make a change but when i think about sobriety i commit myself to failure every time. 

i am posting now because i called out of work yesterday and went on an all day drinking and gambling binge. i got wasted and lost hundreds. in some ways i had a fantastic time but deep down i know i am trying to destroy myself. this was self sabotage that i tricked myself into calling a mental health day. when i got home i passed out on the couch. i woke up with the TV on and stumbled into bed. it is now about 6AM. i am feeling mostly sober and i haven't been able to fall back asleep. my mind is filled with the desire to be sober. the desire to have control over my life again. the desire to be proud of who i am. the desire to choose life instead of death. i need to be sober. i want to recommit myself to this goal but i don't know how to find the strength. i have failed every time before and i cannot see how this time will be different. 

to those who are now sober, how did you make that change in your life?

to those of you who bartend sober, how do you resist temptation? ...especially at first.

this is not the life i want anymore. i cannot spend my days dying anymore. how do i break this addiction to self destruction?

My honest thoughts on sobriety and how I fell off the wagon.,"This post is going to be super long, if you want to give up reading already, I don't mind, I just want to write something and feel like I'm sharing.

Two years ago I decided to stop drinking, for good and seriously. I've had just created my new little company, being for the second time a young entrepreneur and I thought it was necessary to never drink again, so that I could turn my life upside down.

How was my life before sobriety? Needless to say I was wasted almost every day. I was feeling and having, and even felt/had for some time after quit drinking, a high level of anxiety, bitterness, fear, regret, insomnia, chest pain, body pain, unhealthy feces, bad digestion, lack of appetite, extreme laziness, an abuse of procrastination, and some more similar symptoms to these. When I'm in this state, personally I try to understand why I feel like this. I always think about that alcohol is the great creator of it, but I never believe it one hundred percent. My main ""excuse-question"" is: ""Alcohol? No way, how come other people around me don't feel like this and drink every day?"". And normally this is enough to discard alcohol. What is the problem with this? I start thinking that I have one hundred mental problems instead of just admitting I only have one:  
""Why do I feel anxious? Probably I'm insecure.""  
""Why do I feel chest pain? Probably anxiety, because I always feel insecure.""  
""Why am I always procrastinating? Probably because I'm always with chest pains, that gets me more tired than most people, damn anxiety... Maybe I'm not insecure, maybe it's genetic.""  
And so on... Until the point you're never sure what you have and never discarding anything.

One day I was sick of all of this crap and decided to test if all these problems came from alcohol. And wouldn't you believe, it did. Of course. After 2 months of stop drinking I was with very low levels of anxiety, I was happy, I was able to overcome all my fears, I didn't have any regrets, because I was always so secure of what I was doing. All my previous pains disappeared, my digestion system was great, I was eating like a champion (not in excess though), I was super productive and never leaving anything to do. And best of all, I was sleeping like a rock, always getting a good rest, which made all of my days amazing. Why would anyone want to leave this state of body and mind? How come it was so easy to bury all this? I will tell you how, it involves challenging myself, TV Shows and friends that don't know any better.

Feeling this great, I wanted to start studying again, my new little company wasn't giving much profit, it happens to everyone, I'm OK with that, so I wanted to give myself some education so that I could get a better life, financially speaking. After being sober for more or less 4 to 5 months (which is not much, but believe me, it felt like much, in a good way), I've started watching the TV Show ""Mad Men"", and oh boy... I'm the kind of person that really gets into the story of everything and tries to relate with everything, and the show is based on a marketing company throughout the 1960s, where everyone, with no exception, drank alcohol like we should drink water and smoked like we should breathe. After some days, my laptop wallpaper was a glass of whiskey in a desk. What was I doing to myself? I know how I am, I know how ""Californication"" (another TV Show with tons of alcohol) made my drinking worse. Why am I now even putting an image of a glass of whiskey in my laptop' screen?  
After some weeks, I was at home alone, had some of my father's beers in the fridge. I thought on trying one, just to know if it still felt good, what was so amazing about it that made me drink dozens of them in a day. I didn't tell anyone that I was going to try, not even my girlfriend with whom I confide everything. ""Holy shit, this tastes awful."", then I had more two, in less than 5 to 10 minutes. I can't believe how I didn't see the problem right there, how blind I can get when it comes to alcohol. I mean, I try something, it feels absolutely disgusting, then I consume more and I don't think that's weird? 6 months down the drain and I never got them back.  
Why did this happen? Maybe the TV Show had some influence, for some reason all cool characters that I like, usually do some heavy-drinking. But the main problem, I think, was going back to school, to a level I thought I wasn't prepared (Computer Science and Engineering), which I was, but I was so fucking scared, although I never admitted at the time. Why was I scared? Because the last time I was in school was almost ten years ago, and I dropped out after what? Starting to drink. I've also lost my mother at the time and my father is an alcoholic. Although he's better now, at the time, as you can imagine, he did some really heavy-drinking. But I don't like to blame others or life situations for my mistakes, even if I was only a teenager back then.  
What I want to say with all of this, is that I should have never start drinking just because Slash in his early days did or the fictional character Hank Moody did. From that moment on, I felt for whole ten years insecure and incapable of being happy. I was stuck. When the time for going to school again started, I felt all the same shit, and so I dealt with it like the good alcoholic I am, I started drinking again, I gave up my little company, I started drinking more. I gave up school after two months, and I started drinking even more for whole months.

How was my life after falling off the wagon? I live in Portugal, almost every single man drinks every single day. Many, including myself, spend more than half dozen hours per day in this activity. And worse for me, if I drink, I smoke. It's really hard for me not to. I've tried everything since I fell off the wagon, I've started with drinking only quality beer, it's more expensive, you drink it more slowly, so you don't get drunk. Didn't work, sometimes I would get drunk on great beer and since I didn't have the mindset of not drinking at all, sometimes I would also drink shitty beer just to get drunk. I've tried only weekends. Didn't work, I didn't have the mindset to not drink at all anyway, so I would drink during the week too. I've tried drinking only in events. What the fuck is this? This one it's even funny, how can I only drink in events? What's that? Everything can be an event, it's so easy to get an excuse. I got to the point where I gave up stop drinking, it was getting too exhaustive (because I was always drinking, duh). My friends, and please, don't come with the bullshit that they are not really my friends. They are, they just don't know any better. My friends always tell me that the balance is the key, that I should just drink enough and stop. It just doesn't work. What balance are they talking about anyway? How come inducing toxins to your body, in this case alcohol, is some kind of balance? Even in low quality. I don't fucking NEED it, there's not a single thing to balance here, don't be all yin yang with me in this situation. Of course it doesn't work too, because if some heavy shit happens in my life, I'm going to heavy drink, since I already drink anyway.  
Meanwhile, I've started studying again, something easier than Engineering, but kind of challenging anyway. It's going great, I'm one of the top students of the class and in the beginning it was making me feel fulfilled. Now? Not so much, because I've started drinking like there's no tomorrow again, I get a great mark and I don't even feel that happy, I actually feel sad for no reason and go drink beer. And no, I'm not drinking in a celebrating style, I'm drinking while tired and sad.  
I love my girlfriend, and probably you can tell why by just this post, how is she still with me? She doesn't smoke, rarely drinks and hates that I drink. I'm super honest with her and I'm even going to show her this post, but she just doesn't give up on me. She even cried a week ago, when we talked about how I should stop drinking, how it affects my life and how she misses the sober me. The six months guy. I cried too. I felt so powerless these past days since then, I wanted to refuse drink, I couldn't. I wanted to come home, I couldn't. For fuck sake, if I can't, nobody is going to do it for me. I was losing hope. Every time I thought I should stop drinking, I would also think that I couldn't be with my friends, that I would be more lonely, that I wouldn't be so cool as those fictional characters or rock stars. But truth is, I feel more lonely than I've ever felt, I feel more uncool than I've ever felt. I mean, how cool is it that you can't control what you do? So stupid... I even stopped using my old account here, because I am truly ashamed of failing, and started attacking (in my head only) this group, that everyone here are being so extreme and that's no way of living. Typical bullying situation here, right? You feel insecure about yourself, you attack others.

Please, don't make the same mistake as me. I should have never tried those beers, I should have never failed to the temptation just because life was getting more tough. I should have never gave up being happy. This is a remainder for all of you and for me, not drinking is the real balance. Don't let yourself being fooled, by yourself and others, that drinking moderately is the key. It's not. It's stupid and useless. It's never a perk, just a waste.

For the first time since almost two years ago, I'm going to stop drinking again. I'm going to use the same methods I've used before, if it doesn't work, I will seek for professional help. I'm not ashamed of admitting I have a problem, I am ashamed of knowing I have one and don't do shit about it, there's nothing cool about this.

I probably realised that it was past the point of ‘something I could control if I wanted’ when I couldn’t do a one month challenge a few years back (on day 4 I had a meltdown and ended up drinking straight gin from the bottle). Up until then I always justified my nightly drinking by blaming my anxiety, or a stressful work life. I’m perfectly functional, running a business, looking after my young son and generally getting through life. The problem is I thought for years that my intake was normal. I now realise that it’s so far off normal, and I’m on a path to a very early grave. 

So, I am comfortable with the knowledge that I am well and truly under the thumb of booze. 

As we all know it ends up creeping up. I got to the point where 6 beers and 3-4 big glasses of scotch (often a bottle of wine thrown in for good measure) became the nightly habit. I hated the foggy mornings, knowing full well that I could be over the limit if I was pulled over on my way to the office. I gained weight steadily, now weighing in at 120kg. 

At 36 and with a young family alcohol had gained control, and was stealing everything from me. 

I tried a bunch of things. Only drinking beer instead of anything hard (just got bloated and felt like shit), only drinking on weekends (never lasted more than a week) and even TSM, using naltrexone to gradually minimise the cravings. Even this, whilst somewhat effective, was overcome by my brain. It soon realised that hard liquor was an easy way to beat the naltrexone telling me I didn’t need it, and I continued to drink heavily. Of course it was always justified, and being a friendly relaxed drunk meant that my family never really worried too much. 

So, today is the day. I have so much to enjoy being sober, and so many hobbies to pick back up that I lost to the perpetual laziness of drinking. It’s time to set that monster aside and get back to a life of fun, health and energy. 

On today, my day 1, I’m writing this to remind myself why. I have gained a lot of strength reading your stories, and I’ll check in here as often as I can. 

My big concern right now is Friday night, as I always find it impossible to go without my ‘reward’ (which is getting blind drunk and waking up for kids sport with a killer hangover... but I’m going to keep up with it one day at a time, and hopefully one year from now I’ll look back on this and smile.

Luckily nothing terrible happened. One of the reasons that gave me anxiety was a misunderstanding with my girlfriend. Another one was a hurtful thing my father messaged me. I feel like I would have been way better off dealing with both issues sober, but luckily no fight escalated. All misunderstandings were cleared this morning and life goes on.

I regret for not having enough self control in a situation that is usually a huge trigger for me. I didn't even have fun drinking my worries away.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

2020-01-13 02:34:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eo0zo3/thoughts_on_compassion_connection_purpose_and/,"Thoughts on Compassion, Connection, Purpose and Addiction","Today, i understand what it is to live with meaning in order to find my purpose. Today I understand that through the perspective of compassion and kindness, i can find intimate connections with family, friends, strangers, and to other human beings i do not know because I understand that we are all connected in someway. Today I understand that love is the transformative force that can bring everything together and heal my soul. 

But also today, i still search for meaning and purpose. Today i still struggle with living compassionately. And today, i still struggle how to live with love. Life is forever changing, and sometimes it changes make you look back to learn how to move forward. Life makes us question what we know today so we can change once again to move forward with it. Sometimes we fear the signs and fear holds life back. Life also brings us new answers to questions we forgot to ask or answers we were afraid to learn. And sometimes life gives you a gift. 

Today life is hard. Today love is hard. Today acting compassionately is difficult. Today i accept that it is and that there is a lesson for me to seek, to understand what is unfolding in front of me so i can move forward in the direction toward something transformative. Today is a hard day and I understand that sometimes finding happiness doesn't always mean it will bring you pleasure. 
For me, addiction is about finding meaning, finding purpose, finding love, learning how to live through life's struggles. Learning not through a script, learning without set rules or steps or structure but learning through taking a look at life through a critically spiritual process through the perspective of compassion. Learning collectively with others to find answers to your life's unanswered questions. Learning together creatively to transform our individual lives as we discover it. 

The past 8 years I've lived through the perspective of compassion as being the guide to every thought and action which has transformed me into the person i hoped to be in many ways. A person who i can look and see in the mirror most days with love. What ive learned is that compassion is what connects us to each other and the world. It is through compassion that creates the intimate relationships we need to feel connected, to not feel alone, to be understood, to be seen. And addiction is the loss of deeper connection to ones self and to all the relationships we have and seek. During my recovery i have also tried to understand Love’s meaning, purpose, and how it relates to my life and experiences. I practiced love in the way i believe was right for me. Learning from different perspectives and through others experiences that helped me get to a place where others close to me could heal from the damage I've done. And it has helped me also help others to heal by sharing knowledge that i have learned and by sharing my experiences. But love is hard to understand. Love still keeps me questioning, guessing, and especially when it comes to my needs. Not a desire or attachment but a requirement to my soul. I thought i could live without a certain type of love in my life but i was mislead by holding on to shame. 

Now, a better version of myself has appeared but I understand that life always changes and grows. And what we know yesterday doesn't always hold truth to today or tomorrow. That answers to ourselves is transformative through time, experiences and through people who we encounter along the way. Don’t be afraid to grow to change because without change we cannot grow.",3

This is my life now.  It was my life before.  It is my life now.  I do not drink.",12

I have been free for five full years.,"Marking 5 years sober, I am re-submitting a post I made that resonated with a lot of people and I hope a new audience finds it helpful. I re-posting it on the one year anniversaries with additional life changes but here it is anyway.

**Original Post** (with years adjusted)**:**

I gotta say I am so grateful to be here. Really long story about the beliefs and events I held during my years of drinking.

**If I could have told the me of 14 years ago** that drinking was going to make life a million times worst that idiot wouldn't have believed me. He believed drinking would open up the doors to parties, friends, girls, and fun times. He couldn't foresee the endless hangovers, physical and mental damage, the friendships lost, the belligerent behavior, the additional new addictions, the nights of crying, the massive debt, the emotional stunted-ness, and a myriad of negative consequences that were to come.

**If I told the me of 12 years ago** that drinking wasn't a real source of pleasure he would have laughed in my face. He didn't yet understand that drinking wasn't bringing real pleasure, just running a simulation in the brain that gave a false positive that looked like happiness. Besides he thought he needed alcohol to talk to people. He didn't know that initial anxiousness from talking to new people was normal. He would have denied that alcohol is an addictive drug that numbs and dumbs. He was too drunk to realize those parties did not consist of real happiness and those were not real connections he was making. He wouldn't learn how to socialize for years because of his reliance on alcohol. (Still making up for the lack of learning this skill for sure)

**The me of 10 years ago** still wouldn't see it as an addiction. Yes, he had failed out of one college and was about to fail of the second one. Yes, he had put on 30 lbs. But that was just all the junk food from the fast food he was eating when he was hungover. It wasn't the alcohol. Besides he would have said: school was dumb, he wasn't showing up because he didn't want to be there. He thought the hangovers were worth all that useless debt. Also, he wasn't depressed and lonely because alcohol was consuming his life. His friends had just left him because it was what all friends were doing at that time. They were just moving on, not fed up with his shit.

**The me of 8 years ago** wouldn't believe that he could relax without a beer. He couldn't yet see the difference between real relaxation and getting a fix. He needed it after work to make the day easier and to sleep. Btw, that other 35lbs on top of the original 30 was just part of getting old. His life was in shambles. He needed alcohol in greater quantities to take the edge off at the end of the day because his life was really bad. He couldn't see that the alcohol was standing in the way of fixing his life. He didn't understand relaxation could be as natural as breathing and no alcohol would be required.

**The me of 6 years ago** realized that he had been in denial of drinking too much for years longer than he was willing to admit. But he had been telling himself that those times he was able to stop for a day, three days, almost a week, were proof enough that he wasn't really addicted. He could moderate. It would be fine. That night when he threw up blood that should have been a wake up call was only the body staying it was time to slow down for a short while. He did actually admit, it was time to slow down. It was here that he realized he couldn't, he didn't know how. He was trapped by his false beliefs about drinking. He championed a litany of false benefits he claimed drinking was giving him. Justified by his stupidity and brainwashing he decided to only cut down, he would ""moderate."" He wasn't able to see how to live without it. He found this subreddit [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking) and would monitor his drinking. There would be an entire year of reset badges that never made it past 8 days.

**The me of a little over five years ago** thought that only drinking to the point of passing out only three nights a week was progress. It wasn't great but it was manageable. Yes he had been getting advances on his paychecks to buy alcohol, stealing a couple dollars out of people's wallet or raiding the coin section of people's cars now and then, yes he was still hiding the bottles, but he had been doing that for years now. That bloated tiredness was normal. It was normal to take a few days to recover from a night of drinking now.

**Two week prior to the final drink**: 27th birthday. Well since I can't remember too much of it so let me say there was a lot of time spent texting old friends who didn't want to see me which lead to even more drinking. Spent more money than I had to rent a hotel as I drank every night and day for three days. It was a birthday extravaganza. How glamours you ask?

**Five years ago from today:** I was particularly hungover and my job was in jeopardy. I was thinking about my birthday and how crappy it felt. I started reflecting on the last few years and what I would want to change about my life. I had just turned 27 and was worst off than I was at 17. Far worst off in fact. I had accomplished none of my dreams, was living at home, and hated my job and my life more than ever. And the thought struck me: If I keep drinking my life is going to be in this exact same spot on every birthday and every day for the rest of my unhappy life.

That gave me the resolve to quit. I wanted to change. I wanted life. I wanted freedom. It was ridiculous to be so miserable. I had to make a plan for a better life. But there was a hitch, a stumbling block, actually there was an anchor chained to my neck: ALCOHOL. The only way this plan would work was if I stopped drinking. For my life to be better in any measurable way, for me to not continually sabotage myself, I would have to stop drinking. I had to eliminate it for good.

**So I did. One minute, one hour, one evening, and one day at a time.** I white knuckled the first few days. I did the unthinkable and instead of lying about going out to and drinking like I normally did, I lied about where I was going out and went to an AA meetings. I did a couple of those, some Atheist sobriety groups, and tried a few other support groups. I posted here or read posts here every night for the next few months.

In addition to talking to people here what really helped change was changing my perspective through books. The lessons I have learned, or more importantly the false beliefs I had to unlearn have been scattered throughout this post. I would tell you these lessons but it really helps to read the books. The most helpful reads were: Alan Carr's The Easyway to Control Drinking, Jason Vale's Kick the Drink...Easily, and most recently Annie Grace's The Naked Mind. Get them from the library, get them from Overdrive Media, get them anywhere, and give them a shot. I never would have made it this far without them.

Gonna try to wrap this up as it is about 12 times longer than I expected but I got to reflecting. I hope someone read this whole silly thing and that it gave some people some hope for freedom and some ideas what worked for me.

The lows are only made worst by the drinking. Getting clear of that additive toxic poison gave me access to control and freedom to live again.

**Two years later** I have a degree, a new job, moved to a new state, lost about 30lbs, and feel so much better.

**Three years later**: Three years later I have been promoted, got a raise, moved into my first apartment without roommates, lost some more weight, paid off my student loans, replaced a desperately worn out 21 year old junker car, and finally have a small positive net worth. Next step: make friends and maybe start dating again.

**Four years sober:** I want to make this post positive but life still has its ups and downs post drinking.

*Good news:* I was promoted again and am now earning more money than ever before. However I am now working more hours than any time prior. I have a tiny retirement fund, its not much but I started it. I started going on dates again which is something I haven't even tried in over 7 years. I am getting out more and getting outdoor exercise. I am now almost completely vegan.

*Difficult news:* I have tinnitus and am losing my hearing. I am barely in my 30's and my short term memory is turning to crap, it is rather scary and I am waiting on tests. Those daily hangover headaches should have been a wake up call. I was always worried about liver problems, but memory issues seems is my new nightmare.

**Five years sober:** I don't have much to report. Not feeling this post at the moment but it is a good reminder of what's happened and it resonates with others.

Good: Discovered yoga, never saw that coming. It doesn't come natural and I am not good by any means but man does my body need it.  I will have my car paid off this year (hopefully).  Learning Spanish (slowly).  Re-read the harry potter series (Currently half way through the Deathly Hallows). I also went to S. Korea and San Francisco.

Difficult news: Plenty, but no point in focusing on it here since it won't be productive.

Here is some inspiring stuff instead \[The Practical Benefits of Outrageous  Optimism\]([https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/10/03/the-practical-benefits-of-outrageous-optimism/](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/10/03/the-practical-benefits-of-outrageous-optimism/) )

and \[The Key to Happiness in a Distracted World\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Lay89Tk2nk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Lay89Tk2nk) )

&#x200B;

Next steps: Reach final goal weight, make long term friends, start going to physical therapy and psychologist.

Side note, I very much recommend Feeling Good by David Burns. I have recommended it before but it is worth revisiting.

Super grateful! Thanks for listening! Give yourself the freedom you deserve by staying sober.",110
2020-01-12 23:30:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/enz6gw/sober_three_days_scared_i_wont_make_it_last/,"Sober three days, scared I won't make it last","So last Friday night I got really drunk again and, after probably having about 13 drinks, had an argument with my wife over nothing, swore at her, and overall acted like an emotionally abusive monster. I woke up at 12.30 the next day wreaking of alcohol, with the usual heavy head, nausea, and feeling of having added 1000 miles to the ticker in one night. Over conversations the next couple of days, I finally found the strength to say out loud, to myself, to my wife and to my brother, that I have a problem, I'm sick, and I need to stop drinking. 

I've struggled with alcohol for more than ten years now, probably since I was 16/17 (I'm now 29). I think I've always known I've had a problem but have been reluctant to admit it as alcohol has always been such a big part of my social network, my memories, my make-up...it's hard to imagine life without it. This despite the fact that over the years, as a result of alcohol, I've lost jobs, been emotionally and physically abusive to others, been physically+sexually abused myself because I was too wasted, been arrested, cheated on my gf and now wife, made an ass of myself at my work party, pissed the bed, injured myself, cut myself - the list of shit that I've inflicted on myself as a result of drink goes on.

I went to AA for a few meetings when I was 25 and found it both helpful and interesting, but I soon quit, because, well, no good reason. Probably I was scared about the big change in my life. I guess I wasn't ready. 

I want to stop alcohol for good, because it's taken control of my life. I've never been the kind of drinker that drinks every day, or drinks in the morning, and have justified my drinking habits to myself because of this. But I massively binge-drink, I lose control, and in the past few months I've got so drunk that I've been emotionally abusive towards my wife and terrified her, probably on four or five occasions. I feel like if I don't quit alcohol, I'll effectively be choosing drink over my marriage. Not to mention my health. I have to do this for my wife, and for myself.

I think I can finally accept that I can't drink like most other people, and I have a problem. This is a big step for me. However, I currently live in the countryside in Japan, where there are definitely no English-language support groups like AA nearby. I want to stay the course, but I've never lasted more than 5 weeks without alcohol before. 

I'm proud of myself for finally admitting I've got a problem, but I'm also a mess of anger, confusion, fear and loneliness. My wife is amazing and eternally patient, but as someone who's never had a problem with alcohol or other addictions, I don't feel like I can talk to her about what it's like being in my head. And I'm still so cut up. Today, for example, I went to play sport with friends, ended up losing two games, lost my shit as well in probably very comedically childish fashion, and stormed home. I feel all at sea emotionally.

Please give me some advice, and maybe any tips on good apps or online resources to use to support myself in not drinking again. And thank you. Just reading others' stories on here is a help.",22

May 2nd 2016, for years my drinking became something fun to do. Haha, laughs, jukeboxes, etc. Eventually it became me in my bedroom alone, on a third bottle of vodka, gin, rum, beer, airplanes of 99 bananas because they got the job done fast. And my life fell like sand through my fingers. Things got so bad that I made a date. Up until that date I could do whatever I wanted. 
May 2nd, I drive to the hardware store. Bought the strongest cord of rope I could find. Got a room in a shitty motel, made a bowline knot. Drank as much as I could and put my head through that loop. If I had only tied my hands down I wouldn't be here. I lost most function in my right arm and the nerve damage will never go away. But I'm here. Reluctantly at times, but still here

What I'm trying to explain here is; yes, we all have a problem with alcohol. And it does muddle our minds and brain function. But the alcohol is a symptom. In my opinion, of something deeper. We can abstain, count days, treat ourselves with food. But i think we should also be mindful of the WHY. I am by no means perfect. But, for me, tackling the deeper, sad issues of life and conquering them will give that demon less shit to throw in your face. I mean no offense by this post. And I apologize in advance if i did offend.
Thanks everyone.",117

I could have been sober for 110 days (if I had stayed sober this whole time). Now I am back to day one. No more excuses. My streak broke in October when I found out I was pregnant and then a week later found out I was miscarrying (i didn’t drink until after I was miscarrying)... I used that excuse for awhile. Then it was the holidays. Or a hard day at work. Or my parents upsetting me. Or any stupid excuse I could make. I woke up this morning feeling like utter shit that I decided day one again. I’m tired of my kids seeing me intoxicated and they aren’t young that they’ll likely forget (9 & 7). 

So here’s my day one rant again, and I’ll probably lie awake in bed all night, not able to sleep, how it usually goes. It’s hard knowing what I’ll go through this week, but I HAVE to do it. My liver has taken enough damage I’m sure. I’m only 6 years younger than my brother (an intelligent doctor)  was when he died ultimately from complications of liver disease. I can’t let that happen.",6

Had a rough weekend. Picked up a bottle directly after taking an alcohol urinalysis test mandated by an appointment I self-referred to. That turned into a two day bender.  This one feels different. I've known that drinking was not compatible with me for some time, but this feels like the big fall that's need before a real change happens. I've nearly got my life back on track and I know that I will lose it all if I can't get back to sobriety. I've made all the proclamations, and definitely been lower, but now I actually have a life to lose.

So, I guess this is day 1.",19

A question to those who have been around longer than I - I am really blown away by how much better and deeper I sleep since giving it up. I am noticing, however, that I also get tired much earlier and more intensely - when drinking I could easily stay up until 11 and not feel particularly sleepy, but now I start to feel exhausted by 9.

Is this my body making up for lost time? Is it a healing/recovering thing? Or am I just ... a sleepy fellow without booze interfering with my circadian rhythm?",6

First day that I tried to go to aa. Showed up at one meeting that wasn’t there. Wrote down the details incorrectly. Looked up another meeting on my phone. Went there. Arrived early. Only the greeter was there. I mentioned that I mistakenly went to a non-meeting. Guy says do I know that this meeting is a big book study. No. Then he describes what happens in a big book meeting. He says that since they are already into the book, not at the beginning, that I might want to go to a different meeting. He was nice. He says, “It’s up to you.” I think - Well, if he’s in the know and saying maybe I shouldn’t stay - I can go. I’m shy. I was uncomfortable in the first place. First meeting I’ve attempted in years. Only been to a few in my past life. I feel really crummy for being too uncomfortable to stay once the guy said I might want a different meeting. I even said that [this meeting] couldn’t hurt. He agreed but pulled out a pamphlet to look for beginners’ meetings. 

I’m sure he meant well but, damn, I would be welcomed in any bar. But that was not my way. The supermarket/my bedroom was my way. 
I’m surprised I am still alive. 

I excelled at drinking. Practice. I guess I’ll practice showing up at another, non-big-book meeting. 

I guess I will try another aa meeting on another day. I hope I am welcomed or at least not counseled to think about leaving. It’s so hard showing up as a stranger. I’m uncomfortable and shy with new people. I cried a teeny bit talking to that guy. 

I’m sucking in my tears now. Holding back one’s cry can lead to a headache. But I’ve had those before. I’ll live. 

I apologize for this sorry post. I’ve read so many uplifting posts. I root for all of you. I get so much out of this group. I thought it might be the same or similar in person at aa. Though I might wonder what to use instead of higher power. But I was still willing to join in and never judge those who feel their higher power. 

I am judging myself for leaving but I couldn’t stay due to not getting the right kind of meeting picked for myself and also due to starting to cry. 

I am a strong person. I’ll put this into perspective.",95

I just want to say “what I’m hearing here is a lot of excuses.” Hate excuses. “What part of the excuse do you want me to accept?”

I’m feeling very good, and getting to the point where I’m not “just OK” mood wise. I’m rather “good!”

I didn’t drink every day, but I drank heavily like twice a week— the sort of drinker where if I drink, it’s gonna be 8 beers, not one. 

So really, I don’t feel too much different except the hangovers and physical setbacks are gone. I actually love this— I love it because I’m a runner so the recovery and the lack of jabbing the hell out of my physical fitness — plus the absence of guilt for that jab— that’s all positive. 

I’ve been filling my time with reading the science behind alcohol and watching every documentary I can find.

The problem is, I love a bar. I love every part of sitting at a bar for hours, by myself, talking to strangers. It’s something I’ve enjoyed since I was much younger. I’m a 34 year old woman and I have been comfortably going to bars alone and shooting the shit with strangers since I was old enough to drink.

I dearly miss this and I want to know a suitable fix. I’ve been trying to do other things, but I do feel that void. Any advice for that? It would be appreciated",8

I got my car out of impound and found a bag of 12 liquor bottles in my suitcase from the trip I was supposed to go on. I laid them all out in front of me and just stared at them wanting so badly to have just ONE. Then I asked myself, “what is one even going to accomplish? If you’re going to do one you might as well do all of them.” I even opened one and smelled it and gagged but still poured it into a soda. My next internal dialogue was: Jesus Christ you JUST got out of JAIL after blowing over a 0.20 you dumb ass!  It was like straight out of a movie, I dumped every single one down the drain, even the one in the soda and it was like a weight lifted off of my chest because I didn’t have to worry about being tempted by it anymore.

I suppose I am doing this now to further strengthen my knowledge that I am accountable for my decisions, that I have a drinking problem and that I am an alcoholic.

I had similar conversations with my wife over the weekend, which was both hard and reliving. It was the first time I had admitted to anyone out loud, even myself, that I am an alcoholic. She had previously expressed concerns about my drinking even though I hid the full extent of it from her. I admitted to her that I have hidden my drinking from her, that I am an alcoholic and that I cannot drink alcohol as I can not moderate that behaviour. She told me she undestood and that she supports me. She drinks very little and not at all often, so the idea of abstinence isn't that outlandish to her.

I am a little scared of how certain friends and family will react, but I know that in the end, they will respect my decision. Plus, I have read some great tips on here about how to communicate that you are sober.

I'm now looking forward to the journey along with everyone here to better physical and mental health. Not that I want to get a head of myself but I am looking forward to losing weight and improving my running, as well as devoting more regular time to mindfulness.

Thank you to everybody here in this community. I will stay sober.

I was a reckless teen being raised by parents with serious mental issues.  I dropped out of school and was pregnant at 16 by a guy who’s never financially supported my son.  At 19 I got a DUI.  After that I stopped drinking for about 1.5 years due to a scare from a kidney infection.  Since starting up again I have continued drinking on a regular basis for years.  Most of my friends and family drink and up until recently I have enjoyed the party scene...dancing, live shows, concerts, and bars.  Life of the party when drinking and shy when sober.

I’ve driven drunk several times, have crashed my cars twice within the last year, and have had uncontrollable angry outbursts in public, not to mention several more embarrassing stories.

I’ve suffered from depression most of my life and have used alcohol as an escape, but somehow I was able to start two businesses in my early twenties and am still working for myself.  I also finally finished an AS degree in business after 12 years and was accepted into a university and completed my first semester this past fall.

I had a recent break-up from a 2.5 year relationship with the person I thought I’d spend the rest of my life with.  Unfortunately, my SO and I had developed a habit of drinking together, and little by little my outbursts would come out while drunk, and I’ve said terrible things that I’ve regretted.  A lot of it stemmed from suppressed resentment toward my partner.  He was trying to help me change into a more responsible person, and somewhere down the line, I believe my drinking contributed to my partner also drinking heavily (along with the influence of his friends and family).  Things became toxic and as much as we loved each other, it was not healthy during the last year.

Last year I felt the need to seek help for my mental health and have been much more aware of my issues.  Recently, I met the criteria for BPD and am in the beginning stages of an intense year long outpatient program.  The diagnosis has put the puzzle pieces together for me and I’ve been taking antidepressants, anxiety meds, etc.  My therapist and psychiatrist both say I’m an alcoholic.  I started tracking my drinking a few weeks ago and I’ve had between 16-20 drinks per week.
Last night I drove “buzzed” from a friends house to the wrong side of town (to buy a single cigarette). I put myself in a dangerous situation where I had an altercation at the liquor store with a couple who was trying to intimidate me (I look like a nerd and like I didn’t belong there) that turned into them chasing down my car, throwing drinks at me through their window, and ended with me crashing my beautiful car 😭.

I’m so tired of all of the self sabotage.  I’m a great person and am a valued by my friends, clients, and I’ve managed to raise a straight A athlete son (13) who’s incredibly sweet—all on my own.  It’s been a rough road without the alcohol, but now it seems like I’ve spiraled into a depressing hole and the consequences are getting worse as I get older and they continue to stop me from progressing and developing into the person I want to be.  I’ve also managed to contribute to the dissolution of my relationship with the love of my life, which I’m struggling with as well.

I’ve been having a hard time accepting that I can’t drink moderately and with my emotional regulation issues, it only makes the situation worse.  I’m afraid that I am going to lose everything if something doesn’t change.  Enough is enough.  I cannot allow this to continue— it’s gone way too far.  Today is my Day 1.",3

Around 6:30 the previous night, my wife went downstairs and couldn’t wake me.  She tried some more before calling the ask a nurse line.  They immediately sent out an ambulance that hauled me to the ER.  My BAC was 0.53.  I wasn’t breathing right.  They intubated me and sedated me.  They let time pass until I could breathe again on my own.  After that, they held me until they were sure I wouldn’t go into horrible withdrawals.  

In the meantime, I was visited by the hospital CD staff and a team of shrinks who all were pushing me toward inpatient treatment.  I was absolutely against it.  I said I would do outpatient treatment.  My wife agreed with the shrinks and wanted me to go into residential.  My wife won out and one week later I’m posting this from residential treatment.  

It’s only today that I realize why she wanted me in inpatient so badly - she wanted to save my life.  More correctly, she didn’t want to have to save my life again.  I have been reading up on alcohol poisoning and even though I was scared before, I am now absolutely horrified at what I had done and what could have happened.  

Take this as a warning - I got lucky.  Damned lucky that my wife saved me and convinced me to save myself.  IWNDWYT",1011

It was a clean house & better communication with the people around me. My anger diminished & I was able to accomplish things. Then I allowed my broken brain to continue because, while I am strong in so many ways, I decided, actually I don’t know what I decided. I started drinking again. 

The positives of not drinking far outweigh the benefits of rewarding my need to sleep until I am dead. Yet I fight it. I’ve been in my robe for 3 days now. I stink. My scalp itches. My kitchen is a wreck. I got home from work on Friday & passed out. I did not drink yesterday. Today I discovered whiskey & a bottle of wine hidden in the garage. 

I have made a list of everything I need to do. I wonder if not putting throwing out the alcohol on the list is good or bad. I need reminders. But I don’t want reminders of my weakness. I’m a disappointment to myself & my husband. I feel needing validation for doing the right thing is a replacement for the numbness I feel when drinking.

Therefore, I can say that this is day one. I went on a 4 months dry run last year and obviously I failed at it. Recent events have solidified my determination to stop drinking even casually or socially. I have to admit I can't drink in a moderate or controlled way either. However, it makes me afraid life will get boring. Why go on a vacation if you can't have a beer ? Friday is here, have a beer !! Family dinner, here have some wine ! Nope, can't do that anymore. This is what makes me extremely afraid.

I am not someone that will drink everyday, I have a good job and workout 4 or 5 times a week. So you can't really tell I am in a problematic situation just by looking at me. Besides epic hangovers, I don't think I have had major negative repercussions from drinking **SO FAR**. However, recently things have happened. I fell down, memory losses and my heart beats really faster when I drink and I get palpitations. It is worrisome and I will not die for a beer. I'm convinced that if I don't stop drinking something bad is on the way to happen and I don't want to go there.

Another thing is my GF who really likes to drink and says I'm more fun to be around after a few drinks. She respects my decision but I can tell it bothers her. Oh well...

I reached out to a treatment center / therapy and hopefully this will help as well. Of course, finding a community here is great, something I didn't have to first time around. 

So there it is. Day one.

I’m a little over a month in and went to a friends bridal shower yesterday and was greeted with a mimosa. They’re usually pretty weak so I thought what the heck I’ll dip on one.

2) my stomach hurt SO BAD for the rest of the day, I got heartburn, bad bloating etc all night and still this morning.

I’m not upset with myself for trying it though. My resolve had been wavering lately, thinking maybe I was ready to try moderation and this helped me realize that I’m not. But also made me very consciously aware of how much some, maybe all, alcohol makes me feel. So if I ever do go to moderation, champagne and I are a no go. My goal with moderation is to only have something if there’s actually something I truly like, I’m quite picky actually. But I eventually got to the point I would drink whatever was in front of me at events even if I didn’t like it. Now I have a new resolve and focus on continuing to hold off and being more in tune with what doesn’t work with my body.

A slip up, but a learning moment so I’m still taking it as ultimately a good thing. Also I’m 6 pounds down since I stopped drinking and my stomach feels the best it has in years. Keep on keeping on folks.",4

You can't quit when you say ""I want to quit drinking really badly"".
You can mean it and you can want to stop but you won't stop. You won't stop because you are really saying you wish you could but you don't know how.


You quit when you say ""I don't like to drink"" and ""I am not a drinker"". 

The differences in mindset is ""wow I drink a lot and I dont know how to stop but I'm also not ready to stop yet"" and ""that isnt me, I am not a drinker""


Just an overview of my own experience. I hope this can help someone but if not, at least be interesting.

I have been a part of this community for some time now, and am about 5.5 weeks sober so far. Like many of you, it has been an excellent decision, and this community has done nothing but wonderful things for me and I wanted to thank all of you for that. 

I wanted to share an experience I had with you last night. On the surface it really doesn't seem too spectacular, but for me was an enormous victory. I went out to dinner with my wife and a few friends last night who indulge in drinking, but always stay responsible and do not get out of control. We went out to a beautiful restaurant, where we had to wait for a table for about 20 to 25 minutes. This was no big deal to us, but apparently the manager of the restaurant was bothered by this.  

Upon getting to the table our server immediately apologized for the ""long wait"" and promptly placed one free shot, on the house, for all of us. Everyone else in my party was obviously quite thrilled, and I just sat there and stared at the damn thing. Before this, I had probably been drinking for about 10 years. In all that time, I do not think I have EVER been offered a free alcoholic beverage by a business. 

To me, this was a clear an obvious sign of a test, the first of many that I, and all of us, will likely have to face for the foreseeable future. I am happy to say that I stayed strong and passed the shot to my friend, and continued to have a wonderful night out with friends.

I think the moral of the story here is we will all have tests; some large and some small. I managed to pass my first, and I hope that you all do the same. Stay sober everyone. IWNDWYT.",4

Not to mention reopening a litany of old wounds inflicted by him, some by me, that I was probably drowning in alcohol. 

The lovely night sweats are back as well as feeling like I can’t sleep for more than 20 minutes at a time. Complete lack of apatite, morning anxiety so bad I’m retching.

Not serious, but he was asking me if I had hanger issues, and admittedly, I tend to snack a lot while drinking.

We're doing a follow up blood draw in a week, which brings me to my point that it seems that cutting on sugar in the event there might be something going on looks like a good plan as well as cutting alcohol from my life.

My childhood was a mess. I was adopted at 12. My parents treated me like I was adopted. My father was an abusive drunk, which is why my alcoholic mother took me from him at 18 months. My stepdad was my hero, got custody of both of us(younger sister) when I was 4 and she was a baby. Then he married a straight militaristic narcissist, who he had a daughter with. He and his wife are still ""happily married"". I cut them out of my life a few years ago after years of begging them to care about me as a person and to stop being such negative, self righteous, critical pricks. By the way, I should note early on that there are people in my life who are amazing and with whom I am grateful to have positive, healthy relationships. Onward. 

I somehow had the ability as a kid to totally avoid alcohol. I dont know if it was because of the stuff parents told me or just realizing all the hell I had experienced because of alcohol. Even my step dad was an alcoholic and my Nazi step mothers father was an alcoholic who died alone in Vegas, hundreds of miles from his family. Just years of drinking alone.

Anyway, I graduated high school 16 years ago, was forced to go to college and thus began my 16 years straight of drinking all the time. I went from being anti drug and alcohol to a raging alcoholic who failed school multiple times as an adult, who bounced from job to job trying to find answers and value in life. 

I had one brief stint when my ex was pregnant when I did not drink for at least 9 months. Our relationship was crap, so I barely remember it. It was a tumultuous time as I was in the midst of cutting my family off, while having a pregnant wife, working 2 jobs, and just still miserable from my own problems. We also went through a lot together. Major fights, intellectual differences, similar traumatizing childhoods, and of course, a house fire that nearly killed both of us and my 8 month old daughter (at the time).

That scratches the surface. I spent the last 2 years in and out of therapy and it wasnt until this past December when I finally felt less depressed and more at peace with my life and who I am. That has definitely been a turning point in my life. I've never felt this good, but am still far off from where I want to be. 

The drinking hasn't stopped. I have multiple bad habits that are both costly and bad for me that I just can't shake. I'm glad I spent 2 years crying to a total stranger about all the stuff that was dragging me down, but I still am not close to 100% emotionally healthy. I'm broke constantly partially because of the booze. I have a master's degree I'll possibly never use. I'm working for people I find to be absolute wastes of space and my future is dependent on them (semi-successful family business). 

I know I should be grateful to be alive. I should take advantage of and be thankful for what I have. Aside from being a father, I just don't see the point in anything, so I drink. I've been sitting in bed for 3 hours on reddit, just trying to figure out how I'm going to start this journey when there's no one here to care what I do or do not do, I have a full day available to myself, and half a bottle of booze left to be finished, before I drag myself back to work with people I want to suffer for wasting 4 years of my life thus far. I'm an entrepreneur who spent his entire life working in various businesses and now work for another complete narcissist whose own family cannot stand him. Crippling anxiety is real and he might be the most ignorant person I've ever worked around and I have done well at many of my prior positions, in multiple leadership roles.

Anyway, my life has just been one dysfunctional mess after another at all times.

Everything is an excuse to give in to this addiction. Bad day at work. Great day at work. It's a hot summer day. It's a cold winter night. Got a flat tire. Fixed my tire. Feeling bored. Feeling overstimulated. It's the holidays so you have to go to parties, deal with family stress, oh and I'm wrapping gifts so might as well drink while I'm doing that. It would be nice to chat with the regulars at my favorite bars today. Traveling? Who goes to Italy and doesn't partake? 

The negatives of this horrific drug have been accumulating for years. Tens of thousands of dollars gone. Tons of weight added. I'm completely unhealthy. I eat shit and feel like shit. I have high blood pressure and who knows, I probably have diabetes which runs rampant in my family as does cardiovascular issues (oh, and raging alcoholism). I can't really pursue my hobbies and interests effectively. I feel like my brain is rotting and I'm getting noticeably dumber by the day. I have kind of given up on dating because who would want to be with a person whose life is in shambles, whose only hobby is getting fucked up every day. I know I wouldn't. 

I've been on day one so many times, as my username would suggest, and I want to say I'm finally done for good. But how can you grapple with tomorrow before you deal with today? 

I've been thinking about my sense of self lately. Like I don't really have one. I'm just like a piece of driftwood on the high seas. Just kind of doing whatever floats my boat at that very moment. I don't have the strength to actually take care of myself, to try to be the kind of person I would like to be. I would like to better develop my self-advocacy, the ability to advocate for myself to myself. Self-care. I just find it hard to care about myself.

2020-01-12 10:18:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/enomdw/au1400au1800_a_rough_estimate_on_how_much_money_i/,~AU$1400->~AU$1800 - A rough estimate on how much money I have not spent on alcohol in a year.,"OK, so it's not quite a year, but I'm close, and confident I can do it.  15th Jan 2019 was the last day I had a drink, it is now the 13th Jan where I am.

I got these estimates by scouring (using the search facility on) my bank records to see how much was spent on alcohol between 16th Jan 2018 -> 15th Jan 2019, then comparing that to how much was spent on alcohol from 16th Jan 2019 -> Current Date.

Yes, there is still money spent as my partner continues to drink.

I can't get an exact amount because I didn't track how much I spent, so these rough estimates depend on how I do the maths.

Drinking Period - Non Drinking Period ≈ $1400.  This assumes my partner spent the same amount last year as she has this year, and the difference was me.

Drinking Period / 2 ≈ $1800.  This way my partner and I split the cost of last year evenly.

Just a reminder that these numbers do not represent savings, just money not spent on alcohol.  This is because I still purchase other non-alcoholic drinks to have while chilling out around the house.  It also doesn't show the other side of things, such as quality of life and all the other good things that come when the drinking stops.

2020-01-12 09:44:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eno8w9/12_days_sober/,12 Days Sober,"Last year I spent time fantisising about being completely sober: being healthier, having more money, persuing more meaningful relationships. But then, inevitably, I would continue drinking due to a whole host of excuses 'my friends wouldn't accept me not drinking', 'moderation is fine'. But I just don't want to drink.

I'm 27 now and have been drinking heavily for 10 years and enough is enough - alcohol takes more from me than I take from it.

Me and alcohol aren't compatible and it's the cause of so many problems in my life. I've slept in bushes outside my apartment building, blacked out because I've lost my keys. I've been woken up in bus shelters on the other side of the city on work nights. I've woken up in entirely different regions of the UK because I've fallen asleep on public transport, drunk. I've been mugged while blacked out. I've smashed phones, lost too many coats to remember and consistently spent thousands per year on drinking - yet continually moan about not having money. Beer messes up by GI tract and makes me feel sluggish and sick.

And I've had enough of all of this: I just don't want to drink anymore. I don't have to find the motivation to say no: I have a very strong feeling I just don't want to anymore. A calling that I am grateful for. Listening to this, I've been toning down my drinking all year and I'm at a point now where I want to stop entirely. After years of depression and anxiety, this last year I have embraced real joy in my life through meditation, embracing a more simple life and creative hobbies - all of which do not require alcohol.

New Year's eve was the final straw: a friend drank so much, she had a breakdown which led to an awful night. I woke up with a cracking hangover after having a bad night and decided: no more alcohol in my life please!

I just need to learn the tools to navigate this socially (not caring about how I come across when I say no, I don't drink, not worrying about being 'the odd one out' or 'difficult' or 'weird' because I don't drink.)

I'm worrying about how I will deal with my relationships with drinking friends: maybe some friendships won't make it through. But I hope they respect me and my wishes. I'm a bisexual man and spend a lot of time in the gay community where alcohol and drugs are rife. Drugs have never been a problem for me but when friends take drugs, I drink like there's no tomorrow as I feel I have a 'free pass' to get out of it if my friends are too. Add that to living in London where the city seems to run on alcohol, my consumption was socially normalised but personally just not working for me. This is not a life I want anymore, and I think I have finally found the courage to say no.

Beyond those friends, I've some friends who aren't drinkers - old friends who I left behind to go partying - and I can't wait to nourish those friendships again. Friends who I used to go to the gym with, play music and cook with but don't make enough time to do so! I can't wait to spend time on these meaningful activities.

This Saturday morning, instead of having a hangover as usual, I got up early and sat in the morning sun at a coffee shop reading, and I felt incredible joy.

Time to stare myself directly in the face, improve my life and spend more time being creative in my hobbies, instead of continually repressing my problems by getting drunk. If anyone on here would like a sober buddy / accountability partner let me know!",5

My biggest tip would be just to keep the reasons for stopping fresh in your mind (and the things we gain).,"I did 120+ days last time, so 2 months feels a bit less special now. But this time I've made some progress by memorising all the bad issues surrounding my drinking and not letting them slip away (to be replaced by false romantic/nostalgic notions). Keeping lists in my wallet or using wristbands (with a few keywords) helps a lot. It's like exam revision.

At the same time I have a mental list of all the things I would lose if I picked up again - the clarity, the calmness, the good sleep, my (vague) athleticism, the occasional but regular bursts of inspiration/joy. If I started drinking again, these things would be lost - they're just not compatible. In many ways it feels like giving myself a gift, a life upgrade.

I'm also feeling more comfortable with growing into a non-drinker, from an identity point of view. Seeing it as a positive thing, a slightly rebellious life-hack, and most importantly part of an improvement process that I can feel in the present and project into the future. Not drinking can feel amazing, and I choose an amazing, hopeful life. IWNDWYT.",14

&#x200B;

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning fellow recovery brothers and sisters. I'm [u/rachiewoo1000](https://www.reddit.com/u/rachiewoo1000/) and I'm your host for this week.

Quote of the day from Steve O

""Anybody that's not supportive of me staying sober obviously has to go. But on the other hand, there are not really a lot of people who don't want me to stay sober. I was a nightmare.""

Can anyone relate? :)

But I need help.","Last weeks, especially last days, I have been incredibly stressed and sleep deprived. My internship, my classes, my relations, everything has taken a toll on me. I can feel myself slip into this very dark place I had forgotten about. I feel alone, I feel unworthy of help and love, I feel a bunch of different emotions and none of them is pretty or positive.   
I am late on homework but I don't know how to tell my classmates, I'm tempted to just lie and say I have the flue, but knowing I would lie about a real physical condition makes me feel even worse.

The only thing I want right now is get drunk to have an excuse to let all of those bottled up feelings explose, to be somehow allowed to be a mess, maybe cop some xanax and lock myself in my room and be high for a couple of days.  
I'm so exhausted. I don't think anyone except my very pregnant and already overwhelmed sister knows how bad my mental health is on a daily basis. I don't think my group of friends realizes how serious my depression can get.  
I can't follow therapy right now and I'm moving to a different country in a month.

I just saw on the calendar that tomorrow I'll be 11 months sober of any drug and alcohol. Until then, I've always felt great about my sobriety. Right now, it feels bittersweet. I'm glad I'm sober. But I don't have anything to release the tension or to cope with the feels. It makes socializing and sex awkward sometimes. And it feels like a giant red arrow to my issues. How bad are things if I have to take such a radical action? It feels unfair that my mental health cuts me out of it and separates me from parties, from so much.  
I won't drink tonight, not tomorrow either, I won't drink again. Because I know it will makes everything ten times worse. But man, I'm upset about it. And I don't like being upset about my sobriety.",7

It made me feel.. right? a 24 pack on a Tuesday night was normal, a glass of vodka before returning to work was enough to loosen me up. I get more talkative and social, and fun!

A while ago I had made some promises to a couple friends who had passed away, I wouldn't let it take control of me ever again. and I broke that promise, I couldn't stay away.

Well last night, I made a spectacle of my issue in the middle of my girlfriend's favorite restaurant with 2 of our close friends. I showed up to her place a little late, and about 8 heavy beers deep, on an empty stomach, I was flying high. She told me later she could ""tell I was a little off"", well what a perfect time to bring up something I'd been feeling a certain kind of way about.. in our relationship. Side note, my mother is an alcoholic to the highest degree, I do not talk to her because she would do things exactly like I'm about to describe. I told her I feel like she's selfish in many ways, what I meant to say was "" I just need a little bit more love from you in a different way. "" I'm an awful communicator, and low and behold, this girl had put up with my shit for over 2 years and was used to/sick of it. We bicker and I try to go back and explain what I was trying to say, finally I said F\*\*\* it, lets go to dinner, I'm sorry I brought it up. She agreed, she was hungry, we kissed and everything was normalish.

My lord and savor alcohol decided we needed company, so I called up my buddy to get his girlfriend and lets go to dinner together! My Girlfriend was ecstatic, she loves these two, and we normally have a good time. They agree and we all ride together to the restaurant! Things quiet down for approximately 19 seconds before the waitress gets our table and seats us, and I go into it with her, in good fun. Then I became ""that guy"". I swore a bit loud, and the table across from us stopped, and looked. I recognized this, and apologized to them. When I got back to our table, my friend told me "" You're at about a 12, I need you to reel it back to about a 6.5. "" ME? A 12? NEEDING TO REEL IT BACK? WHAT IS THIS MADNESS.  I jokingly said ""mmm shut up."" Lucky for me, he's a teddy bear, I look back now and wish he would have gotten a bit more serious with it, but it's not his job to baby sit a grown man.. or what is supposed to be a grown man. The night progresses and I'm naturally alienated as the drunk guy at the table. It sucks. I don't like it, I can't handle it. I keep making passive jokes about it, and saying how ""I guess I can't say 'F\*\*\*' anymore."" and other, not funny, stupid comments. I look back now and just think, ""who am I?"".

The night progresses and I've gone full blown melt down, I want attention and no one is giving it to me. I don't want to be here anymore, and I don't feel like anyone wants me here anymore, and that's the worst thing to me at the moment. I start getting the drunk super charge, and I look at my phone to get an uber and I can't even read the screen. I stand up and say ""listen guys, I'm going to catch an uber back, I don't feel wanted here, and I don't want to cause a burden on others."" They get extremely agitated and exclaim for me to sit down and I've reached a point where I need to make the decision to go full blown asshole or calm down. Luckily, I called down, I sat down quietly, and ate my food, it was awkward from then on out, and its my fault, and I knew it, so I apologized, reluctantly. Leaving, my girlfriend had to help me walk out because at that point I turned into a toddler.

We get to the car, and it's pretty quiet, I try talking to my girlfriend but she's so far beyond pissed it's pointless. I have to pee so bad at this point, that I'm actually scared I'm going to pee my pants. They live extremely close together, in an apartment complex, my girlfriend and these friends of ours. They stop and chat a bit, and I'm sure girlfriend said ""I'm so sorry.... "" I grab the keys and run to her apartment, both of our dogs come FLYING out of the door, and I'm too committed, I HAVE TO PEE. Run to the toilet and luckily avoid any accidents. I come back out a minute later and get the dogs, apologize and head back inside for water and to settle down.

She gets back, and I'm watching her buzz like a bee around the place, FURIOUSLY cleaning in silence. I get to see her maybe 2 weekends out of the month now, and I realized that I had messed up so bad at this point, that I need to make it up to her. I try to talk to her, and she's not having it. I plead with her just to hear me out, I blame the whole thing on my job, and not having enough love, and everything else I can grasp onto to try and spin the situation. When in reality, what it was.. is I needed to wake up and realize I had become my mother. A sad, empty shell of a person fueled by booze with complete and utter disregard for anyone else's feelings and thoughts.

I woke up on the couch after 4 hours of sleep, 4 hours of sleep is what I do when I'm running on fumes, or in panic mode.. I was doing both. It's 4a, I'm lying on the couch and I know now what I didn't know then, she was done. This was the second or third time I had gone full ""my mom"" and it's scary, it's not me at all. She wouldn't take it anymore, she doesn't need to, she deserves so much better. The things I had put this woman through are unfair to even the cruelest of enemies, and I did it to the woman I loved and cherished the most. I decided I'd make it easy for her, I ended it, and that was it. I have some things I need to work on, and she needs better. I'm running on 4 hours again, as i lay here in my bed.. reliving that moment time and time and TIME again. I need help.",6

If I said I got here of my own strength, it wouldn't be true. Today also marks a few days past my 6 month anniversary with my partner. When we met, I had spent a better part of the last year drinking most nights away. I had a drink on our second date and a little on our third, and then I just stopped. I had been better the previous month, and then when I met her, I stopped wanting to piss away every free hour that I could. I wanted to be there for every moment we were together, and I wanted to remember it all. I drank to hide from myself the pain I felt. But her presence numbed the pain in a  way that alcohol couldn't.

It felt effortless to stop this time, but I did have to make some changes. I had to stop hanging with certain people, take medication on a regular basis again, and find healthy ways to cope with pain. But every time I had an urge to give up again, I had a cheerleader, a confidant, and a reason to be better.

Now I'm sober for the longest time since I started drinking, and happier than I've been in as long as I can remember. I'd watched so many happy updates on this sub the last year or so, and it feels good to write my own. Cheers, yall",16

Sorry, I have to share this, and get it off my chest real quick. Ok, I am 38F, who has recently given up drinking (normally drink 6-8 beers every night, and have for years). I'm going on 12 days sober. It's been up and down, honestly mostly up, but today was a little rougher. After work, I was trying to find something fun for my Husband and I to go out and do that didn't involve drinking. And - I found the perfect thing!!! Literally minutes up the street from me, was a ""No - Alcohol Pop - Up Bar""!  Food, Music, Games. The whole thing. Tonight only. We decided to head up, I got all pumped to try some fancy Mocktails and NA Craft Beers (not triggering to me at all, they actually help me here and there). Well, guess what??? Turns out that you had to buy tix in advance, and no walkups allowed. We were turned away at the door. I didn't realize how frustrated and on edge I was today, until I burst into tears on the walk home tonight, asking why they had to make it so hard for me to try and do the right thing and stay sober, crying and ranting that they're gonna turn away the wrong person, who might just walk across the street to the liquor store where they won't get turned away...And then I caught myself and laughed and said to my Husband ""Jesus. Look at me. I'm crying about MOCKTAILS""!!! 😂😂😂 I honestly don't even drink them, just Heineken NA, maybe one every couple days, mostly sparkling water and kombucha, but...it was more that I was excited to try a sober event for the first time. It did reaffirm to me, though, that...I'm stepping out of my comfort zone, you know? And that I'm really, truly serious about this. Anyway, all's well that ends well. My Husband and I brought home my favorite Thai food and binge - watched a few episodes of ""The Americans"". We turned it around, and had a good night, and I forgot about all the other stuff. Lol My Husband (my best friend, sober in solidarity with me since New Year's : ) asked me if I wanted him to buy a couple juices that he can mix together at home for me and charge me $8 a piece for, and it's still making me laugh and smile 😂😂😂 IWNDWYT!!! ♥️♥️♥️",109

My wife barely ever drinks. Really, if she had a drink it was mostly due to my influence. The other night we went out to eat and she asked me, before ordering, if it was ok for her to order a glass of wine. How awesome is that? I said of course and she enjoyed one glass of wine the entire evening. The friend we went out with also rarely drinks, and had a glass of juice. There was zero pressure on me to drink.

Last night we had dinner with some other friends, at their place. There was no alcohol to be seen, because they rarely drink either. So no temptation there either.

I have so much natural support, and it’s not fair. It’s not fair for me to have it so easy. But even more it’s not fair for me to be *so upset about not being able to drink*! And then it just gets worse because I get upset at myself about getting upset in the first place.

I mean, I was in such a bad mood yesterday. I felt depressed, frustrated, and angry to the point I almost cancelled the get-together so I could stay home and have a pity party. For no other reason than I’m upset I can’t drink. I didn’t cancel — I went, my mood improved, and we had a blast playing games. And I drove home sober.

But it’s not fair. Not fair that I can’t drink. And not fair that I get upset about it when it’s not something that’s pushed on me.

Sorry for the rant. Stay strong everyone. IWNDWYT.

The first year. Time stood still. The first day was the longest of my life. The first week, an eternity.  I quietly struggled. I was still depressed that whiskey and I had to break up. I almost called her a few times. But couldnt press send. Because in the back of my mind resided the truth. She was guna kil me.

Year two. Still unsure of who i was without a glass in my hand i began to explore some hobbys.( I settled on the violin.)  Still much of a hermit. Keeping to myself and work. But winning each day. Even quit smoking this year

Year 3. I was waking up each day a changed person. I had allowed myself to become happy again. One night I wept tears of joy at the realization that i was actually happy again.  I stopped dwelling on the past as much as before. I knew i had found a groove that i could just auto pilot this no drinking thing. I only every thought about drinking  once every month or two at this point,  Just to check how long it had been.

Year 4 . 
Relationships are strong. Work is solid as heck. 
Ive lost the mental capacity to negatively dwell on the years wasted,being blackout wasted. Since i only have space in my life to look forward to doing the things i love.

Year 5 day 1. Im not looking for a congratulations for making it to 5 years. Just wanted to share my experience, hopefully inspire some of you fine people in the community to succeed without drinking.

Iwndwyt. Or ever. 
5years was so fun, ima do another 5.",116

There are so many amazing things that have happened since I’ve gotten sober—my whole life is vastly more manageable. Even though this is hard, it is still not nearly as bad as when I was drinking. The one thing that really really motivates me to keep from drinking is thinking what I’ll be like as a mum if I stay sober. I had a really difficult childhood and have a lot of trauma and pain, that I addressed by using. I used to want to have kids so badly, but I felt like it would be extremely irresponsible of me due to my past issues and my drinking. Now, I feel like I could be an amazing mum someday. The idea that I could wake up sober every morning and be present for a family is amazing. If I have kids they will get to grow up in a home with a parent who loves them unconditionally and doesn’t do anything to numb herself or avoid facing her life. Just thinking about this makes me want to cry. When I think about drinking, I imagine the type of person I was/am when drinking in contrast to who I am becoming and who I want to be down the road.

I feel more confident in my abilities then ever.,"I, like many people stopped drinking for the new year. I got decently drunk on the 31st and chugged my last beer at exactly 11:59pm. I went into the new year with the mindset of cutting back severely on my drinking, I didn’t have a plan for whether it was temporary or permanent. I just knew that I need to not drink alcohol for the foreseeable future. It really took control of my life. I couldn’t go more than a few days without drinking. I drank almost every single day. After work I’d pick up a 12 pack and drink while playing call of duty. I was eating horribly too. Fast food every night for dinner. Not only was I destroying my body I was bludgeoning my wallet. Almost 100 bucks a week went to drinking beer. And that was just drinking at home. When I’d go to the bars I’d drop well over 100 on the night, thank god for Uber and Lyft but Jesus Christ are they expensive. I had no savings, none. Between buying beer, burgers and going out my entire check would be practically gone before I got my next one. 

But I stopped. I really actually stopped! I can’t believe it tbh. I haven’t had a sip of alcohol all year. It hasn’t exactly been easy either, last weekend my buddies went out to a bar and invited me and dammit if I wasn’t already dressed and willing when I came to my senses and told them I wouldn’t make it. Same thing tonight, my friends had a bbq with a rib roast and a bunch of beer but I declined. I knew I couldn’t be around them, watching everyone drink and stay committed to this goal. But you know what I feel good, in fact I feel more thank good. I feel fucking amazing. I had a cup of tea earlier and sat down with a new book. I knew this feeling would come eventually, I just knew it. From the insomnia to the urges to drink it’s been a hard 11 days but I’ve made it through and I feel more in control that I ever could have imagined. 2020 is gonna be a good year.",9

Faith for the fundamentally suspicious.,"I cried in a meeting tonight. I’m not usually much of a crier, but I have cried in meetings before, and on the other occasions it’s happened I felt better for it. Tonight I just feel weird. 

It wasn’t in AA, it was [ACA](adultchildren.org). I didn’t even cry why I shared, it was when other people were sharing afterwards, and I don’t know why. I can’t even remember what anyone was talking about, I just kept crying.

I’m at the point in my AA step work where I’m starting to look at my resentments. My biggest resentments are clearly towards my parents, but I don’t know what to put down for my reasons. Nothing that I can think of feels legitimate or real or like enough of a reason, or even like it’s really the real reason. I don’t know how to articulate it, my mind just draws a blank. 

But I know that it’s there. I know that this is stuff that I’ve been carrying around for a lot of years. And I know that this is work that I need to do, that there are things that I need to pull out and look at with an open mind and willingness to see them another way. 

I drank because I’m an alcoholic. Four of my siblings who grew up in the same house with the same parents aren’t alcoholics. But my family stuff is definitely connected to my drinking. It is something that I need to face. 

I’ve done a lot of work in therapy around this, and could no doubt stand to do some more. Doing work in that therapeutic framework has been enormously helpful and healing and life changing for me. But it didn’t keep me sober, I relapsed not too long after starting therapy. And it didn’t get me sober again. It was certainly beneficial and positive in my life, but I didn’t get sober again through therapy. I got sober with the support of other alcoholics.

I’m very grateful that I have the sponsor that I have. We’re taking the steps incredibly slow. It’s not by my choice, but I trust my sponsor’s judgement. And I trust that she works a spiritual program. A lot of people strongly recommend working through the steps at a much faster pace, but I wouldn’t be able to do this now if I hadn’t done such a thorough third step. 

The third step is the one where you turn everything over to your Higher Power. It’s the one that I tapped out on the last time that I got sober and tried going to AA. Not for any specific reason, other than I didn’t particularly care for the idea of writing down a bunch of personal shit and sharing it with someone else, which I knew was coming next.

But I can see now that I really didn’t understand what the third step was about *at all*. I have a better sense of it. And I’ve lived it. I have experience with turning things over to my Higher Power and letting go. I have experience with trying to do what my HP wants me to do. I have experienced the results of that. 

My sponsor has told me things that I needed to hear when I needed to hear them, and I know that she didn’t know why she was telling me them, that she was just saying what she felt like she needed to say. I’ve had experiences with other people in AA being in the right place at the right time and interacting with me in meaningful ways. I have experience with this now. I know that it works. My trust in the process has grown, based on experience.

I was listening to an AA speaker today, driving home from work, who said that the “God of our understanding” (as it is described in AA, which basically means that AA isn’t getting involved in theology, your God/HP can be anything that you want it to be) which we talk about in AA would actually be more accurately described as the “God of our experience.” Because generally speaking, for alcoholics in AA, the conception of a Higher Power/God comes through practical experiences with working the steps. 

I have experienced that. I don’t have any real belief in a capital “G” God. What I have is my experience with working the program in AA to the extent that I have, to the best of my ability. I know what I experience when I do that. I didn’t get here by thinking about it. I still don’t know what to think about my Higher Power. Nor do I care, particularly. What I do know is that it works, and that it only works if I keep going, so I will.

I still do not particularly want to write down a bunch of personal shit and share it with somebody. I’m doing it because I know that it works. I’ve experienced it. And I know that my sponsor will say what she feels that she needs to say, and that it will be what I need to hear. I’ve experienced that too. I know that she steps outside of her ego and works with me as one alcoholic talking to another, and that whatever the magic is that happens as a result, it is real. 

Anyway, I hope that you all are well. Thank you for sharing this journey with me. I couldn’t do it without you.

One of the first things that came to mind was to suggest this sub to him; hopefully he made it here.

Just reminded me how critical this place, and friends like Cactus, were in the tough, early days. Things are a little different nowadays.

Went to a friend's kid's birthday party today and instead of pre gaming and getting hammered on shots I played with my kids... I do a lot more of that now.

Even more shocking was the fact that I ran 5k and lifted weights for 30-40 minutes before that. I actually enjoy exercise again. Today, my blood pressure is normal and my resting heart rate is in the 60s. I'm still heavier but about to break the 200lb mark and only 20lbs from my goal.

I read more, both for enjoyment and escape, but also for introspection and growth. I am trying to be more efficient with my time because there is so much I want to accomplish. I look back at the years I wasted drunk with a mix of regret and nostalgia.. regret for how much further ahead I would have been, had I started working on my life 10, 20 years ago. But nostalgia because I would not have met the people I did, experienced the things I did, or ended up where I am.

I think a lot of my current drive is coming from making up for lost time, and although I know I'll never get those years back, nothing will take my remaining years from me. 

If you're struggling today, hang in there. It **does** get better. You **can** do it. Cliche as it may sound, keep reminding yourself that **you** are worth it, and **this** is worth it.

I will not drink with you today.

Just really craving alcohol right now so I thought I'd come here and share my story instead. 

I know deep down that I have a problem with drinking. And I've started to see a major pattern of avoidance in general to anything that feels murky or hard or stressful. I just started hiding at some point. Hiding and drinking. Every day. 

It got to the point where I started to miss social things that I would normally be excited for because on some days I'd start in on the alcohol before noon and was just drunk and exhausted by evening. It got hard to work out because I couldn't get to a class before I started drinking, so I used to just go to classes after a few glasses of wine until an instructor called me out in front of the class due to me smelling. It was mortifying.

I managed to dial back the drinking a ton in the last year, meaning I mostly quit doing it alone. The rule was: only out in public and because I don't go out every day, this gained me a lot of sober days and some practice. I looked remarkably better, which really surprised me -- I thought it hadn't been affecting my appearance. It also improved my relationships with my friends, because I actually saw them. I gained more sober friends too, because I was able to withstand sober activities without pre-gaming and then having to hide it. I almost felt like I cracked the code of moderation. 
But I think I kind of just replaced the missing alcohol with other avoidance patterns, like obsessively lurking around Reddit. My life is on the precipice of ruin, financially. Work is bad. Romance is non-existent. When I look out at the future I go into such a deep depression and panic and I don't see any simple way out of this situation that I've cultivated over many years. There's a piece of me that just wants to go to AA but I'm so fucking scared. I don't want the world to know that I have a problem. I know the Anonymous part of Alcoholics Anonymous is bullshit. I really love drinking more than  anything else, and I still have this sense of being able to negotiate with the addiction. 

Via the cutting back plus a series of Dry Januaries, I've had some breakthrough moments where I was able to envision a truly sober life that was meaningful and directed outward towards community, not in some depressing silo of drunken avoidance. But for some reason, I still really just want to go get a bottle and destroy it. But I won't. 

Love you guys.",7

If your kid died, I'm very sorry, but I still feel the same way- no excuses'. The other one chimed in- I just can't handle people that- are basically not perfect people. I grew up with two narcissistic parents with sisters 4 and 8 years older than me. They divorced when I was 12 and everyone fucking disappeared. My dad moved away, my mom started dating, my sisters went to college and I was living in a house by myself. They both grew up with multiple siblings, their parents are both married. Both families 'do not worry about money.' The conversation was so annoying to me. And I love these women. They are both great and amazing. They were set up to be. I felt so frustrated and annoyed and I managed, 'yeah, well-some people have a to do a lot of work to get there to recover from their upbringing and you guys just kind of started there.'",2

Today I woke up and decided to do it for myself. Not tell anyone, not make some big plan that I would eventually change and then ultimately bail on for a shot of whiskey.

I did it for myself today, and that's the best feeling I've had in a very long while. Today made me realize how scary it is when you can't trust yourself.

I spent no money today. I ate the food actually in my fridge, I remember what actually happened in the last episode of The Expanse I just watched and I went outside for a walk, not to get beer, but just because being outside is something I claim to enjoy but never do when I'm drinking.

I'm going to do it for myself again tomorrow. One day with small changes.

Eventually all of this work on doing it for me will translate to how it effects others, but for now it's all for me and it is all one day and moment at a time.

I did not drink today and I kept a promise to myself.

Keep fighting yall.",10

Lasted for a couple years. I used to tell people it's lucky I have to cut it out or else I'd be a bad alcohol cause the euphoria is like nothing else to me. Of course my skin got better and I began to teat things I'd cut out and incredibly, I could drink alcohol and my skin would be fine. Which lead me down a long bad path of binging. I would drink every night for a couple months, realize it was a problem, and drop it for a month. 

The cycle would continue as I'd tell myself to moderate this time knowing that was impossible for me. This holiday break I was all alone, roommates gone, and had just had a talk with my ex which spiralled me into probably the worst week long binge I've had, drinking day and night. 

It wasn't till I told myself enough was enough that I realized how deep in I was. I would wake up in the morning shaking, feverish, nauseous, and so anxious I thought every minute was gonna be my last. Knowing that just a sip of alcohol was relieve that. At points I was shaking so hard I was sure I was on the verge of a seizure. Which was the spookiest part, the fact that withdrawal can kill you, I was terrified. 

I tapered down for a week and a half or so and jumped off Monday night. Tuesday I went in to work and spent the day basically rolling around on the floor, my skin so hot and so cold at the same time it was awful. Luckily my boss wasn't here this week. The next days were similar but kept easing up. Today, I'm seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. I can actually sit and watch TV on the couch without two sweaters and two blankets wrapped around me. I know I have some more work to go but I also know I never want to be in that hell again.

But I don’t feel like I do. Like a genuine deep connection to anybody. Sometimes I’m tired of doing the right thing. I feel bored. I feel lost. I feel disassociated with everyone my age (26f). I’m tired of saying no. I’m tired of feeling left out. I’m tired of being scared to go out again. I don’t know who to turn to. I don’t invite many people to my home. I’m scared of interactions anymore. Yet I’m less anxious because my body isn’t carrying the previous nights poison. 

I’m not good at keeping busy because my mind is so scattered. I want to have fun. Like everyone else who does it so effortlessly/carefree. I’m jealous. I miss my ignorance sometimes. But I carry the burden of what I did to finally decide to be sober, and if I go against it I will be filled with deep guilt, like I have been living a lie. I guess I know these feelings will pass, but I’m impatient! And just fucken lonely man. I’m being a bit whiny here but I can’t to no one else right now. No one understands in a way that doesn’t make me seem like a crazy drunk person, or someone who is just really hard on themselves . It’s a random beautiful night in January and I hear the parties everywhere. But here I am alone in my house unsure who to call or spend my time with. I guess it wouldn’t feel so bad if this wasn’t pretty much every night of my life these past 3 months.

The joy of sobriety does exist in waves for me, but tonight I feel bitter and excluded. I wish i was smart and had a project, I wish I was in school even (fucken. Crazy.) just something to make me feel like staying inside on yet another Saturday night alone wouldn’t make me feel lame. I guess I should work on making more friendships, or not being so scared to interact with the world. Something. I know. I gotta keep busy.

I've had gastric bypass and can drink a fifth by myself and still go to bed sober. My body processes the alcohol as soon as I start drinking. 

My wife and her friends that come over every weekend want to drink, but I know that I'll be tempted to just jump right back in again. Since I've quit, there has been no alcohol in my house. 

The other day, she sent me a text with the following:
""I just want to check in with you about drinking.  I don't want to start any kind of argument. I literally just want to ask how you're feeling.

I know no matter how I ask or say this it's going to sound insensitive, but I also have no idea where you're at or if you think there may be a point where you'd be ok with Aaron or I having something to drink around you in an inconspicuous way. 

I'm not looking for one answer or another here, I'm just trying to find out where you're at.

Also, by inconspicuous I really just meant like how Aaron's drink just looks like a soda and not a mixed drink or anything.  And I could drink out of a colored or regular cup.  That's really all I meant.""

Here's my response:
""I'm doing very well with not drinking. I'm staying positive, I feel much better about my health, my life, and my relationships. I'm thinking clearly and not being a jerk or an asshole to those around me that I love. 

I've avoided being around alcohol and that has really helped my state of mind. It isn't near me, so it isn't a temptation. I would love to keep it that way for as long as possible, but I know it isn't fair to you, Aaron, or Lindsay. 

There isn't an inconspicuous way for you two to drink if I'm going to be interacting with either of you. The only way that can happen is if the two of you drink after I've gone to bed. I don't really know how I feel about that right now. It might be the first step to being able to be around alcohol again, but it might also be the first step to falling down the rabbit hole again. 

I have been checking in on a subreddit daily to keep myself honest and accountable for my actions. I would like to check in with them and see what their opinion on this matter looks like. Would you be ok with me getting their anonymous opinion? Not necessarily to make any decisions for me, but to hear if anyone has experienced anything similar.""

So, here we are. I'm asking for advice. What would you do in this situation?  What advice would you give me for this situation?

2020-01-11 19:24:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/enfytg/a_love_letter_to_sobriety/,A Love Letter to Sobriety," 

I knew I needed you before I met you. After a long holiday season full of get-togethers, endless carbs and rivers of booze, I needed to set my intentions and reset my body.

Going alcohol free sounded easy enough, but it also made me realize how much of my life revolved around fermented spirits. The Friday Happy Hours, the ice cold beer after a long day, the celebratory clinks of glasses to good news and the solemn pour into a rocks glass to grieve. Alcohol with dinner, alcohol with football, alcohol with damn near everything.  

The first thing I noticed was the unexpected hole in my social life. In the beginning I thought I could still go out on the weekends, I just wouldn’t drink. It would be easy! If my life had a narrator, this is where they would chime in and say, “But it was not easy.” Not only are bars and clubs huge triggers but if you do manage to stay sober, you just find out an unpleasant truth: bars are not that fun. They’re loud, they’re dirty and they’re repetitive. It’s the same group of people bellied up to the bar re-hashing different variations of the same old shit.  

I also noticed that a lot of my bar friends started falling off the radar and I heard from them less and less. It stung a little at first but was ultimately a good thing. Maybe another unpleasant truth you have to learn, but a valuable one: your bar friends are not your real friends. Everyone loves a drinking buddy, but if that’s all you really share, maybe it’s time to expand your circle a little. No one said growth was easy.

But growth is something I achieved with you. There were struggles, but the rewards waiting on the other side were worth their weight in gold.

If you’ve ever suddenly woken up at 3:30 in the morning dripping in sweat, disoriented and with a pounding head, you know as well as I do that drunk sleep is not real sleep. However, after several days, I started getting that rich, saturated, REM-filled dreamland experience that I thought only the young had the privilege of. Getting a true, solid night of sleep paired with waking up refreshed in the morning was something I hadn’t experienced in years and I owe it all to you.  

You not only gave me more energy, but you also gave me plenty of time. I didn’t know what to do with this gift at first. In fact, it was almost annoying. Being a bar fly is a part-time job, so I had to figure out who I was outside of those walls and decide who I wanted to be in this bright new world you introduced me to.  

This made me do some heavy introspection. It was both painful and beautiful. Both freeing and hard. I had to come to some tough conclusions and I had to make changes in other aspects of my life in order to move forward. Without your nudge, I don’t know if I would have ever come to that point. You made me brave again. 

This new life is like seeing the world through new eyes. Everything is just a little more vivid and every day I’m just a little happier to be here.",17
2020-01-11 19:15:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/enfuo1/it_was_in_my_hand/,It was in my hand...,"Today was my dad's birthday celebration. It's a milestone year for him so my brother, sister-in-law, and I rented a room at a local restaurant for a party. I had 30 days off drinking in October but can't say the same for November and December. I intended to quit again but wasn't in the right mindset to make it happen til I got super sick around xmas. It kinda forced me to get started just before the new year and I'm at 12 days now. 

Anyway, we planned the party in the time that I was drinking and we decided to order a punch bowl of the restaurant's signature drink. I've finally recovered from being sick and it's been harder not to fall back on my usual evening beer, but I did it. Each day I've been getting more anxious about the party. A ""one day at a time"" mindset helped ease my anxiety but today, the day finally came. 

I rationalized partaking in a lot of ways. It's a party! This birthday only happens once! What if no one else drinks the bowl, we still have to pay for it!  

After setting up early, guests started arriving and I ended up using hostessing as my out—too many people to greet and get settled to grab anything besides the water that was already in my hand. I also ended up sitting at a table that made getting to the drink station very difficult. 

After lunch, speeches, cake, and a friend also unexpectedly ordering a Diet Coke, things were looking really good. People were starting to trickle out and I was so close to leaving. Then two close friends who are heavy drinkers decided to check the status of the bowl, feeling challenged to make sure it was empty before we left. I chugged my water and replaced it with half a ladle of poison. I added a striped paper straw and occupied myself fidgeting with it for awhile. Everyone else was choking down their drink. I don't know how, but I held onto that hardly filled glass til every one of the remaining guests left and then left it behind. 

I'm really proud of myself. It was such a close call and definitely would not have been worth it.   Thanks for reading, needed to share with some peeps who understand to celebrate this win!",51

I had a year and a half up until Thanksgiving 2018. The second my husband was off on a long trip I started boozing and I've spent the last year+ drinking myself back to where I started. 

I know what triggers my brain to start rationalize drinking and today is just one big trigger. Raining, blustery, husband thousands of miles away, bank account limping along until payday, and my kid is glued to his switch. I know there are plenty of ways I could turn my day around, but there's a nagging voice inside that says that drinking is the quickest way to make this day interesting and to make it through the next 8 hours of parenting. 

But I know that's not true. I know that it's half past noon. If I start drinking now, I'll be drunk soon. By the time I need to fix dinner for my kid I'll be too drunk to feed him a proper meal. I'll be hammered, possibly in a blackout when I put him to bed. Probably too drunk for a bed time story. My parents are alcoholics, so I remember how seeing my parents stumbling drunk was scary and confusing. I know my drunk behavior is scary and confusing for my son as well. 

If drink now, I'll keep drinking until I pass out/black out. I'll wake up hungover tomorrow and will decide the day is a wash and lay in bed while my kid sits alone playing endless hours of video games. I'll be too hungover to drive safely. Then then the boredom, anxiety, and seemingly neverending day will make me resolve to get more booze to move the rest of the day along and that the following day will be a......wash. Wash, rinse, repeat I guess. 

So, I wrote this. Rereading it was embarrassing, which lets me see how important sobriety is for me. 

And I'm here. I've never left an attempt to get sober without a new bit of insight. After 10 years of trying, I know that regularly interacting with other drunks is an key aspect to long term sobriety.

I was born with cerebral palsy and kinda figured it wouldn't be wise to add booze to my life. I changed my mind with the influence of close friends. It was just social drinking at first. Things got pretty bad at one point and for about a year, I was drinking more than bottle of wine a night, I reeled it in from time to time but my weekends were always filled with drinking and socialising.

Since my decision to live sober, I have experienced the full gamut of benefits, increased focus, attention and energy, a reduction in anxiety and negative thought patterns, plus overall better decision making and emotional stability. 

But the main thing I have noticed is the return of my fine motor coordination, particularly typing. I didn't realise how much being hung over effected this for me, it's definitely a amplification effect of my CP, but the onset was so gradual, I couldn't distinguish between the booze and my underlying condition until I eliminated the booze. 

Having this realisation has been like an awakening and great motivation to keep me going. I just wanted to share this and say thank you to this community.",5

2020-01-11 16:04:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/end95t/all_the_wine_i_havent_drunk/,All the wine I haven’t drunk.,"
It’s been 212 days is since I joined this subreddit - that’s DEFINITELY not how many days sober I have.  I have 7 days sober. The most I have reached in that time since I started trying (on 3rd June 2019) to be sober is 36 days. I couldn’t string 2/3 days together at first, then I finally did 4 days in a row, which felt like a marathon, then I went to see a friend’s band play and got wasted on wine.  Then I managed 7 days, another setback/relapse, then 10, relapse, then 4 again, relapse, then 7 again and on and on - HOWEVER... 

All the while I have read and reread and listened and re-listened to about twenty different books on quitting. I have researched and researched on YouTube, podcasts and lurked on here and posted on here too. All this I think has slowly been changing my thought patterns and ingrained responses. I am really trying to become as informed as I can about quitting. I have been to AA, not very often, but I mainly found the meetings I did go to helpful and the people just as diverse as any other bunch of folks you’re ever likely to meet. 

Then one day, and I don’t know why but in November 2019, five months after I started trying to quit, I was aiming for 30 days and I somehow managed 36 days. 

I was over the moon, I felt healthy, happier, slimmer more in control, fitter, my skin was better, I could still eat ice cream, my sleep was good, I felt more alive, more like me. 

Then, I kind of let the breaks off for the holiday season and drank again “because it’s Christmas!” but ended up feeling as shitty as I ever did and spent way too many days of my short holiday hung over. 

I currently have a goal of 100 days in my head and am doing all I can daily to get there. I really, desperately want to get there. I’m currently on day 7 and whereas the first time I made it to 7 days, it felt like struggling up a mountain with a backpack of rocks with temptation around every corner, this time it feels different.  The days have flown past. I am so grateful to feel like I actually *want* to do this. I don’t *have* to drink!! Ever again if I want!! Who knew?!? It feels like a gift to have all of these alcohol free days ahead of me. 

I think something clicks as soon as you realise you reeeeaally, reaaaaly want all the brilliant things that come with not drinking, and you start to see the benefits and the amazing glimpses of ‘a different way’ and the little “sparkly” moments within your own brain, and all that starts to outweigh the momentary and fake release of booze - The shame, the fear, the craving the inadequacy - the list goes on and on. Then *that* is where you really start feeling like you’re going in the direction you want. 

It took me a long time it didn’t happen on the first attempt and it might not on this one. But in the meantime, you know what hungover feels like? Right? Not being hungover always feels better than being hungover. No one ever died from too much sparkling water. Keep on going. 

There’s real work to be done and the hardest part (for me) is  just being alone in my own head with my thoughts, in my own body with my feelings and not numbing them out with alcohol. One thing I will say though is that it’s been getting slowly and ever so slightly easier to do this as time has passed. 

PS: I don’t want this to be read as any thing irresponsible as I know for some folks one more drink can be fatal, and please for the love of sparkling water, do not take this as any sort of encouragement to drink.  I was a bottle of wine a night kinda gal and often more, I suppose I just wrote it because I sometimes feel like counting all the bottles of wine I have NOT drunk and all the time I have saved by NOT drinking means that I have improved and I’m getting better. I am trying not to berate myself too much on the slip ups which have become fewer and farther between. Any way I hope this makes sense to someone and I also hope this is your last day seven (or any number!) ever- and mine. If it turns out it’s not I will not judge you or me and I will take all the AF days and start building upon them again. 

PPS: Please always see your doctor or go to hospital if you’re worried about the shakes, delerium tremons, or any other negative side effects of alcohol withdrawal.

I wrote this as I hope it may help someone and I hope that it is not controversial it is just how it has been for me. 


TLDR: The good of not drinking waaay out weighs the bad. Don’t be hard on yourself. Ice cream is great. IWNDWYT.",19

Today marks 9 weeks: the longest I've been sober in years. I'm really proud of myself with the progress I've made so far and how consistent I've been with not drinking.  I live with people who keep alcohol in the house, and so far, I've been pretty impressed by my ability to resist the urge to drink.  But today, I might have gotten a little cocky in my steps towards recovery. While cooking a recipe, I whipped out some sherry. Before adding it it a sauce I was making, I decided to put my nose to the bottle and take a sniff. Fortunately, I put the bottle back in the cabinet, but wow, was that a dumb idea. I was instantly brought back to my days as an active drinker where I would guzzle anything I could get my hands on. What was I thinking? That I would be healed in just 9 weeks and the smell of alcohol would never entice me again? Ugh. That was a close one.  

I hope you all are having a great sober day.

I have read through reddit stuff before, but never joined. After reading through these, I had to join. I felt like I needed this, needed to be here, needed to read and contribute. 

I started day one obviously on the most cliche day to begin, January 1st, but figured what the heck, I'll give it a go. Damn am I glad I finally followed through with my intentions to stop. 

I told my wife that I was gonna try that ""Dry January"" thing. She has no real clue that I intend to make it permanent, as while I haven't called myself an alcoholic, I do realize my relationship with it is pretty damn dysfunctional. I get closer and closer everyday to saying it, and today I said it in my journal finally. 

I I never really got wasted everyday, I just had a habit of drinking and drinking everyday. Come home from work, sit down with a glass of bourbon and coke and then just continue till I crawled into bed. It's hard to admit that it isn't just a ""Habit"", but an addiction. I mean hell, I can't think of anytime since I was 16 that I have gone 11 days without a drink, and I am 41 now. How is that not a problem?

The biggest things I have noticed so far is my skin is so much better. It doesn't feel hot, tight, dry and bloated. I am not really sleeping better yet, but I know that will come. I think it partially has to do with the fact I have been consuming large amounts of water. I don't drink soda at all except with liquor, so giving up alcohol also caused me to give up soda. 

I have also noticed that my head is insanely clear. I don't really like what it thinks about all the time, and that is maybe one of the reasons I drank (past tense, I like that!). So much to confront and deal with, but I like the fact that being sober is at least giving me the opportunity to deal with it. 

Getting home from work is the hardest, between the hours of 6pm to 8pm. I've been trying to make myself stay busy around the house during that timeframe. Do laundry, help with meals, cleaning, etc. I keep one of those insulated aluminum thermoses full of ice water and that seems to help satiate the desire to drink. I have also been keeping a journal on my phone and laptop. Crazy, absolutely crazy how much that helps. 

Well, I guess that is enough for now. Just glad to read through the motivation & experiences here, and thought I had to contribute. Both for myself an for others.",37

Vodka. Always. 

I’m strangely okay though. No withdrawals, no real cravings, I told myself I’d do Dry January for the sole basis of losing some weight and by the end of daily December drinking I was waking up at 5am thinking “why do i do this every night just to have the same results of a shit sleep and a pit in my stomach.” So between reading This Naked Mind and being fed up with my own shit, here I am. 

I’m at the gym every day, counting calories, intermittent fasting, not drinking, and I’m starting to see my face depuff and look like a somewhat healthy and happy human.  I’m 1/3 of the way through January and I can’t see myself caving for a drink, it would ruin the competition with myself to get to 30. Oh and if you need some help staying sober, get yourself a lap cat. Mine won’t let me get up the second I sit down for the night. 

What a strange existence this all is. The whole human experience.

2020-01-11 14:42:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/enc42w/my_thoughts_on_101_days_without_drinking/,My thoughts on 101 days without drinking,"I'm 25 years old and I've been drinking regularly since I was about 15. Things got really bad last year, I had a bit of a rubbish breakup and started drinking more and more each day. I would wake up at 4pm and immediately go to the fridge and crack open a beer. I was so used to the comfortable, numb feeling that booze gave me, and of course, once I'd had my first drink of the day I just wouldn't stop, and by 4am I'd be absolutely pished.

One day my flatmate found me in the living room drinking from a bottle of vodka and crying at 8 in the morning. I had been there all night, alone, drinking by myself. He was understandbly upset and made me go to bed. I could tell that he was losing patience with me.

I had tried stopping several times before, and it never worked. I'd always relapse after a week or two. I couldn't see the point in trying again, but my therapist said I should keep a diary of every drink I had so I could at least see how much I was taking in. Within a few weeks of keeping this diary, I realised that I was destroying myself.  I decided to try stopping drinking once more.

I will tell you honestly what it's been like. The first 15 days of abstinence were hell. I couldn't think of anything but going to the pub, and life seemed so boring and headache-inducing. I kept telling myself just to try for another day, and so I kept going. But I had several close calls, and so I would never think badly of anyone who relapsed at this point. I was lucky to have encouraging friends who told me to hang in there, and who would meet up for coffees and lunch rather than (yet another) depressing alcoholics' party.

After the first month I was feeling much more confident. I visited my therapist and he encouraged me to keep going, and to not be too hard on myself if I relapsed. For a while things seemed perfect, I woke up in the morning without a headache and I stopped feeling ill all the time. I started to build a normal routine, going to work earlier, eating better, caring about myself. I enjoyed seeing friends because I was seeing friends, not because I wanted to get drunk and was using them as an excuse to drink at lunchtime.

On day 101, I'm feeling a strange mix of feelings. On one hand, I'm really proud of myself for having stopped drinking for so long. I know that if I'd kept going I'd be pushing myself toward an early grave, and it was starting to feel like I wasn't really living life at all, just existing and trying to numb myself enough to not really take in reality. But now I feel like I'm actually living again. It's not perfect though. 

I really miss my old social life, I miss the feeling of being around friends and being in warm pubs and talking for hours. I really think not drinking has hurt my social life, but I've decided that this is an opportunity. I'm getting involved in my community, playing music and volunteering. The temptation to drink is always there, especially when I'm feeling depressed, but something keeps me going. I don't want to be in that bad place again, drinking to excess to escape life. It was a form of self harm and I knew it.

I know I have to keep going even though sometimes it feels like there's not much to keep going for. But sometimes there are moments in my life that are truly beautiful and warm, and I'm glad I'm sober and can take it all in clearly. For anyone else who is struggling, I can tell you that things will get better slowly if you take a small step every day, although I would never have listened if someone told me that two years ago.

I highly recommend this documentary which really put my drinking into perspective, [Louis Theroux - Drinking to Oblivion](https://www.amazon.com/Louis-Theroux-Drinking-to-Oblivion/dp/B07BN3SDLB)

Help,"Been sober for 2 weeks and it's going well. It's Saturday here and nearly 7pm. I've had a very productive day doing household chores and cooked myself a nice dinner. I am now going to relax and watch a movie this evening and I keep thinking about buying a 0.5 litre bottle of vodka to help relax me. My justification is that I've done lots of productive work today and if I drink 0.5 litres I will have totally recovered before I start work on Monday. I have had this thought for about an hour and a half now so it doesn't seem to be a passing craving. My goal is to be completely clean and healthy. I have even been running a few times this week which made me feel good. Any tips at all?

Edit: Thank you for all the posts. I can't reply to them all but I am genuinely grateful.  I do feel less of an urge to do it now but it still hasn't completely gone. I live just 5 minutes away from a shop so it just takes a few minutes of weakness to have a bottle in my hand unfortunately! I know I will feel great and fresh if I don't drink and I will be able to go for a run tomorrow morning so that is my current motivation.

Update Sunday Morning: I resisted the urge to buy alcohol. Got up early this morning and went for a 5km run. I need to remember how great I feel after a run to stop me drinking in future.",5

I have been having that feeling alot the last 2 - 3 days. I check my pockets. My phone is there, my keys, my wallet and my snus. What am i forgetting?! 
I dont know. But cant be important because if it was i would remember it some time of the day. 

Yesterday i did some test to see how much i know about driving. I got 61/65, 63/65 and 59/65. I have to get 60/65 3 times before i can take the real test. And on the real test i only have to get 52/65. Soooo im on my way to a life where i can drive cars again. One, maby two more months then im done! 
When i got 61 and 63 i really wanted a beer to celebrate, and when i got 59 i really wanted a beer because i fellt sorry for my self. BUT i skipped the beer and hugged my wife instead. It felt so good. 

Today has been an... good, bad day.... i dont know. I took the bus to the store to get some food for the week. It was soo much people at the store that i missed my bus home with just 2 - 3 min. I was speaking with my wife all the time on the phone and told her the bus hade allready left the station. So we said goodbye and i started to watch YT in the cold. When i came home she was very cold aginst me. Quiet. And didnt respond when i was talking to her. 
The reson was she was thinking i am cheating with someone. I looked at her and got really sad. When i came home i hade my backpack and a big bag in each hand full of food. I almost didt manage to take everything from the bus. And she was finking i hade the power to carry all the food to a person, cheat, and walk back to the bus stop. I was devestaited after she told me. 

I know she will not trust me for a long time. I lied to her about the drinking, so she thinks i can cheat on her to. But i would never cheat on her. I love her, and i want to live with her for the rest of my life. But if she is going to say i do stuffs even if i dont do them. Then i dont know if she will ever trust me again. 

But the good thing was that i went to the beer shelf in the store and i looked at the beer i used to buy and said to my self ""your stupid MFer, why the hell did i try you when i was young!!"" And then i went from that shelf and got a monster energydrink. 

Now i am sitting at the local pizza place, and the pizzaguy said: food for you but no beer!! 
He remembers that i dont drink anymore. And it feels good. 

Sorry for the rant, but it feels good to write it out. 
20 days without beer is 20 days with more love and happynes.

Basically 8 wks sober here. Had a small slip one month in but didn’t let it ruin my progress.

My husband has grown distant, sarcastic, and overall cold. We started couples counseling around the time I stopped drinking. On Thursday night with our counselor he finally admitted:
-He misses me drinking because I could be really fun.
-He doesn’t think I have a problem bc I’m high functioning (I didn’t used to be mind you).
-If I have enough control to stop for the last 8 wks I’ve demonstrated I do indeed have self control and so I should be able to learn to just have 2 or 3 drinks and stop. 
-He won’t ever stop around me or stop bringing it in the house (it’s his life. Sucks for me but he’s gonna do what he wants ya know?)

It’s crazy to me he doesn’t believe me that I have a problem. Usually it’s the opposite where your loved ones are trying to convince YOU that you have a problem. This is the exact opposite. He didn’t know me when I was a daily drinker for 10 years. In those first 5 yrs I got 2 DUIs, crashed my car 3 times while drinking and driving, got kicked out of college, went to rehab, went to jail twice, did house arrest, and lived in absolute squalor. Like no power, rotting food, liquor bottles, and cat shit all over my house. 
Rehab changed me and got me sober for 8 months and I did start drinking daily again but I kind of got my shit together. 
He met me 3 yrs ago and by then I was binge drinking 4 nights a week, no more daily drinking but it was still problematic. Sore tender liver, often acting like an ass hole to the people I love, including him, and I black out EVERY time I drink. But what he sees is that I have an amazing career and got a graduate degree and keep a very clean house. From the outside looking in I seem ok. So to him I seem ok. 

The thing is, I love him. He’s my best friend... I’m not sure what I need to do to convince him that I have a drinking problem. But the problem is my biggest support person is offering zero support. Instead he’s sending me articles about how to drink in moderation and arguing with me about it. And my very broken alcoholic mind is just waiting to manipulate this. I’m barely hanging on here. Yesterday I wanted to drink so badly but I couldn’t tell him this bc I know he would have practically put the glass of wine in my hand...

Sorry for the long post. I’m just frustrated. I need support. I don’t do AA; it’s not for me. I have a few friends who are supportive and my therapist but the person I love the most in this world and I share a life with doesn’t want me sober... it’s hard.",37

I, of course, am known to be a big drinker but I always just fit right in with them. They don’t know about the internal struggle and the nightly drinking at home. They were all drinking already when we arrived at 3 pm yesterday. I was offered a glass of wine immediately and declined. Finally at 9 pm someone just poured me a glass of wine. I was just in the midst of getting our toddlers (3,3,2) to bed. Against my better judgement, I took a sip. It tasted disgusting. And I love wine. Loved? I don’t know... This book really retrains your unconscious mind so maybe it’s really working. 

My kids fell asleep around 930 pm and normally I would have went back out and got wasted. Instead, I decided to go to sleep as well. I had a great sleep and woke up this morning rested and ready for the day of playing and swimming instead of hungover with anxiety and regret.

Edited to add: I have said “Day 1” soooo many times. The longest I made it before this was 4 days so 6 days is already huge for me. I was also being questioned about why I wasn’t drinking and I just keep saying my hangovers are so bad these days that it’s not worth it for me to drink.",7

I read a paper once that said the timing is not that unusual as journey home is usually 'routine' and combined with booze it is a common time to lose memories.

But couple times recently I got my memory back while a few meters walking from my front door. Literally I would be like 'how the hell did I get here?' and remember everything else after until I fall asleep. Only memory gap is part of that journey home. Literally remembering 'waking' from a blackout like a light switch while still walking. This is after only 6 pints of beer, albeit on almost empty stomach, but I was maybe slurring but still had coordination. And marijuana, which I heard is also bad for memory. I even was able to afterwards roll a joint and smoke it before I slept.

Anyone ever had such blackouts? I'm worried I'm losing my mind and on the way to Korsakoff syndrome.

Although in the past I've not regained normal memory function until I woke up the next day. Maybe what I'm describing is normal and I only remember this event because when I got home I did not immediately fall into bed.

&#x200B;

PS I'm not asking for medical advice, just wondering if anyone had these types of blackouts before. I'll decide soon whether to bring it up with my doctor. Probably he will just say stop drinking, which is my current plan anyway. I'm fine when not drinking.",8

I don't spend Saturdays between my couch and the toilet, trying desperately to keep water inside me. I don't replay every possible thing I may or may not have said, racked with anxiety.

Instead, I get up early and do a short yoga practice. I eat yogurt, I take my time drinking my coffee. I watch my cat as he cautiously navigates the snow on the back deck. I feel a deep sense of peace that comes from no longer living in a state of cognitive dissonance - of wanting to drink and desperately wanting to stop. Instead, I have a sense of pride from living in a way that is consistent with what my body and spirit had been trying to tell me all along. 

It's not always like this, of course. There are still moments of feeling deeply deprived, but they are fleeting for the most part. I feel grateful and lucky in equal measures. Putting on the kettle for another cup. IWNDWYT.",8

But being sober IDGAF, I am contented and I realised that I don't think about whether or not I am single or have any dates to go on. I have other things to think about that are legitimately more interesting to me.

When drunk the emotions are so overwhelming that they seem like conviction, it must be the truth. But the difference when I'm sober tells me that alcohol exaggerates and distorts my emotions until I don't know what I really feel anymore.

On December 1st, I started reading This Naked Mind. I have drank frequently since I started, but in the few months prior - dealing with moving to a new country, not having work, and mental health - I'd started drinking every night, about a bottle of wine give or take. 

While AA has never felt like an option (personal preference and I grew up in a strict religious cult-like environment), I was tired of doing something that had become no longer enjoyable. I was drinking just to avoid my anxiety and loneliness. 

In December, I drank 6x. This was a significant decrease of course. I have seen my anxiety decrease tremendously as well. I also got a job finally after months of trying. 

This brings me to tonight. I am just over 2 weeks no drinking. It's been ok, no huge cravings and I've settled into a new routine with lots of reading and sweets. My partner (also sober, about 12yrs) and I are going out tonight for his work mate's birthday. 

Going to a pub isn't really what makes me nervous, it's more navigating meeting a room full of new people who I really want to like me who will also all be drinking.

I am a very social person usually, but between a new country/new people, and now this new version of me who doesn't drink - I'm nervous to say the least.

I was a member of this sub many years ago, but I quit and went back to drinking because life was so shit at the time I figured it wouldn't make a difference. 

Beer has always been my poison of choice, but last summer I switched to liquor and I went at it hard. It lead to me experiencing delirium tremens which is the most frightening experience I've ever had. I switched back to beer but something in me had changed, it made me realize that I cant continue to poison my body in this way. So as I sat there alone on Christmas eve I decided that 2020 is the year of soberness.

In 2015 I had 9 months without drinking, I can do it again. I got weight to lose, I got money to save, I got everything to win by not drinking. Alcohol is trying to kill me, so it can go to hell.

I have a network of people who can help me find a job where I am paid much more in respect), I have a grip on why I attempted suicide a decade ago, and I had the best day of my life several weeks ago. 

I am not one for magical thinking yet I asked a God... if one exists... if this God fellow could make me a better person and take away all of my pain. It worked. Did it ever work. I realize now that job was killing me and I was a worse person for it. A lot of other items also lined up a bit too perfectly. Of course, humans are often good at pattern recognition yet one never knows. I am merely keeping an open mind as a former atheist and former Ph.D student in psychology (left with the master's to go into the corporate world -- Office Space is too real. Lol). Part of me wants to go back and finish that degree... maybe later I will take that challenge. 

I also determined what I will do for my business I am starting on the side. I have done this once before when I was younger.

I am so thankful for this sub that allows me a chance for peace and sharing. I am coming out of a great darkness to go the rest of my life in peace.

This has meant avoiding temptation as much as possible.

Last night my wife and I were at a german restaurant and I was craving a beer like you wouldn't believe. She could tell, and recommended that I try a NA beer like Clausthaler. I had never even considered it in the past...

I ordered one. The first few sips I was so happy, I had really missed the taste of beer in the last 11 months. But the funny part was, I struggled to finish it. I just wasn't as into it as I had thought. 

It was actually really freeing. It was another reminder that with vigilance and dedication, that part of my brain is slowly being rewired. I left as happy as a clam, and stone sober. IWNDWYT",15

Just sharing some thoughts although it's common knowledge around here.

No matter how honourable, healthy and kind I can be in a normal state, drinking turns me into a mean person. What's really annoying is that I spend so much time trying to rebuild trust around me especially with my family, but a single slip puts everything back to square one.

I was having a nice streak of several days / weeks, but I drank a bottle of port wine last night. I didn't do anything horrible except saying mean and stupid things to my girlfriend. She's extremely upset of course, and it's understandable. But at the same time, I feel like it's unfair somehow (probably the booze talking here finding excuses). I have been extremely cautious the past weeks and even refused going out with friends because I knew it was going to turn into a binge night. I was waking up early, studying, working out, meditating. And I will keep doing it. But it's true that I slipped last night : but even if I'm going to reset my badge, that doesn't mean that I'm back to square one in my opinion. I believe it was expected and you can't have it all under control from the beginning. I'll keep pushing. I'll keep being healthy and fighting those cravings. I do not want to drink, but yesterday it got me. It's ok, it will happen less and less. 

I feel ashamed of course but at the same time I know that it won't turn into a bender. It's a one off. So let's keep going.

What prompted the search was coming across the quote you hear in various sobriety circles. “First you take a drink, then the drink takes a drink, then the drink takes you.” 

I had known about Fitzgerald and the Great Gatsby many years before I heard it mentioned on this sub and AA meetings. I also knew that Fitzgerald drank heavily as did/do many other great writers. Aside from this trivial knowledge, I knew very little about him.

Thus, I landed on his Wikipedia page and began reading about his life. When he was in the depths of his alcoholism, another writer interviewed him and wrote an article that wasn’t very kind. It’s reported that he became suicidal after reading the article, published in 1936. Fitzgerald was dead 4 years later, in 1940.

As part of my recovery, I attend AA meetings. At the meeting tonight, the speaker talked about the history of AA. The first AA book was published in 1939. I began thinking, what if Fitzgerald lived in an era as we do, with so many resources to get help (AA, SMART recovery, Life Ring, this sub, etc.) How many more great novels could he have written?

Moreover, the attitudes have shifted a lot since his time. Alcoholics receive “treatment.” Many companies offer assistance programs to their employees. This is a damn sight better than how they were treating folks in the 1930s.

All of this assumes of course that Fitzgerald would have wanted to stop. Nonetheless, we occupy a good time to be sober. Whether it be by AA, a different program, or just this sub. There’s some great resources available to us friends.",16

My own staircase to my room wears me out these days and I am so over it 😩 I just don’t want to push too far... but I also don’t want to go too easy on myself either! The thought of passing out at the gym or any of the other scary/embarrassing scenarios I’ve thought of terrify and intimidate me... I wanted to keep this short-ish and not too blabby so sorry for the vagueness/possible incoherence. Guess though that I should at least mention that I was a 5x/wk weight lifter, 3x/wk yoga attendee and often did HIIT sprinting for cardio. I feel foolish for even writing this out with my history and experience in fitness that I already have, but it’s my first time having to heal from something like alcoholism... maybe I just wanted to talk or be inspired. I’ve also never attended an AA or NA meeting outside of rehab so I guess I’m just looking for someone to relate to, too!

I've been sober since December 30th . I've gotten through New Years, watching football at a bar, hanging out with my party friends and even a wine tasting (I just looked and drank ginger ale) all sober. I've posted a bit before about some negative reactions from my friends, all of which I have a history of drinking heavily with, but today I had a really positive story to share.

My friend was having a going away dinner/drinking night out at a local bar. He knows I'm trying not to drink, yet when I told him I've never had a pina colada he kept trying to push it into my face, saying ""just a taste, c'mon, just a taste."" My other friend was also there, and he has seen A LOT of my worst drinking days, and he intervened. 

He put his hand in between me and the pina colada shoved in my face and said, ""hey man, leave her alone. Respect she's trying to stay sober. It's a slippery slope for some people.""

My other friend apologized and we went on our night. It wasn't brought up again, and I felt like my friend's comment helped me establish some space around my decision. It solidified to the group that my sobriety is something to take seriously and I really appreciate my friend sticking up for me. 

I've tried to downplay my sobriety a bit with friends because I really don't want to have a lot of attention on me. I'm still too ashamed to come out and say I'm not drinking because I can't control myself and always drive it way too hard to the hoop. That I'm an alcoholic. Would rather just change the subject and move on.

It was nice to have someone else speak up.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Sometimes until 8... maybe midnight... 3am.... fuck it, I can rally... I’ll just work from home so no one can smell me. 

The other half oddly doesn’t approve of me quitting... “why can’t you just stop at two or three?!?! “.  I’ve turned down almost 10 happy hours in only one week back at work. I went to one but didn’t drink. 

The excuse is “sober January” but I’m running out of time to figure out my go to line. 

I don’t want people to think I’m judging them for drinking and I don’t want them to feel sorry for me. 

I quit because I’m tired. I’m depressed. I’m 100lbs overweight, with a fatty liver, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. 

I quit because I want a hobby again. I want to be happy again.

I decided to stop drinking for a while to help me reach my weight loss goal and to see if I could finally get off of blood pressure medicine completely. I haven’t accomplished the latter two, yet. But, I don’t think I realized what other profound affect my decision to stop drinking would have on my life. I’ve been ashamed and embarrassed to tell some people about my sobriety. As bazaar as that may sound to some it has been a very real dilemma for me.  I never wanted to be an alcoholic or admit that I had a drinking problem. I didn’t drink secretively. I never got a DUI though I should have. I wasn’t in and out of jail or any of the number of other things people associate with someone that is addicted to alcohol. I had a lot of fun drinking and a lot of other people had fun drinking with me at times. Over the years though, I found myself making excuses to drink until eventually, I was drinking everyday. Being sober, I have realized the impact that alcohol had on my life and many of the relationships I had with others. While I used to drink because I thought it helped me be less anxious, I’ve found that I have far less anxiety sober. I used to say having something to drink before bed would help me sleep yet now I find my sleep to be far more restful. The one thing alcohol was good for was forgetting. I could forget all the things that made me feel horrible inside. I could forget how others hurt me and how my bad decisions had lead me to hurt myself. Unfortunately though, I never learned how to cope and deal with these things in a real way. Even though I still can’t make sense of many things in my life, people, and experiences I’m doing my best to figure things out in a healthy way. And, I know there will be friends and family who think I should keep this to myself. They are entitled to their opinion. But after giving this a lot of thought I’ve decided to share this in hopes that I might be able to help someone else. I’ve lost so many friends to drugs and alcohol. Some because they passed too soon; others because of my own actions that lead to them no longer wanting to be in my life or me not wanting them in mine. If I can prevent ANYONE from putting themself through that it’s worth any amount of judgement someone puts on me. So, with that, I’m going to enjoy knowing that today I accomplished something that a year ago seemed impossible!",67

I can still remember lurking on this thread, whilst desperate to draw a line under my drinking and the feeling of envy that others could do it and not me. I remember reading more “if I can do it, you can too” posts than I could keep track of - but I was not convinced I could. When I finally managed to stop for a day, I would look in here and see how many folk were celebrating years and decades already, which scared me somewhat. Again, I felt like being sober for such a long time was too far out of reach. So I had a mentality switch, one that is familiar to everyone here: one day at a time. I stopped comparing myself to those that had more time under their belt. This was for me. And if not drinking for this one day makes me feel better tomorrow, I’m doing it.

Today I was feeling really down. Was listening to “our song” and suddenly started going through old letters, cards, promises ... it’s been 10 days since I’ve been sober. 

Usually I would have downed a bottle of wine, eaten till I couldn’t breathe and stuffed my feelings down and passed out. I would have woken up tomorrow without processing anything but feeling like I was okay. Until it hits me again. Blindsides me. 

Today I didn’t drink, I didn’t eat all the food I could find, I simply let myself feel. I cried. Cried some more. Wrote down how I felt. Wrote some more. Then put all the cards and letters and books he gave me in a box, and placed it at the back of a closet. 

The crying slowly died out. And I feel some sort of closure and relief. As I went through the letters and saw the downfall of our relationship I could see that I was so much happier now. 

I’m actually smiling as I type this. I can’t believe it took me sobriety to process this and give me closure, almost 9 months later.

I wrote the following, the day I quit - - I am a highly functioning person...sort of. Until 4pm rolls around. Then I am in my safe zone. Anything can happen during that time. But little gets done. I am pretty unproductive. Lots of fun, laughs, sometimes, tears, and angry outbursts. It is mostly smooth, happy sailing through the evening, until lights out. Then I’m out. 

Everything is amplified, but I am still numb. I don’t live in the moment. I live in a cloud watching others in my house live their moments. I have little to offer of any substance. Because I’m at peace. I’m selfish. I don’t want to deal with anything. I just want the heavy weight removed from my chest. To be calm. Evenness throughout my mind and body. I look forward to 4pm all day. I get anxious and heavy chested waiting for it. Needing it. I look at my husband and kids. They love me when I’m in my safe zone. I’m goofy, fun. Or do they?? 

I’m hiding. What am I hiding from? Can they see me? Or am I just as cloudy as they are? Have I become a willowy, whispering cloud floating through their lives? Some meaningless person, who sometimes sits for hours sifting through my phone or has bursts of energy and happiness, trying to envelope them in my often short lived excitement. What am I even excited about?? Feeling good? What do I feel good about in those moments as my mind numbs and my chests becomes free of that stupid elephant? Do I feel good because my kids want me to cuddle and watch tv with them or do I feel good because I’m finally numb. I’m not really there with them. I’m in my head, enjoying my nightly ride. I always wake up fine. Not sure how, but life goes on in that way. Another day looking forward to 4pm. 

Only this time is different. I’m looking forward to attempting to TRY to live life at 4pm. To get through the heaviness and anxiety. To figure out what I am hiding from. To deal with it and get through it. I can do this. I think. 

At the moment my head is pounding. It started two days ago. Today is not as bad. Has anyone experienced this? I didn’t have any kind of withdrawal, with the exception of a really decreased mood and fatigue. But sometimes it feels like my head is going to burst. Why now? Why days later? How long will this last?

I’m mostly good. First few days were rough, but now I feel good. There must be a catch. Drinking lots of water and trying to focus on and look forward to other things, like food, movies, time with my kids. I think I’m really done this time. Reading all your posts inspiring posts is really helping me. I got this. I think.",3

Nobody would ever even know. So I poured a glass, took a piece of cheese and went back to my desk. I ate the cheese. Then I stared  at the glass of wine for about five minutes. I took it back to the kitchen and poured it out, along with the rest of the two bottles. Fuck this. Tomorrow is day 11 and I’m going to be there.

Turns out that drinking culture is so much more ingrained than I  realized. I made arrangements to meet an old friend tomorrow who lives about an hour away and when we were talking about our outing she mentioned how we could do A first then stop for a cocktail before moving on to B, and then cocktails and dinner after. Well, maybe I should have just waited to deal with it while we were actually out, but instead I told her I'd quit drinking and it quickly became very awkward, with her trying to change the plans on the fly and me assuring her that I'm fine with my ""cocktail"" being sparkling water or coffee. By the time I hung up, I felt very out-of-sorts. 

Then, this afternoon, I went golfing with a new group that I'm a co-founder of -- our first outing. First, in the cart, my partner was talking about how nice it would be if we had a cooler full of beer, and I just didn't say anything. Then, afterward, everyone met in the clubhouse for a drink, one woman got a soda, I got a club soda and everyone else was drinking. People kept asking me if I was doing Dry January and I told them no, that I'd decided to quit for good for health reasons.  Reactions were definitely mixed, with one woman even making a joke of, ""yeah, I quit too, that's why I'm drinking Corona."" By the time I got home I literally felt emotionally exhausted not just from the struggle it is for me to turn down drinks, but because I kept having to explain and justify. 

Here's what I was wondering too: how much do these people drink? I know my friend drinks moderately because her husband keeps it all under control, if he didn't, I know she'd drink a lot more. And even though I've known her for years, she has no idea how much I drink and what a problem I have because I'm so good at hiding it. I know one of the women in the golf group is a moderate drinker because I've played with her before, she can have one and done. But I wonder how many more are like me, having one at the club, then going home and drinking a bottle or more because, like me,  once they start, they can't stop. I can't have even one, is the bottom line, but boy is it exhausting to try to stick to that!

Sorry for the long post, but I knew I'd feel better if I got it out of my system -- I just can't wait until I get to the point where I'm just the non-drinker and everyone knows it and it's no big deal. IWNDWYT. (Or with anyone else.)",9

About 2 weeks ago I sent an self referral to an outpatient addiction clinic with focus on mental illnesses and right now they're doing some kind of evaluation but I have no idea if and when I'm going to get an appointment. I can take a single day being this shitty but if they keep on coming with the same intensity as today it's only a matter of time before I relapse. Anyways, I've never really considered going to AA for real, tbh I'm quite skeptical, for one, I am not religious and find it hard that it seems to revolve around god/a higher power, secondly I have this prejudice about it being kind of like a cult, and it scares me a bit. But today I realized that I might have to give it a try, (I tried to read up on addiction and sobriety over all and it seems like the chances that you're going to be successful in your recovery are far lower if you don't have a support group/follow the 12-steps/have therapy or go to some kind of rehab?) Now to the actual point, I'm super freaking scared to attend my first AA meeting, I have quite a bit of social anxiety and the internalized stigmatization around alcoholism is pretty strong within me. I feel like I don't ""belong"" in AA for some reason and I really have no idea of what to expect (of course it depends on the local group etc) I'm sorry for the long and incoherent post, if you have any tips, encouragement or experience, please feel free to hit me up!

After many failed attempts, my rock bottom was running into an old friend. I hadn't seen her in a couple years. We ran into each other on the sidewalk. Her reaction and facial expression upon seeing me was what did it. She was shocked and couldn't hide it. I was clearly a miserable, bloated, dead-eyed and lifeless shell of my former self. That interaction was so embarrassing that I walked away knowing I had to change.

This subreddit was crucial for me during the first few months. I wasn't very vocal, I'm shy even online! But I mostly just needed to read. I read it every night before bed.

Reading about your current struggles made me feel less alone in my own.

Reading about your milestones made me want to keep going so I could be just like you.

As the months went on I returned to this sub every once in a while. It helped me stay strong in times of momentary weakness.

Slowly, painstakingly, determinedly, my life began to change for the better. Some changes came naturally from not having booze in my system. Some of the bigger ones required more action than that. But the clarity I got from sobriety gave me the strength to take action.

It's still not perfect, I still get quite anxious or low. But now I no longer need medication for that (and CBT helped a great deal).

I started to enjoy things again. Music, food, movies, and activities previously seemed grey and dull. They roared back into full colour.

I picked up my old hobbies and started new ones. I had to, since an idle mind and hand (boredom) was partially why I started drinking too much in the first place.

Then my work got better and my bosses and coworkers noticed. I got a promotion and a raise.

Then the one friend at work that I shared my struggles with became my best friend. Then my girlfriend. And is now my soon-to-be fiancé.

Now I actually plan for the future and have my finances on track. Instead of being in the red because of spending so much money on booze, I now have a decent amount saved up and being invested. One of those accounts is just for the ring for the aforementioned proposal.

I feel (and even look) like a different person in many ways. I cringe at all the mistakes, mean things and embarrassing texts I was sending just a little over a year ago. Who was that guy? But reflecting on those times, while painful, just solidifies that sobriety was the right decision.

To those just starting their journey, this is the best decision of your life. It's a bumpy road and it often feels more difficult than just giving in. But that fleeting bliss that those liquid handcuffs give you can't hold a candle to what sober life can feel like.

To everyone that's posted on this sub during any part of the journey, you're truly life savers. So thank you.

They were happy for me, I was proud of myself","Since graduating from college and starting my career last January, I've been stuck in a rut and abusing my body and mind in various ways, one of which is alcohol. I often came home after work, and since I was too tired to do anything productive, I would turn to alcohol and do unproductive stuff.

Here I am a year later, deeper into the rut, heavier, sadder, so on and so forth. I've read a lot about psychology, neuroscience, and self-improvement, and I've always had belief in my potential, so I know **what** to do and I know I **can** do it. I realized a few days ago that at least for right now, I've allowed alcohol to drag me down further into the rut, and therefore I've decided to take a break for an indefinite amount of time.

Last night I was at 4 days. Met friends at a bar - a place I've been to a lot, my boss's boss goes there, I know the bartenders, etc etc. I declined drinks 3 times and each time was met with basically ""oh okay, good for you"". No judgment, just mild admiration and support.

I'm proud of myself and happy to see that me not drinking doesn't take away from the fun of my friends drinking.

I'm going to get the bad news out of the way.  Cause of death from alcohol, per year, in the United States, has more than doubled from 1999 to 2017.  This is from a press release, published today, from the [National Institutes of Health] (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/alcohol-related-deaths-increasing-united-states).

This means that there were more than twice as many deaths from alcohol in 2017, than in 1999.  More alarming though, is that this represents only official cause of death listed on death certificate, and doesn't account for the proximate deaths caused by alcohol.  Deaths like car accidents, falls, and cancers caused by alcohol use are not classified as deaths from alcohol, though directly responsible.  

Furthermore, the increase in deaths is not an anomaly.  It's not like 1999 was a particularly low year, and 2017 saw an unusually high number of deaths.  There has been a consistent increase of deaths over time. 

There are many places to point fingers for the increase in deaths.  We can blame social media for the Mommy Wine Hour, which normalizes drinking on weekdays with small children in tow.  We can blame the Corporations for the seemingly infinite amount of funds available to advertise the product.  We can also blame our Local Governments for handing out liquor licenses to any establishment willing to dump cash into the municipal bureaucracy.

On January 1st of 2016 I had a divine revelation.  Being an alcoholic sucks, and, it is not cool.  Yeah, duh.  Sometimes the obvious needs to be said.  

Good news is that resistance is NOT futile.  Though we sobernauts are still a minority, we are gaining traction.  Since my nearly four years on r/stopdrinking, I've seen this sub nearly quadruple in members.  In the end, it is we who are responsible.  The decision is upon the individual to decide to go against the system.  It is upon you to decide to stop being a slave to alcohol.


And now for some more good news: I START ORIENTATION FOR A NEW JOB ON MONDAY!  I was supposed to go over to my Dad's tonight, but I think I'm going to cancel so that I can spend time with my daughter because this will be my last weekend that I'm not employed.   I'm thinking that we'll cook dinner, bake some cookies, then have family movie night.  That's the plan, we'll see what happens!

I always drank heavily at university - sometimes socially but more often alone.

I told myself I would cut down on my drinking once I left university. At the same time, I told myself my drinking was fine and just a youthful thing that I would get over once I got a job. In fact I found myself drinking more than ever over the past year. While I wouldn't have bothered to work out how much I was drinking until the past week, I estimate I was consuming maybe 70 units some weeks; I was drinking most days.

I started Dry January as a way to 'prove' to myself that I drink only to unwind and as a choice. In fact the past 10 days have only proven that I am dependent on alcohol. For the past week I have been trying to convince myself to have a drink. I stopped drinking in part to lose weight, so a couple of days ago I told myself ""skip lunch and have a few beers after work and you won't gain weight"".

I know 10 days isn't a lot. I nearly went out this evening to buy some alcohol. That's why I have joined this subreddit and I hope that reading other posters' stories will encourage to me lay off the drink for the rest of the month and hopefully beyond that. 

Did anyone else find the second week harder than the first?",35

I no longer even need to unbutton my jeans to remove them! 

More importantly, I've put together my new daybed and organized my home office, installed a wireless card in my own computer, sold furniture I no longer needed, and rejoined church choir.

I blacked out the first night and passed out. Luckily my husband doesn’t drink so he could watch our one year old. The second day I drank through being hung over, tired and grouchy. The final day we were there was my actual birthday and I was just done. I reluctantly accepted a beer for my birthday dinner that night because, well, it was my birthday dinner (which makes no fucking sense) and sat there in disbelief. I wasn’t having fun. I was wasting precious time with my family. I was exhausted and felt like shit.

I'm really needing to focus so much more on my sobriety because I felt it slipping last week and I'm like I need to get back on track. This relapse really messed with me. It's kind of like well if I can drink to feel better about my sister's death oh, that's like a special type of excuse.

My biggest motivation for quitting drinking is mental and physical wellness including decreasing my anxiety and depression and stress levels, and physical health. Sure enough, after I relapsed I got really physically sick, my immune system was down, and with me I don't just get a little bit sick, I'm out for weeks.

Not linked to a relapse, I'm on the second week of a really bad illness. At the point of possibly seeing a doctor on Monday if it doesn't get better. So today I feel like shit. My sinuses are plugged, I'm coughing, all of my body hurts, Etc.

Update: I had a miserable night.  I went through three cycles of sleep, sweat, get up, change, sleep, sweat and so forth...

The last few months have been especially bad with me being on the verge of suicide many times. I have sobered up before but it’s different this time. I have hobbies, creative outlets and the rest of it now and I have made serious lifestyle changes. It’s different this time around I’m sure.

We are planning to go out for one of the drinker's birthdays this weekend and she confronted me about why I act like I do not want to go out with these people any more. 

I finally explained to her the pull that alcohol seems to have on me, the pressure I feel being around these people and in settings like bars. While I explained my difficulties in the best manner that I could, I just do not think she can ever fully understand. 

Has anyone had such a talk with their significant other?

I’ve set expectations that I’m not drinking and will be enjoying the festivities, while still catering to those that are enjoying their drinks.

Next week will be training with tastings, ending in a 2 day long meeting where there will be tastings Thursday night, followed by a day long meeting on Friday talking all day about alcohol.

I am sure others have been here, what I am wondering is if the sobriety on its own was enough to correct high BP.  I am of the mindset that once I go on meds to manage it, i will be on them forever.   Of course with sobriety will come better food choices, I already see that in the 5 days I have enjoyed so far.

2020-01-10 09:17:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/emri2m/day_2_my_best_friend_and_i/,Day 2 - my best friend and I.,"For a slight bit on context, we are both men in our 30's, best friends since 12-13 years old, so about 20 years of solid friendship behind us, we talk almost every day, we have just decided we are brothers who didn't meet until we were kids.  


 Well, growing up we didn't get into drinking until we were both over 21 and once we did... whew... We drank every single day. Naturally we had an apartment together and worked at the same restaurant, our house was the party spot, after shift 6-10 people would come over, bring booze etc and we'd have a party nearly every day. That lasted for years, we both drank every single day for several years.  Later into our 20's I lost my father to cancer and it affected us both quite a bit, it gave us a cause to quit drinking and we both did, cold turkey for about 2 years. We decided we had conquered the habit and could do it in moderation, which we did, once or twice a week we'd go out for beers or cook out and have a few. We had ground rules, we said NO liquor, NO MORE than 6 each and NO drinking alone.  


It felt like such a fast slippery slope, before too long we were breaking almost all of the rules, drinking all the time, experiencing craft beers, trying new breweries on our own, we both quickly went back to drinking every day. That started about 4 years ago and we've both been drinking everyday ever since. We both pep talk one another up into quitting for good, we hype it up all day, sending reaffirming texts back and forth and we feel like we can do it until around 4pm when the quitting bell at work approaches, we always find excuses to drink and the other follows suite. In November, we managed to quit for 31 days until Thanksgiving when we convinced ourselves through the festivities that we earned a few beers and that led to us again not stopping and drinking nearly every day. We did not drink yesterday and we are on day 2. I have told him about this Subreddit but he doesn't use social media much and isn't willing to learn Reddit but he gave me permission to update on here. I think this is a place where I will continue to find inspiration to stay sober, so I thank you all for that. He and I have adopted your ""IWNDWYT"" and will use it going forward.",4
2020-01-10 09:15:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/emrgzy/6_weeks_sober/,6 weeks sober!,"I gave up in a big way this past fall. Right after my birthday I became super self-absorbed and hyper focused on my loneliness in a very cyclical and unhealthy way. You know those types of thoughts which make you think that no one could ever comprehend your pain and despair? It's absolute bullshit though, as even at my worst points in life I still have so much opportunity and chances for redemption. Instead it becomes this self fulfilling prophecy where I would keep myself in a bad place because, maybe, I just wasn't strong enough to snap out of it. The worst part was that I had managed to be alcohol free for almost 10 years before this change occurred. The disappointment in myself was really strong. 

Another part of the problem was that I had gotten sober prior to this time, but had only done so with the hope that an ex of mine would see my changes and give us another shot. That wasn't very realistic of me, and making positive changes just for others to notice is a great way to fall short when they don't respond as you hope. And this really fed that self loathing cycle. If I can't have this life that I want, it must all be worthless, so I'll just give up. I was blinding myself to two things. 1) that life may not be an option, but there are an infinite number of options which do exist. 2) there is no life without suffering to some degree. But that suffering will make us stronger, and there are lessons to be learned if you have an open mind about it!

Well I'm officially 6 weeks sober at this point. I am at the point where the thought of actually stopping in the liquor store depresses me, and even the smell of alcohol is off putting. I don't worry about failing at this now, as I feel a resolve and strength within myself that only grows each day. I'm exercising again, eating right and focusing on what my next steps in life should be. I don't really have any IRL friends to share this with, so I'm sharing it with you Reddit. This community, and a couple others, have been great resources over the past couple months. Even just knowing I'm not alone. I made it almost ten years sober last time, I think I got this thing beat for good this time!",17

With a little support to keep me away from the Liquor stores, I am working on my first day 3 in months. It feels good, to choose when to go to bed instead of drinking until I am too tired to stay awake, or remember clearly the night before instead of only floating images that may or may not have been dreams. 

Today, I am TIRED. Is that normal? I got more and better sleep than I have in weeks, or at least I think I did, and yet, I feel like my head is going to hit my keyboard. And, staying focused is a bit harder today than the last two; my mind is wandering into odd places, and I find myself just staring for a couple minutes before I realize I have been thinking about why are teacups served on saucers and whether it’s more of a fashion issue or if it is to stop drips damaging furniture like a coaster?

I turn 50 this year and with the new decade (I know not technically) it feels like I'm coming into a much different second half of my life.  Here's some thoughts:

- I've struggled for a longtime as a problem drinker.  I was never one to go on benders but alcohol consumed an enormous amount of my mind space.  After 30+ years I simply couldn't handle the anxiety within me.  I'm a successful software exec and I had virtually zero emotional outlets.  

- I have mentioned here and in the real world that's sober life didn't have the same highs nor the lows of the drinking life but instead fix you live life right down the middle. That can seem a little boring. As a friend of mine said, ""welcome to the real world!""   However, instead of boredom I'm finding that the stillness it's fertile ground her growth. I have more time and energy to get to know myself and to learn how to live this new life.

- No matter how confident I'm feeling I like to keep a healthy paranoia. I come back to this subreddit time and again and it just gives me a certain sense of comfort. There are people with 12 hours of sobriety and there are people with 12 years of sobriety but the struggle it's still the same and that's very powerful to me.

Thanks to all of you and take care today!",242

A resounding ABSOLUTELY!

People said I was lucky to be able to take six months off from life to fulfil the dreams of a once useless drunk. I never doubted that I was lucky but I also lived like a hermit for nearly a year to make it happen. I stayed in and saved every penny. I sold my car so I didn't have to pay for the tax and insurance. I bought NOTHING other than bare essentials. I felt indebted to myself for all the years of slumping against a bar dreaming of seeing the things I'd always longed to see. Sobriety gave me the freedom to do so and to waste that freedom would have been an affront to myself. If it was not for sobriety I WOULD NOT HAVE TRAVELLED THE WORLD. It's as clear as that. Sobriety gave me the tools to save money. The self-belief to pursue the goal and the strength to see it through. I owe it all to stopping drinking.

Thanks to sticking to the simple path of choosing life over drinking I have fulfilled my lifelong ambition of visiting some of the wonders of the world, experienced beautiful people and cultures, I have found a level of self-belief that I didn't think I had. It has been an incredible six months that has far exceeded my expectations.

It is taking a bit to sink in. That the man who thought nothing of himself could climb off the barstool and turn those drunken dreams into a reality. But it is the same person just with the alcohol removed and a bit of work done on myself.

Fuck, it was scary at the start. Sobriety seems like a long road of nothingness. A bland future that will end in a withering death caused by boredom. How wrong was I? It has been an incredible, difficult, scary journey but much like climbing a mountain the rewards come much later. Of course, there were times where I thought this is a waste of time. But deep down I didn't want to be like the people I drank with. I didn't want to be the men who frequented the pubs and normalised my drinking. Who told me tales of all the things they ""nearly"" did and all the things they were ""gonna"" do. They would tell tales of lives they never lived as their dreams would remain on a shelf. Some had genuine reasons for not pursuing what they wanted. Many, like myself, hid behind a glass and used the illusionary fun of heavy drinking as the preferred life activity. Cowards.

If I hadn't seen such riches, I could live with being poor.

I could never have imagined in those early days that behind the drunken veil was a life of vibrancy and opportunity. It wasn't a million miles away. I collected myself on the way and made my way into a future that had been written off as fantasy. And, now, due to seeing the simple wonders life has to offer I cannot go back to the dark days of drinking. The fullness of life offers too much that the positives of drinking are FAR outweighed by the negatives; hangovers, regret, remorse, weight gain, financial impact, health impact. For what? A few hours of escapism and illusionary fun? Standing in a bar repeating the same tired conversations? Fuck that! I've seen life. I've seen what it has to offer and that isn't it. Give me peace any day. Give me serenity. Give me good health and good finances. Give me not having to avoid people because I might have offended them or I have built up a world of lies. That's where I end up. I know. I tried.

Initially, I was upset that I couldn't drink. I thought I was missing out. Then I created a mindset and life that I wouldn't want to trade for all the alcohol in the world. Slowly, a goal at a time I managed to get some self-respect. That alone is worth more than a night of drinking. The ending of the never-ending torrent of torment that used to barrel frantically around my head with barbed words intent on cutting my self-respect down is a gift I can never trade.

I am not perfect and sometimes get impatient. I sometimes lose my temper and say things I regret but these occurrences are not on a nightly basis like they once were. Those fleeting moments are a reminder of the damage that can be done if I lose too much control of myself. How I can slide back to the start so easily. There is a fragile beauty to sobriety. It gives so much strength but it can so easily be broken. I guess that is why I see it as something to be protected. I need sobriety for my strength but I need to protect it. And by protecting it I am rewarded with the ability to turn the dreams of the drunk me into my sober reality.

It happens on Friday mornings. I think I’m so excited that it’s finally the weekend! My fiancé still wasn’t home. He goes out with coworkers on Fridays and sometimes Thursdays. I texted him to check in and see if he was okay and he responded right away. 

Two hours later, I was getting ready for work and he finally opened the door. He walked in and said that he left his phone in the Uber he took home. No problem. He can log in to his account and we can report it lost. 

I was getting my lunch together for the day when I heard banging and cursing in my bedroom. This is at 4:15 a.m. The keys of his keyboard were all over the place. He had been banging on the keyboard in frustration. 

Then I took over. We tried to sign in to his Uber account. He couldn’t remember his password. We looked up what he needed to do if he can’t log in to his account. He needs to know the exact address of his pick up location. He didn’t know it, and the emailed receipt from Uber only includes a vague map of the trip. 

After about ten minutes of trying to log in or find the bar where he went I gave up. I left the directions for how to get his phone back on the nightstand and told him to go to sleep. 

He has been there for me countless times. I was a mean, angry drunk. He is sloppy but never mean to anyone. He is kind and supportive and it makes me really sad that he’s putting himself through this. We have been together for years. The only time we haven’t been drinking buddies has been during a few sober Septembers and, of course, the last two hundred something days.

He is so supportive of me being sober. He has said he knows he can’t moderate. He has also said he can’t see himself quitting. Drinking is a 
huge part of his social life.  I quit because drinking was ruining my social life. 

I’m writing this to process. I know that he is an independent person who needs to make his own decisions. I’m extremely happy in my relationship. I’m just sad for him.",26

I was not certain at the time if that was what was happening yet now I know. This company has had one of the worst management incompetence I have ever seen, yet I loved the people I worked with.

I am thinking of hitting up AA. I barely slept 4 hrs and I am struggling to get back to sleep.

I worked hard to have connections so I will find something before too long, but this does not change how much this hurts.

The good part is I think the job was killing me. I gave so much to them and they kicked me out the same day they told me. Wow. No wonder people bad mouth this place. 

They did not want me coming in tomorrow because someone the bosses like more is having a going away party. However I have learned that only a couple of higher ups knew I was being let go, so maybe I am reading into it too much. But I am speculating now so I need to stop. 

I will land on my feet quickly yet wow. I realize how little all I did for them matters to them.

I’ve established a new life routine that doesn’t involve using (Ie I fall asleep naturally, I eat based on my actual hunger cues, I don’t think about using, etc). 

Now comes the hard part...tackling my emotional sobriety. I originally thought that I needed to work on the external stuff (getting better friends, cooking healthier food, working out more etc). Don’t get me wrong, those things needed to be done. But now I’m realizing that I have a lot of internal stuff to work on - mostly my anger and tendency to compare myself to others. It’s soooo hard, way harder than letting go of the drugs and alcohol. It’s really hard to feel feelings. It’s difficult to feel intense anger and let it pass naturally. I get so resentful and obsess over certain statements made to me that I perceive to be rude or offensive. Does anyone else struggle with this? Thanks for reading.",6

I started drinking heavily in college and really kicked it up when I turned 21. I’ve gone through heavy and light times since then, and when I party with others often get debilitating hangovers.

This New Years Eve I drank all kinds of things I had no business drinking at my boyfriends party and ended up vomiting for 12 hours straight into the next day. I felt absolutely horrible physically and couldn’t even enjoy my evening. I decided I’m too old and have too much going for me to behave like that. Why am I even doing it? I usually have at least one or two drinks a day to wind down from work. 

So I’m doing Dry January and it feels great to not be dependent on alcohol. I don’t know if I’ll keep up once the month is over, but I’m scared to let alcohol take back over my life and I’m scared to not let it.

Also taking a vacation with my family soon and my dad drinks every night. I’m just not sure where to go from here.",4

I cleaned my house, went to yoga, and made dinner to distract my mind, but it doesn’t take away from the desire for human interaction. I want nothing more than to go next door to the local bar and listen to live music or go down the street to karaoke. There’s a feeling of existing in society but being invisible. I’m not craving alcohol more than I’m craving a meaningful relationship and would love to get out there and meet people. But when it’s after 8pm and the anxiety creeps in, where does someone go that does not include a bar? There’s this societal pressure to drink as evidenced by the constant in your face alcohol culture. You see it everywhere (I’m in the U.S.) Phrases can be found on shirts and towels and whatever else you can put words on. They will say things like “Mommy needs a glass of wine” or “It’s beer thirty”.  Reminding us that social interactions should include alcohol.

My kids don't deserve that. I'm not at my fullest, or even half of me when I am hungover, tired, and grumpy. I just feel silly, because I'm 25. That's what a LOT of people do my age. What my friends and I do when we hangout. I don't think I have hung out with 95% of my friends without drinking. 

I also feel weird thinking about NEVER having a drink again. Assuming I live a full life, that's a long time to go without even just one drink. My husbands whole family are social drinkers also. I don't consider myself an alcoholic, but isn't that what all alcoholics say? Some days I can control what I drink and how much. Others are just shots after shots. I never drink to the point I black out, but within the past 2 months I have twice. 

There are 2 reasons I want to quit drinking. 1. My kids. Like I said they don't deserve a mom that's hungover. 2. I recently got diagnosed Bipolar 2. I was taking an anti-depressant before but it wasn't working fully. I've always felt something was off and should've gotten help WAY sooner than I did but I didn't want to until I was in a really bad depressive episode. While I can always talk myself out of the suicidal thoughts, that day it was very hard too. If my kids weren't here, I probably wouldn't be. I was prescribed a mood stabilizer 2 1/2 months ago and I keep thinking ""Is this what normal feels like"". I still have my off days but I'm still getting used to the new medication. Since I started taking these meds I've noticed my hangovers are equipped with REALLY bad migraines. My psychiatrist told me to limit the drinking since alcohol would mess with both medications, making them not work the way they should.

The past year and a half I have lost ALMOST 50 pounds. I go to the gym 5-6 times a week. So at least I can use the gym to focus on instead of alcohol. This year my birthday is also 3 days shy of me hitting 90 days sober. (I started my counter on Sunday January 5th). I have 3 things planned I'm very excited about but it'll be the first year since I was 15 I won't drink. We're going to dinner, rollerskating, and then to a bar where they have an event every Wednesday I always love. We wouldn't get to the bar till about 9 or 9:30 which is prime drinking time for me. I think that's the only worry I have right now.

Laying this all out seems stupid to me. I was just hoping typing it out would help. I just mainly want to know if anyone's been in the same position in their 20's and stopped drinking.",2

Alcohol free nights and trying to string them together. Then one night I got a phone call from my mother. My brother had been in an accident. I moved my ass and said I would grab my fiance and he would take me to whatever hospital. Then she said the words. He's dead. I'm sorry satansprincessx he's dead. I fell down. I screamed. My fiance came running. I threw the phone at him. Mum told him. He took me to my parents. Longest night of my life. Every freaking relative from a 50k radius rocked up that night. When I got home I drank 500ml of vodka. Didn't sleep. Couldn't sleep. I was put on medication. Once meds ran out drank to sleep and forget seeing my brother in a fucking coffin looking like he was sleeping. Drinking will kill me. I won't lie, I want to fucking die. But I can't put that look on my parents face. And I can't do that to my fiance. We have been through enough. So I'm starting again. Day fucking 1. I'm sorry if this needs a trigger warning I don't know how to put it. I need to get my shit together for my fiance, for my parents and myself. I'm just hoping I have some strength left to do it because I can't do that to my fiance or my parents. I need to find my strength again. I have lurked here for about a year. You guys are amazing.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Tomorrow I will enter double digits and it’s been well over a year since I’ve had that high of a number.  But truth be told the thought of drinking hasn’t left my mind for the last couple of days.  I’ve been exercising each evening after work and getting lost in my thoughts.  I’ve caught myself negotiating with myself 
on what I am going to drink when I do break this streak, or fantasizing about how it’s going to taste with that warm rush of comfort and numbness.  I have an upcoming business trip and those usually involve open bars and heavy drinking with a bunch of coworker alcoholics, it’s definitely making me anxious.  I probably won’t stay sober the whole time but my goal is to not over do it and get right back on track when I get back home.  But there I go again, planning my own failure.  The mind is a powerful thing.  

I’m proud of myself today though.  I made the decision to grab a bottle on the way home several times and instead I kept making myself go do other things first.  First a haircut, then a trip to the gym, then I’m going to make a healthy dinner, and if I still feel like it - I’ll head back out before the stores close.  2019 me would have been buzzed by 5pm, eat a bunch of bad food, and passed out by 11.

I am beginning to improve my diet and exercise routine and plan on running a 5K in May.  I was feeling less anxious about my health, and less anxious in general. I've had 2 liver ultrasounds that showed a fatty liver, the last one was in 2018. For some reason that was not enough for me to stop. My bloodwork was done just under a year ago at the height of my alcohol abuse. I knew it was bad, I was sent to a specialist who said stop drinking and lose 10 lbs. I never did look at the numbers. I made attempts but the withdrawals were so bad I never made it past a day 2. I went to detox in May. And June. And July. In July I stayed for rehab and finally it stuck. I will never put myself through that again.

But because of delays and technical issues, my facing the consequences in court is finally happening tomorrow. My lawyer is confident it will just be weekends to serve, which I am thankful for. It means I can continue to work and be a part of society. 

And I accept that that penance needs to be served and I am ready and willing to do it. But as I sit here tonight it is tough to be anything but depressed. I am having to face my actions from a year ago and look at who I was and what choices I made. I need to now deal with the consequences of the actions of me from a year ago.

The part that I think is toughest is me from before this would be trying to justify why I wasn't bad, or to look for blame elsewhere. Me from today can see my mistakes and accepts the consequences of my actions. I guess that's kind of a silver lining, I have grown in the past year.

I'll face the music in the morning, and then deal with what comes. I cannot change these things now, so I should accept them. I can change my attitude and keep myself in the best possible place during this.

If anyone else is going through something similar, or their own personal battles, know I am rooting for you. Dealing with the wreckages of the past isn't fun, but it'll always be there if it isn't dealt with, so might as well clean it up as best as possible.",14

One of them cracked a joke saying, “What, you’re not gonna order a Long Island on your first day??”

After thinking about it for about 5 seconds, I came straight out with, “Actually, I don’t drink.” Immediately his jaw dropped and he said, “Oh! Shit! Good for you!” and they both proceeded to let me know about a few incidents where people had been let go for drinking during office hours and displaying completely inappropriate behavior. I assured them that would never be an issue for me, and we moved on from the topic.

Honestly, putting it out there right up front was... a huge relief. I’d been kinda worried about it, but right up front it’s established that they’ll never see their boss with a drink in hand. Everywhere I’ve worked previously, I’ve been known for always being down to enjoy beverages in the office, and it really held me back from moving up to high positions of authority.

I’m really beginning to enjoy this new and improved version of myself. I can’t wait to see what else this new year has in store :)

I guess I feel okay, but sometimes it’s hard to feel like celebrating. I know I should take the time to be proud of the accomplishment, and I am…but my journey is far from over. I guess if I had any advice for anyone fighting to stop drinking it would be this: in order to fully commit to making the life decision to stop drinking, you HAVE to love who you are as a person. That is step one and the hardest sometimes. It’s also the easiest to skip. Another bit of advice is that you have to have support which comes in many forms: family, friends, forums etc. I don’t know where I would be if I hadn’t had such amazing support, but I can guess that it would not be great.

There is also the misconception that sobriety will make all your problems go away. As much as we’d like to believe that, it just isn’t the case. Sobriety does, however, allow for a clean head and a sense of feeling present. What this means is that we can deal with our problems instead of hiding from them. I’ll always be an alcoholic and that will not change, BUT at least I’m a sober alcoholic and that is good enough for me.",18
2020-01-09 20:03:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/emjadg/enough_said_my_soul_1_year_sober/,"""Enough!"" said my Soul! 1 Year Sober.","It's ok to fail at sobriety, it is just another chance to make it better. It may feel like eternal darkness but the sun rising is another chance at a new life.  That sunrise came one year ago when my soul had said it had enough of hangovers that thrust me into internal damnation and contemplating death by my own hands. 

Many times I said this was it, only to thrown to the sweet elixir to numb my brain and thwart my attempts to find the real me. I had made a decision that this is not the way I wanted to live my life anymore, I wasn't going to be ""that person"". The one that everyone had to be careful around when they got drunk, the person that was going to be the self-exile, the drunk uncle, the drunk dad, the Drunk. 

My sobriety came from a place deep inside of me that wanted to thrive and be alive, and that wasn't going to happen by killing myself and my soul everyday with alcohol. The early days are very difficult, but I overcame every situation possible because my soul was finally in the driver seat, not the human who was fearful to live, who had insecurities and was carrying a world of hurt. 

Now I am a shining light that I yearned for, I am an example to my community that wants to be sober, I have people approaching me telling me they want to be like me. I thought I was the only one that was suffering, alcohol has that effect to isolate us, but I have come to realize that everyone is suffering in some shape or form, life, in general, is not an easy thing to fathom let alone navigate. 

I'm in no place to give advice, but what I found on this journey is that to really stay sober, you have to dig deep inside of you and find a reason bigger than yourself, and be ready to fight for it every single day. Never get complacent. And in the good times, I try to negatively reinforce that there were bad times and that all it takes is one drink to go back into the dark. 

Don't look left or right, look inside yourself, you are the only person that is on YOUR journey, so it is up to you, and no one else to make sure that you live your life story on your own terms.

The Soul doesn't know days, how could it? It's been around for centuries, maybe millions of years, who knows? Your only obligation is to be true to it so that it can soar high and freely above the shackles of human confinements. 

apologies if this sounds like rambling, or too philosophical. I fought this battle by going inside of myself and fighting the monster from within without any outside help.",13

Wine is fine but whiskey's quicker
Suicide is slow with liquor
Take a bottle and drown your sorrows
Then it floods away tomorrows

Evil thoughts and evil doings
Cold, alone you hang in ruins
Thought that you'd escape the reaper
You can't escape the Master Keeper

Cause you feel life's unreal, you're living a lie
Such a shame who's to blame and you're wondering why
Then you ask from your cask is there life after birth
What you saw can be Hell on this earth

Now you live inside a bottle
The reaper's traveling at full throttle
It's catching you but you don't see
The reaper is you and the reaper is me

Breaking laws, knocking doors
But there's no one at home
Made your bed, rest your head
But you lie there and moan
Where to hide, Suicide is the only way out
Don't you know what it's really about",4

I only stop because I’m so tired from working/parenting that I pass out. Occasionally I’ve passed out on the couch and woken up in the sitting position with the drink still in my hand.

2020-01-09 16:37:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/emgf4d/my_mindset_has_changed/,My Mindset Has Changed,"I tried to stop drinking back in October 2018. I made it 10 days! Holy cow was it hard. I thought about drinking non-stop. Unfortunately this subreddit, instead of being a place to go to stop thinking about drinking, it just made me think to myself, ""well I'm not drinking as much as that guy, I must be OK."" This must be a common mindset.

And so I started again, and didn't stop.

I can actually tell you the 3 days in all of 2019 that I didn't drink (my ""drink"" at home is 24oz of Coke Zero and 7-8oz of Bacardi, and I typically have 3 a night)...that's not a good sign. I went to bed drunk (or not sober) 99.8% of all days in 2019! Yikes!

Even though I would keep telling myself, there's no reason to drink, I seemingly still couldn't stop myself. Like something was forcing me to.

Until Monday, Jan 6th, when I came back to this subreddit for the first time in over a year, and saw someone mention ""This Naked Mind"". I had heard about it before but blew it off as another BS self help book. Oddly enough, it was already in my Audible account, I must have purchased it but not read it. I decided to give it a go.

I listened to all 7 hours and 28 minutes that day! And it was the first time in forever that I didn't crave alcohol. This was crazy cause Monday's are my bowling days with my buddies, I typically have a drink, and we all always drink while bowling. I didn't even want a drink! Even watching them all drinking, it never even crossed my mind.

What kind of voodoo is in this book?!?!

She managed to stifle my fear of ""oh god, what am I going to do if I no longer GET to drink"" and changed that to ""I'm so excited to live the rest of my live without WANTING to drink!""

Somehow she got my subconcious brain to stop being a douche and start listening to my concious brain. It's seemingly magic is all I can say. 

I now look forward going to restaurants that are further than a few miles away so I don't dread getting pulled over and getting a DUI. Actually doing things in the evenings rather than putting them off because I want to drink at home. So many more things I'm EXCITED about rather than worried about being able to do without alcohol.

For me, I hope, it's no longer one day at a time not drinking. It's the rest of my life not worrying about wanting to drink!

I Will Not Drink With You Today -> I Will Not WANT to Drink With You Ever!

I know this is super early to talk like this, but it's totally my mindset right now. It was not like this when I tried quitting before. Before it was like a diet, and I always fail diets. It was ""Ok I'm gonna try to stop drinking"" just like ""OK I'm going to eat healthy and go to the gym"". Always fails. Maybe I need a book to get my subconcious to learn to love working out! hmm.

I'm not in any way associated with the book, nor do I profit from anyone buying it. Just sharing my story. If you REALLY want to quit, that is the mindset needed, then I highly recommend the book.

Anyone else read it and immediately feel relief? It really does feel like magic.",3

But today I’ve had the strongest cravings so far (more so than the holidays or NYE) for no reason! It’s almost like my subconscious mind is trying to convince myself of a reward for all the hard work my conscious mind has put in.  I think this is amplified because I’m also recently celebrating a month off of smokes.  

Anyway, even though the cravings are the strongest today, I won’t give in because I know it will pass. Tonight I have plans that I was looking forward to doing. Later I’ll hit my head on my pillow sober and be infinitely happier than if I drank or smoked a cigarette.",6

Yesterday after I completed my intake and getting a sobriety plan set up I came home and cleaned out the garage, cleaned out the fridge, threw away a ton of useless junk, cleaned the house, took the puppy for a nice long walk and then watched a movie with my wife sober. 

Today I woke up at 7am, without an alarm or a hangover, and went to renew my license which I've been putting off since it expired in August. Then I took my wife out for breakfast, came home and took the pup on a walk and I'm about to hop on my Peloton for a nice ride. 

My Dad is coming today, usually I'd be a ball of nerves because the house doesn't look nice and I'd be drinking full of anxiety. He'd arrive and not care about the house but that his adult son was clearly buzzed on a Thursday night for no apparent reason.

It has all come down to my many ""shun's"" of alcohol. I thought I would share those here for all of you finding yourself struggling with the first few days or who find yourself going back to the bottle after a period of sobriety.

1. Prepara-shun: I set myself up for success before I started the first few grueling days. I have am lucky enough to have a very supportive family and knew that if I spent Christmas surrounded by them I wouldn't find myself in a position where alcohol would be available or required. I picked this time to prepare myself for the first rough days of withdrawal by reading ""This Naked Mind"" twice before I quit and began a few other ""shuns"" before taking the leap.
2. Medica-shun: I have struggled with depression and anxiety for my entire life. I only realized how deep the drinking hole had gotten after I made the effort to combat these two issues through self assessment and therapy. But realizing I had a problem wasn't enough for me to battle the enormity of my demons. Sometimes you need a step stool to reach the rope to drag yourself up out of the well of mental illness. I started taking medication to combat the symptoms of my illnesses a full 2 months prior to committing to an AF lifestyle.
3. Motiva-shun: I took a real, hard look at my life and what alcohol had done for me. Pros, Cons and everything in between. I started to focus on what i wanted to achieve in my life and what steps I would need to take to get there. I set myself weight, monetary and relationship goals and wrote down as much as I could about how alcohol would or would not help me in those quests. Doing this while i was still drinking gave me goals I could strive for, all while still under the same physical and mental constraints that alcohol had on me (fun fact, those goals were easy to start down the path on once I got started with sobriety).
4. Participa-shun: I have an amazing group of extremely drunk friends. Most of the time I believed that our relationship was not only built around alcohol, but was the only reason we even got together. By letting them know I was starting down this journey and that I still wanted to hang out as often as we used to set the stage for involvement in the group without losing those closest to me. Not participating with those who love and appreciate will only make your experience a negative one. Once you are ready to make the commitment to yourself that drinking isn't the reason you have fun with your friends, it is easier to hang out with drinkers. And who knows, maybe all the fun you are still having while sober can be the catalyst to helping your friends make choices to annex alcohol from their lives. If participating in your old life is triggering, start participating with others in new activities... you may find yourself a new core group of people!

Thanks for reading and hopefully you can see through my useless puns to find the information helpful. These 4 points has made this particular AF experience nearly painless and I suspect with continuing down this path will not be filled with as much self-loathing as quitting had in the past.

I posted a reply to u/beenlurkin yesterday and u/rachiewoo100 suggested I post my response as its own thread. I am humbled and somewhat surprised that my silly rambling spoke to someone else, but I wanted to honor that request because I think its an important reason we are all here: to share our experiences, to let others know they're not alone, and to provide hope.

I often lurked this community in the beginning of my sober journey. I clung to your stories and wisdom. I trusted you all that things would get better. I tried to follow a lot of your advice: I read books (shout out to *The Easy Way for Women to Quit Drinking* by Alan Carr - that was a godsend!), and I treated this place as my virtual meetings. And day by day, I made the choice to not drink.

The choice to quit wasn't easy. I found out I had liver damage already starting at 28. I'd only been drinking heavily for \~2 years at that point. But it was enough, apparently. The day the doctor's office called to tell me the results of my ultrasound, I drank. I drank because I was pissed and sad, hopeless and lost. I shared the news with my then-boyfriend, A. I told him I wasn't ready to stop but that I would soon. And I meant it, because two weeks later I did.

The first day wasn't easy. I actually gave A my debit card so that I couldn't walk to the liquor store across the street. Day one sucked. Day two sucked. Days 3-?? sucked. I spent hours pouring over this sub, trying to distract myself from the constant screaming in my head. But just as time heals a broken heart, so does it muffle that voice.

I won't say that I suddenly became a perfect partner, professional, or citizen. But slowly, I noticed that the universe was rewarding my positive choices with abundance in other ways. I wrote about this in another post, but in short, my life completely changed direction. I married an amazing man. I was a sober bride almost a year ago today. I started my own business and I've been able to play in quite a few professional ensembles since then. (I'm a musician... the classical, nerdy kind. Ha!) I've made really great friends, and been able to be honest with people about my struggles. My parents and siblings still doesn't know, but that's a post for a whole different sub.

I wanted to tell you all these things first because I want you to know that life really does get better. Its not magically going to be different; no unicorns or rainbows, I'm afraid. But its even better than that because its real, its human.  (Side note: if you've never done [values cards](http://www.motivationalinterviewing.org/sites/default/files/valuescardsort_0.pdf), I highly recommend you look into them. Essentially you go through these cards one by one and quickly decide whether they fall into one of three categories: Very Important to Me, Important, Not Important. Once you've gone through them all, chuck the Not Important pile and continue sorting them into three piles until you're left with 10 or less. These are the values that are most important to you. Do this helped me define things in my life in a way I had never been asked; I was literally able to see that X, X, and X are important to me. Now I make choices that are in line with these. Also, don't be afraid to do them every 6 months to a year. It's really fun to see how you've grown!)

So... now that I've talked your ear off, here is what I replied in that post:

>Recently I've had a couple very stressful days where, as I'm heading home, I think *I wish I could just get shitfaced... Leave my brain and escape from it all.* The thought is surprising as hell, honestly, because it seems to pop up out of nowhere. But it serves a vital function: this thirsty voice is really telling me that I'm not dealing with something in my life. It's like a little alarm bell that causes me to stop and evaluate my choices, actions, habits. This in turn allows me to take inventory of all the good things that are in my life as well.  
>  
>Within minutes I'm full of gratitude, and relieved because I know for absolute certainty I will not be stopping by the liquor store. I will not be getting drunk this evening. I will not fuck over my amazing husband, my family, my students or colleagues. Most importantly, I will not fuck over my future self. Instead, I'll calmly address -- or at the very least identify and acknowledge -- what caused me to feel triggered in the first place.  
>  
>This amazing sense of freedom, of choice, is worth it. I only wish I would have stopped sooner.

No matter what day you're on, remember to be kind to yourself. You're here. You're reading this. That means you care, something deep inside you wants to make a change. Fear is a powerful deterrent, it keeps us locked away and prevents us from being our best selves. Today, I challenge you to be brave.

Previously attenuated and modified by the depressive effects of alcohol, previous euphoria and then descent into the abyss, and now after this time successive stages, periods and moments are normalized. You learn to distinguish a bad moment, a listlessness or a frustration without it being more than one more step, manageable at each moment. Anxiety, obsessiveness and depression are recurrent when you drink or have addictions, but they are not alien to a substance-free mind and can appear. The big difference is how you deal with them. And depending on the situation, it's not always easy. I have read some posts about people who after quitting alcohol at six months had a ""great"" life and others with years suffer every time they see a friend take a beer, so everyone has some goals, some support and get some results. In any case the cornerstone is in oneself, not drinking, not being an addict. For the rest there are no guarantees, you don't know if it will go well or badly, but without that initial attitude, without drinking, there is no way.

2020-01-09 12:27:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/emcup4/i_was_tired_of_being_an_intoxicated_ghost/,I was tired of being an intoxicated ghost,"A couple of years I read an interview with actor and legendary stoner Woody Harrelson. In the interview Woody explained that he had recently given up smoking weed.  He said that his prodigious  weed consumption was making him feel detached from reality. He felt like he wasn’t present in his own life.

Then, more recently, I heard an interview with UK rapper Tricky. He too had given up smoking weed.  And he said something that really hit home for me.  He said he felt like weed had turned him into a ‘hovering ghost’ in his own life. 

Thats’ what I had become too.  An intoxicated ghost watching reality from a distance. 

Everyday was about making sure I had enough booze and weed to get high. 

Going to the movies? No. There’e no booze there and the movie time conflicts with my planned daily intoxication schedule.  

Taking a class in something that interested me? No. Can’t show up buzzed. So fuck that.

Fancy going to dinner at a funky new restaurant that doesn’t yet have a liquor license? No I don’t. I feel like going to the steak house with the attendant promise of unlimited red wine. 

It went on an on.  Booze and weed was constricting my life and making me an extra in my own life. 

And one of the biggest benefits of sobriety for me has been my re-entry into the real world.  

I’m no longer waiting for the booze to enter my bloodstream and the weed to enter my lungs just so I can feel ‘normal’ and enjoy myself and the company of others. 

I have turned into a slight impersonation of legendary non-stoner Tom Hanks.  

I’m happy to meet and chat with the guy/gal at the Whole Foods register.  No longer scoping out the staff to avoid the one that sold me my nightly haul of wine and IPA the day before. 

 In case they get the idea that I might be alcoholic. And do what? Tell my wife?  It was crazy.  

Now I notice things afresh. I’m more open and less afraid.  My energy has completely changed.

Now i’m up at the crack of dawn making tea for still-sleeping wife and kids. 

I’m no longer constantly on the verge of snapping at people because my head is wrong.

The upside to sobriety for me is that the real me is back.  

And I missed him. He was alright.

2020-01-09 11:54:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/emcdad/a_my_perspective_on_addiction/,A (My) perspective on Addiction,"Overcoming addiction was the most difficult challenge i have faced and doing so i had to focus on its roots, my suffering and disconnect. For many of us, if not all, our pain and suffering began before our addiction even started. And so developing a better understanding of ourselves and embracing the right perspective where compassion, truth and forgiveness are present is essential in facing out fear, understanding guilt, so it can be transformed to empower change. 

It is our detachment or disconnect from our psyche (the human soul, mind or spirit) that has or help some of us survive a traumatic event, and turned to behaviours like seen in addiction to cope. Substances to relieve us from pain, an unhealthy attachment for the need to be love and to love, our unhealthy relationship with food and our body,  or the need to accumule material things and money, just to name a few.  And for some, we also took on personality traits that led to personality disorders. These personalities are not our character but coping mechanisms to perhaps shield us from reality of trauma.  And for others, the trauma they endure is a crisis of reality because they are born into it. They say money cannot buy happiness, i beg to differ because not having it brings a tremendous amount of suffering. The constant stress of putting food on the table, paying bills, paying for school, clothes, just basic needs for yourself or kids is needless suffering. 

When dealing with guilt from our addiction, yes we must take ownership for our part so we can change, but own onlt what is ours to own. Ownership is not self blame but the search for reason for the ability to choose better. And there are many contributing factors that is not yours to own. We live in a social ill ideological society that puts Politics, Power and Profits over the social needs of its people. Where inequality is much greater than the value of equality. This plays a big part in our suffering because it feeds to our insecurities of our self image and says we are never enough. That we always need more or to be more in a way that contradicts the true meaning of happiness. 

With undertanding, its in that moment we must own what is ours because that is the moment when we become empowered to choose to change. But do not own the shit that society gives you that contributes to stress, anxiety, depression that leads to the need for escape. And do not feel bad, It is natural for you to think about escaping the reality of your suffering. 

Addiction is complicated and complex. It biological, psychology, social and spiritual.
I do not presume to know your path but what i do know is that addiction is the absence of connection and at times the distortion of love, compassion and kindness. And that the pursuit of happiness must include love in order to re-connect with your psyche and to find meaningful connections with others. Without Self Love and Love for Others, true happiness will always feel and be out of your reach. Love is always the way forward.",3

I got engaged last weekend! I’ve been with my SO for almost three years, in that time he’s been so supportive of me, coming off antidepressants, getting healthier, and eventually two months ago- finally kicking the booze for good. I love him and I’m really excited. 

I’m already feeling anxiety about all the people saying “can’t wait for the wedding!” We have talked about eloping and I know that will come with a whole other set of hurt feelings, but I can’t imagine now, in my early sobriety, planning one of those big traditional weddings that to me are completely centered around drinking. Engagement parties, bridal showers with mimosas bars, bachelorette parties where you black out and get sloppy with penis favors, a wedding where all your guests feel entitled to an open bar when you’ve already spent 30/40/50k on feeding them etc.

Watching my friends and family get drunk in the name of celebrating my marriage sounds like my worst f-ing nightmare. Maybe that’s because that’s how I lived and saw weddings- as an excuse to party and drink, but I just don’t want that. 

Just wondering if any of my fellow alcohol free friends here have felt the same.

Even before I quit drinking, I knew I wanted to quit and wanted to find the support in a group to not feel alone and to actually do it. And it’s been a huge help. I made a diet change last year. I gave up red meat, pork, and poultry. I loved the way I felt and was able to do it with ease. With each of those I gave myself a quit date and just tapered off until the actual date. I decided to do the same with drinking. I loved drinking and it didn’t prevent me from doing the things I loved or needed to, but I decided just to do it like I did with meats. I quit on the first of the year and this group and the I AM SOBER app have been a great help in keeping me on track long enough to see benefits. One of the things I’m really thankful for right now is more clarity of mind and better memory about what happens late at night before going to bed. “...did I remember to?....” isn’t an issue anymore. I love being able to remember right off that I finished my nightly routine before crawling into bed and not waking in a panic thinking I might have forgotten to put the leftovers into the fridge. 
I’m also feeling great and prepping to run a 5K. I miss drinking, but I’d miss the proud feeling I have even more.

I’m still in a state of shock sometimes, for years I drank, took drugs, engaged in destructive relationships. I did it before so it was never going to get better. I can’t tell people how much better my life is since I stopped numbing the pain and started accepting life, I’m so fortunate to have the life I have, the people I have in it and the knowledge I have.

At least I am sober and that 6 hours is better quality than the 7 or 8 I slept (or less when I stayed up drinking on the weekends) while a lush.

Net, everything in my life amounts to a more positive way to pursue life yet I would love more sleep. I woke up at 4:50 A.M. a little while ago and got some work done. I fell asleep around 10:15 listening to The Office. Lol. 

There is a lot going on in my life: nothing horrible and it is what it is. Life can be a challenge yet I took on these challenges by my own choice. I need more money to do what I want to do in re: to retiring early and starting a non profit. I make a lot of money and I also donate right now. I donate my time here as well on this subreddit trying to help others.

I could quit everything and go back to my way of life as a high functioning and heavy drinking alcoholic or I could continue this more challenging and rewarding path.

What would you choose, reader? Guidance from others is something I value a great deal.

I remembered all I’ve gained the past 8 months. I felt gratitude for feeling like, this year, I am living as the person my heart feels she is. I am connecting with the world and myself in a way that I have long craved. 

When I wanted a drink, I wanted something else. And each drink I took was one sip further away from me doing the self work to figure out what that was. I’m still working on it, but I know that 
I find joy in meaningful relationships, exercise, intellectual pursuits, creative expression, and flowing with nature. 

So, today on my birthday, I *did* celebrate. I did the things that bring me joy with the people I love. And I did so from a place of honesty and self-love.

It’s currently 1:10am and I know I won’t be able to sleep with out it but I have not drank today. I had to call my best Friend to take me to the hospital today to get an iv because I couldn’t stop throwing up from drinking to much the night before.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Could it be counterproductive to keep count of the days since we last drank?,"I’m new to this. I was a daily drinker of about four to ten drinks per day. I drank daily for nearly twenty years. For the last few years I felt my lifestyle was not sustainable. Finally, I stopped drinking just before New Years after reading Alcohol Explained and The Naked Mind. Anyway, I am not taking the mindset that everyday is  a struggle and it will get easier. I’m also not feeling like anything magical happens after X number of days. I’m thrilled that I can live life without needing a drink. My new found freedom is amazing. 

I feel like counting the days since the last drink re-enforces that quitting is difficult. It also makes it seem like giving up alcohol is a sacrifice rather than an indulgence in and of itself. 

I don’t count how many days in a row I have had sex or went for a run. I don’t count how many days it has been since I ate a steak or had ice cream. I’m living like I am 16 again. Alcohol just isn’t something I think about. The cravings come occasionally but I decided to confront them and ride them out. A single drink is not worth risking my new freedom from addiction and that’s that.

I’m  proud of everyone here who has quit. I’m thankful for all the support this subreddit offers, I just wonder if the daily checking in and counting of days is helpful. It’s not like we are on some constant struggle for the rest of our lives. That’s the opposite of how I feel. Alcohol is like an ex-girlfriend. She was part of your life but you move on to a partner, or new interests. You can’t keep thinking about your ex. Living your best life is the way to be free.

I read it more than a few times here but it is true, sometimes you have a ""good day"", took care of the kids, took care of the cat or dog, everything was okay at work, you feel good so far and all the sudden sadness fell on you from nowhere, you feel alone, sad, you want to cry without a particular reason, you just want to be happy now, to smile for no reason, and a drink at that time sounds so damn good. One drink and the evening will look ""happier"", ""easier"", any joke on a tv show, even a stupid one will make you smile or something silly your kid says, food sounds better, your bad thoughts, your stress are gone, everything is brighter...I know it is not true and this artificial happiness will be paid the following day including taxes, extra taxes and a straight back to square one. Fucking Day 1. No, thank you. The scary part is to read guys here with 100+ or 200+ days still having this feeling sometimes. I guess the brain never let you forget there is a easy and quick shortcut to ""happiness"". Friday night is still the scary night to me after a week of ""good"" work. Hang in there my friends.",9

I just got home from a SMART Recovery meeting to more silence from my live-in boyfriend. He’s gone from mad to not to mad within the space of three days because he found out I took up vaping again. 

The thing is, he won’t tell me outright that is why he’s mad, I’m supposed to guess and try to make it better without any communication. He also said when he found out that he is learning to let it go, and that it’s not the end of the world. Apparently, it was.

It hurts guys. I just tried speaking to him about it again like let’s sort this out and he’s like “just leave me alone”, and I pushed it and with a raised voice and sarcastic tone he said a bunch of hurtful things. Mostly how I suck at relationships because I should just “know"" he’s mad at me and to try to make it better when he gets into a dark mood. I get that, but when he went from really sweet and making plans to silence in the span of an hour, it’s hard to tell how it was triggered. 

He says I’ve not been trying, I said I am working on myself, going back to school, etc. something he used to be very proud of. Oh, and I also quit drinking “for our future” as he put it before when he said he was proud of me for that too. He laughed at that sarcastically, made fun of me that I consider that as trying, “big deal”. Excuse fucking me? 

I don’t want to hurt anymore, in times like this I feel stupid and alone and I can’t drown my sorrows in wine anymore. I thought I was doing a good thing by giving him space, by asking to talk, but apparently I was doing the opposite by “not trying to cheer him up” when I don’t even know for sure why he’s like that in the first place. 

I feel crazy and frustrated because I couldn’t even get my point across without him interrupting me. How can I make things better when I can’t even fucking talk? After his “now leave me alone”, I ended the conversation with “I know you are speaking from a place of hurt, but you are being extremely awful right now. You are doing the exact same thing you hated about your parents. You are becoming the thing you hate, and that is sad. “ and closed the door. 

Please /stopdrinking, I need some support right now because all I want to do is drink the bottle of wine that’s sitting in my fridge as a big eff you, but I know that would only further prove his point.

2020-01-08 19:47:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/em1xha/relapsed_sort_of/,Relapsed... sort of,"3 days ago, after 20 days of not drinking, I decided to quit using Kratom cold turkey, which I had been using for weeks in place of alcohol. I was blowing money that was supposed to go towards food and rent on it, and I was lying to everyone saying that I was sober. I'm still lying to people; only a few of my friends know about the kratom use, and I was lying to my AA sponsor. Not only was it eating up most of my money, but I was being a lying sack of shit to everyone including myself.

These past 3 days have been awful. At the same time, I'm getting off of some seizure medication (Depakote), after tapering for a few days, so it hit me hard. I've been so depressed that all I've been doing is watching YouTube videos and sleeping. Work has been extremely, extremely stressful. I've been shaking like crazy and I'm so anxious I can barely finish sentences or communicate with anyone. I stopped talking to my AA sponsor and other people I met at AA. Leaving friends on read. Last time I used Kratom, I puked on some shoes and didnt even have the strength to clean it up until today. I'm pathetic. I do feel like I have a bit more energy today, and the tremors have stopped mostly, but mentally I'm still a wreck and I don't know if it will fully pass

2 days ago I was about to have a panic attack and used some of the last of my money to buy a beer... I paced around the neighborhood for 20-30 minutes trying to decide what I wanted to do with it, texted a friend and he nearly talked me out of drinking it, but eventually I relented and opened the can. I drank a few swigs and poured about 50% out, then took a few more gulps and poured the rest out. Honestly, it was enough for me to calm down a bit. I just watched YouTube videos until I fell asleep

I feel like I really shouldn't stay mad at myself for this or feel like I'm back to ""square one"". I poured most of it out, haven't drank any since, and after all I still managed to go 20 days without drinking. It is something to be proud of, I guess; nobody's perfect anyway and alcohol is a monster drug that is ridiculously hard to quit. The withdrawals from Depakote and Kratom seem to be passing as well and I seem to be feeling a bit more like myself. Honestly though, it's been a very long time since I've been totally sober. I don't even know what ""feeling like myself"" is... From what I can remember, I'm a dysfunctional trainwreck, but my living situation and job have both changed since, so maybe I'll be fine... I just don't have any idea at this point. Damn, this is so difficult

Today I sit in the United Club having just been fired. The good news is that I am not drinking, but I have been distracted by writing a few apologies. 

My story begins with always being a heavy drinker, but largely functional and capable of stopping. I work in sales and it is also part of the culture, so it can get buried a bit in the overall activity of the company.

Where things go sideways - originally...about a year and a half ago, I found out that my father was not my biological father (thanks Ancestry.com). I decided not to point this out to him as I am an only son and this would rob him of his legacy.  

While I always had a weird feeling and pain surrounding my family, I was gutted. My wife and child were not in town when I found this out, and I started drinking. I didn't stop for three days. I called off work and embraced the liquid solution to my problems. My wife started to freak out and had to end her trip early when I clearly needed the help. Since that time, my drinking (and problem drinking) increased incrementally over time. I took ""breaks"" where I wouldn't drink for a month or two, but man, what a flare up I had when I was told that my father had a stroke. 

I flew to meet him in the hospital and then had to leave for our company event. I had just come off one of my breaks and thought a beer would be the right thing to have at the airport. This then led to 48 hours of binge drinking where I passed out in the hallways both nights, offended a female member of the company by putting my hand on her leg while probably being just a general asshole, to the point where she felt compelled to raise it to HR, and then I was fired this afternoon.

I am scared, but also there is some level of peace that comes with this. I have never felt like, ""you have to stop drinking"", but I have the unequivocal proof that I do. Furthermore, I need help with the issues that drive the drinking. If you made it this far, thanks for reading.",624

2020-01-08 18:47:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/em14lz/fear/,Fear,"Hi everyone!

I’ve gotten sober before and relapsed after about as much time as I have now. One of the things that I learned from that experience is that I have to keep actively working on my sobriety in order to keep it. I’m never done. Sobriety isn’t a destination, it’s an ongoing process. This is a journey of a lifetime. 

Another thing I learned is that relapse doesn’t start with thinking about drinking. That’s actually one of the *last* things that happens before I relapse, that’s the end stage. By the time I’m having anything more than a passing thought about drinking alarm bells should be going off *everywhere* and I should be at DEFCON 5, because I’ve already been in relapse mode for quite a while.

One of the first steps towards relapse is that I stop working on my recovery. I stop making it a priority in my life. I also start isolating. Even if I’m still seeing people, I stay stuck in my head, and I stop talking about what’s actually going on with me. When I’m headed for a relapse I’m always “fine.” Even if my life is on fire I’m “fine.” I don’t need you. I’ve got this.

Something that I’m just starting to recognize is that my level of fear about the future and my life in general is also a good barometer for where my recovery is at. 

Drinking was a solution for how I felt. It was a way I coped with situations and feelings that overwhelmed me. Looking back, a lot of those situations and feelings boiled down to fear. A lot of times I wasn’t even afraid of concrete realities, I was spinning stories in my head about what I *assumed* was going on, and I made assumptions about the future which also weren’t based in a whole lot of concrete fact.

I’ve been experiencing a lot of fear this week. I’m still active in my recovery, so it’s just one of those wobbles that life throws you, it’s not heading me off towards a relapse. But holy crap, I *am* glad that I’ve stayed active and engaged in my recovery, I can see now how something that this could very easily be the sort of thing that starts the ball rolling towards a relapse.

I just started a new job. I didn’t have any details about my new position before starting. I’d talked with my new boss about my bigger picture career path and some areas where I need help with professional development, but he wasn’t sure exactly where he was going to place me. 

He ended up creating a position for me which builds on where I’m already at and is clearly leading towards the career path that we talked about. I’m happy about that. I feel good about where I landed, and I feel like I’m in the right place.

Where the fear comes in is that, in addition to the small promotion and raise, I’m also increasing my hours and I’m going to be working in the neighborhood of 48 hours a week, which is fairly standard in the industry. It’s also a pretty fast paced and active job. 

I’ve got some chronic physical health issues and I’m experiencing a ton of fear around that. I just don’t know if I’m going to be physically able to do this long term. I’m already fairly exhausted, and I have no idea how I’m going to be able to work that kind of a schedule and stay on top of any of the other practical realities of having a life. 

But I was talking about this situation with a sober friend on Monday night, and he shared an acronym for FEAR which I hadn’t heard before, which is very applicable - **F**orget **E**verything **I**s **A**l**R**ight. I don’t have to force myself to trust that things will work out okay in the future, I just have to take a step back and look around me and recognize that things are actually alright *right now*. 

I’m sober. Because I have stayed active in my recovery I have a sober support network all around me. I’m tired, but my health is fine. I’ve been working a similarly intense job for the better part of a year already, and my health has been fine. 

And I have options available to me. I have a boss who I trust and who is interested in my professional development. If I start to have an issue, I have the option of talking to him about it. I have the option of moving closer to work so I have a shorter commute. I always have the option of quitting and trying something else. I have the option of asking for help and support and suggestions from the people in my life who care about me and my wellbeing. I am not alone right now. I am sober right now. Things are fine right now.

Anyway, that’s probably long enough. I hope that you all are well. Thanks for being here with me.

2020-01-08 15:10:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ely330/101_days_cool/,101 Days. Cool.,"Drinking wasn't totally wrecking my life.  But yes I absolutely drank too often.  And yes, sometimes I absolutely drank too much.  I wasted money, planned my life around booze, took unnecessary risks.. etc. etc. But most importantly (and detrimentally) I was not present for my family even though I was physically there. So honestly, drinking wasn't totally wrecking my life YET, but it was damn sure making me a less better me than I could potentially be.  

I started with Sober October.  I moved on to No Booze November before taking on Dry-cember.  I just hit 101 days and here are my observations pertaining to my own experiences with no longer drinking:

1.  After 100 days it's not really hard *not* to drink.  But I can see that it would be just as easy to drink again.  
2.  I don't really feel that much different physically, aside from a couple notable exceptions:
 
 a.) Waking up without any hangover is great. Not having to power through to get to the afternoon before feeling normal again.

 b.) Workouts are noticeably better all around.

 c.)  The anxiety of waking up not clearly remembering the last hour or so before going to bed is gone of course, so that's nice.

3.  I didn't really realize how strong the craving to drink was until I don't have them anymore.  I am kind of to the point where I don't think about it much.  I used to think I was just drinking because I wanted to, but now, I realize it was because I physically *needed* to.  Now that I don't physically *need* to I definitely don't want to... if that makes any sense.

4.  I didn't realize before how many people could drink socially and not get drunk.  I actually assumed after 25-30 years of drinking often and often binge drinking that the two were mutually exclusive.  Since I stopped drinking, I am really surprised how many people go to bars/parties/whatever and truly only have ""a couple drinks"".  I was always drunk enough (or headed in that direction) that I assumed everyone else was too.  

5.  That  ""just have a couple drinks"" guy is not and will definitely never be me.


My goal started as Sober October and has now evolved to 100+ days - my next goal is just to stop counting, stop thinking about it, and stop dwelling on it.  Acknowledging it - yes... but... Drinking is just a part of my past that is now just **extinct**. It has no control of me or my life because it is not a part of my life anymore.  Feels pretty good to make this as a clear-minded conscious decision.  Good luck all of you in finding your best version of yourself with alcohol!",18

> Alcohol was liberating for me at first. A standard progression:  great, good, fair, poor, bad, very bad, and then a phase for which any  word but “Hell” fails. Halfway through the second drink, there may be a  flicker of the old euphoria, quickly snuffed. You chase it in vain for  the rest of a wretched night. It’s over for you. A line has been  crossed. Yet you cannot imagine yourself not drinking. The obsession is  at one with your core sense of self.

Whether it's your first hour, your first day, your first year, or your tenth, today is the most important day you can possibly pick to not have a drink. 

2010 is the first year I tried to stop drinking. I didn't really want it, I just sort of knew that it was a good idea. So, I quit. I lasted about three months. It occurred to me one day that, ""hey, I don't need to \*stop\* drinking, I just need to stop drinking \*so much\*."" Raise your hand if you've ever had this epiphany. Ok, put your hand down if that worked out for you. Most of you still raising your hands? Yeah, me too...

A couple of years later I got in some legal trouble. A judge decided it was a good idea for me to stop drinking, and although I didn't totally agree with him, he made some compelling points about what would happen if I didn't listen, so I did. I held out about a year this time. Then, the judge stopped taking an interest in my day to day sobriety, and I had yet another epiphany... That didn't end well. 

Over the last decade, I have tried to stop drinking several times. And I have relapsed several times. Two years ago I faced some real consequences from my bad habits. Up until this point I had remained largely functional, holding down a high-paying job and maintaining a semblance of a healthy family unit, which helped to convince me that I really didn't have a problem, per se, so much as a PR problem. Well, I let my guard down and did some things I shouldn't have, and I got to see real consequences for my actions, and real loss. 

And you know what? Something clicked for me. Something that hadn't locked into place for me previously. I began to understand that if I really wanted to stop drinking, I could. But I had to really want it. So, I started focusing on all of the things I had: my wife, my kids, my house, my dogs and cats. Everything that I had the potential to lose, and lose permanently, not just for a year. I realized that I really value all of these things, and I don't want to lose them, and they're much more important to me than a drink - especially my family. I could lose my house and my possessions. But I cannot lose my family. What happened next was nothing short of a shift in my entire philosophy. I began to believe that if I picked up one drink, while I might not lose anything that day or the next, it would inexorably begin the process by which I might lose everything that was ever and will ever be important to me. No, not might. That I absolutely \*will\* lose everything. Just one drink holds that power for me.

I lost the will to drink. I no longer desire a drink the way that I once did. I still crave the feeling, from time to time, please don't misunderstand me. That may never go away. But, I am no longer willing to trade my present and my future for that feeling. Most of the times that the thought of drinking creeps into my subconscious, an aversion to that reality sets in fast and hard. And when it doesn't, all I have to do is focus on the year I spent away from my family and loved ones, and the aversion settles back in, comfortably, like a well worn sweater. I don't dread the feeling, rather I seek comfort from it. Because in that aversion is the knowledge that I will never drink again.

I don't know what works for you, but I know what works for me. I wish I could have learned that lesson without having to suffer that loss. I hope that some or many of you can and will take the losses of others to heart and avoid suffering unnecessary losses of your own. Just know, relapse is a part of many peoples' recovery, but it doesn't have to be the end of yours.

Anyone who's here because you want to stop drinking, just know that you're welcome here, and that you can do it. I'll be right there with you every day, refusing to give in to temptation and focusing on reality. I will not drink with you today.",638

I am officially 8 days into being sober and honestly, I can't believe I have gone this far. In the past, going 1 or 2 days was an accomplishment but after the holidays I knew I needed to make a change for myself. Ever since Halloween, it has felt that every day has been binge drinking. With a lot of family upheaval and a job I feel stuck in, life has felt like a rut. I will constantly dream of a day where I am sober and finally work towards my goals, but coming home at the end of the day, a bottle of wine and sneaking sips of hard alcohol while going into the kitchen to get ""water"". 

It was always hard to get away from alcohol. I work in sales and I have a lot of friends that love to meet up at the bars after work. I had a philosophy that it's ok to drink socially but never at home but that feels like the biggest crutch I have been carrying with me for a long time. It will work out for a while and then I am back into the thick of it. 

I know it's just 8 days but it feels like a weight has been taken off of me and clarity has been bestowed. I look forward to my new year and continuing being sober.",5

 At Marvel Bar, the subterranean North Loop speakeasy that also happens to be one of the [best places to get a cocktail](http://www.citypages.com/best-of/2012/food-and-drink/marvel-bar-7365326) in the Twin Cities, the staff is always experimenting. Last spring, it was an exploration into gin; they shifted focus to foraging over the summer. Most recently, they embarked on a four-month deep-dive into brandy.

  But when the bar reopens Wednesday after a short hiatus, it'll be with a new theme unlike any of those alcohol endeavors.

From January to April, Marvel's going *dry*.

“What that means right off the bat is a menu dedicated to new cocktails that don’t contain alcohol,” says Peder Schweigert, general manager at the Bachelor Farmer’s basement neighbor. “And we’re in the process of minimizing alcohol’s visible impact in the space as well.”

We’ve reported on the Twin Cities’ growing temperance movement a lot lately, from the [non-alcoholic spirit Seedlip](http://www.citypages.com/restaurants/a-non-alcoholic-spirityes-reallyis-coming-for-local-cocktail-lists/508905671) to the [most inventive and refreshing NA drinks](http://www.citypages.com/restaurants/7-mocktails-to-truly-enjoy-this-summer/512657641) available around town. Shoot, the movement is becoming so widespread that we [added a mocktails category](http://www.citypages.com/best-of/2019/food-and-drink/eat-street-social/508543671) to our Best Of issue last year, an honor that went to the sophisticated boozeless beverages at Eat Street Social.

But for a *bar* bar, a speakeasy—a place where the only food you can order is Cheetos—to cut back on the alcohol? That’s a little different.

Schweigert and co. are willing to bet that people will be interested, and so far it looks like they’re right. The Instagram post announcing the new menu has collected more likes and comments than just about any photo Marvel Bar has posted to date—“almost all for the positive. It’s definitely resonated with people,” he says. ",36

Having been addicted to alcohol most of my adult life (30 years), I have had numerous sobriety of attempts, but this time I feel committed.  Here's why:

Alcohol has become unenjoyable for me.  It makes me feel sluggish and tired and generally like crap.  After 3 days sober, I am feeling more energetic and focused.

I honestly don't enjoy the taste of alcohol.  Why drink something that doesn't taste good to me?  I wouldn't eat broccoli or octopus because I don't enjoy it.  Why would I drink alcohol?

I have missed important events and things I want to do while drinking.  I actually passed out during the performance of Hamilton -- something I was really looking forward to seeing.  Fortunately, I have another opportunity to see this.

I have deeply hurt the people I love.  Sometimes, I become a very angry and evil drunk.  There are healthier and more productive way of coping with my emotions.  I am stopping now before I completely drive away the person I love the most.

Alcohol works against my depression meds.  I can't make progress on my mental health if I am diluting the effect of my medications.

Essentially, I am really tired of being sick and tired.  I want to be present for my retirement years and fully enjoy the time I have left.

I know it will be a difficult journey.  The worst for me is the first week.  Fortunately, I have a sober partner supporting me as well as all of you. I've got this.",4

Something I never thought would be possible and it wouldn't be if I was still drinking.

I spent a lot of time on this subreddit my first year which was a huge help in getting me where I am today. Pushing for that 1 year happy face star meant a lot to me and reading about all the others before me that where already there gave me a lot of the early motivation to do it myself.

I’d drink from 9am to 6pm while at work, M-F. Go home, walk my dog, shower, pour myself some more drinks, play video games, and repeat. I was drinking 3-4 Four Lokos and about a pint of Jack a night.

2020-01-08 11:25:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eluxw3/three_months_sober/,Three months sober!,"Hi all, long time lurker here. I've been a steady alcoholic since around 2009, up to about six light beers a night at my worst, more on the weekends. I took the ocassional day off, but each sober day was difficult. I would even pop by here to check in over the years, sometimes putting together a couple days of sobriety and patting myself on the back before returning to my old habits shortly after. 

I've known for a long time that I had a negative relationship with alcohol and would need to quit. For some reason, that certain knowledge was never enough for me to actually make the decision, and my issues stemming from alcohol worsened over time. 

Finally, after a particularly bad night of drinking, I suffered a life-altering panic attack. It was absolutely horrible. Luckily, I even knew at the time that it was ""just"" a panic attack, but there was nothing I could do to ebb the absolute dread and terror that overwhelmed me. It lasted for hours and the aftereffects still haunt me.

Even then, I continued to drink, albeit less. Anxiety still lingered (very common to hear with heavy drinkers). AI scheduled a physical and got unexpected results -- a clean bill of health. This enabled me to continue my habit. 

Then, as if out of the blue, I decided to string a couple days of sobriety together. I checked in each day and bought pop and chocolate to keep me occupied in the evening. A couple days became a week. I got through my first sober weekend in a long while, which was a major hurdle. Anxiety was my only withdrawal symptom, which improved with time and certain techniques such as mindfulness and meditation. 

Weeks became months. I survived sober holidays and trips, and all my friends and family know that I'm ""not drinking right now."" Shockingly, my alcoholic parents are fine with it. I'm forming new habits and at this point, alcohol is something I barely think about anymore. 

I feel incredibly lucky that I didn't have more intensive withdrawal symptoms, and that sobriety has been relatively easy compared to previous attempts. I am thankful to the Lord and also for the mindset that life without booze is a blessing, not a struggle, even when it seems difficult. I think that's why some may say sobriety is a gift. One of my favorite sayings is, ""It's not 'I can't drink,' it's that 'I don't have to drink.'"" It is an absolute relief to not worry about alcohol. 

I remember worrying if I would have enough alcohol for a night. Wife and I took a trip with friends once, and the first night included a drive to Chicago for an overnight stay with an early flight out of O'Hare the next morning. That night, we *only* drank two drinks at a restaurant, and one at a bar at the hotel. That wasn't enough! I ended up pounding mini champagnes that my wife brought, all in front of my friends. It was embarrassing to 'need' booze. 

I remember having to work hard to pace myself, especially if I started drinking early. Golfing at midday made that difficult. I remember having to space out each drink to not get too buzzed. It was exhausting--chasing the high without going too far. ""If you can't have fun when you control your drinking, or if you can't control your drinking when you have fun, then you have a problem."" 

These past few months have been eye-opening. I've certainly taken my sobriety for granted, but there are times I look back to the decade I spent as an alcoholic and realize how much control it had over me. From the outside, I don't look like your standard alcoholic--I never got too drunk at social outings and was never 'that guy'. But I was always planning around alcohol and allowing it to control my actions and steer my life. I developed severe insomnia and even knowing that alcohol was the problem, I still didn't make the change until years later. Now, I sleep like a rock. 

Anxiety crept up on me over the years, often just a sense of jitters and unease in the mornings after drinking. Combined with poor sleep, I became lethargic and unproductive in the morning, pushing off work as much as possible. In the evenings, I would isolate myself from my wife just to drink my light beer in peace. My wife certainly noticed, but I only made enough change to appease her while maintaining my habit. 

Now, after three months, I am at peace with my sobriety and am working to continue to establish new sober habits. I've happily accepted the sober lifestyle and rarely miss drinking. Cravings are virtually non-existent. I owe so much to this sub, I don't know that I'd be here without it. Thank you all! IWNDWYT",3

I was in a miserable marriage with a new baby. I was stuck home all day, because despite being a doctor who loves her career, my husband wanted me to stay home with the child and to avoid argument, I did what he said. He worked all day, but would then stay out late gambling or cheating or both. We fought constantly because my dreams were being squashed, I had postpartum depression in a bad way but very little support, and I felt trapped. I always knew who he was, yet because of past traumas and a very poor sense of self, I just brushed our being totally incompatible aside as my being ""bad"" or ""unlovable."" The more unlovable I felt, the more self destructive I became. The more destructive I became, the less my husband loved me, the more unlovable I felt. It was a toxic cycle triggered by just not being a good fit, and needing more from life. 

I had always enjoyed imbibing, so I drank... I drank secretly, I drank socially, I drank to celebrate, I drank to commiserate, I drank for every single reason there was to drink every other day. I day drank, I drank at night, I drank allllll the time. Really, I was drinking to blind myself - from the emptiness I felt, the shame I felt, the insecurities, the hurt, the boredom, the chemical imbalances... everything. 

I functioned, I guess. I was an okay mom, an okay wife, my house was clean, my husband and I looked cute together to the public, I reopened my practice and wasn't a terrible doctor, and I went to Sunday service usually. Life was mediocre (at best) as a drunk. It revolved around not only when I could drink again, but who'd I'd drink with and how I'd ""get away with it"" but it was okay... except when it wasn't. After my son was in bed, I made stupid decisions while drunk... embarrassed myself, acted out, texted people I shouldn't have, made awful facebook posts, would get sick and try to hide it, broke things, fell, and some much worse things that fall under the umbrella of being a drunk. All this did was fuel the shame I felt, and kept the drinking cycle going. I drank to forget the last stupid thing I did while drinking. 

So one day I woke up from the fog, and I realized I couldn't keep doing what I was doing. I left my husband and I got sober. It was hard... remember when I said I was ""functioning, I guess"" well, it turns out I wasn't functioning at all. My practice was suffering, I'd lost whatever friendships I thought I had because they were just drinking buddies or people I'd hurt, I was bloated and sick with a big fat liver, I had a terrible reputation for being unreliable, and my son hated when I drank and didn't believe me when I said I was sober. 

So I put work in... I worked really hard. I got therapy and stayed in it, I started telling the truth, even when things were bad, I started saving money again, I put in hours at work that I used to run home to drink instead of working. I told my son that I was sorry and meant it by showing him in action. I got my life back, each day that I spent sober. Eventually I woke up and realized that I was healing and so was my life and the lives of those I love and had hurt. 

I bought a new house for my son (who's now 10) and I so that we could start fresh, and we just moved in. The other night my ex husband was over, because we're still friends,  and while he was setting up the television system he said ""I think we should get back together, because you're so different now."" and it felt really good that he had noticed the changes I've made. I will never go back to him, but it was nice to be noticed for something other than being a drunk. 

One day, if you start right now or keep pushing on, someone will notice you for other reasons than being a drunk. You're not unlovable, you're not shameful, you're not bad. You're sick and you need to heal. Healing takes time, and that's okay. 

TL;DR My name is Dr. Cactus, and I'm an alcoholic.

Bringing it up causes blowups.

You might not have crashed your car or lost your job. There may not have been a “rock bottom” when you finally had a moment of enlightenment. I didn’t. What I did have was a nightly habit that had become conditioning. Alcohol is a master at instruction. Its conditioning on your psyche is subtle and patient and delivered by a mechanism that is obvious and immediate on your senses. It conditions you to accept your circumstances and behaviors as “given.”

Once you stop you begin the process of breaking the spell. When drinking daily I had a pretty good life and did well with my work and family, but I had no idea what potential waited for me on the other side. Deconditioning took time, but the benefits of sobriety became evident quickly. I don’t consider myself a person that was broken, but one needing improvements. I chose improvement. One of the best decisions in my life.

I went through a really significant and sudden/tragic loss of someone extremely close this summer, specifically an in law who was like a parent to me and unexpectedly took their own life. I turned to alcohol and I am ashamed to say it. Since the death, there has barely been a single day that I haven't had at least one beer (those days were more rare), but usually many, many glasses of wine. I can't do this to my fiance any more and I don't want to feel this way anymore. I have abstained the last two days and while I am having cravings, I physically feel good. I want to keep feeling this way, especially because my wedding is just months away. While my vanity isn't the main reason I'm doing this - I mainly want to heal my mind, body and soul and really go through my grief without numbing agents, but I hear an added bonus is fitness and weight loss.

I've always been the type who works out every day, is actually pretty fit, but always has that beer belly, puffy face, skin that just can't clear up. I'm over it, I want to feel better about myself.

So in addition to my goal of healing my soul, I want to look better for my wedding. I have sabotaged every attempt at losing my belly for the last 10 years because of my love for beer and wine (I truly do love the taste, learning about varieties, but it's gone from an interest to a dependence). For once in my life, I want to prove to myself that I can become the best version of myself, and for me, as vain as it is, is seeing the results on my body. I want to stop hurting my spouse by my belligerent drunkness all the time, and I want to feel amazing on my wedding day.

I'd love to hear how your body positively reacted to cutting alcohol as some inspiration.

And of course, I will not drink with you today.

ETA: The days I haven't drank I am SO hungry, is this normal? I feel like I'm eating more, but I still feel better because i'm drinking less.",2

>My way of dealing with life was to numb myself with drugs and alcohol, because it made me feel better and more equipped to deal with everything. My career was skyrocketing, but the scaffolding that was holding me up as a person was starting to collapse. I wasn’t fully aware of how bad it was getting, but I knew, in my heart, that I was on an unsustainable, reckless, self-destructive path.

>When I met David, he had been through that. And he was content. He was at peace with himself, with an incredible wife, clearly in love. There were a number of times where the two of us were alone, and he said some things that weren’t scolding, but pieces of wisdom that stuck with me: “You know, there is a better way here, and it doesn’t have to end in despair or in death, in the bottom.”

>A few years later, Bowie came through L.A. I’d been sober for a fair amount of time. I wanted to thank him in the way that he helped me. And I reluctantly went backstage, feeling weird and ashamed, like, “Hey, I’m the guy that puked on the rug.” And again, I was met with warmth, and grace, and love. And I started to say, “Hey listen, I’ve been clean for …” I don’t even think I finished the sentence; I got a big hug. And he said, “I knew. I knew you’d do that. I knew you’d come out of that.” I have goosebumps right now just thinking about it. It was another very important moment in my life.

I am a woman who had a bottle of wine or more a day habit for years. I justified my behavior with the mindset that I deserved to drink, I’m a working mother with a demanding high stress job and a husband that travels. Given that the days of the week long benders from college were no longer appropriate wine would allow me to “relax”in a socially acceptable way. 

I am ashamed to think of all the times I have acted in a manner totally inconsistent with my character because of alcohol. All of the times I became upset because my three year old refused to go to sleep at a reasonable hour so I could start drinking. Drinking during family activities that should have been special memories for us and believing that no one would know. Thinking about the time I passed out on my living room floor and my husband literally could not move me because I was dead weight and I woke up with my toddler daughter sleeping next to me on the carpet as she had likely stumbled out of bed in the middle of the night looking for me. All of the times I pissed myself on our couch and had to make sure the cushions were dried and coverings washed before we had family or friends over later that day. Purchasing multiple bottles of the same wine and switching them out in the fridge after finishing them when my parents were visiting so they would think I hadn't touched it and therefore didn't have a drinking problem.

I gave up alcohol for Lent last year and got so shitfaced at Easter with my in laws that they literally forced me into another area of their home so my daughter wouldn't have to  see me. I can only pray that my daughter is young enough where she will remember none of this. 

I never want to be this person again. My daughter deserves a mother who is 100% present, my husband deserves a partner who is not a fucking mess. These past few days have been so great with my family, I am getting into the groove of normalcy and that feels strangely okay. 

I feel so strongly in my ability to stick with sobriety this time around and really hope I am strong enough to do this.",24

I feel like somebody died and when I remember I won’t be seeing them again I get sad and nostalgic. Like I’m mourning my old life. Also, intense feelings of shame and guilt for every stupid thing I did while drunk. I know I can’t change the past and apologizing to a few people in particular has helped, but being so clear minded has sent everything floating to the surface. Wondering if anyone has any helpful tips for stopping the montage in your head of cringe-worthy moments. 

I’m sure there’s a better way I could be phrasing this, so I’m sorry if it’s all over the place. It’s my first post after lurking for months but tonight I feel compelled to finally say something.

Thanks in advance.

I must admit I was really happy to see this sub in my feed.,"I’m going on 5 years sober. FIVE YEARS.  If you had asked me 6 years ago where I would be right now I would have said “drunk.”   If you’re reading this you are probably struggling with that first year, or lurking because you want to quit but you don’t think you can.  Let me tell you:  you CAN!  I lurked here for years before I decided to finally stop and I’m so glad I did.  

4 New Year’s Eves sober.  4 birthdays sober.  4 thanksgivings sober and not passing out drunk embarrassing my family - which was a common occurrence for 10 years+.

Now I’m the guy everyone leans on for a sober ride home and let me feel you, I’d MUCH rather be that guy than the one they hide the bourbon from.  

Right now you may feel weird that you are the one who isn’t drinking.  You’ll get over it.  But you have to be the awkward sober guy before you are the comfortable sober guy. (Or gal). It’s uncomfortable and scary at first, but isn’t everything worth doing uncomfortable and scary the first time you do it?  

Take the plunge and make the effort to meet the sober you.  Sober you is living inside of you scared to come out because of drunk you.  

Life is so much better on this side. If you’re a lurker reading this I’ll ask you what I read once that really hit me when I took one of those “Am I an alcoholic?” tests. If you weren’t an alcoholic, would you even be here asking yourself that question?",127

I honestly can’t even believe I made it this far. It’s my longest clean time I’ve ever had, combined with the one of the hardest time’s I’ll probably ever face. Mid November I found my boyfriends lifeless body, facedown in bed, from an overdose. Everyday I am haunted by this nightmare I now call my reality. During all the grief, PTSD, inconsolable tears, an psych ward visits, I never once drank. I think about how that one night of drinking could *maybe* let me forget the pain and images from that day briefly. But that one night will bring on endless benders filled with misery and more agony, on top of what I already have. I decided to actually feel this heartache and learn to cope and heal for once properly. My mental health took a massive hit but I still came out sober! I know for a fact if I was using during his death, I would be sitting beside my boyfriend right now thinking “what the fuck?!”",16
2020-01-08 00:34:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eloe6b/day_12/,Day 12,"Hey everyone, just realized I haven't checked this sub in a while... I used to read through hear longing to be able to say that I hit a milestone but never had the will to start. Ever since college I've been a high functioning alcoholic and it has been exhausting. During Christmas, I confessed to two of my cousins who look up to me that I'm a high functioning alcoholic and they were kind and supportive. Talking to them help me really start to look closer at why I drank in the first place. I have a few personal issues that need to be worked out and alcohol was just making me more depressed and self loathing.

On Christmas, my brother was hospitalized for congestive heart failure. That's when my mom suggested that since my bro couldn't drink, it would be easy for her not too especially if it was to support him. She's not an alcoholic but she does enjoy a few beers a few days a week and I've voiced to her my struggles with it. Then she asked if I would do it too and we could hold each other accountable. I was reluctant, but agreed and it has been so liberating. I'm looking forward to pressing on with this because it feels like I'm beginning a new chapter. 

My self confidence has slowly been increasing and I feel like I'm getting in touch with a level of clarity that I haven't had in years (minus boot camp where we had to be sober but I relapsed immediately after I graduated).

Idk, this shit just feels good and tonight I went out with some friends who were all drinking and I wasn't even tempted to order a beer! 

Thank you all for the inspiration and stories. If there's any two cents I can give from personal experience it would be to HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY with someone you respect. It has helped me feel less alone. 

I look forward to posting here more often. 

Cheers(with sparkling water)

For the first time in as long as I can remember I'm home alone. In the silence of my house I got a craving to be bad so I headed to the kitchen and toasted up a croissant with nutella. It wasn't until I was coming back to my room that I realized how different things would have been a year ago. My splurge would have been more and more alcohol, I would be hiding in my room when people got back, and the dog would have surely torn up the house. Instead I'm binging bad tv and nursing a cold water on my nightstand with a sleeping puppy beside me. It's nice being on the other side of my decision to stop drinking. IWNDWYT",7

After the first week or so of sobriety,  the not drinking became just kind of a dull ache for awhile.  It wasn't a crisis,  I felt it and it was uncomfortable,  but I got through it.  From months 3-6, that was pretty much gone.  Life was good,  not drinking was a non issue,  I didn't really think about it much. 

But now,  it's like that dull ache is back.  I just kinda want a drink. The moderation thoughts are more frequent and convincing.  The idea of forever seems daunting.  I was headed to my kids' 4H meeting tonight,  and the ""I need a quick drink"" thought that crossed my mind surprised me.  I haven't thought that for awhile now. 

I guess I just wish the ache would go away,  that my certainty would return.  I don't plan to drink,  but I don't like that I don't plan to drink.  I want to go back to feeling *happy that I don't drink.  It would be really nice if this feeling didn't last too long.",10

Reading this and imagining the reviewer read this got me in a real funk...I spent 3 months putting this application together.

I def felt like a drink tonight, but instead settled for my usual snack. 

Even those I cringe when I think about it, at least I'm sober and can have a productive day tomorrow.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

The good news: your liver can repair itself and even regenerate. So it’s always worth drinking less or quitting.""


So if a person has been drinking double of these weekly amounts for x amount of years, the liver would be trashed. I think about this and all the years of abusing alcohol. My poor liver. I hope it starts to heal. Does anyone else feel concerned? I need a physical but little afraid to.

More proud than anything.

Overall, I think my drinking falls in the middle of the road as far as stories I've read here go. I was easily polishing off 3-5 drinks a night, sometimes a bottle of wine, sometimes a craft six-pack. Weekends are worse because I'll often have my first drink pretty early and get through quite a few in a day. I tend to favor having a slow, continuous trickle of booze rather than drinking it at once and getting hammered. I don't mean to try and downplay it, I am posting here after all, just provide an accurate picture.

Here's my issue though: I am historically a person who is *very* prone to health anxiety. It doesn't take much for me to start obsessing over a bump in my mouth or checking my heart-rate periodically. I say this to make it clear that anxiety is a normal state for me (and probably not a symptom of withdrawal). I'm just an anxious guy - medicating that often drove my drinking. In fact, I think a large portion of what kept me from stopping drinking is that I feared (massively) that I would experience withdrawal which would 1) be dangerous, and 2) reveal me to be the gone-too-far-already alcoholic that I feared I was.

My last drink was Sunday afternoon, I was out with a friend for some afternoon drinks and came home around 3 o'clock and took a nap. I woke up in the evening and felt the telltale twinge of anxiety that would prompt me to get something to drink. But then I thought ""well what if I just didn't?"" I'm not sure why this time it's been easier to follow through on thoughts of quitting, but it was, and I decided to grab the opportunity. I just got home from work, and it's been about 48 hours since my last drink - I was feeling awesome, and especially happy that I haven't had to deal with anything that strikes me as a withdrawal symptom either (I have, I kid you not, been periodically holding my hand level to examine it for any tremors - none so far). I decided to drive that relief home by googling the timeline for alcohol withdrawal. At which point I saw that the ""bad stages"" can start up to 3 days in. Fuck.

So that's where I am now. I want to continue this exercise, and I do not intend to fail, but I am all kinds of nervous. I think I'm worried that I'll wake up tomorrow morning having hallucinations and seizures; which sounds a bit ridiculous, but I suppose anxieties aren't always well-grounded in reality. I think what I'd love to hear that if I'm feeling fine now I'm going to be okay the next few days too. Really I'm just looking for some reassurance that it'll be okay and support in my endeavor.

Four new tires & Firewood. IWNDWYT,"We had a surprise snow storm last night. I have a good amount of firewood to keep warm but I don’t think it will be enough. I’ve ordered a $125 load & will need at least one more. I knew I needed new tires but thought it could wait. That would be a no.. I barely made it up my snow covered, steep, scary when I’m sliding around everywhere driveway this afternoon in my AWD. Got to work & checked my rear tires-zero outside tread. Passed inspection barely but that was 6 months ago. My Mother (I’m 47..) bought those 4 tires for me 2 years ago - cheapest things we could find because I was broke & she was buying them. 

My drinking habit used to cost me $400/month & that was just in daily maintenance. Doesn’t include going out to bars, eating bar food or “special drinking more” occasions (every weekend). 

On my way home I pondered my predicament. Need more firewood & 4 new tires. Now. My bills are all paid till I get paid again. Checked my bank account. I’m not made of money but I make a good living for what I do, where I work & where I live. Above average I’d say & I live alone. Since I quit drinking, I’m not living paycheck to paycheck anymore but have no savings yet. I do have to budget & have been buying all kinds of things I really need & some things I want. Was worried about my newish bill that I just paid for my new Cellular/Wifi router & data plan/new phone/new JBL Bluetooth speaker plan. Except for the phone, those are wants - I can now watch TV, listen to music & use the internet. Couldn’t afford it before I quit drinking. 

I actually have the money to buy 4 new tires (good ones) and get my wood. Right now. When I need it & even after paying that new bill. Gonna call tomorrow & get new tires ordered & get an appointment to put them on. Firewood on the way tomorrow too. 

I’m not sure if I’m tearing up because I’m happy or because I wasted so much money & my Mom always bailed me out when an unexpected expense came up. Probably both but more the latter. I don’t have to call her & ask for help. I can afford the things I need when I need them. I’m so happy not to worry or burden her like that anymore. It’s about dang time. She knows I’ve quit drinking but I’ve never apologized to her for essentially helping me to stay drunk. Think I will do that. She will cry & also have mixed emotions but will mostly be so happy. 

I just wanted to tell someone. Thanks for reading if you did. IWNDWYT

Edit: Thank you so much everyone. Gonna make that call to my Mom tomorrow. I really appreciate your support & I couldn’t have stopped drinking without you all! ❤️",293

Definite habit, definitely a BAD habit, but my actual daily amount is/was pitifully small (usually just 2-3 beers). Unfortunately what I've discovered is that even that tiny amount just doesn't suit me, but that doesn't make kicking the habit any easier. Might be worse, because annoying as it is, there's just not much in the way of super-bad effects, just a list of annoying little things. I've dried out a few times, completely, for weeks to months, and it never really sticks- eventually having a beer with \_\_\_\_\_ just sounds good and over a few months to a year, back the habit crawls. Last time I had any success sticking to it, my process involved participating here, so here I am again.  


Had my last couple of beers ceremony free Christmas Eve, so it's been two weeks. In those two weeks, I haven't snored a breath, the eternal bags under my eyes are receding, my rosacea/ facial redness is all but gone, and I'm letting my baby dose of antidepressant do its thing instead of offsetting it like a dummy, so I'm actually quite happy and way, WAY less irritable than I hadn't realized I was. I talked to my wife a couple nights ago and said, basically, ""I can't swear I'll never drink a drop again, but I'm gonna give drying out completely another good long run and see if I can make it stick better.""

I'm not doing a very good job of it yet.

My husband and I were going to quit on the 2nd.  But then the weekend came and we caved, buying a case of the same lite beer we have been drinking for years.  At least I don't polish off a full bottle of vodka every 2 nights like I did before we switched to lite beer.

But we're both very depressed about losing our last vice.  We quit smoking in October and this was all we had left.  We bought a bunch of flavored carbonated water but...last night I was weak and bought a bottle of champagne.

I actually tried to hoard it to myself and I've literally never hid alcohol from him before.  I'm struggling with his judgmental attitude though.  His tone of voice, his accusing eyes when I fessed up with drink in hand.  I feel like shit but I really thought he'd be more understanding.  After all, I have 'allowed' him to continue smoking cigarillos even though I hate them and I've totally quit smoking.  

We fought over the alcohol last night, he slept downstairs on the couch last night and we haven't spoken in almost 24 hours now.  I've taken loads of breaks from drinking before, and I've always joked about being an alcoholic knowing that I've been able to quit.  But last night proved that I do have a problem and it's absolutely killing me.

Why was I so weak?  Why did I try to hide it?  How sad is that?  But even more, how can I get him to understand how hurtful his judgement was?  If this is how miserable life is all because we can't have our 5 or 6 lite beers every night - then why quit drinking?  I feel like I'm on the verge of just going crazy and buying a shit ton of hard A to keep for myself.  Just to prove to myself that I can do whatever I want.

Sigh.  I feel like a fucking mess.  I just need to vent to a community that might understand because I've never really been here before and I don't know what to do.  Thanks to anyone who read this crap haha.",5

I woke up Monday and barely made it to work then. I felt awful all day and had the sweats. I shuffled through the day and managed to keep some food down.
  I got home after work and it was heartbreaking. My apartment was trashed. Beer, vodka, and wine bottles everywhere. I’m a very clean person, and there was food on my floor and counter. I broke down and cried. Cried like a baby almost the whole time I cleaned.  I’ve been debating for a bit but that broke me. I still feel hungover and it’s Tuesday afternoon.

Too good to be true?,"I stopped drinking around midnight on New Year’s Eve. I’ve struggled with anxiety and panic attacks my whole life. Recently I’d been getting super anxious at work to the point that I felt dizzy and nauseous and had to go home. I also used to have constant indigestion after eating, which contributed to the panic as I have a terrible fear of vomiting, but I haven’t felt it at all for the past three days. 

It was rare to have an entire day of feeling completely relaxed at the office...but I’ve just had two of them in a row!

Am I just extra refreshed from holiday vacation or can the anxiety caused by alcohol really dissipate in just 6-7 days?! Was drinking the main cause of my anxiety all along?

I never drank every day but I was a binge drinker every Friday and Saturday (and some Thursdays) so I really only went 4-5 days between bouts of heavy drinking. It probably wasn’t actually out of my system for more than a day at a time and Mondays and Tuesdays were my worst days for anxiety and panic at the office (I was invariably painfully hungover on Sundays).

I’ve been sober for a month or two in the past but I didn’t have a good therapist at the time and hadn’t done much else to treat my anxiety so I didn’t really notice. This time around I feel alarmingly relaxed. I hope this feeling lasts!",4
2020-01-07 18:01:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eljenx/updates_from_day_10_some_good_some_bad_some_weird/,"Updates from Day 10 - Some Good, Some Bad, Some Weird Realizations","After a few 30 day stints in 2019 I’m back on for 2020 and generally feeling pretty good. Far from perfect, but it’s been a while since I made it to Day 10 and here’s some of what I’m feeling this time:

- The shakiness is gone. One of my biggest problems while drinking was driving, not while drunk, but when starting to feel that 12 hour tic of the start of withdrawals and needing to drive home from work. I’ve literally had to pull over before from anxiety while driving through that, or take a long way home to avoid highways or really anywhere I had to go above 40 mph. This isn’t my first run so I knew it would get better, but I drove myself to an appointment this morning and had zero driving anxiety. If I don’t have to be whispering Hail Mary’s through an afternoon 15 minute drive home, that’s reward enough in itself!

- I threw up today, but for the first time in a long time I know solidly it wasn’t from alcohol. I had a bad reaction to a new medication I was put on this week (unrelated to alcohol). It wasn’t pleasant, but it was nice to know it wasn’t from downing two bottles of wine last night and to just learn the lesson I need to take it on a full stomach, without questioning if it was the meds or a hangover.

- I’ve always been an enabler, and I realized I still am. Something to work on. A friend recently messaged about how he was getting some drinks at the movie theater bar, and how there was a limit of 3 drinks. My response? “Well down three drinks at the bar, then get three more from your server once you take your seat in the theater!” I’ve always been “that guy” trying to encourage everyone to drink more. And now it upsets me when people do it to me, yet I’m still here doing it to others for some semblance of fitting it. Thinking about my responses and encouraging others’ drinking while I’m also judging them for it a bit is something I’ll be working on as I try to readjust my social expectations.

- Speaking of being social, I noticed on New Years that I’m fine being around other people drinking. If anything it kind of bolsters me not wanting to have that dazed out look in my eyes. But, after a few hours of it when everyone else is drunk, it starts to be a little less fun and more like baby sitting. The first few hours I had a great time, playing games, socializing, just catching up. But by midnight I was over being surrounded by a bunch of slurred words and sloppy people. It’s probably also going to change how I socialize, but sometimes seeing it in others and thinking “I don’t know how many times I’ve been that guy, but I don’t want to be” helps to drive me a little more.

- Wine shits are real my friends. I think it was around Day 6 I had a real, normal bathroom experience and I was fucking heavenly.

- At the doctor I got to hit the box for “ex-drinker” today. I waffled a little (will I still maybe have wine sometimes?), and I think previously that’s absolutely what I would have hit, but I felt a solidarity today with being sober that hasn’t felt real before. I know it’s only the beginning, but I feel a lot more resolved this time than I ever have before. It won’t always be the case, but I think so far I’ve made some good changes and I feel confident that 2020 is going to be my best, most sober year yet!

Anyway, just some jumbled thoughts. Thanks everyone for your encouragement; reading your posts keeps me going when I feel spent and restless. IWNDWYT!",12

Yesterday I read this passage from VALIS by Philip K. Dick and it seemed very interesting to me. This morning I went to an AA meeting and I realized why: the experience of anhedonia/disillusionment (nothing is fun or meaningful or happy) that I have been feeling is very real. Not only because I’ve been numbing myself with alcohol, but because I’ve been actively destroying myself to feel a sense of control. Giving myself an excuse not to try. I could easily drink myself to death in the struggle to escape my own feelings of existential dread and helplessness. From small things like not being able to control alcoholism (so I binge drink and make the question irrelevant) to less tangible things like struggling to cope with my mortality or feelings of impotence.

Even sometimes the disease itself can be a crutch, something for us to focus on. I don’t really have a relationship with a “higher power” yet (I’m only a week sober...hopefully it will come) but I really feel like this seems to hit the nail on the head re: admitting we are powerless. 

Anyway, I thought you might enjoy. I apologize in advance for the wall of text; I transcribed it as it is written (no paragraph breaks.)

IWNDWYT 

——————


“In his study of the form that masochism takes in modern man, Theodor Reik puts forth an interesting view. Masochism is more widespread than we realize because it takes an attenuated form. The basic dynamism is as follows: a human being sees something bad which is coming as inevitable. There is no way he can halt the process; he is helpless. This sense of helplessness generates a need to gain some control over the impending pain—any kind of control will do. This makes sense; the subjective feeling of helplessness is more painful than the impending misery. So the person seizes control over the situation in the only way open to him: he connives to bring on the impending misery; he hastens it. This activity on his part promotes the false impression that he enjoys pain. Not so. It is simply that he cannot any longer endure the helplessness or the supposed helplessness. But in the process of gaining control over the inevitable misery he becomes, automatically, anhedonic (which means being unable or unwilling to enjoy pleasure). Anhedonia sets in stealthily. Over the years it takes control of him. For example, he learns to defer gratification; this is a step in the dismal process of anhedonia. In learning to defer gratification he experiences a sense of self-mastery; he has become stoic, disciplined; he does not give way to impulse. He has *control*. Control over himself in terms of his impulses and control over the external situation. He is a controlled and controlling person. Pretty soon he has branched out and is controlling other people, as part of the situation. He becomes a manipulator. Of course, he is not consciously aware of this; all he intends to do is lessen his own sense of impotence. But in his task of lessening this sense, he insidiously overpowers the freedom of others. Yet, he derives no pleasure from this, no positive psychological gain; all his gains are essentially negative. 

(Continued on a different page)
“In summary [...] the modern-day masochist does not enjoy pain, he simply can’t stand being helpless.”

I'm doing Dry January... It's been OK so far. But tonight for some reason I am feeling the craving. But I'm definitely not going to drink, alcohol at least.

I already smashed 2 litres of cola over the past two evenings...
I kept seeing 'La Croix' mentioned on this sub so I looked it up. I don't think we have it here (UK) but I found something that looks similar called Ugly. Sugar and sweetner free flavoured sparkling water. So I ordered some and it should arrive tomorrow. Hopefully keep me from consuming a litre of Coke a day.

With regard to the cravings, I like to imagine at times like these, when you can feel the resistance, that the habit/addiction/whatever you want to call it is really taking a pounding. It's crying out.

So tomorrow perhaps I will wake up with a big chunk smashed out of my drinking obsession.

I am so happy to accomplish something that, for a while, I was pretty damn afraid of. I was afraid of being the “sober guy”. I was afraid of changing or eliminating something that was intrinsically a part of me and had been a part of me for years. It was that same anxiety that I felt every day when traffic or a slow checkout line delayed my first drink but instead it stretched on forever. I felt like I was procrastinating like I would back in school. There was this looming deadline that was coming up, but I didn’t know what day or week or month it was due. But it probably wouldn’t be years. I could feel that. I could see it in my face in the mirror every shitty morning.

I used to get annoyed about some things people would say to me about my drinking when I was at my worst. I had people compliment my tolerance like it was something to be proud of, but inside, I’m thinking, ""You think this is fun for me?” At the same time, I was petrified of someone bringing up my drinking. I had two friends mention something to me on separate occasions, but both were speaking about a third person. “So-and-so is drinking everyday now. They can’t keep that up forever…” I probably need to thank those people.

I’m sad that I let so many friendships die. I think I was afraid when friends started moving off to different cities and moving on to different lives. I clung to the thing I thought was the constant in all our great times together. It’s like I was holding onto the sinking ship when everyone else was floating away in other boats. I would avoid social situations if I couldn’t drink. Hell, towards the end, I rarely went anywhere except my regular bar or my back porch where I had my ritual (laptop, drink cup, and cigarettes). I’ve rekindled some friendships just through texting every once in a while. I’m making plans to travel to see people later this year. I’m looking forward to that.

More happy stuff. I’ll try to focus on that. Not only in this post, but in life in general. I’ve lost weight. About 50 lbs. When I first quit, I was eating whatever I wanted to keep from getting bored. About six months ago I started tracking what I ate and working out again. I’m back in clothes from high school (the same size anyway). I’ve started to tell people that I’m boring whenever they ask what I’ve been up to. It’s true, I guess. I wake up and go to work (on time now), workout when I get home, cook, eat, and sleep. But I don’t mind boring. It’s peaceful. I still get sad or lonely. The difference is now I don’t send a drunk text of a link to whatever Youtube video I’m watching. Instead, I’ll send a text just asking how someone is doing. Now that I think about it, they might still think I’m drunk, but fuck it, whatever.

I guess I should end with something for people who are thinking of going sober. First, thanks for reading this far. I appreciate it. If someone else out there is feeling the anxiety and fear of what life would be like after quitting, it’s better in my opinion. I hope that my post helps someone who shares similar feelings or experiences and gives them the assurance to move forward. I was lucky enough to have a couple people who shared similar experiences, and those shared experiences helped me make the decision. I figured I should pay it forward. Thanks again, and I wish the best of luck to everyone.",178

This was while I was ""moderating"". I got off of work early that day. If you remember my last post, I get faced with a question at the end of every shift. 

""Want a shift drink?""

I said yes. It was just a white claw and cranberry juice! Everyone was making fun of me and telling me to 'drink a real drink'. That white claw was a world away from my old whiskey ginger I used to drink. They'd be at least 5 oz of whiskey too. I'm not exaggerating. We always said ""If you've had one, you've had two"". Basically, I felt that this white claw was a good middle ground. I was wrong.

I drank 2 white claws. Left my job feeling fine. Decided to go to the market near my house. Once I got there, I felt very out of it. It was almost surreal. I was in this place where I'm normally stone sober, but i was kind of tipsy. It wasn't fun. Almost annoying honestly. I kept accidentally hitting people with my basket. Fumbled over my words with the cashier. Whatever. I was on my way home.

I had my headphones in. I was walking. It was dark. It was also a Friday. Not saying this person was a drunk driver, but their lights weren't on. Long story short, I got hit by a car. I was fine. Kind of scraped up, but I'm a touch bitch. However, my precious phone was not. It was shattered. I cried in the street. That phone was a gift to myself for making it 30 days alcohol free. It was the nicest phone I've ever had. And it was gone. Because I decided to drink 2 white claws. I didn't even have it 2 months.

Even after that, I thought moderation was ok. What a crazy drug alcohol is. The bottom is where you stop digging. I'm done digging. That was November, and I have since ordered and received my new phone. I'm charging it for the first time right now. I ordered it as a prize for making it 7 days, and also as a reminder. Every time I use my phone, I'll think about how upset I was. How those 2 white claws were NOT worth ANY of the emotions I felt, not to mention the money I spent.

I woke up to see Mr. Depression waiting patiently next to my alarm clock helping me hit the snooze button, he's quite nice that way.

He helped me decide to put off a bunch of work for another time and to cancel plans that seemed rather disruptive--he cleared my schedule, as the kind soul does when he visits.

But, I know that the more I let him help, the more I'll put off and the longer he'll stay. The only way to get him on his way is to break the schedule he's made for me.

I went out.

A social bowling league was starting, I've never done a league but why not? Plus, it should be fun.

Suddenly Mr Depression was there, in my lane. Just he and I and some strangers. He was kind enough to order a beer for me. It had been 3 years, but what the hell. Have 2.

Go home, have another. And another.

I remember beer making me feel better. Instant relaxation at the pop of the cap or crack of a can. The taste. Mr Depression even assured me as much. It did at first, but quickly went sideways. 

After 3 years, 4 drinks was enough to give me a hangover and fog up the memory of a conversation I had with my wife--amatuer hour.

I'm ashamed. But, I realize that the drink didn't do its job, it made it worse. Instead of feeling better and seeing Mr depression on his way, he is still sitting here in my home office with me.

I'm working it out. But at least it's crystal clear what does not work.

I am contemplating taking action in one way or another to adress the issue of alcohol in my life. However, I'm just not sure what could be the best for me. Cutting down / moderation or quit ?

I have been on dry runs before but it seems it always come back. I'll have just ONE beer and next thing you know it's 3 or 4.

Recently, I have been experiencing memory losses when drinking, something that did not happen before. It is very scary waking up the next day wondering if I did something bad or not. I have also lost my balance and fell down. Embarassing stuff really. I have sprained my ankle the other night and I have no idea how it happened. That's next level and it is serious enough that I need to do something about it.

On a side note, I've come to realization that all this time I wasn't drinking to relieve stress, I am a drunk because I refuse to face issues or take responsibility of things and such. I guess it's not fun and all; it maybe is easier to hide behind the dullness, but it doesn't change anything outside it but makes it worse.

I've read a lot of stories here that all sound the same. Come out of drinking to these shitty circumstances some, if not most end up badly (divorces, getting fired). But all in all we were all hiding behind alcohol suppressing everything, and slowly building the issues to more serious degrees requiring more alcohol.

2020-01-07 11:45:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ele0it/some_things_ive_learned_over_the_last_month_or_so/,Some things I've learned over the last month or so,"I have been sober for over 30 days. When I first started out I wasn't sure how I was going to make it through the first weekend, or the next one after that. I didn't even want to stop drinking when I first started to stop drinking. I was desperate to find a new way to cope with the sadness of life other than alcohol. So on 6 Dec 19 I attended my first AA meeting. I've been reading the big book and attending meetings every once in a while and I've learned some things I'd like to share with this community.

Firstly I have learned that Alcohol is a liar. I was using it to wash down and bury my sorrows all the while thinking it was helping. It did help, until it didn't (I hear this same theme over and over again within our community). Eventually I just broke down and cried every time I drank. I hated myself even more when I was drunk than I did when I was sober. When I began the uphill journey towards constant sobriety, the memory of alcohol kept telling me, ""Hey, is it too hard? That's ok, I can help. Remember?"" But this was a lie, alcohol doesn't help, it buries a volcano, and laughs when it boils over and explodes in your face. Like a demented friend.

I have learned that unlike the court ordered and some other lucky attendees of AA, I did not HAVE to reach the rock bottom of life in order to realize and make a change. This concept in the big book is called ""the ability to moderate"" and it has been confusing for me. I believe I can moderate (this may or may not be true), which leads me to the next thing I learned.

There is a struggle that a lot of alcoholics have faced and I have faced it as well, and that is the desire to make alcohol consumption ""Fit"" back into place. It's the idea that THIS TIME, I'll really get the hang of it. THIS TIME I'll be able to drink and it won't be a problem. Through this, I have learned that even if I could moderate (like I believe I can), it would *most likely* lead toward a path of depression and suffering.

I have learned that sleep is so much more rewarding when I am sober. On top of more impactful sleep, I also get to sleep at more responsible times. I used to stay up and drink just because I thought I deserved to feel drunk because I had worked hard that day. That leads to a very miserable morning and day at work.

Life experiences can bring great pain and trauma. They did for me. For me my experiences were so unbearable, the future so sad, that I wanted to not think about it. So what I did was spend 8 years drinking to get drunk almost every day so that I could forget the pain. I have learned that you don't actually forget it, you just put it somewhere hard to find. AND when you put it all somewhere hard to find for 8 years, it gets found. I found it, and I named it The Sads. The Sads come back when your sober, or when you're drunk. They come back when you're having a bad day, or when your walking in the park and you see a child handed a balloon. The Sads come back when you get a headache, or when your partner kisses you. They come back when you're driving your car or when you're doing the dishes. I learned that it wasn't the alcohol that made the Sads and it wasn't the alcohol that brought them to the foreground whenever i brushed my teeth. It was Life that brought the Sads. I just used alcohol to bury them because it hurt so bad. Now that I am sober, it hurts really bad, but it doesn't hurt any worse than the last few times I was drunk. It's just that now I don't have a ""medicine"" to help wash it down. It's like quitting caffeine, you're gonna have headaches that you can't get rid of for the first 2 weeks (because headache medicine uses caffeine), but after that you will feel much better. I have concluded that sobriety is going to hurt for a while (A few introspective others at AA meetings have told me the same thing), but it will be worth it to find proper healing.

And Finally, I have learned that I can always drink tomorrow, but I will not drink with you today.",21

I used to have healthy habits and was in excellent shape. Today I look like shit. I haven't hit the gym in months. I can hardly summon the will to get up in the morning, much less work out.

I suppose alcohol helps me not think about all the problems I need to deal with. They feel so overwhelming I don't know where to start, but I think the first step is stopping with the alcohol. I'm to the point where I can put away an astonishing amount of whiskey at night and not even feel drunk - I just feel good and safe.

In my 40s I hated my job, had no dating prospects, drank to blackout at least once a week, and lost all my ambition to improve my lot.

I found a great new job in a new state. It was terrifying leaving the support networks I had at home to a place where I knew only a couple of people. Since I didn't have a busy social calendar, I focused on improving myself. Hit the gym regularly, concentrated on doing my job well, and learned small new healthy habits like routinely taking care of my fingernails instead of tearing them off leaving them dirty and gross. I got off of dating apps partially because going out on drunk dates was part of my old habit. It all seemed pretty mundane for quite a while and I was wondering if my new sober life would  be dull while remaining healthy and safe.

Though my new coworkers never knew drunk me, they often comment how healthy I seem and how much I'm killing it at work. I got a promotion already. I've picked up the old hobbies that I'd lost interest in and they seem fresh and new again. A friend introduced me to a terrific lady and now we are in a great relationship. She rarely drinks and appreciates having a sober guy. She told me that right away she positively observed my clean fingernails. My life is so much better now and began a slow fall into place once I made the decision to improve myself.

All the little positive changes work together to improve one's life. Stopping drinking is the big one, and not worrying about anything but improving myself supported the changes. 

At parties friends talk about how great drinking is but privately some of them tell me they wish they could quit too. I never want to go back there and remain vigilant that I could slip anytime. I relapsed before and it is an ever present danger. However the more I distance myself from it, the less the chance of taking that first sip. It took a while but I stayed the course and have no desire to get off it again.

Since becoming sober 193 days ago, I have learned a lot about myself. About my strength, my beliefs, how I love hard and defend those around me. Some of these things I knew to an extent about myself but they became blinding in sobriety. 

In regards to the group, it started out to be a fun release about cute first interactions with people and if they were gonna make it. It turned into a lot of male bashing. I am well aware some men need to be bashed, but not every one, every time. 

I posted my opinion that someone had overreacted to a situation. I was met with anger. Several people took time out of their day to let me know that I’m a shitty person, a pick me bitch, should be someone different. To name a few. 

I don’t want to be someone different. I want to be this independent, sober person that I have become. 

I would have used this stupid situation in the past as a reason to crack a bottle open. But I will not today. Someone’s opinion of me is not worth getting drunk.

Then they actually did it and found out they could only last say 40 seconds.

Then later in the day the researchers would ask them how long they could keep their hands in the bowl and again they would say 60 seconds!

Scientists call this they “empathy gap” where you can’t actually remember how bad something made you feel in the past. You lack empathy to your previous self.

Of course I started banging my head when I heard this shouting :”That’s just like me with hangovers ”.

The last few years things changed and I dread going to work every single day. I’ve always drank, but the last few years I’ve fallen in to a deep hole with alcoholism and depression because I dread every day that I’m alive and have to go to the place I loathe every day. I make pretty good money here which is why it’s so hard to leave and find a new job and I recently got married so I’ve got more than my self to pay bills for. Every day I would use alcohol to the point I could hardly remember where I worked or who I am. 

Well... I finally decided it’s time to make some changes. The first step for me to find a new career is to stop drinking. I’m proud I even made it 5 days! I do feel a bit better. 

This morning was particularly rough. I talked to the wife last night about a strategy to get me out of this workplace. She tries to tell me I need to stay here at least another 5 years so we can build up more money and has no respect for my new plan to get out. It kind of pissed me off because she’s out living her dream job making 1/10 of my salary. I don’t think she has a right to tell me what to do like that when she’s not concerned about making money herself. Apparently that’s only my job in the relationship. Last night she basically told me to quit my bitching and go buy booze. Which I didn’t. 

This morning it hit me - I can’t possibly live this life another 5 years. I already have suicidal thoughts almost every day. I leave in the morning angry and I come home angry. I have a strong mind and am aware of negative thoughts and push them away, but I’m afraid I can’t keep this up for 5 more years. I’m afraid suicide will catch me some day and apparently I can’t count on my wife for support. Guess I’m doing this alone and I’ll prove her, my family and the world wrong! 

I just needed to let this out. I really appreciate this community. Much love",13

2020-01-07 08:12:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/elbdjc/book_movie_tuesday/,Book & Movie Tuesday,"Good morning Sobernauts! Or good afternoon as the case may be-- I'm a little late today. Hope the new year is treating you well. For those who are new, let me introduce you to our weekly book and movie thread where we discuss what we are reading or watching that is helping us with sobriety.  You’re also very welcome to discuss what music or podcasts or TV shows you are finding helpful. OR-- feel free to just shoutout some show or whatever that isn’t maybe relevant to sobriety but you are just plain loving it. 

If you’re new and looking for books on getting sober, I have a few suggestions. Probably the 2 most popular among the SD community are William Porter’s *Alcohol Explained* and Annie Grace’s *This Naked Mind*. I have not read *Alcohol Explained* (yet) but I did read TNM a little over 2 years ago when I first started this journey and I did find it helpful. My personal favorites, however, are Judith Grisell’s *Never Enough* (which I raved about for several months in this thread last year) and Russel Brand’s *Recovery: Freedom from Our Addictions*.

Both of my 2 favorites are not just about alcohol but rather are about addiction in general. These 2 clicked with me personally the most. *Never Enough* is by a neurobiologist who explains in layman’s terms what is happening to an addicted brain and though I’d read many similar books and articles over the years, somehow this one explained it best for me and the chapter on alcohol was particularly insightful. Helps that the neurobiologist author is an addict who got sober herself. She has a dry wit that makes the book pleasant to read and she's very sympathetic to addictions sufferers as she’s experienced it first hand.

*Recovery* is by Russel Brand, who I knew had been in recovery for years himself but I thought him too big a goofball to have any special insights. However, he surprised me with this book. In it he talks about how the 12 steps can be helpful to just about anyone who finds his or her self with any sort of addiction. I will add here that I have never gone to an AA meeting and still have no plans to. Yet I found it comforting and helpful and just an all-round good read. I was reading that one when I was about 10 months sober and at a real make-or-break type point where the seriousness of a permanent sober existence really hit me hard. It’s as if I had been separated from a horrible but sexy spouse for 10 months and was realizing that I was going to have to sign the divorce papers. It had become terrifyingly real. That’s not why I picked up the book per se, but it’s what I happened to be reading around then and it was there for me at just the right time. 

So how are you guys starting your new year? Any great new finds or old favorites you want to recommend?",21

He basically doesn't like me after we lived together and I was drinking and doing other things too much. Did a few questionable things I'm not proud of but I've made that up with the people that where involved.

I moved out as it was such a horrible environment to live in and I'd just started seeing this girl. I ended up moving into somewhere that isn't ideal, and it made my depression much worse.

None of my friends stood up for me because they're scared of his reaction. I just want my old life back. Or atleast to be able to go and hang out with the few friends I have left. 

I left him the flat ffs and left the area. At the time it seemed like it was a good idea as I was around to many people getting wasted on the estate. Cutting myself off now seems like it was a bad idea.

I've stopped getting trashed. I've tried to make ammends. He refuses to talk to me at all, I didn't realise he would sucker punch me twice though

**Thee and me**

Waxing gibbous, waning repetitious

No one wants to talk to two drunks

Slumped by moonlight 

Outside the gaping entrance maw

Of this concrete fronted liquor store


&nbsp;


Here by Christmas bottle we have fallen

Breath by brandy and stolen stollen

Whiskers crumbed, lips salt baked 

With whatever drool did sake

That raging thirst we feigned, we faked


&nbsp;


Did I tell you the one about? 

Yes you did, Joe, on your fourth or fifth go, 

With pretzels used as stencils, your fingers trembling

You marked out the passage of your life

The bar top loss of your home, your job, your wife


&nbsp;


And you, John, why did your mother not save you? 

Could not your father, brother, sister, friend, 

All keep you from this sodden end? 

Nah, naw, pal, see, jus' let them be 

The only one who raised the glass was me


&nbsp;


And now it's late...

So cover us under festive skies

Upon this bench where we will lie

Us slatted sots for ever more

Mom was an alcoholic who relapsed in my late 20s, and I remember thinking “thank god I am not like that.” Well here we are. The funny thing is, I don’t consider myself your run of the mill alcoholic, but yet I am. Not a blackout drunk. Never lose my stuff. Never had a DUI. Never drunk dialed an ex. Rarely regret my actions the next day when the scaries set in. Own a business. Go to school full time with a 4.0. Can drink a bottle of wine and sometimes another two beers with only a slight hangover in the morning. 

Gained 40 pounds over the last 6 years due to increased boozing, deal with daily acid reflux, stomach problems, psoriatic arthritis, fibromyalgia, depression, anxiety, etc etc etc. No energy to workout if I’ve already picked up the bottle, no energy to leave the house if I’ve already had a glass of wine, no energy to hang out with friends, or go to the store. Thank god for grocery delivery. 

The other thing is, I do eat really healthy, I have never touched drugs, hell I don’t even drink caffeine or take ibuprofen unless absolutely necessary, but I can drink a bottle of wine and still hold a conversation, I can drink a bottle of wine and get up in the morning and work a full day and see multiple clients, I can drink a bottle of wine and show up to my 8am class to take an exam, I can run my errands in the morning and keep my house spotless, I can remember birthdays and anniversaries, I can help my family with their needs, I can go on dates with my husband, but I always drink a bottle of wine when I get home and turn into a couch sloth who blocks out the outside world.

My partner is super judgmental of me all the time when I drink, whether it’s one drink with dinner, or several with our friends at a party. He stopped drinking around me unless we are with friends, which I don’t really care about, but will go get hammered with his friends without me and feel like shit for two days, and that’s completely okay. 

Now that I’m doing dry January, he’s been really condescending and more or less doesn’t think I can do it. It makes me feel like crap. I tried to talk to him tonight about my emotions and triggers and how I was trying to psychologically understand my addiction issues, especially regarding stress and my family trauma, and he cut me off and shut me down, and made me feel like a complete fuck up addict, then said he couldn’t believe how much my mother drank (its own issue). I can’t really talk about this with anyone else, and it really hurt and made me feel like I can’t trust him with my most painful issues. 

He’s not a bad person. I just wish he was more sympathetic. 

Anyway, I wanted wine tonight, but I’m drinking cbd soda. Just needed to send this out into the ether. Iwndwyt",5

Anyway long distance bf of 8 years.  Only get together every other month so most communication on phone.  He's an extrovert,  could talk for hours about anything.  Im the complete opposite. It's usually fine because I like to hear what he has to say and I'm good at asking questions, being interested, etc. I listen all about his life even if it's not something otherwise interesting to me. So he's the opposite in that he doesn't ask me questions, half the time I feel he's probably not even listening.  So he could tell I was really struggling with my drinking Oct/Nov (and basically for 6 years), but we don't really talk about it.  At most if we talk and he can tell I'm drinking he might ask if I have been and say I need to get it under control (he doesn't drink). So I went to visit over New Year's and I kind of wanted to talk to him and tell him I stopped on Christmas day and was feeling positive about change this time,  but I never really felt like having that conversation.  He didn't say anything until I was getting ready to catch my flight and he said ""We never talked about your drinking."" Fast forward to today I started a part time job today (in addition to my full time) and I tried to call him as I was driving from one to the other and he didn't answer so I texted I was going to my 2nd job. So he knew I was going because he replied he had been showering and asked if I was there yet.  After the new job I called him and all he did was talk about his things and not ask about my first day. It wasn't until I called a couple of hours later to say goodnight and when he could probably tell I was annoyed and we were about to hang up when he said ""you didn't tell me about your job."" So am I being petty thinking he should ask because I would have immediately asked if roles were reversed,  or should I just put things out there and not wait to be asked. The problem is I'm sensitive (overly, I know) and it happens somewhat often that I am enthusiastic about something and tell him and he doesn't pursue the topic or ask further questions and my feelings get hurt.  Anyway as far as drinking I was worried thre first day back to work after the holidays plus first day at a new job would make me want to drink, and while the thought entered my mind,  it was fairly easy to resist!",2

I’ve been drinking most nights here on the clock for the last few years now.  I was a little worried it would be triggering as it’s been a major trigger for awhile now, but ultimately going in today I was confident in my resolve.  

I wasn’t here long before the bullshit started piling up, like it always does.  I started feeling the craving, bad.  Didn’t want to go get lunch, because that’s normally when I would pick up a case, but I had no choice as I didn’t have food with me.  

I didn’t trust myself leaving, I had the internal struggle the whole time I was in the car, same internal back and forth I’ve had with myself countless times, normally losing to my sub-conscious and the voice of my addiction.  

But tonight...tonight I came out on top.  I pulled into the parking lot of the same nearby gas station I’d go to almost every night, and this time, I just didn’t get out of the car.  I just sat there, and kept telling myself not to get out of the car, that I was safe in the car.  Riddled with anxiety, fidgety and shaky, mind racing, grasping for any rationalization it could.  But atleast for tonight I was right, I was safe in my car.  I was probably in that parking lot a good 15 minutes or so before regaining composure, showed back up to work several minutes late, but atleast I returned sober.",14

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I got it given to me on my way out of work to my car and took it home last night. I could have thrown it or given it away to someone on the street straight away. I haven’t touched it, though I thought about it. In the end I had a great sense of satisfaction going to sleep without touching it and waking up sober. Waking up with no dread feeling of why did I undo all the good work, and with nothing to hide.
What helped me was remembering the desire I have been building to be truthful. To not do things I can’t be truthful about. Alcohol abuse showed me to be a liar and someone lacking integrity even when not drinking I could do things I wouldn’t be willing to openly admit. That me would have happily drunk the Moët and chucked the bottle and told no one and pretended nothing happened. That type of behaviour degraded my sense of who i was and what I stood for. I was empty, trying to fill a void and didn’t stand for much.
I am happy to feel there is some improvement. I can’t say I’ve turned things around because a big part of me was tempted, the old imagining was there, but a new voice of some kind helped me stay strong to my aim... making truth my reality. 
Now... gonna get rid of that bottle as soon as I can. I’ve learnt something, no need to tempt fate any longer.

Saw someone post about dry January a while back and My lady and I are giving it a go... some early thoughts from a bartender.,"We drink *a lot* out of boredom. But now that it’s out of the equation we’re finding a lot of things to do besides drinking. (I have a pretty large bar collection at out house so it’s kind of just always around.) we’re taking the dogs on long walks/ runs. Rearranging the living room. Cleaning the place up. Yard work. Cleaning our cars. Working out in the home gym. Binging Netflix. It’s been really fun and productive! And the sex has been great!!

Having no drinking as a hard rule is so much easier than “just trying time cut back some.” The matter always means one drink turns into three. 

I’m sleeping like a dream and waking up early / on time much easier. No day long hangovers or spending all day on a couch feeling horrible and sorry for myself. 

Finding slot of camaraderie amongst friends and other bartenders that are doing dry January. I’m fact the other night I went to visit a friend at his work and a coworker asked if I’d like a drink. I told him what was going on and he was like no shit! Me too! I’m fact he had done five months sober last year and was looking forward to doing a dry January this year as well. It’s much better to have some people around that are in it with you, so I can really see the value in forums like this and IRL support groups. 

Hope you are all doing well and thank you for putting the idea in my head.

2020-01-06 20:42:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/el45gh/5_days_blood_pressure_question/,5 days - blood pressure question...,"Hey everyone!

I wanted to let you all know I'm 5 days sober! I just turned 26. I've been drinking daily since I turned 21. Anywhere from 1-4 drinks a night during the week and 6-8 on the weekends. Aside from minor cravings, these 5 days haven't been too bad - thankfully. 

A lot has changed for me in the last few months. I've re-evaluated my drinking (And now i've quit), I quit smoking in September and starting using nicotine gum. I'm still on the gum, but hey - that's not the worst thing. I'm even lifting weights and running a couple miles a day. It's great :)

The reason I've sparked all of this change is because I finally had a checkup with my Dr. last summer - I hadn't been since I was 22 - started drinking at 21. Everything was fine back then. When I saw her this time my blood pressure was 150/80 - which only made me more anxious hearing that. So, I bought a home tester with the arm cuff and checked it every few days before a follow up appointment several weeks later. It was usually normal in the mornings (unless I had more than 1 or 2 drinks, then it was back in the 150s/80s) but would climb throughout the day. I started thinking deeply about this and asked my Dr. what my past checkups showed for BP. Here's the funny thing. When I was 21 - my BP was 100/60. The next year, when I was 22 (had been drinking pretty regularly for about a year at that point) it was 140/80. She didn't bring it up because I was supposed to come back in 60 months for blood work - but I didn't. I started getting self conscious about my health and just said ""fuck it"" until last summer - when I realized I needed to go get a checkup.

So here's my question, how long before your blood pressure dropped, if it did? I checked mine this morning and it was 135/85, and the other day it was 145/90. I do use nicotine, but I have been since I was 15 - and my BP never seemed to be an issue until a year after starting drinking @ 22 years old. I have very minor anxiety - I have my whole life, but I think the drinking has exacerbated the anxiety. It's never been bad enough to actually cause chronic hypertension. 

What should I expect in the next month or so? Thank you for all of your kind words and influence to get me going in the sober direction!",4

Now the next day, I'm having a great day but all of a sudden I want to have a glass of whiskey for no good reason. I'm pretty sure that one night was a mistake. Maybe I'm just craving cause I know I've got a month to go. Either way though I'm addicted.

&#x200B;

I am 25(M) and began abusing alchohol since the age of 17. Countless blackout nights, many mistakes made. Lots of morning after shakes and trembling. I knew 1 month ago that if I did not stop my excessive consumption of alchohol, death would soon follow. It was like an epiphany that came to me during mediation, I'm not that spiritual but I do beleive this may have been a higher power trying to save my life.

&#x200B;

1 month later, I am more productive than I ever have been my whole life, Old hobbies are starting to interest me again, depression and anxiety is fading away and I now realize what I thought was helping with anxiety (alchohol) is what actually gave me anxiety in the first place and progressively made it worse. I'm so happy i found the strength to give it up, and I will never look back.

&#x200B;

There has definitely been some damage done however to my brain and body that I can't help but notice unfortunately, I'm not sure if the damage is permanent or it will heal but I'm gonna look on the bright side and be thankful that at least I did not let it get any worse. If anyone out there is reading this, please you just need to start now, forget about your friends, those social events or whatever, your life is really on the line and you are the only one who can save yourself. There are also many replacements for alchohol for people who need to cope with extreme social situations such as propranolol, phenibut etc.

The temptation will be there at social events, but my mantra is always this: never have I regretted not drinking. And it's true, I never have. Drinking, on the other hand... I regret every time.

Two days ago I decided I'm going to go for it. I would like to live a more spiritual life and feel you cannot do that whilst continuing to consume the juice. I no longer enjoy drinking and I've witnessed the damage it causes. It has had an impact on my productivity and has caused me to act foolishly and hurt people in the past (near enough every major mistake I've made can be linked to alcohol although the frequency of this has decreased over the years). In addition I believe that there is no benefit to drinking and have come to view the substance (or at least the state of consciousness it manifests) as bordering upon, if not fully evil.

I still have some alcohol in my home and I don't know what to do with it, so I'm wondering whether it is unethical to give it away to friends. Near enough every person I've seen drinking appears to be suffering somehow. There is an air of sadness around them that they don't seem to admit and I'm unsure whether it is right to fuel their own drinking by providing alcohol for them. But on the other hand giving it to them will save them money as they'd only go an buy some at some point anyway. I don't know whether I'm just projecting my own negative views of alcohol on them anyway, for all I know this air of sadness could be a construct of my own mind and they could actually be living their best life.",3

You were right, something was going on. I've been working through some heavy ass depression, but worse than that: I'm an alcoholic. It's completely taken over my life and negatively effecting everything. 

It's ruined jobs, friendships, romantic relationships, my relationship with myself, absolutely everything.

Austin, I am so, so sorry I let it effect you. I'm sorry it took me months to offer any sort of explanation. I'm sorry I'm still not brave enough to call you and say those words in person, even though it's not face to face.

I miss you. And I'm sorry I let you down.

What used to be a fun pursuit for me is now getting in the way of my goals and aspirations. I’ve spent far too much money on something that I’ve nothing to show for, nor enjoyed. I left university 18 months ago and have taken up exploits in theatre, comedy, and sport, as well as a part time degree outside of work. I’ve tried to maintain my drinking ‘hobby’ and it’s destroying me, so it has to go. 

When I used to drink like it was a sport I remember looking at those that didn’t as boring and clueless. Yet, it’s alcohol that makes you boring and clueless. I needed a drug to keep me occupied and to be interesting. That drug happened to cost me a lot of time and money. I was dull and unhappy and I needed an expensive drug to lean on to make social situations bearable. Whether I was drinking at a social occasion was not a question - it was ‘how much am I drinking?’.  How boring is that?! At university I was the life and soul and was known for being loose. Yet, I’ve nothing to show for those experiences I had, and I feel quite embarrassed about it in hindsight.

When I was a proper drinker, I would look at people who had hobbies like: reading, jigsaw puzzles, dancing, walking etc. as dull and out of touch. Yet, now I have cut down significantly, my perception is so different. I have all of those hobbies now, and they’re significantly more enjoyable than drinking ever was. The boring conversations are those had at 1:30am in a cheap bar. The clueless people are those spending £70-100 on a night they won’t even remember, paying for it with a crippling headache for days after. Oh the irony of me denigrating others for having traits that I actually possessed.

Just logically speaking, I cannot justify booze anymore.  The smell of alcohol on your breath is unattractive. The anxiety and terrible sleep is unnecessary. The average night experienced with people you barely like is not worth the expense. The shits for days after are disgusting. The empty calories make you needlessly fat. The damaging effect on your skin and life expectancy is not worth it. The blackouts are scary and damaging.  The lack of fulfilment is anxiety-feeling.

I’ve just been having this slow epiphany over the last 6 months, and I think very recently I’ve come to the decision that drinking is an absolute waste of time. I had done 47 days at the back end of 2019, breaking my streak for a friends Christmas party. I’d planned this drinking session and thought i could justify it because of my impressive streak. Yet, I actually hated the night and spent the whole time wishing I hadn’t drunk anything. Its not like I had a massive blackout with this crazy stop-drinking epiphany afterwards. I was in full control, but I just sat there thinking ‘I’m not really enjoying this, and I’m done with drinking now’. I could be literally having the exact same night, just minus all these unnecessary negative consequences.

I’ve read some of your amazing stories on here and I’m so impressed with all your efforts, no matter how far you are along your journey. It’s really helped me come to this realisation and decision. I think that once you’ve admitted you’ve got a problem and can start publicly sharing that, it makes the job of quitting so much easier.",12

I slept like hell last night because of what I know I shouldn't have done, but did anyway. I know there doesn't seem to be any structure to this, I'm just writing as the thoughts come.

At least I have this Day 1.",28

I’m not drinking, nor do I have the desire to today, but I can tell something isn’t right. I feel so full of anger and resentment and I don’t know a safe and healthy way of letting it out. 

I had an argument with my partner earlier that got blown way out of proportion because I was angry and frustrated. She hadn’t done anything wrong. I’m resentful and jealous of the things other people have. I’m beginning to realise how little understanding I had of how much I was hurting others when I was drinking and there isn’t anything I can do to make things better except continue to stay sober as I am doing.

I’m worried I’ve become a ‘dry drunk’, someone who is no longer still in the acute throes of the madness of drink, but who still is a slave to the mentality of it. I don’t want pity, I want help figuring out how to work through this in a sensible and cohesive manner. I know I can’t do it overnight, but I don’t know where to begin. I know I need to find a sponsor and my intention was to ask someone tonight, but he didn’t make it to the meeting. I’ve accepted step one and the fact that I am and always will be an alcoholic, that I have no power over alcohol and my life had become unmanageable, but I don’t know how to get in touch with my higher power (or even what my higher power is). All I’m managing at the moment is vocalising into the void every morning that I need help, and thanking the same void every night before I go to sleep.

I’m full of anger and resentment today. I don’t know how to process or deal with it but I’m beginning to see the flaws in my character. Any advice would be welcome in learning how to come to terms with and deal with them.

But I won’t be drinking today, and I hope you join me in staying sober regardless of what gets thrown your way today, this week or this month. IWNDWYT.",5

I've (25f) struggled with alcoholism for the past 3 years, and within the past almost 6 months found myself going through rehab. I've gotten out in the past 2 months, and been sober for 2 months except for 1 night of drinking shortly after I got out. 

A week after getting checked into rehab, someone else came in named S (40sM), and we instantly connected. He had been into rehab once before, and from the start we helped and supported each other. He was like my protector, goofy older brother, whom I could talk to about anything. Im sure others who have been through an in-patient rehab know the ""unusual friendship pairings"" I am talking about. We would have probably never talked/been such close friends had we not met in such an environment, but we did, and I don't believe I would have been able to have had the confidence or courage to be moving forward the way I am today had it not met him. We would go on an hour walk most everyday in the 2 hours we had between the days groups, and the nighttime dinner/meetings were we talked about everything we were going through. He had me laugh, and believed in me in a time when most of my other loved ones were at the end of their ropes. I loved him, and needed him, and knew the rest of my life he would be someone I could talk to and rely on whenever I needed him. And I would be that for him. I talk some time before I let people into my life in such a way, and he became part of my inner circle. 

We got out of rehab, and went into the same sober living community. Starting around Thanksgiving he started slowly drinking and using again. On Christmas day, he called me wanting to talk about it all, and talking about suicide(something he had longtime struggled with). He'd been drinking though, and was driving, and on the phone with him he got into a car accident, and started raging. He was okay, but after that I told him he had to start getting being true to himself/the program/whatever and until then, I had to put some distance because I couldn't support him while he was drinking. I loved him, would always be there, but he had to start going back to meetings, and stop drinking.

He went to a psych ward, got out, and when he called me said he understood, and wanted to get better. We talked 3 times the week after christmas and on New Years eve. I suspected he may be drinking, but it wasn't so ""bad"" that I called him out, and I was keeping it short anyway because of my suspicions. 

Well yesterday I learned that he was found dead in a hotel room. There was alcohol in the room, and pill bottles. No one really knows what happened. I had been ""preparing"" myself for this the past week after christmas day, but nothing could really prepare me for what is has been like. I have never experienced grief before, and having the added element of substance abuse makes things even harder. My family, and friends have been trying to be supportive, but its ""well he was very sick, this was going to happen"", ""there was nothing you can do"", ""you need to move on like he would have wanted you to"" ect. and thats all fine, but its been just about 24 hours, and I am just sad right now. I was with my other buddies from the rehab last night for dinner/a sleepover to be together and that was great. People that knew the funny, complicated person he was as I knew him. 

But I feel like I'm on a carousel of feelings, and I can't not think about him, and all the things leading up to his death, and our friendship. But most of my loved ones didn't know him, and don't get it. It's like I am expected to be ""fine"" and functioning, but there are points during the day when I just want to lay down in my bed, or go outside and listen to music or just cry and think about him. Already I am feeling judged for my parents, and its like the person I would want to above everyone else is him, and I am just tired. I feel battered. 

&#x200B;

I guess now I am just asking for advice for how I should be feeling or acting right now, or even comment stories. Its like its just been over 24 hours, and its really just starting to sink in for my that I will never hear this person laugh again, or have him say ""how are you doing kiddo?"", but I am being pushed by my parents to move on. And I am just sad right now. I am not planning on sinking into a deep depression, or wallowing for forever, but is a couple days not okay?? Just wanting to share about him, and hear from you guys.",3

It feels like a lifetime ago when i was perpetually anxious, drinking almost every night to some degree, destroying my marriage, worrying my parents, etc. getting arrested for DUIs (yes multiple).

A few glasses of wine could turn into a few bottles of wine, a few beers could turn into a 12 pack and liquor drinks. The end result was almost always the same. Shame. Guilt. Self-doubting. Apologetic. Why can’t i drink like a gentleman? How do my friends drink without going overboard? Why do i always think that i can control it THIS time? 

Everyone’s journey to six hundred something days is different. There is no foolproof plan to get sober. What worked for me may not work for you and vice versa. The goal is to keep trying. Keep committing. Keep changing. Keep seeing what works. Keep seeing what doesn’t. 

I know that if i didn’t have my wife stay sober by my side, my life would be in a complete downward spiral. She helped but i decided. I told myself that i was done. I quit cold turkey. I stopped going to functions that involved heavy drinking. My life improved. My marriage improved. My relationships with my friends changed. They don’t view me as a lush anymore. They view me as an incredible dad and someone that doesn’t drink anymore. I lost touch with some people who’s only commonality with me was binge drinking. I developed stronger relationships with friends who just enjoyed my friendship and presence ex alcohol. 

This past year i bought a house, had my best year at work financially, and was present every single day for my daughter. It keeps me going. It makes it easier to do. Find what works for you and keep at it. You’ll get there. I believe in you stranger. IWNDWYT",7

Had a fantastic weekend de-stressing from work etc and alcohol snuck in.  Sunday night - all my chores were completed, full fridge, clean clothes, clean apartment...and things got very, very quiet at about 6pm.  All the sudden I was here alone in my quiet, dark NYC apartment.  So, I decided to go buy some 'snacks' - and found myself buying a six pack of beer and a pack of cigarettes and staying up until 2am watching nonsense on YouTube.  Then, I tried to sleep (nope) finally drifted off (5am?) and when the alarm went off at six I had to call off work, making up an excuse.  I lied.  I hate that I lied.  I hate it.  I then called a bunch of sober people that I know and love and trust and got a lot of great insight, but the one thing that jumped out at me was my drinking pattern - and it was pointed out to me that I don't plan any social / fun things any more.  I'm either at work, or home 'relaxing...' - HAH.  I never want to drink if I go hang out with friends, get dinner, take a Muay Thai class, hit a meeting...anything social.  But if I spend a ton of time alone, or just going to work - going home - going to work - going home, my subconscious starts to play tricks on me.  I start to have all these thoughts and feelings and before I know it I'm headed to the bar or to the deli - for alcohol.  It's not even really a conscious decision.  There's no joy in it, either.  And I think it starts way before I put my shoes on.  By that time it's too late.  I don't know about you guys but I'm not calling anyone when I'm headed for booze.  By that time, it's too late.

So this morning, hung over and calling work lying about a 'personal issue' (which I detest), was an opportunity for me to pump the brakes.  I'm tired of continually finding myself in front of a fucking beer, like ""what the hell happened?""  Even more than that I'm sick of waking up with shame and guilt and unbelievable anxiety - it's like I'm on another planet today, I don't even recognize who I am or what my thought processes are doing.  So, I hit an afternoon meeting (I have good friends there, and NYC AA can be pretty awesome), and tonight I'm going to either go to Jiu Jitsu or Meditation.  I'm afraid of my thoughts, and to be honest I'm scared of the future, but more than that I'm afraid of ruining my life by drinking and calling in sick to work and losing everything I care about.  I'm at the fork in the road and I see it clearly.  This is it.  It's scary as hell.  So, I'm calling in reinforcements.  I can't do this solo, and what I've been doing hasn't been working at all.  I'm so tired and depressed and blah.  It doesn't need to be this way, right?  This isn't me, this isn't my reality.  I need to break the pattern and move on.  Thanks for reading.",8

2. I was drinking on my own. A lot.

4. I had dispensed with glassware. Hey wine already comes in a bottle. that's glassware. cut out the middle man.
5. I never got hangovers. Because my body was so accustomed to having booze in my system. remember once having a crazy night in New Orleans with colleagues. Tequila etc. Ended up on the mechanical bull. Met in the hotel lobby next morning. Everybody was dying. Except me! I bounced in with a cappuccino. they looked at Mel like I was a super hero.
6. My weed consumption rose in tandem with my drinking. I was using it to revive in the morning. 
7. I was getting sloppy. Losing shit all the time. 
8. Blacking out. Hadn't done that since I was a teenager. it was back.
9. I had become a bloated bastard.
10. I'm Irish. I was attending a sporting event in the UK (live in US and A) with hard partying Irish pals. They looked on in awe as I sank three pints of Motorhead  IPA in twenty minutes at lunchtime. Just to get level. When Irish people comment on how much and how fast you're drinking you might be in trouble.

I wanted to share some additional resources that have helped me. I've been a serial relapser for a few years but damn determined to beat this thing, it's just taken every bone in my body. I can't say anything is forever but I feel more confident than before. So I wanted to share for anyone struggling. Something will click after a while.

I've read This Naked Mind and it's okay as an introduction.

Books (all available as audiobooks!):

* Allen Carr's easy way to control alcohol: talks about identifying and reframing cravings. Repurposed from his quit smoking book.
* The AA Big Book + 12 Steps/12 Traditions (obviously part of AA but may be helpful from a spiritual/""how to live sober"" standpoint. Better for people who hit a rock bottom hard.
* Alcohol Explained by William Porter - very good book that's more scientific in nature than Naked Mind and less anecdotal. Especially for a binge drinker, explains the theory behind why we can't stop in clear terms. Eye opening for me.
* The Blackout Diaries - cringe-worthy and easy to relate to, the story of a drinker in a big city and her slow march toward sobriety
* Alcohol is Sh!t - by Paul Churchill, who made a name with his Recovery Elevator podcast. I'd describe it as somewhere between Naked Mind (more high-level and beginner friendly) and Alcohol Explained (technical) and goes into Paul's story which is quite interesting
* 30 Day Sobriety Solution - consider it structured CBT therapy, with some life coaching, by book. You learn coping mechanisms, envision your future, decide what you don't like about drinking and drunk people in general.

Podcasts

* Seltzer Squad - super informal, 15-20 mins about a weekly topic. A couple of sober women living in the city.
* SoberCast - years and years worth of recorded AA meetings
* The Sober Experiment - a deeper dive into the stories of individuals, more 'emotional', lots of extreme cases
* Recovery Elevator - hour long with a theme at the beginning and then a deep dive into someone's story, usually a younger person, with varied levels of ""bottom""

Movies

* One Little Pill - for those considering the Sinclair Method (using Naltrexone, an opiate blocker, before drinking to curb the 'reward' and unlearn the habit) - should be on Amazon Prime.",7

I don’t know why but I had the feeling that I should update this because one it can also help me. During New Years Eve, I was taken to the emergency room for not just drinking too much alcohol but consuming too much marijuana. I was way too intoxicated where I kept throwing up, my blood pressure going extremely high at times to where my pressure went extremely low to where I almost passed out which did occur a couple times. Throughout my life I’ve had many wake up calls but the problem is, if no one noticed I was looking bad I would’ve kept drinking and smoking and consuming edibles and it could have been worse (take into consideration that on the days before, I would get drunk and high consecutively during the night which may have also played a role to my mishap ). Today, I threw away all the alcohol I had stored and plan to give all my smoking products to my older and mature friends. I took this path because when you’re not sober, you don’t have to feel any type of bad emotion. It numbs the pain and therefore that is why. But that can’t be my bs excuse. I really f***** up. My family found out and now they see me differently so this year, I plan to put my head in the game. I plan to get back into shape ( right after throwing everything, I went for a 5.25 mile run), and plan to earn their trust and respect again. I must become a better person because I believe my purpose is to be successful. I will be coming on Reddit more often to mentally focus myself and not let my temptations get the best of me. For everyone who is also doing this, you are in my prayers all the time and I know we can do this! We are badass! And extremely strong! We must fight to become the best versions of ourselves.

I used to think the world was against me as every time I tried to quit I would instantly have my resolve tested constantly by out the blue and rare occurrences such as invited to special occasions or a family member randomly offering me a full bottle of good whiskey for no reason, or someone buying me tickets to a festival etc etc.

This time was different however; I had a bad spell on alcahol and ruined a long term friendship of mine when I was in a bad place and it gave me the kick up the arse I needed to get myself sorted out. It wasn't easy and I was still tested by these oddly timed occurrences but this time I was able to get a bit more time to prepare myself for it and was also expecting it. I've also been living like a hermit for the past few months which has helped avoid the drinking scene, though I can't and wouldn't reccomend keeping this up some of my other friendships have been dwindling as a result (I think).

Anyway what I really wanted to ask was, does anybody else still get dreams where you end up getting hammered and then feeling the accompanying dread and regret when you realise in the dream that you have let yourself down and fell into old habits? I went through a period maybe a month ago after over 100 days of sobriety where for 3 weeks straight I had those kind of dreams everynight. Its not the worst thing ever and it doesn't bother me really but I've lately started getting these dreams frequently again and was wondering if they ever go away?

Also I never realised my mind was this consumed by alcohol that I dream about it so often. Although I identified as a problem drinker and had great difficulty stopping I never drank daily or got ill from stopping but it seems to me that mentally I was more addicted than I thought?

So, I quit drinking alcohol just over 10 months ago- Feb 24 for personal reasons and I secretly feel more and more amazing as the days go by.

So for as long as I can remember alcohol has been apart of my life. I've always enjoyed having it, I've enjoyed relaxing to having fun and partying, drinking in excess and even binge drinking in my 20s and at times, consistently and nightly. And at any point I never felt like I had a problem. I never felt like it was something I couldn't quit and I never saw myself quitting because it was so apart of who I was. As time went on I started to see my life twisting into something I always said I wouldn't be... Just like everyone one else in my family. So here's some of my story about becoming a better person thus far.

1. Mornings are a thing again.. think about being a kid with Saturday cartoons, having time to do things you want to do... I wanted to pick up meditation: I went in a 10 retreat and started a morning practice. I've wanted to see how my body would look if i started working out: I got a membership at a gym and it's one of the first things I do in the morning. I wanted to meet different types of people then I was used to at bars or clubs: I'm on top of my game at coffee shops and just around running errands.

When I wake up and I feel good I tend to be more social, more of a go-getter an overall happier in my life- I am looking for more meaningful work and daring to take chances that direction that attracts me in life.

2. I stopped making such dumb decisions when I was out socializing or at work or you can just being a good son, brother or partner. I've done a lot of dumb things in my life and usually when alcohol is involved they were a lot worse. since I've cut out the booze I still make them decisions but they're not anywhere close to how dumb that used to be with alcohol.

3. Clarity. There is a whole other level of perceiving and problem solving that came with not drinking. And this kind of came in stages.. initially there's a big jolt and just being sober and having that ultra awareness. But as time goes on the days turn into months there's another level of multi-leveled problem solving and I realize this as getting into arguments with my boss and out thinking in very logical ways. I've become quicker and lighter on my feet in the ways of problem solving and being creative in my everyday life.

4. I started making more money... I was problem solving better at work, talking and helping out costumers and other employees with their problems, and my boss noticed and was able to trust me with a larger work load that also came with a higher pay. By not being so clouded in my thoughts I started listening and trying my best to understand others needs, that along creative solutions, the people around me are much happier and my work environment is a lot more enjoyable to be in.

5. Productive AF. I got ahold of my schedule and squeezed as much as I possibly can in my day. My days aren't necessarily automatic 100% but I don't have to think so much about the things I should be doing because they kind of turn into a habit. I really do enjoy just shooting off the cop on my off days and not going by a schedule but it's nice because it doesn't come with this level of guilt and procrastination that I felt for.

6. I quit smoking. I'm going on 7 months without any cigarettes, vaping, any tobacco at all! This is probably bigger than quitting drinking for me. You see I never really wanted to smoke but it was something I picked up in my life working restaurants as a young adult. I've known it's always been bad for me because when I was a child I had asthma and I got to the point where I could not run any more, but by quitting booze give me the awareness and will to deal with my triggers that led me to over drinking and smoking in my twenties.

7. I started getting compliments on my skin... Mostly from girls, maybe because they are the ones to talk about that stuff more. But I've had a number of friends telling me that my skin looks and feels so much softer and younger than before. I lost a bit of bloating in my face and remember around my nose... I haven't had a bad breakout in months too.

8. I'm proud of myself. I never thought that I'd say no to alcohol and feel as good as I do... I feel like I'm overcoming a generational addiction.. a waste of money, time and energy. I use to be so self-destructive and at times I hated my life and the choices I have made in the past. I really feel like I was a bad person before and I dragged not only myself but family members, friend's, past partners and co-worker down with my poor decisions. My sobriety outweighs all of those negative feelings I lived with for so long.

I could probably squeeze about half dozen of reasons I'm becoming a better person because of not drinking but... Since this is my first post I'll leave it and see what y'all think... Maybe I'll add some later.

Take care, keep improving and may the force be with you!",81

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we share about AoK which have touched us this past week. It can be AoK to ourselves, to others, to animals, or to the environment we live in. It can be AoK which we've performed, received, observed, or heard about secondhand or through the media. Any AoK which has touched us is fair game.

This week’s AoK is a [story about an epic tip, $2,020 on a $23 bill.](https://epaper.ajc.com/popovers/dynamic_article_popover.aspx?artguid=efe19083-5a72-47ca-9d64-b5cfeb3195f8&utm_source=app.pagesuite&utm_medium=app-interaction&utm_campaign=pagesuite-epaper-ipad_share-article&appid=2870) The waitress who received the tip talks about how she’s a single mother who was living in a homeless shelter a year ago, and says that she’s going to use the money to get her driver’s license reinstated and to build up her savings.

What struck me about this AoK is that there were no strings attached. The people who left the tip didn’t know about her background, and they weren’t trying to influence her behavior with the money. They had decided that it was an act of generosity which they could afford, and they left her the tip unconditionally. 

So that’s me for this week, sobernauts. And I apologize for the late post. I meant to do it this morning, but I overslept, and it’s my first day on my new job, so not really a good time to be making Reddit posts at work. How’s everyone else doing, any AoK that you’d like to share?",23

Things at work have been really challenging lately and have affected how much I've been drinking. Last year, my drinking was really getting out of control and I believe that a lot of it was a coping mechanism for the stress and toxic environment that I was working in. I also believe that using alcohol as a coping mechanism made the situation worse. Given that I was usually hungover, I compounded my anxieties and frustrations with alcohol withdrawal instead of addressing the issues and dealing with my emotions in a healthy way. Then I'd drink again to relieve the negative emotions and feel numb, be hungover, and then start the process over again. Each time getting a little bit worse. 

There was another incident at work today that made me feel frustrated, abused and unappreciated. My first instinct was the thought ""Alright, F\*\*\* you boss, time to hit the bar...I'm gonna get drunk"". I have been feeling much less depressed and anxious since I stopped drinking, but I suddenly felt intense frustration and anxiety well up inside of me, followed almost immediately by The Urge to drink. 

Fortunately, because I have recently wrote down the signs of The Urge, I recognized what was happening. I have a conditioned and practiced response to these situations deeply ingrained in my sub-conscious, which is negative emotion = drink now. Recognizing what was happening allowed me to quickly put my controls in place. I drank a glass of water, took a few minutes to myself with some breathing exercises and at a small snack. 

I'm still very frustrated, I'm still very angry, and I'm still working on my exit plan out of that toxic environment. However, I will not make the situation worse by giving in to my urge and getting blackout drunk to numb my feelings. I will not force myself to address these emotions tomorrow instead while simultaneously being depressed, anxious and exhausted from the poison I poured into my body today. If I did do that, I would likely do it again tomorrow too, and the cycle would continue indefinitely.   


I will not drink with you today.

I haven’t woken up wondering what I did to make a fool of myself the night before in all that time, and my anxiety in general has really calmed down. In my daily life I have no desire to drink, and if I have a stressful day I go unwind at the gym or yoga. 
I’m leaving for a vacation in about a week and I’m really torn. Having a drink (or 10) in the sunshine is usually one of the best parts of my vacation. I know all of my buddies will be drinking moderately throughout the trip and likely getting drunk a couple of times as well. They don’t know I’m sober and I always used to be the biggest drinker in the group. I hope they’ll be happy that I’ve made the choice to stop drinking, and I’m not too worried about them pressuring me. What I am concerned about is craving a drink on the beach and telling myself it’s fine if I have just one, or a few. I don’t want to be the sloppy drunk friend anymore, and I’m also worried that if I let myself have one I’ll fall off the wagon completely.

2020-01-06 14:14:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ekyp2d/having_a_real_shit_day/,Having a Real Shit Day,"Hello everyone, 

Writing because I have no where else to go - and I'm really trying to avoid going to the corner store, while at work (until 5, it's currently 11), buying something to drink, and chugging it in my car. I know this might seem like an /r/relationships thing, but I really need to vent somewhere where people may understand why I want to get blackout drunk this very second.

My fiance and I broke up this last September. We lived together and I was very involved in his six-year-old daughter's life. 

Once this happened, I binged. **Hard**. This was noticed by my parents, thus, I went through IOP, started antidepressants, and shopped around for therapists - finally finding one I liked.

My family and friends were so supportive, even helping renovate my entire apartment to scrub all the traces of him away.

However, in mid-November, he and I got in touch. My drinking (or rather, my behavior when drunk) was one of the nails in the coffin of our relationship. This along with his inability to ""grow up."" 

Since getting in touch, we've been seeing each-other 1-3 times a week. Things are going well, all things considered. Without my drunken rage and him having had to live on his own and grow up a little... it feels different.

But - I can't share this with anyone. I can't tell a single soul. I'm embarrassed by all the drama that occurred through our breakup and feel like it would be a slap in the face to everyone who stood by my side through the process. This has been my dirty little secret for months now.

Well, today I made the mistake of checking his baby mama's Instagram page. I discovered he took her to his sisters' wedding (three weeks after our breakup) and they dressed up in matching costumes for Halloween. I was devastated.

I just stepped into the hallway at work to call and basically laid it all out. I said I'm treading carefully but if he's involved with her that's more mess than I can handle. He asserted, strongly, that they're just co-parenting and he'd paid a bunch to go to the wedding and his daughter (a flowergirl) really wanted her mom to go. She does know his family. The Halloween thing was just to take her trick-or-treating. 

I do believe him.. her captions even read ""#coparentingdoneright"" (insinuating they aren't ""together"") and his tone in denying anything inappropriate was sincere. But there's that nagging, intense, burning green jealousy rotting in my heart. My eyes feel hot and I just want to cry. And drink. I want to drink so badly it hurts.

I don't know what I'm doing. Typically, I'd call a girlfriend or a family member and vent, but no one knows about any of this. I don't know what I'm doing seeing him again. I don't know why I have all this hurt. I don't know what to do next, or what's right. I just want to drink.

Thanks for allowing me this space.",2

Why are there 100 less dollars in my bank account? Where is my debit card? Etc) and decided I just can't fucking do it anymore. 

Just some brief history: I was staying in a sober house from January 2019-October 2019, thanks to some healthy urging from a good friend/roommate. I knew I had a problem and was willing to get help. I was successfully sober while there, but got tired of all the rules and going to all the mandatory AA or NA meetings. I felt like I had enough time under my belt, so I bounced. Man, was I wrong. Shit was just hanging out dormant. I don't drink if I work the next day, but my brain is starting to become accustomed to drinking any time that doesn't interfere with work. Still have my job, haven't had anything catastrophic happen, but I can feel the shitstorm coming and I'm pretty scared. If I just don't drink I'll be okay, but I've realized that's really hard on your own when you're not actively doing anything to prevent it, so I figured I'd post here and see what advice some of you folks might have to offer. I've tried the whole AA thing and recognize there's value in a lot of their process, but I have a very hard time getting to know people and I despise larger group settings. Any and all advice and recommendations appreciated. Don't want to drink anymore and I know I can do it!

I didn't expect the withdrawal symptoms; it never, ever occurred to me. It was eye-opening to how bad the problem is. So I crashed Saturday, found the hidden booze and drank enough to make the pain go away. Roommates found out, got mad at me, and I ended up with a fresh bottle of whiskey in the park. I drank all night in the rain then cried myself to sleep. Good times.

I started again yesterday and I can already feel the withdrawal. I'm sitting at my desk, shaking and sweating, imaging how bad it's going to be tomorrow. Of course the timing is bad because my assistant has the week off, so it would be hard for me to take a couple sick days. Should I just delay quitting until later this week so that I can lay in bed all weekend, or does anyone have some tips or tricks to get through it while at work?

1. All the bs that alcohol told me was a lie. I don't need it to enjoy music or to relax, in fact it destroys my ability to do those things. 
2. I don't need it to feel ""cool"" or unique or more interesting, in fact, all it ever did was turn be into a boring @$$hole. 
3. The real world is not ""lame"" and people who don't drink are not boring or deprived of anything. Over the holidays, I played board games, I socialized with my family while drinking mocktails, and I spent quality time with my nieces and nephews which would've never happened had I been drinking. I shopped, I helped wrap presents, I ran errands. It was so rewarding to be able to do what I could to help my family have a merry Christmas. Alcohol would've rendered me useless, lazy, and miserable. 
4. I am far from powerless and I am anything but deprived. The only thing that renders me powerless over alcohol and drugs is if I let myself be deceived and manipulated by it again. My mind is incredibly powerful and I get stronger every day. The high highs and low lows of addiction are no way to live. 

If I can do this, literally anyone can. Alcohol used to be part of my identity, a badge of honor, if you will. A month is the longest I've gone without a drink in 5 or 6 years and I can already see myself enjoying things more and more the way I used to, which has been really encouraging and empowering! The brain needs time to regain its ability to enjoy things without such substances, so if you want something to really look forward to, give yourself about a month for this to happen and make sure to feel hopeful and excited along the way! Be free, be weird, be spontaneous, be crazy, do whatever TF you want in this wonderful and crazy world! Put that pointless poison in it's rightful place and stop letting in f**k with you and your self-worth!

I have been drinking really excessively for about 5 years and have been drinking long before that. I haven't made it this long without it at any point during that time so this is uncharted territory for me.  I'm a relatively functional alcoholic and have been surprisingly successful throughout it.  I knew it was time to quit about 2 years ago, when every afternoon I would start to sober up I would have the most crippling anxiety and depression that I cannot even begin to explain.  The other withdrawal symptoms were nothing compared to that.  That has gone on for so long every day and it has literally been destroying my life.  Recently I almost lost my job and career that I have been building for 6 years because I would take shots of vodka throughout the day to avoid the withdrawal and be able to function.  By the time I would get home at night I would pass out and wake up in the same situation every single day like groundhogs day.  I really dove in this time and have been eating extremely clean, exercising and have begun to try and repair damaged relationships.  I'm not sure how I got the willpower to do it because I could never imagine trying to tackle this head on before.  I don't believe I will ever go back but I know I'd be naive to say that for certain.  It's only been 7 days but I'm beginning to wonder if my brain is ever going to get back to normal.  I still have horrible anxiety and pretty severe depression, albeit not as severe.  I've always handled things myself without any outside help but I guess I'm wondering if anyone else knows what I'm experiencing and looking for a little insight into maybe how long this will go on for.  I know it's silly for me to just expect to be better after a week after drinking so much for so long but I just want it to be over.

(25m weekend binge drinker for 7 years),"I went to a restaurant last night and was really tempted to drink. I had taken a microdose of lsd and had an amazing experience. Usually on the comedown, I feel a bit mentally exhausted and a bit of anxiety so I wanted a beer just to mellow out. 

My mother ordered a margarita because her new year resolution is to drink more. She is not an alcoholic and has about 2 drinks per year. She takes one shot and she’s done pretty much lol. 

Anyway, I was close to caving but then I thought, “I don’t really NEED it. I just want it to change the way I was feeling. Over the past few months, I’ve learned to sit and process my emotions rather than run from them. Alcohol has always been my outlet to escape from problems. Now that I’m facing my problems head on, why do I even need to drink? 

So 37 days into this non alcoholic lifestyle and I’m feeling more optimistic about my life. I can feel my confidence rising and anxiety/depression decreasing as each week passes. 

Wish you all luck!

I never drank nightly or near to the point to feel any withdrawals... After I made the conscious decision to stop for awhile, my dreams have gotten more and more vivid, almost as if my subconscious is begging me to continue with the abstinence (I don't usually believe this hoo-ha stuff but some of this is backed by biology). 

At first the dreams were anxiety ridden -- mornings of me waking up after a blackout looking at photos trying to piece together various adventures. Then they turned into me choosing to have one drink or two regardless of my choice to abstain. The more days without alcohol, the more my dreams solely focused on alcohol. Recently, I had a dream about growing old and the meaning of death. Another version of me told me how important time is and how easily it can be wasted away until it's too late... I woke up feeling as if I had gone through some sort of reawakening. Very strange. 

I thought it was interesting to watch as my brain went through the various stages of no alcohol and how they translated into my dreams -- from the typical anxiety of post-drinking malaise to perhaps craving it and drinking again to coming out on the other side of sobriety.

It hurts to see that happen to someone, let alone family, because I’ve had my own struggles, and know how miserable you have to be to get to that point. In a way, this makes me wanna go grab a drink, and also makes me repulsed at the idea, because that’s a big part of what brought me to that place.

I had been dry on Saturday, and was working on a dry Sunday. I started the day in good spirits; feeling dedicated. I was playing a video game, preparing to beat the game, and I had just started the final missions and I was getting rather pumped, excited. 

And it hit RIGHT then. I wanted to drink. The excitement triggered it this time, somehow. I hadn’t even been thinking about it. I wanted the booze to enhance the experience, to provide that extra bit of fun. It was Sunday, and I knew that I couldn’t get liquor, but drunk is drunk, and even though I dislike wine, it gets you there. 

So the fight began; I paused the game almost without thinking and got up to get ready to go out; and I started arguing with myself. I didn’t need it, I didn’t want it, it wouldn’t do what I want anyway; but all the while, I’m going through the motions of getting shoes on, getting car keys, grabbing wallet. Almost like someone else is in control. 

I started pacing, trying to talk myself out of it, and though everything I said was true, the lie that I could enhance my good mood with alcohol kept hammering away at my self-control. So, finally, I gave in, and bought 3 bottles of cheap wine. $20.00 going POOF into my addiction. 

I got back, started drinking, finished the game, and even started a New Game +; but, around 6 PM and 2 bottles in, I got so drowsy; I quit out and laid down for a nap. This “Nap” turned into me staying in bed, tossing and turning, until 6 this morning when it was time to get up for work.  I then dumped out the 3rd bottle feeling angry and frustrated at myself.  

Looking back on the afternoon of gaming, I remember that I beat the game and about how it all went; so I was far from being blacked out (not a surprise, that’s not nearly enough for a blackout for me these days) but my memories of it ARE all foggy and jagged; not as clear as they could be. 

What I do NOT remember is feeling like anything was enhanced. It wasn’t; my memories are fuzzier, I didn’t have any more fun than before, I ended up sleeping through several hours of my weekend that could have been spent still enjoying myself, I slept poorly and now I am slightly hung over and grumpy at work.  Why do I keep doing it? It’s so frustrating! It seems like it should be easy, and it’s NOT. It feels like it should be easy, until that very moment when it is no. longer. Easy.

I have been binge drinking (still struggling with the label, 'alcoholic') for a little over 30 years. I'm approaching 50 and don't have any known medical issues, except pre-diabetes (which I beleive is diet and alcohol related). I have ADHD, not taking any medication for this but working out (and sobriety) gives me the most clear headspace imaginable. Question here... Has anyone in this group come back from this? Have you been able to restore your health? I fear that I may have messed up my internal organs (pancreas, liver, brain). There is no physical or medical indication of this, it's just in my head. 🙄.

Last year, I had multiple blackout situations, concurrently. I'm sure that I properly embarrassed my family and myself. I wish that I could erase all of those episodes from my life. I have had two adult children watching this train wreck. It's extremely difficult to even write these words because of my shame.

The truth is that, I have NOT been enjoying my drinking experiences for quite a few years now. Regardless of quantity or type of alcohol. I seriously prefer the evenings/days that I am sober (my mind is clear, no fog). Still, my drinking frequency has begun to escalate. I have been struggling to understand why I have been drinking so frequently and why I haven't been able to stop when I start. I used to be able to cut myself off for months at a time, once I even stopped for 3yrs, when my ex finally gave up and ran away with another man.

My current wife enjoys (celebrates) drinking and wouldn't ever consider stopping. Her dad died of cirrhosis, so she is very familiar with consequences of overdoing it, but she believes fervently that there is middle ground. She loves the taste and experience and prefers to fight the urge to overdo it rather than avoid it all together. Thats fine, I don't feel bothered by her moderate drinking, I would often NOT have a drink, while she or others are drinking. It has never bothered me... but when I start... OMG. 

My latest shenanigans. I literally drank a bottle of rum on New Years Eve (not a brag, it was a horrible mistake, of which I will spare you the details), then I had a 1oz shot of Tequila on Jan 2nd. I feel like that is the perfect way to bring this horrible part of my life to an end. 

After that, I consulted a vitamin store salesperson and purchased some fancy vitamins that have been really helping me AND thanks to this sub, I purchased ""alcohol explained"" and have read most of it. I've been listening to Seltzer Squad podcast 'sober in the city'. I have been feeling **so** good! Like. Incredibly **GOOD**! I thank you all for that. 

At the same time, I have all of this panic rushing in, and shame... Mostly from reading this book and realizing how incorrectly I have been framing things. Simple things, like 'alcohol literally makes you stupid' ... I knew this, how could I have just ignored it and continued to look stupid in front of people that had respect and admiration for me. It's like I've been a zombie. How do you guys get over the remorse of lost times and opportunities to have meaningful conversations and relationships because you were too inebriated.

Thanks again for reading, and thank God for this sub. I have never written this many honest words about my drinking, in my life and I am grateful that there is an accessible place for me to do so!",19

I lost all of my friends and social status because of issues with drugs (benzos to be exact). For the past five years, I drank daily, but for the first three it was social. Like a few beers or cocktails at bars with friends.

The last two years however have been awful. I lost job after job because of my drug addiction (and speaking honestly, piss-poor attitude). Eventually over the summer I started up at NA meetings, which helped immensely. That coupled with my having to move back home with my parents kept me 100% clean for about a month.

Thinking I was in the clear, and with some savings in my pocket, I decided to solo travel internationally for the first time, which was a huge mistake. Every night I was either in a bar or in my hotel room getting drunk to pass out. After a few months I come back home, but this time stopped going to meetings. I start sneak buying bottles of vodka to drink on my own. My rationale being ""well, at least I'm not doing pills and powders again"" despite the NA ""alcohol is a drug"" creed. 

Cut to now: I'm on an entirely new continent on my own, with a pretty decent job and my own apartment again. I drank the first month, not blacking out, but the fact that I needed to everyday hurts. So I bought a ps4, am buying a calendar to physically and visually mark progress, and diving into my new job and FIFA with a fervor I've never had before. I'm scared of failing again, especially because I'm in a place where I don't speak the language, and the only available english meeting within 100 miles is on a worknight (I work nights).

Wondering if I’m expecting too much from my family, friends...

Specifically, my husband seems incapable of providing the emotional support and understanding I need when I am feeling like I can’t do this. He quit  smoking effortlessly years ago and can moderate his drinking or not drink like it’s no big deal. He doesn’t seem to understand why it’s so hard for me to stop. He also gets angry when, for example, I confided in him that I had fallen off the wagon a few times before the new year. He suggested that now he “can’t trust [me]” and called me a liar. When I began to cry and said I needed his support and love he asked me “what do you want me to do??” Like now I also have to teach someone to be empathetic AND battle my own addictions?? How can anyone do this alone, especially when your self esteem is fairly shit in general??

I do love him even though, and not to be flippant but, he is such a fucking Aquarius - an aloof and self-absorbed loner - I don’t know if I will ever be able to count on him. He has his own issues that seem to have made him acutely unable to understand anybody else’s feelings, it seems. Maybe I’m asking too much.

Yesterday my partner (who is also going sober) and I went to a favorite restaurant, where, as you might guess, we each had a favorite drink on the menu.

We handed back the alcohol menu right away and took a look - for the first time - at the non-alcoholic drink list. Oooh! They had a lot of great choices! (Who knew??) We ordered a mango slush and a boba tea and started chatting. 

A few minutes later I spotted our server coming toward us... with a beer on a tray. A tall, glistening, amber, glass of beer. Now, beer isn't even my drink of choice but my heart skipped a beat. I had a moment of panic. ""That's not what I ordered. I'll have to turn it away. I can't have that in front of me. What do I say??""

I’m trying to keep myself motivated, so if you could share one *small*, tangible change for the better you had during month one, I’d be super grateful.

I am/was an in between drinker. Two bourbons per night, maybe three on  Friday and Saturday, maybe four when out with friends. But rarely more.

I’ve been drinking since I was about 18 and started drinking a lot more regularly at 20. I think it pretty much immediately became a problem at 21 when I was able to legally drink and realized that I could actually socialize when drunk.  I am 23 now.

Since then, it really has been ruining my life. I’ve suffered from depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. I haven’t sought help and have been coping with beer and liquor.

On January 1st of this year I decided to at least quit drinking for one month. (my birthday is in one month) with encouragement and support from my girlfriend. Then, on January 3rd she broke up with me without reason and basically ghosted me. I started drinking again because I was alone and had no way to cope.

I’ve drank every night since then and last night I went out to a comedy club with a friend and had a few beers.

I tried to sleep but woke up with a panic attack thinking about my ex. 

I got up, took a shower, then went and dumped all of my booze down the sink. 
I’m done. I’m going to finally try to take care of myself and get healthy and hopefully sober. 

I’m sorry if this is a mess to read but it’s 3am and I’m so tired and just can’t sleep. I don’t know how posts on here usually go but I’m looking forward to my new life of being healthier and hopefully happier.

Thanks for reading and I hope this sub can help me in some way. I’m just glad support is available.",24

I was terrified of telling my family (my dad who I lived with, my friends, my colleagues etc). However, I made the decision to check in to rehab and I've been clean and sober ever since.

&#x200B;

I've been able to do so by doing what I was told to do. I went to AA and NA and I still go. I got a sponsor and I'm slowly working the steps. My dad, the closest person in my life, trusts me again and believes in me.

&#x200B;

I've slowly started taking the steps to deal with all my early childhood trauma which I believe is the reason why I'm an addict in the first place. It hasn't been easy. In fact the first 6 months were awesome but when the trauma started to emerge after 16 years of pushing it down via booze and drugs shit got really dark and really fucking painful and i barely had any coping mechanisms to deal with it all. It was either top myself or go back to hospital to seek further treatment for complex trauma, depression and anxiety. First admission was back in August for a month and I bounced back quickly, however I'm currently an inpatient once again after experiencing the most severe bout of panic attacks, disassociation and mild psychosis I've ever experienced.

It's been a torturous couple of weeks but thank fuck I'm still clean and thank fuck I'm still sober. My doctors are aware not to prescribe me any benzos, and I'm hyper-vigilant about the medication I'm taking. I'm praying to my HP and taking it one day at a time. It's hard af and god knows I'd rather be on a beach somewhere sipping mocktails and celebrating my 27th Birthday in all it's glory but this is a part of my story and yet another tribulation I gotta pull through.

It's always darkest before the dawn.

Nothing too major or life-changing but it just wasn't working for me and I was using it as a crutch. Decided no more alcohol for the rest of 2019. So here we are almost a week in to 2020 and the only alcohol I've had was two sips of someone else's wine on Christmas Eve. I intentionally didn't decide what to do after the new year until it happened, because I didn't just want to spend three months waiting to be allowed to drink again.

I don't know how much of it was cutting out the wine and how much of it was being a few months into eating paleo but I feel so much better. I wake up feeling better, my hormones are more balanced than they've ever been in my life, no panic about what I posted on Facebook or said to someone on Snapchat the night before. I had been dreading certain holiday events without the comfort of being buzzed, but I actually really enjoyed being sober and thought everyone who was drinking seemed a bit silly. I don't miss wondering if I made a fool of myself.

I've been sick since New Year's Eve so I've extended it by default - now I'm looking back over the past few months sober and really proud of myself for reaching my goal. I definitely don't want to get drunk again, which is something I didn't realize before. Maybe I'll be able to be one of those people who enjoys the occasional glass of wine with dinner, or maybe I'll just compartmentalize it as something I avoid because it seems to impact my health.

2020-01-06 00:21:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ekpejb/i_finally_lost_the_urge_to_drink/,I finally lost the urge to drink...!,"I don’t know exactly when it happened, but I finally had the realization this weekend that I absolutely don’t miss being drunk, and I’m really enjoying the shit out of sobriety. It hasn’t been all unicorns and rainbows, but it’s certainly starting to feel that way.

40 days ago — the day before Thanksgiving — I got lucky as hell in getting off easy after drunkenly assaulting the woman of my dreams. I had spent 32 days in pretrial detention (aka city jail) after getting into an argument with my girlfriend and attempting to physically remove her from our apartment. When she didn’t leave, I decided it would be appropriate to pin her down, choke her, and scream at her about how everything wrong in my life is her fault (spoiler: that’s absolutely not the case). I regretted those actions thoroughly, and swore to myself during those 32 days that I would never touch alcohol again in my life.

But then I was released. I’d lost my job and my dog, my relationship was obviously on the rocks (and my gf was looking to move to an entirely different city). Things were bad... really bad. Despite my promise to myself, I found that urge creeping everywhere once I got back into the swing of everyday life. In jail, I witnessed multiple stabbings and was threatened myself. The trauma of it all made my head spin and I didn’t sleep for well over 48 hours after my release. I felt like I *needed* to drink to cope with it all, even though I knew I shouldn’t.

Over the last 40 days, I have struggled. I was completely alone for the holidays, and on one occasion, I decided to let the urge take over. No one could be hurt since no one was around, so what was the harm?

Well... I didn’t even want it once I had it. I had a couple of beers and dumped the rest. But I still just felt restless and useless; like I needed *something* to fill the void of being painfully aware of my own existence.

In the couple of weeks since then, I’ve come to realize all of the positives of sobriety. Though my life isn’t perfect, I’m not continuing to slide downhill. I’m back to my high school weight without even trying, I feel refreshed every morning, and I’m not spending money I don’t have on shit I don’t need. I somehow managed to land an awesome job, complete with a raise in salary and responsibility over the one I lost while in jail, with a much more exciting company. I can’t sleep right now because of anxiety over starting it this week, but I’m *enjoying* the anxiety for once, rather than drinking it away.

Though my girlfriend hasn’t entirely forgiven me, she’s decided I’m at least worth sticking around for, and I have no intention of letting her completely lose faith in me. I came so close to losing *everything* important to me... and now I feel like I’m beginning my Robert Downey Jr. redemption arc.

I’ve tried several times over the last few years to quit, and after dozens of false starts I can finally say with certainty that I have absolutely no urge to turn back.

So, this post goes out to all of the people struggling with abstinence. It’s scary — the thought of “never again” — but please believe the posts here that tell you not to quit on quitting. I had heard it all before, I had tried to get into the mindset, and I had failed, but fucking finally I’ve had my eureka moment. It’s liberating as hell, and for once I know for certain that the temptation is just... gone. I’m not repulsed by the thought of alcohol, but I am repulsed by the thought of turning back to the person I’ve been.

Do yourself a favor and don’t quit on quitting. I can’t say it enough. It gets better. IWNDWYT",23

Whether it be a twelve pack in a few hours, or a fifth. I’m tired of waking up sick and tired. I’m exhausted of feeling the shame and emberrasment.  I recently met an amazing woman. Someone I can’t imagine being without. 

She doesn’t drink, or do drugs.  She has children, a job, just.... a real human being.  And I’ve drank every time we have been together. And when we aren’t.  

It’s created a weird dynamic for me. And two nights ago, or three, I drank a fifth of vodka in a few hours.  I blacked out and she’s said I didn’t do anything messed up and it wasn’t a bad night. But this was the last push I think I needed.  

I’m not doing it for her, I’m just tired of ruining everything and anything because of booze.  Then using booze to forget or feel okay about it. It isn’t a terrible cycle and I’m just done. I want to do something with my life. 21-28 years of age I’ve been doing this.  

I have terrible anxiety, depression, ADD. I’ve self medicated for a long time. I am planning on visiting a doctor finally this week. 

What do you guys do to get your mind off of cravings? Any suggestions on the upcoming WDs?  I’m already dealing with my regular shakes. That’s nothing to me right now.

Walking through that space was pure horror. But then at the end of the day, I would always drink again.

It would usually begin Sunday evening with a crushing sadness, knowing I had failed to take advantage of another weekend, instead spending it drinking from Friday night on. I would fall into bed, utterly depressed and terrified of the upcoming work week.

Then 3AM would hit, and things would get bad. I’d wake up, sick, coated with sweat, beyond anxious. Willing myself to fall back asleep for just a few more hours…if I was lucky I would.

Then my alarm would go off, and I’d have to get up. Anxious beyond any reason, feeling absolutely horrible, with a deep fear of what the work day would bring in the pit of my stomach.

I would get to work, and it was always 100 times harder than it needed to be. I’d be shaky, sweaty, and by lunch I’d feel like I was dying. I’d go home Monday night and drink to feel better. 

As the week wore on I’d drink less on weeknights, but always some. And then, by Friday, I’d be ready to go again, starting the vicious cycle anew.

Today though, I found myself reading on my porch, drinking tea and staring out over the lake. Absolutely serene. I had a productive day filled with things I’ve wanted to do for years, and as I get ready to go to bed tonight, sober, I am proud.

Life still isn’t always easy, and Monday’s still suck sometimes, but I can say with certainty being sober makes life SO much easier. I have a long journey ahead of me, but for tonight at least, I’m proud of my sobriety and everything I’ve accomplished. 

So for those of you going to bed sober tonight, congratulations on not having to feel that horrible Monday anxiety tomorrow.

And for any of you who have another bad Monday in store…just remember, it doesn’t have to be like this next week.

We had to put down our cherished patterdale terrier, Ford, on New Year's Day, a day after my birthday. He was only 5.

I allowed myself to cry it out and managed to avoid alcohol. A few days had gone by. Every minute I was awake, I thought of him. I blamed myself, I tried to go back in time and hypothesize about what I could have changed... my veterinarian said I should definitely not blame myself. It was a 100% freak disease that we had zero chance at curing.

I decided I needed to do something, even if it was too soon. I did not want to stay in this rut and risk the progress I've made over the last few months. I decided Ford wouldn't want me to be alone. He knows I loved him and he knows I'll continue to mourn him, but I can't cope with vast emptiness he left behind.

Long story short, I rescued a treeing walker coonhound mix. His name is Champ, and he gets along with my other dog, Ranger, and the cats perfectly. He was previously abused with a BB gun and dumped on the side of the road. He'll be a lot of work. He'll have to learn to trust and love, but it'll be so rewarding. I don't feel like I'm at risk of making any stupid decisions anymore. I haven't cried since he came home and now I can tell stories about Ford without becoming emotional.

Here's some pictures. Ford was the black dog. Our new pup, Champ, is the hound on the left. Ranger has been with us for about three years.

Drinking will not bring him back and will only make me less supportive of Ranger and Champ. There, I said it.

my girlfriend calling me an alcoholic just puts a belief in my mind that my drinking habits arent normal despite everyone i know drinking the same amount... i'm not alone in feeling this am I?

 I don't have anyone I can talk to, I'm on a waiting list for therapy and all the usuals with anxiety.  Losing the will to keep on pushing when it is so much easier to give up, I have nothing i truly feel motivated about or worth fighting for anymore. maybe i just need something to bring me back to earth. been unemployed for a while now and meant to be starting work this week. currently on day 4 of no drinking (ignore any badges if i have them, its from past sloshy relapses)",6

I work in the restaurant industry and didn't start drinking heavy till i was 23ish. The family I worked (still do) for was opening a second restaurant and I got brought on as part of the management team, so that meant I got free food and free booze. As you can imagine a beer or two after the shift turned into several a night and I ended up cultivating a problem before I knew it.  Many of you probably know how the service industry is a sess pool for alcohol and drug abuse so it wasn't long before I started using cocaine on the regular and making some really harmful choices.

Fast forward to now, The second restaurant is closed (Good riddance) and I'm back at the first and we are doing great business wise, and both of the chefs (owners) are sober now. I use to party with one of them some so it has been an inspiration to see him doing so well and the other chef has been sober for 9 years or so and is very active in AA still, I don't know if i want to try it but i'm keeping an open mind.

I definitely have been a worse drunk before but...I am done, I am done waking up feeling like shit,   I am done being mean to my SO for no fucking reason, I am done neglecting the fact that my dog needs exercise or that I need excercise, I am done spending money on it, I am done with my coffee and would like another but i need to sleep tonight, I'm just finished with the whole life style/ lack there of. I stopped doing cocaine a few years ago but relapsed back in april, so not too bad, but not great. I refused when a coworker offered it to me two months ago so now it's time to kick the drinking! I feel good about it but I know I need to take it one day at a time.

I'm SO tired from the lack of sleep but at least I don't feel sick when I actually wake up from sleeping, I love that.

I have emotional goals — to be the best version of myself I can be. I’m still learning the ins and outs of socialization. Most of my social life consisted of bar culture, so that’s a change.

It's been years of struggles; quitting, binge, relapse, etc. All the time done by ""feel"", as in I dont feel drunk so I can drive. Or I dont feel shocky so I can drink tonight. Thinking if I follow rules like beer only, from 5 to midnight, etc I'll be ok. Wrong. Years ago I finally got a quality breathalyzer online (all of the over the counter ones are junk and temperature sensitive). I was able to manage to a point and not binge into wish for death withdrawal, but then I discovered kindling. Months into what works and taking a couple days off every week I found that shocky feeling returned. Even after a couple days off. Then something stressful would happen, a careless night binge, and bam full withdrawals, seizures, dts lasting way longer than ever before; this is kindling. I know complete abstinence is the only way and you are lying to yourself if you think you have a system figured out. It's not if it's when it will destroy you. Research and buy a quality breathalyzer to help you figure out your true limits; you will find when you wake up ""feeling"" sober it's so far beyond that. My personal metabolism is double the drinks to equal the hours to zero; ie 12 drinks will take 24 hours to zero (pretty scarey thinking you're sober the next day). The breathalyzer gave me the feed back I needed to step it down and quit. Post acute withdrawal is real, if you relapse dont beat yourself up about it, remember what your true limits are if you cave, and get back to abstinence. Never ever give in because of outside stress or you have ""no reason to live"". It's the most torturous, slow, painful way to die. I've had to bury several family and friends. Ive come close as well. Reach out if you're depressed. It took years to figure this out on my own, I'm 4 years without relapse now. Hope this may be helpful to anyone",8

It would have been my mom's birthday yesterday and she died far too early, in large part from this disease.  We were estranged.  Today was the first day since she died over three years ago that I can remember waking up wanting my mom. 

My eyes are also bonkers bloodshot, probably bc I've been using anti-redness eyedrops like a fucking fiend most of the year, and they apparently have rebound effects.  And I'm fat as all get out, maybe the fattest I've been since 2007 or so.  I know from experience if I can wait it out, my liver starts to sort it out after a month.  Just can't give it other BS to plow through first. Also my joints ache and my feet fall asleep quickly, but I'm not sure if that's because I'm fat, alcoholic, or 40!

It’s always a bummer and sometimes it has made me feel like there’s not much left. There always is. Things we take for granted until we lose them too. For example I had not valued the fact that I have a perfectly fine and straight nose, until I was drunk and got attacked two weeks ago. I ended up in hospital and had to have a surgery to fix my nose. It’s not crooked but I can see there is a difference. It’s just a nose, not a big deal, but it is a good reminder that I (like we all) still have all kinds of things to lose. In a world where nothing is free we can still lose everything for free. I feel like I’ve thrown myself to the dirt by drinking and have little by little lost more and more. Lets all appreciate what we have, even if it feels like there’s not a lot left. Or if it takes some thinking to find out what those things are. Some things might not feel important right now, but it still might hurt a lot to see them gone. Drinking is bound to take away some things. I think we all have experienced that.

Now, I am seven months sober. I find pleasure in getting out of my comfort zone. 

As much as possible, i try to be spontaneous and impulsive around things I wouldnt normally do. Yesterday I was going to head to the gym after work and get some exercise in, when I found out that my workplace gym closed early on Saturdays (you can tell how little I have been to the gym). I was walking home slightly dissapointed, when my colleague hit me up and asked if I wanted to train with him at his gym. 

I was like  ''fuck it, what have I got to lose? I was going to go the gym anyway''. 


So I hop on the bus and head over to his gym. 

My colleague is a muscleman and clearly does weights all the time. He is practically a bodybuilder, and the gym he trains at is full of absolute units.  I had signed myself up to two hours of pain. 

I lifted more weights, more intensively than I have ever done in my life. I learned how to safely lift weights, spot for friends and lose all power in both of my arms for the next few days.... 


The point is, I got out of my comfort zone, had fun, and told the world that I could do this. I suprised my colleague as he said 9/10 times people say yes they are just being polite. I doubled down and decided that anything was better than giving up. 


Back in my drinking days, if it was not involving drinking, I would have not been interested. Now that I am sober, I feel like I can take on the world, I just need to say hell yes.

I always liked drinking kombucha here and there, but I really started leaning on that as a replacement this last month. The only downside is that it's a little pricey (about as expensive as a bottle of vodka I guess). So I decided to look into making my own.

It's been a pretty fun month of learning how to generate my own scoby (the fermenting agent), investing in supplies, and understanding the biology. I just finished my first full batch and now have a gallon of kombucha brewed all by myself. I even made one bottle with hops that give it a beer flavor that's not alcoholic. I am super happy with how it turned out and I have a new hobby I wouldn't have had if I were still drinking. I am now looking into other fermentation recipes like pickling and sauerkraut. 

Anyway, I feel good about myself and wanted to share this as something that has helped me occupy my time without alcohol. It might be fun for others looking for something to do or consume other than drinking. IWNDWYT

I did dry last year, from 1st Jan through mid-March, but it was such a different and negative situation (living in a friend's spare room after my boyfriend who I was gonna move in with broke up with me earlier in the year because, you guessed it, I was a mess who thought they were *fine*.

This year, I live on my own in a lovely one bed house I moved into a couple months ago. I'm exercising through walking at least 10-12k steps a day, but often up to 20k which is a decent couple of hours / 15km of thinking and self reflection time.

Usually weekends were a big Saturday with mates after an excessive week, often getting home without even knowing how, jut that shit-faved homedar I know a lot us seem to have. Sunday's, I'd order crap takeout from the place that I knew also sold beer and wine and eat grease and medicate the hangover with more drink, I'd rarely leave the room, let alone house.

This time it's all change! Saturday I was at my parents, woke up early and cooked them breakfast (they were amazed!). Walked listening to some amazing podcasts, went to a friend's where we drank coffee and played Mahjong (our new obsession). They didn't drink but did vape weed which I would've usually done but declined.

At home I watched all three parts of ""Don't F**k with Cats"", something that's one of those mini-goals: I used to be so anxious and agitated I could never watch something over the weekend, just the same familiar shit that didn't give me a panic attack.

Today, I woke up feeling fresh, tidied my house, went for a 10km walk around the new local parkland, went over to my neighbours for a couple of hours for  a tea, having gotten chatting to them over the holidays. They gave me some bookcases which I set up and arranged, I cooked all the food - soup for healthy lunches this week, soda bread to go with it, an amazing dinner, and wrote up the recipes for next week. I also did all those things that I'd usually put off or ignore, small things that feel big once done (emails, grocery shop etc).

Unfortunately that didn't happen. My situation is not unique, I come home after work, on the way stop off and grab a few shooters, then finish them off at home. Although I spend time with my wife and daughter during the evening I can sense it's not the quality time it should be. Aside from that it's also economically challenging, spending around $300 per month. 
It amazes me how folks on here can get through tough times and still have the discipline to stay sober. I applaud you all for your strength. Day one seems hard, no shakes or withdrawal symptoms, just an internal battle of will. 
If I do make it past the first day, then I feel good about myself. Day two is pretty easy,then day three I convince myself it's under control and I'll just have a couple drinks. It starts all over again. I'm going to continue to reset until I finally accomplish my goal.

I was hoping the pink cloud of sobriety would envelop me and make it all better but nope. SO NOPE.  I have more energy -- big plus -- but I've gained weight (hello, sugar!) and I spend my days feeling like a raw nerve ending. And I'd LOVE to get out and spend more me-time and decompress but it's all ""Mom, I need blah blah blah"" and ""Honey, I can't find my blah blah blah.""

My drinking has become out of control. I can usually go a day without a drink but as soon as I have one I can’t seem to stop. I made a pact with myself to do dry January but that only lasted one day. I am extremely disappointed in myself. 

2019 was a terrible year for me which has led me to drinking more and more to numb the pain. I got married but, shortly after, my wife left and moved to another state. She begged me to come but I did not go with her. We discussed this before marriage and both of us decided against the move but that changed after the wedding. Besides this being a unilateral decision by her, this would have jeopardized my job and isolated me from family and friends. We are now separated. My father passed away a few months ago unexpectedly, which was and is absolutely devastating. He was a rock in my life and I am struggling to cope without my partner. 

I am truly depressed and the only time I feel some sense of normalcy is when I am drinking. That is until the next morning when the anxiety, sadness, and loneliness flood my body. I know that drinking is only adding to my depression so I need to stop. I am posting here for some accountability in hopes that it will give me the push I need to start on the road to sobriety... at least for today.

I did not so much as feel an urge to even be around alcohol. Last New Years I went to a party but did not drink. I was incredibly clunky and awkward. It's crazy how much I  grew in just one year. 

If there is anyone reading this who drank on New Years, or during the holidays for that matter, I want to share how I overcame my alcoholism.

I stopped. I took a look around myself. I said out loud what I saw. I took a deep breath. Then I took another deep breath. I  then thought about how every person I have ever seen has a life that is just as complex and vivid as mine (this is called ""sonder""). I then thought about every mistake I have ever made in life, visualized in a timeline. Once I did that, I thought about every person I have ever seen, and how integrated into the complexity and vividness of their life is every mistake they have ever made. Every single mistake of every single person I have ever seen (or not seen). I let it dawn on myself, that every time I make a mistake, that there is a high chance that someone else is making that exact same mistake, simultaneously, somewhere else in the world.

Then I did that over, and over, and over, and over again every single time I made a mistake that caused me to view myself or my life in a negative light. My life is ultimately so insignificant, but my human nature and ego attempted to resist that worldview by distorting and perverting the reality of my thoughts and actions. My ego wanted me to continue viewing the world through a veil of selfishness, that constantly reminded me that I am the victim and the most important person on Earth.

I did not entirely stop drinking until l realized that we are all the same. One is all, all is one. The Universal Truth. I will never forget the moment I accepted the truth, the reality of everything. It was like everything made sense. In that moment, I accepted everything. 

I believe alcoholism is a symptom of an underlying problem, the inability to accept who I am. Once I accepted who I am, I never drank again.

I hope this makes sense and helps at least one person.

Happy New Year!!",45

I heard him tell my mom that his stomach was bad and couldn’t tolerate food but could tolerate alcohol so he was only drinking for the calories. 

He couldn’t stand longer than 2 minutes because of intense pain in his stomach. 

He put of going to the doctor for months, telling everyone it was just a problem with his appendix and he had to wait for his health insurance to kick in. 

On Thursday he was walking to his car to finally go to the doctor and he collapsed in his front yard and died. Just like that. He was 61. 

This was man who repeatedly told me that he had no memory of me. That he sees me and knows we are related but could that he couldn’t remember a single time he talked to me or spent time with me. I am almost 40.

Before that I was a daily drinker for the last year, at my worst finishing a good portion of a 26 ounce bottle of whiskey daily. Ive promised myself I would stop in the last 3-4 years, only to relapse a day, a week, or a month later. 

Since the last two months I’ve slipped up maybe 5-6 times (mostly during the holidays) however I haven’t let these isolated events turn into relapses like the past. 

I’ve journey and examined each slip up and really thought about what made me slip up, what it cost, what it gave, and if it was worth it. 

So here’s the thing - I don’t feel guilty and actually feel really proud of these last months even though I’ve slipped up 5-6 times. Am I stupid for that? 

A part of me feels like I should feel guilty for the slip ups, but I don’t. I feel really happy about the other 50ish days that I WAS sober. 

I really wish I could have long numbers showing how many days it’s been without a single drink like some of you guys! I’ve had to reset it a few times now, but I still think I’m making progress. 

Am I stupid for this? For some reason there’s this voice in my head that keeps saying I’m failing everytime I drink and that I should feel bad. 

Sorry for the long rant, and thanks in advance!!",12

I told my husband I was quitting and would on the 1st. Well, per doctors orders, I’ve been tapering. But... I didn’t tell me husband that. I’m embarrassed. Didn’t want him to know how bad it’s gotten. Thought I could taper for 5 days and stop and he’d never know and we’d move on. Well, as can be expected tapering isn’t going awesome (last night was the opposite of tapering). I still feel like I could get on top of it and do 4 tonight, then down by one until mid week and be done. But I also know that I said that a few days ago and I don’t have the most faith in myself. I’m terrified of telling him the truth. Will it ruin our marriage that I’ve lied to him the past 5 days? That I was drinking behind his back? Would he ever trust me again? This is the last thing in the world that I want. 

I need to talk to someone. Literally nobody knows what’s going on. So I think I’m going to break down to my mom. She’s the smartest most successful woman I know, who also drinks too much probably a bit too often (weekly?). So I think she’ll have grace for me. She’s also a nurse so I want her opinion from that standpoint. She also understands my husband and why I can’t always go to him about these things. I dont know. I’m really hoping reaching out to her will give me some relief and support at the same time. Meeting her in 2 hours. Wish me luck.",10

My kids are older teens, one in college and one in high school. I used to delude myself into thinking they didn't know when I was drinking. Even though I'd be short tempered or unstable, manic or depressed, or sick and napping all the time. My youngest would just stay in his room on his computer.

The last two weeks, with my oldest home on break, we've spent so much quality time together, great vacation travel, playing board games, hanging out.. I haven't told them explicitly that I'm not drinking anymore, but the difference in our interactions is night and day. Guess what? My youngest actually does want to hang out with me - when I'm present and sober and clear headed. He will seek me out just to share a funny video or meme, tell me about his day, all things he didn't do before. 

Trying to make a choice to move forward and enjoy what little time I have left with them as ""kids"" and not beat myself up over screwing up their childhoods. They're both very successful and they are great people, despite me. My husband has a lot to do with that, he's an amazing dad and is very supportive of me, in spite of everything. 

I'm so proud of them and want to make up for lost time.

I feel like a lightweight by comparison. Anyway, I'm getting a lot of pressure to attend AA from psychiatrist and wife. I have been to four meetings and I fucking hated it. I'm an Irish catholic and it reminds me of going to mass. reading from a book written before weed and coke and X were invented. and I don't relate to the principles of AA. making amends sounds good but the rest of it feels like dogma to me. the standard spiel is 'you have to find the meeting that's right for you'. fine. I get it. But everyone telling me to attend AA has one thing in common: they have never been addicted to anything. And am I supposed to spend ages trying to find the meeting that's 'right' for me? Going to a meeting is, let's face it, a two hour commitment. you have to travel there and back. AA is a traditional bricks and mortar retail model if you think about it. and there's a reason that shit is dying out. Whereas on /stopdrinking I get instant access 24/7 to a huge community of people who are in my position and get it. without travel or dogma. and this is kind of fun.  I am looking to change my lifestyle but going to dingy basements and drinking Dunder Mifflin coffee has zero appeal to me. I am doing yoga 7 days a week. which I find super helpful in lots of ways.

2020-01-05 11:17:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ekf030/my_tools_of_sobriety/,My Tools of Sobriety,"I only have 170ish days of sobriety, but think that I have a rock solid foundation to sobriety and wanted to share what has worked for me this time around.

1. I replaced the time and energy spent on drinking with healthy living, going to the gym and eating properly. I also quit tobacco.

2. I’ve supplemented in CBD oil without THC to help on days I have extreme anxiety, I’m naturally anxious, have an insanely stressful job and drinking exacerbated all of these issues. 

3. I don’t hang out with alcoholics anymore. 



1). Not only has eating healthy and going to the gym helped me lose 45 pounds in 5 months, but it makes me more emotionally healthy and helps reverse the damage done to my brain from drinking. 

Most importantly, when some people stop drinking they find a massive time void and lack of direction in sobriety. Focusing on healthy living filled that void with something that is productive and naturally helps mitigate depression and anxiety. 

2). If I didn’t get enough sleep, have PAWS, or have a major event at work, I take CBD. I don’t get a high or really feel anything from taking it except for a major reduction in anxiety. This has helped me not get too out of whack and relapse. 

3). This is self explanatory. I also don’t advertise my sobriety, but that’s just me. When people talk about drinking I just sit and nod or give some vague comment to show I’m following along. When I’m offered a drink, or worse pressured to drink, I politely say that I’m not drinking because of calories. It works 100% of the time. If I get push back, I laugh and say I’m taking my heath very seriously and don’t want to ruin the momentum I have.",40

Taking it day by day at the beginning was great advise. Some of the ""firsts"" weren't as bad as my head made it out to be. I didn't want to make it obvious at first because I was afraid of looking like an idiot if I failed. 

The amazing part is life experiences getting better. I got so much done in the last year it's mind boggling. Vacations were longer due to not sleeping hangovers off. I've even read a couple books!

I think one of the biggest realizations I had early on was at a birthday party for a family member. We did axe throwing and that football bowling. The bars in the place were packed. People in out party were struggling to get beers. I wouldn't have had a good time at all had I been drinking. I'd have been miserable trying to constantly fight the crowd around the bar for the next drink.

I couldn't have done it without my wife though. She had her own reasons for quitting and that helped a ton. We didn't purposely quit together but quit at the same time. It's nice to have a partner in crime so to speak.

I think the hardest part was bailing on a snowmobile trip this past Christmas break. Not sure if alot if people on this sub are familiar with the hobby but where I ride theres thousands of miles of trails that basically tie bars and gas stations together. Usually a drunk fest. It doesn't have to be with the right crowd but my crowd isn't the right one. So I opted out this year. It's a ton of fun without booze. Hopefully I can figure it out before the season's over.

Is there even such a thing as stopping after a couple drinks? Or do I have to throw it away completely? Even just pacing myself and prolonging those two drinks over a couple hours would be amazing.

I've been on here all week READING, and I want to thank you all so much! I'm an almost 60 yo retired woman. I've drank almost daily for a very very long time (decades). When I worked, I opened the first beer at 5:00, as soon as I got home. I'd drink my 6 beers, then make dinner and go to bed, did that for years. After retirement, it slowly turned into 8 beers a night. And I slowly turned starting time from 5:00 to 2:00. I watched the clock as soon as noon hit, waiting for 2:00. When I woke up, one of the first things I did was count how many beers were in the fridge. If there were 7 or more, I was okay. Otherwise, I planned a trip to the grocery store and had to 1) figure out some groceries to buy along with the beer so I didn't look like a lush just buying beer 2) remember which store I went to last time and go to a different one so the cashiers didn't think I was a lush. Another thing I did was pretend to remember conversations. If someone said ""did I tell you xyz?"" I'd reply ""I think so. What was it again? Oh yeah, you did."" Meanwhile, I was always fearful of repeating things I said the night before. ""Mom, you already told me that last night"" Oh yeah right, I forgot. Also my weight has slowly crept up and I am a true apple shape, which is extremely unhealthy. So I started doing cardio videos about a month ago. No weight change at all. Hmm, could it be those 800 calories in beer I drank every night? I decided I really needed to stop drinking for my health. I started eating healthy and counting calories the day I chose not to drink and upped my exercise to 60 minutes a day. I feel really good and  I've already dropped 3.5 pounds. I'm not sleeping too well but I still feel more awake and alert than before. It took 5 days and many cups of smooth move tea, but I'm finally ""going"" again lol.

I've been sober 3 years and 4 months. It started as a lark, I signed up for the ""world's steepest 5k"" called Hell on Hills here in Pittsburgh back in 2016 and while I ran frequently, this was going to be challenging, so I stopped drinking to train. I told myself after, I'd go back to drinking. In the 3 months I was training for the race I finally let myself admit what I had known all along, I had a drinking problem.

I stayed sober through buying our first home, through (now countless) holidays with my family, through very deep depressive episodes, and losing several much loved family members.

Over all the people in my immediate circle have been very supportive, but I can often tell that people miss the ""old me."" I'm very much a homebody and an introvert in person. I have auditory sensory issues and now without alcohol I can't handle loud places well. I don't like crowds of people or social situations where drinking is the focus.

It's to a point almost 4 years later where I don't get invited to things, or people try and talk me into going out bar hopping with them even if I explain that being in loud bars makes it really hard to stay sober.

Coming to this subreddit has been helping me a lot, even if I was just lurking. I'm struggling so much lately. Regular Style Depression, Extra Crisp Style Seasonal Depression, the sudden unexpected loss of my stepmother and subsequently more interaction with my father who has been the shining example of a usually out of control but somehow still  functioning alcoholic my entire life, and isolation has my brain playing the bargaining game. 

""What if I JUST drank on holidays? Like just on SPECIAL DAYS?""

""What if I only drank on weekends?""

Always finding some condition to make it acceptable, even when I know if I were to ever give in to these I'd back slide the entire way.

I'm constantly living between being proud of how far I've come and feeling like I've become some forgotten burden hanging around the necks of everyone close to me.

- pre Xmas drinks - everybody is very much in a cheerful mood, meeting with friends who’ve returned home from wherever, and everyone doing rounds or offering a pint here and there. A simple “I’m not drinking” was enough and people were pleasantly understanding - one of my closest friends bought be a pint without knowning, which I politely refused and he gave me a little bit of banter about it, but ultimately in good spirits, and he drank the pint happily. 

- no hangovers are the best!

- Xmas day - no real issues, I spent it with family and brought my own non-alcoholic drinks which I enjoyed - I also did the family quiz and didn’t feel too sluggish to play with the nieces and nephews, and went to bed feeling good!

- happy took ‘on-call’ shifts in work as I wasn’t drinking, didn’t feel like a punishment!

- work until midnight New Year’s Eve, then visited friends after and had a cup of tea - everyone seemed pretty tired after an evenings drinking so we’re not very lively, played some Pictionary like game and had a chat, woke up the next day late but functional!

- no hangover guilt!

- first party at our home - am big evening of friends after new year was great fun, everyone played games and Nintendo, loads of chatting and I was also on call for work so could answer a few questions over the phone with no stress, tidied up after everyone left at 3pm and woke up to do some studying in the morning! Also, conversations felt more meaningful and I definitely didn’t feel like I needed alcohol as a social crutch as much

- have lost a lot of beer belly, but feel a bit bloated after non-alcoholic fizzy drinks which are only treats now

- all in all better clarity of thought and more energy in work, and more productive overall - plus I love the mornings now!

Just thought I’d share some brief thoughts, feels so good to have stopped when I did and not waste a Xmas under the influence :)",11

Today marks my first year of sobriety!,"I woke up in the middle of the night having a panic attack because my body needed booze. As I gulped down a few shots of vodka from the bottle, I told myself that was my last drink, that was my last drink, that was my last drink.

Well that first week from Jan 5 onward was hellish. Withdrawal was brutal, but I did feel confident in my resolve to quit. I was tempted many, many times. More than many maybe because **I work in a liquor store!** So, if I can go from 13+ drinks a day to cold turkey all the while being surrounded by it, I'm sure you can do it too, no matter what your situation is!

Three months followed that were actually blissful in a way. I hit the gym, fixed my diet, did loads of work on personal projects, got my finances together and paid off some debts. Then I hit a rough spot. For six months or so I really didn't know who I was anymore. From being an addict and low down, shifty delinquent to a clean cut law abiding citizen... My life didn't make sense anymore. I encountered some rough times, my grandmother passed away and I had a major fight with my wife, but I did stay sober throughout.

It was really only in December, after I had secured almost a full year of sobriety that my perception really began to change. And let me tell you, was it ever worth it. I see and understand things about myself now that I would have ignored or rejected a year ago. I feel like a completely different person in all the best ways. I will say with confidence that quitting drinking was the best decision I have ever made and IWNDWYT!",276

Yesterday some gym friends came to find me after class (I was still doing a few things and they had all been done and were dressing in the locker room) to say they were going out for drinks later and wanted me to come. 

For about 1 second I had that ""Oh no, I'm on the spot"" feeling and then I just said it. ""Sorry no, I can't drink and don't even like to be around it as I'm an alcoholic."" The main one asking me kind of gasped ""oh, I had no idea! I'm sorry!"" I said ""it's ok-- I really appreciate the invite but I'll pass"" and that was that. It was great. Normally I'm all awkward and ""er, um, I, um, have to clean out my sock drawer"" kind of thing. This was much better and didn't lead to any ""oh come on, just come out for 1 or 2"". 

I'm an antisocial introvert and being an alcoholic is a great excuse to say no to an invite without seeming rude!",232

2020-01-05 06:44:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ekc11m/back_again_again/,"Back again, again.","2019 looked promising several times. I had a 33-day stretch of sobriety through May, then I fell off the wagon. Then I made it 27 days in August and fell off again. Then I made it 39 days around October/November, and then I fell off pretty hard. You know, apocalyptic hangovers, drinking at work again, entertaining a false fantasy that moderation is possible for me while knowing all along that I’m bullshitting myself.

If I look at 2019 as a whole, it was by far the most sober year I’ve ever had since I discovered liquor, pot, adderall, and tobacco when I was 15 years of age. I was addicted to pseudoephedrine for over 10 years. This is the first and only place that I’ve ever said that to anyone. No one one knows. I’m not a hermit - I have a wife, close friendships, a somewhat high-profile career where I’m leading and interacting with lots of people on a daily basis. They all just think I’m an unusually edgy person sometimes, and an extremely energetic, upbeat person at other times. No one knows that my edginess is directly related to me crashing from some variety of stimulants, then drinking to mitigate withdrawal, then taking more stimulants the next day to push through the alcohol hangover, repeat. I got alcohol and stimulants severely tangled up in my brain, and it led to a decade-long cycle of abusing stimulants during the day, then drinking at night. 

Gradually, I started drinking earlier and earlier, and taking stimulants later and later. After a few years of accepting looser and looser standards for myself, I would just wash down the stimulants with beer and/or wine around midday. I loved the contrast of going from hungover and lethargic to jacked up, loose, and flooded with serotonin. Every day the hangover was a little worse and the buzz was a little less rewarding. Most of you know where that road leads.

I quit pseudoephedrine for 8 months in 2019. Then I started it again after my third alcohol relapse in November. Now it’s been about 10 days. When I don’t use one, I don’t use the other. If I use one, I feel compelled to use the other. It’s a classic cross-addiction and it’s fucking awful. 

To those of you who don’t have the “I just quit one day and never went back,” story, I’m with you. Let’s do this.

They were very supportive, I had realized that the reason I didn't want to tell them was I was just planning how I was going to backslide in the deep dark corner of my mind where our demons hide and wait. The desire to have a drink was really strong, then I told them, felt like a weight was lifted. I know it will be back soon and may never fully go away.  

Everyone knew daytime me, they didn’t know about the other one. I am struggling. I don't like who I am so I drink because it makes me feel better, but I really actually don't like myself these days because I drink. This is my story.

Every time I try to stop the withdrawal/hangover makes me go what if I just had a tiny bit, not enough to get drunk of course, just ease the transition and a little bit later I am loaded. Not feeling like I am good enough is probably the root cause, not sure, I am going to be getting a therapist next week once I am back from Asia on a business trip. I'm sure most of you have heard a version of this story before, details of mine are below.

To be honest from the outside most people would probably trade their life for mine. I know that that so many people suffer so much because of the nature of the world that we live in. It is a terrible place when you can't afford rent, or food, or stuff for your kids. My drinking comes from self loathing, the more I get angry at myself for not being able to appreciate my life the more I want to drink, the more I drink the angrier I get at myself for not being able to deal with it.

Negative feedback is super fucked emotionally.

In short I have a problem between who I am on the outside and what I feel on the inside.

I run a business with my partner (not like marriage or some other personal arrangement, just business). I got decent grades in school, got a degree, worked a few jobs before I got involved with where I am now.

My problem with alcohol started early on as a coping mechanism, I remember going on a class trip down south where the drinking laws were more lax in high school, I wasn't excited about going down and having fun with my friends, I was excited because finally I was going to be allowed to get drunk for a week straight without anyone judging me.

If we skip to university, I was in a very competitive degree, nice thing about school was you only needed to turn it on in order to finish an assignment or write a test. Same way I got through high school I could bullshit, fake, or bargain enough grades to get through. I used every mechanism possible, in fact if I had spent the time on just doing well in school instead of reading over school documents to look for my next out to cover my drinking problem, I probably would have been fine. Either way I could graduate after 4 years but decided to stay a 5th to ""expand my knowledge of other areas"" as my justification, really what I wanted was to stay in an environment where binge drinking was acceptable.

That as with all things had to end, you can't be 30 years old hanging out in college where you've been a student for 12 years. Although I got scholarships my lifestyle was maintained by a steady flow of funds from my parents. My focus shifted to how I was going to keep the gravy train flowing, that meant that what I needed was a job with flexible hours that was acceptable to them. So I went out and found one. My long term planning became about ensuring I was going to be able to drink comfortably.

This paragraph is necessary for context. My parents are pretty wealthy, not quite ""f-you I can do whatever I want money"" but close enough that for the majority of people the distinction is moot. They always took a more conservative approach to spreading it out than a lot of people do. Never had a trust fund but they made it clear that if you've got a good idea or want to start/build something the money is available. They were always supportive of anything I wanted to do that was productive but frowned on most frivolous things. Easiest thing is to use a car analogy, they'll buy a nice C class Mercedes even though they can easily afford a Bentley/Porsche/etc... After all, it's a car, we need it to transport us comfortably/safely from place to place, once we find one that we like why would we bother spending money on something more expensive?

This utilitarian view probably impacted me and honestly is very reasonable. I felt that if value is established by utility, and deep down I knew I was useless, therefore I had no value and anything I got was fraud. All I knew was that night time me needed support and it was up to daytime me to figure out how that was going to happen.

So I moved back to my parents place, luckily they are semi retired and mostly do consulting work so they were going to be gone 70-80% of the time travelling/working. In the 2 years I lived there I don't know how many times I refilled the bottles of alcohol they had in the house. After all I was going to stop drinking, every day I was going to stop. Then I would get home and fight it for a bit, eventually the one sip just to feel better would set in and we were off to the races. I worked, consistently, diligently, and with great results! For the time between when I got up and went to work and when I went home I never drank.

Over time it stopped being when they were away that I would drink, and shifted to how I was going to be able to keep drinking with them around. Easy solution! Fake a sleeping disorder that requires you to be trying to sleep for 12+ hours a day in order to be properly rested, insomnia! Perfect! Now the reason that when I get home I go upstairs is reasonable and justifiable, after all I am just trying to beat my insomnia in order to be able to function at work tomorrow. So that's when the nightly stop at the liquor store for a 13oz that I could throw in the trash tomorrow started. In order to cover my tracks I would hit a lot of different places on the way home, always vodka so the smell would be easier to hide. Eventually even though I was spreading things around at a bunch of different stores I became paranoid that someone would remember me coming in often, so I started buying 60oz at a time it would look more like I was stocking a bar and if I only visited a store every few weeks it was probably because I was popular and had guests over.

Hiding my addiction became as stressful as the addiction, so eventually I moved out. Not because I wanted to continue my life as a successful young person but because it would allow me to pursue my addiction in earnest. During this time I was doing well in my daytime life, I even won a couple of awards and got more promotions. Rather than being able to enjoy them my self loathing grew because I knew deep down I was a fraud. I knew that if drinking me was able to do that, sober me could do it so much better. So despite the fact that everyone told me I was doing well the depression grew, because I knew that secretly I was actually letting them down.

Since the person I was outside was doing well, I was eventually approached by someone who wanted to start something up. They had the idea, the drive and the know how, I would provide my know how and some capital. Parents of course were happy to oblige.

I’ll skip over the majority of that part, but during it the alcohol abuse got worse, therefore my need to hide it became more of a drain on my time and energy. My partner didn’t care, company was doing well, we were making good money, he didn’t explicitly know but I think this falls into the don’t ask don’t tell line of thinking. Don’t forget that if you’re poor you’re an alcoholic, when you’ve got money you’re just out of control. Our society judges people on different yardsticks and it is total fucking bullshit. My distaste for that is another reason I drink, my ability to change the world is hampered by the fact that the productive part of me spends most of its time babysitting the terrible secrets the rest of the world can’t be allowed to see. If it doesn’t impact them directly most people don’t give a shit about your life or your problems. Don’t blame them. That’s the world we live in.

That brings us to today, business is doing well. My social life took a complete shit years ago once I realized that the only reason I wanted to see people was to drink and it was much easier to short circuit the process and just start drinking. I would occasionally go out and see people, but I deliberately established a bunch of social circles, made sure they knew about the other ones, kept my distance from everyone and that way if they didn’t see me for a few weeks or months I was just too busy with work and probably with someone else.

I would take vacations, nice places I’m sure, I saw the airport and the trip to the hotel where my serious business was getting drunk for a week. I no longer maintained social connections so when people at work asked how the vacation was I made up a few stories and change the subject. Remember I was always playing the I’m with xyz game, and so people think I have a vibrant social life, just… somewhere else. And I was always distant so people just considered me private, did that on purpose to protect my habit.

So here we are, I sit inside an incredibly vast web of lies in order to maintain my addiction, I can no longer sit idly by while this destroys the core of who I am. I know that if I continue everything will come crashing down, but I can’t stop myself from keeping on going. I think the first step is admitting to someone, anyone, literally just telling the truth about myself. I need to force a confrontation with my drunk self, because they have had power over me for too long.

I’ve tried to beat my drunk self alone for years and it hasn’t worked, this time I was hoping to bring some friends. Maybe we can do it together, if you’ll help.

I don’t believe in anything, hopefully someone can believe in me.",6

I don’t think there was a minute I’m that time that I didn’t miss drinking. I could be wrong since I’ve been off the wagon as long as I was on. 

I’ve been thinking knowing and planning but not actually doing anything to get on the wagon. Today is the day. It has to be. It’s 355 am. I went to the bar to escape my family at 5:30 pm. I promised my daughter I’d be home to read to her. I came home on time, went upstairs, must have laid down in bed, passed out and here I am. 

I’ve been hurting me the most but I know I hurt my daughter tonight. I won’t even see her for a few more hours. I’ll likely still be awake because I’m wide awake now. I don’t want to hurt her. Tonight it’s just one night. Next time I could be dead. 

My marriage is a shambles. I don’t think that is due to my drinking. It wasn’t good when I was sober for the last two of those years. I don’t know if I can fix it and frankly it’s not a why factor in choosing to stop drinking again. 

Right now I’m full of fear and questions. I’m looking forward to going to a concert Friday and I don’t know how I’m going to make it without drinking but I went to shows while I was sober for those four years so I know there is a way. 

I know there is a way through every day and every event because I did four years. Just writing this gives me hope. 

I know AA is good but it’s not for me. Maybe my feelings will change as I not drink. I’ll leave it at that. It’s so wonderful for so many people.

My significant other knows about the relapse but no one else in my life, my AA group of friends, or my sponsor do. I can’t figure out how to handle it. I have gone back and forth with myself on how far I want to take working the program...if I restart my clock...who I tell... 

I had 3 months, and I’m supposed to throw that away and start over? Ugh

Idk how to feel but I’m grateful I stopped before it got out of hand. Not even sure why I’m posting. Maybe some of you have been where I’m at. 

Thanks for listening to me ramble and happy new year. Let’s make it a sober one!",15

Thankfully, not about how I want a drink right now, but the role it has played in my life up to this point. Not only did I form the habit of drinking to celebrate, drinking to cope, and drinking because i was bored, but it feels impossible to escape in my professional life. I have worked in the industry for just under a year and a half trying to build a career and now, if I'm not drinking, how can I morally be okay with essentially peddling the product that was ruining my life? I'm sure I can find a way to detach myself from the fact I'm selling booze, but it hurts my soul a bit at the moment. I mean I could always quit my job, but this is the most money I've ever made and my serving/bartending wage was not helping me pay off my tremendous debts. Idk, I know I can't tackle everything at once and tomorrow is a new day. I just wish I didn't let myself get so bad.",8

Tonight, we went to a pub with really decent food. Everyone was drinking but my wife and me. All is good, been there many times before. We went back to some friends’ house and they like to keep them pouring. Everyone around me was super awesome and supportive, didn’t try to badger me about it. It felt really good. That was by far the best part. My wife was able to partake a little and I got to drive home stone cold sober and make sure the other DD was good to go.

I got home, helped get kids to bed, everyone is happy. I’m not super emotional and/or trying to climb all over my wife in a ridiculous drunken manner.

My dudes and dudettes. I will not drink with you today! I will not drink with you tomorrow.

All of you have this. After years of going through a handle in 2 days, I finally was able to make it so I haven’t had a drink in 2 years. I can’t say I haven’t quit drinking. It’s just been a while since my last one. Once a drinker or a smoker, you’ll always be one. Just cope in more healthy ways and just not have one today!!!! Set the goal every day.

Should I look at moving out of my old flat where I did almost all of my solo problem drinking?,"I posted earlier about my journey to realising I was an alcoholic after a nasty Incident on New Years that led to an intervention by my family. Since then I’ve managed to stay sober for longer than I’ve managed to in YEARS! (YAY!) which I’m super proud of. I’ve even managed to do this with loads of alcohol lying around I’m arm’s reach. I’ve just not been tempted because I have come to realise so whole heartedly that my life will become better when I am not dependent on it. I’ve also picked up This Naked Mind as recommended by others in this sub which has been great to reinforce a lot of the thoughts I’d already had about how my life came to look like it did before I got sober. 

However, I am assisted by the fact that I’m not in an environment that I strongly associate with drinking. I return home to my flat in the middle of this month (shared with two others, I think one of them suspects something may be up with me alcohol-wise but the newer one definitely doesn’t). Most of my drinking was done alone in my room. 

I live in London, UK where moving is difficult and expensive. I would obviously rather stay put. I may also need to relocate for work because now that I’m sober I can give my all to my job l (or get another one) in ways I couldn’t when I was hungover half the time. But I’d like to get some advice from those on here about returning to the familiar drinking environments of your home after getting sober? Should I be looking into moving seriously or do I need to take it upon myself to get stronger in difficult environments? 

Thanks in advance!",6

I grabbed a beer. It's been a long ass day. House full of people and too much noise. 
I walked the beer into the kitchen with the intention of opening it .

Then walked the beer back to the box, popped a bag of popcorn and watched a movie. 

Why? Well, because I promised myself at least 30 days dry. 
(I killed 2.5 bottles of wine on NYE and had the mother of all hangovers for 2 days) 
I made it 6 months dry in 2019, then caved for the holidays.

I have thought I enjoyed alcohol in the past but I really enjoyed a fake, hollow escape from issues that would still be there in the morning.

Things I'm loving about sober life so far:

1. Being able to drive at any point in the night
2. Having my wits about me at all times and not having to worry about embarrassing myself when an unexpected interaction occurs
3. Not passing out at 7pm
4. Waking up refreshed and ready to go
5. Not blacking out and having to have an uncomfortable or upsetting conversation with my partner about what I said or did the night before
6. Not being that drunk person on social media wanting to chat with everyone
7. Not having diarrhea or enflamed throat
8. Not having my day revolve solely around alcohol and junk food after 10AM on weekends and 4pm weekdays
9. SO much more energy. Incredible how much easier things are when you're not 4 shots deep.
10. Being finally free to LIVE

I'm above content, almost happy. I haven't felt this in a long, long time. 

I hope this lasts as long as possible and when it doesn't, I hope I have the courage and determination to make myself to remember why being sober is the only way I can have a fighting chance at being who I want to be.

Thank you for reading if you did. IWNDWYT and I hope you have a wonderful night.",32

Looked down and it was a drop of blood,  que the rest of the blood river that followed all from one nostril.

While it isn't the end of the world, and I don't think it kills your progress too much, it doesn't change how much of a dick you look when you get drunk. 

  My relapses last year managed to lose me a whole lot of respect with people, even though it was only once or twice I got wasted. They didn't care that I'd spent most of the year sober, just that I'd made trouble. 

  Protesting about my efforts to stay sober afterwards fell on deaf ears. 

  In the end, if you drink too much, you look like a fool and in the wrong circumstances you can't change that with certain people. I spent most of last year sober as a judge yet still managed to come out as the clown or the liability in some people's eyes.

  This is why I'm not giving into temptation this year! Time to raise standards.",9

I decided it was time to quit for a few reasons

1. I'm no longer living with my family, who were extremely difficult to live with and triggered me all the time. I'm not perfect at all, in fact I'm a bit of a pain to live with, but I can't stand being screamed at constantly. I'm living with friends and not around my biggest trigger anymore. I just don't need it to cope with that.

2. Nevertheless when I moved here I continued to drink and use benzos on a daily basis. I turned into a real scumbag. Was a self-absorbed asshole with no empathy who took advantage of his friends at every opportunity. I don't even recall doing it but apparently I yelled at one of my roommates and called her a bitch. I stole from them, lied to them and cheated them, and felt zero remorse, when I should have been grateful to them and you know, not treated them like shit

3. I'm tired of the fucking tremors and the constant sickness, the inability to sleep. I still can't sleep, but hey, I wake up feeling better than I was. Felt like death every morning and wouldn't stop shaking until I took a Xanax

Work gave me a week to get sober (when they could have just fired me), and I tapered off the benzos and haven't drank since. I've been going to AA meetings and talk to my sponsor every day. I can't say it's been extremely helpful so far but it's nice having a group of people I can talk to anytime; best part is it's so easy to talk to them because they've been through the exact same shit I've been through. I'm not completely sober yet, I've substituted the alcohol for Kratom and while that definitely isn't as much of a problem, it's still a problem. It really does take time and effort for life to improve sober, and I don't feel like I'm quite there yet but I'm going to keep this up for as long as I can and quit the Kratom when I'm ready... 

This has been extremely hard to say the least, one of t he hardest things I've ever done. I can't say each day gets better. I feel pretty awful. There's a mental ""wall"" that I seem to put up around other people; it's just so hard to talk to anyone, I'm just so anxious. I was covering this up with benzos and alcohol, now it's come back and hit me like a brick. That and pretty severe depression. I'm just glad to know I'm not a special case, tons of people like me are on here and in AA, going through the exact same stuff, it's a pretty comforting feeling. Nevertheless, this is hard but I'm determined to keep it up, this is the longest I've gone without drinking since turning 21, I cannot go back now

Anyway I basically just needed to vent and get my thoughts out in text, thanks for reading, glad this sub exists",11

I cut back in 2019 to pretty much weekends exclusively. 

Then came Thanksgiving, work parties, family friends in town etc. I had fun but I’m just nervous about withdrawals.

Friday: 3.5 beers

Started out good, had a midmorning start and I like my feeling of not being hungover, not groggy or gross. 

Then I went to my friend's daughter's bday party... byob and then stay after for a few more drinks if ya like. These are my oldest group of friends and most have kids but I don't (there's a very tentative ""yet"" hanging there). Anyways they have long since been my drinking buds ever since I was 15 and I wanted to see them and celebrate the little girl's bday. Then I went to the baby section of the store and saw this Baby Journey type book and just starting fucking crying all alone in the bookstore! No idea why.

Then I went to the party and it was a nice time but I realized how much drinking is a suit of armor in social situations. I wanted to run from every person who talked to me and I had no excuse of needing to fill my drink. I don't know why these 20 year old friendships felt so... scary.

My sister told me she was going to stop talking to my mom if my mom didn't start tending to her health better. She told me this through text on the way to the party. I made the decision and texted my husband to say I will be coming home with wine today and will be just keeping it to the weekends. He said try to hold out a little longer. 

Someone at the party told me about a virtual reality gaming place and so I told him to book it for an hour after the party because I wasn't going home without wine and so my solution is to not go home.

We went, did a second session. I cried the whole way there for no reason other than I wanted wine and I also wanted to keep my sober streak and I didn't know what I wanted more. All my emotions feel like they are turned up to 11 and my brain is like a hamster on a wheel and I just want it to stoooooop. I said if I still wanted wine after the games I would buy it. Tried to go to a diner after but the server was being rude to us and so we left and got fast food. 

Got home. Ate the food. Went in the bath. No wine. The games tired me out enough and the craving passed. Barely. 

I keep thinking it's gonna get easier but man. So much turmoil for what should be such a normal Saturday. Tomorrow will be day 5 and then that will be the longest in about 3 years. It will be worth it.",4

I am 24 days sober, beating my record of 23 days that I set about 2 years ago. In 6 years of regular drinking, I have never gone this far without drinking. 

There have been some things that I’ve done in those 6 years that I am not proud of. There are things I have done that make me cringe whenever I think of them.  However, all those moments are lessons. I don’t fail. I either succeed or I learn. In 6 years, I have learned quite a bit.

This time is different than 23 though. 2 years ago I went 23 days just to see how long I could go. After a long day of work I decided to get a 6 pack. I had just gone 23 days so why not?

Well in the time between then and now I’ve had a few weeks here and there of no drinking. Not a lot though. I want to say that 95% of the days since 23, I had at least 2 beers or more. 

24 days ago my girlfriend of over 1.5 years almost left me because my drinking was getting out of hand. It was an eye opening moment to be sure. 

Since that day I’ve been going to the gym almost every day. I’ve stuck to a body building program that’s slowly teaching me discipline. I’ve been waking up without a hangover and feeling great all day. I’ve even enrolled in a coding boot camp so I can start a career in a field I love. If I was still drinking, I would not have done any of this stuff. 

So yeah, even though it’s not as long as some of the streaks y’all have, it’s such an important milestone for me.

First Friday night last night sober in years.  First Saturday in a long time I didn’t decide “well it’s 11 am already so I’m good” and star pouring up a glass of wine.  Here are a few things I have noticed today:

1- I still thought about drinking today, more in the evening after dinner (this is why I am here) 
2- my face is not as red as it normally is- I always felt like under florescent lights my face looked red , kinda post beach vacation look 
3- I have smiled a lot more than normal today
4- I have had a few anxious moments 
5- the best thing I have noticed is if I want o go out in the afternoon- go get ice cream, go pick take out - boom get in the car and go! Most Saturdays  around  5 I was trying to figure out who would deliver because
I never could drive by this time and if anyone wanted to hang out they would have to come to me.  I never realized how much freedom I was constantly losing by drinking all day Saturday just because “it’s Saturday” 
6- MSO and I have had real conversations today and actually shared a few good genuine laughs.  We had a good relationship before but we were both drinking and most convos were more loud debates about randomness or meaningless conversation.  
6- going sober as a couple has been tough but has been a relationship building process -  figuring out who you are sober then who you are as a sober couple is almost like getting to know someone all over again

While I’m uncomfortable with the term alcoholic, I was more than comfortable living that life. Had my behavior been my job that I’d be paid to do ... I would’ve risen to be CEO with an excellent annual bonus. 

I’m on day 5, despite my 23 year old (who is living with me until she graduates) telling me that once she moves, she will have nothing to do with me. That news was given on my sober NYE. I stayed sober, though I sulked in my room. 

And I turned 56 yesterday. 

I’m thinking of a quick trip to Cancun alone. I have an extra week off this coming week. 

I have four grownish children (whom I raised lovingly on my own), three of whom live at home still. Despite that, I have no one who is involved/cares enough to ask whether I should go. 

It’s $850 for flights, hotel, breakfast for four nights. If I continue not drinking I could easily pay myself back. 
 
I don’t want to spend one week at home not drinking when I could spend a week not drinking  but also traveling. But I really can’t make a decision. 

I’ve lived for others for a long time. It’s time to live for me. But is Cancun what I should do?

Being alcohol-free has meant no hangovers. I’ve loved that. But it hasn’t meant I’m better at deciding anything(s) definitively. 

I could stay home and hike/practice yoga and listen to my three in-home beloveds speak to me as if I didn’t love them more than anything ever. (My goodness, they’ve become less than nice!) Or I could get out of town. 

If we were together having a non-alcoholic beverage, what would you tell me?

P.S. I’m a teacher so $850, while a good price, is still quite a sum for me. 

Thanks for any info.

That was a pretty big sign that maybe I had a psychological dependency.  Also, I had all the common shit once I had gone past the pleasure point.  Feet feeling taut, dehydrated, awful hangovers, pins and needles in my legs at night, etc.  I never did anything to damage relationships or jobs thankfully, but it just wasn't enjoyable anymore and I realized that it had reached it's end.

1. This time 6 months ago I was in hospital and hadn't long been told I may not make it 4 weeks. I was severely jaundiced and everything my blood was telling the docs was that my liver was shutting down and my heart was under stress to keep up with it all. 

2. Diagnosed with cirrohsis, devastated but I had to things to hold onto. One being my family and seeing my little girl grow up and two that I am relatively young and otherwise healthy. With determination and drive I could at least slow this thing to a crawl. 

3. I am living proof that it is possible to quit. It is NOT easy and the moment you think it is will be the moment you fail.

4. This is not my first time trying to quit for good.

5. For those wishing they need more help there is none finer than this good forum. I also registered with the local Liver trust group and through that I started to put a plan together. 

6. I wrote letters to all of my loved ones 6 months ago, those letters remain unsent. I plan to keep it that way.

If you've ever seen my posts, you know my sobriety is very on/off. I'm not nearly successful as a lot of you, but I just wanted to share a small victory in my baby steps to a healthier me.

For the past 2ish years, whenever I'd get sick with a common cold or something, I'd drink anyway. And I mean DRINK. I didn't care that it would make that cold last 2-3 weeks. If it was the weekend, I was drinking, no ifs, ands, or buts. 

I'm currently fighting an cold but I have chosen to *remain sober*, if nothing else but for the duration of the cold. And surprise surprise, I'm *already* feeling so much better and I've only been sick for like 2 days? What is this sorcery? Lol it's amazing how much better our bodies can fight off illness when we aren't poisoning them!

It seems like a no-brainer, but it really is a mini victory for me. I'm starting to actually give a shit about how my body feels. Stay healthy, my friends! IWNDWYT.",26

I came home from Vegas feeling good as new until I realized I had caught something. Shucks. 

I know being sober is going to come with some challenges. The biggest for me is rearranging my life. I live in what is basically an alcohol mecca and my life revolved around it. All my friends do is drink so I've had to cut most of them out. If I'm honest most of them are just drinking buddies. No matter how far I'm in to sobriety I don't think I'll ever like hanging out at bars without drinking, and the drug scene is something I want to avoid too. They kinda go hand in hand.

So, I’ve been reflecting on 419 days of sobriety, and I think anyone considering or struggling may find some inspiration in this post.

Here’s what I did with my 419 days of sobriety (so far, and I may be forgetting some things):

* levelled up my bouldering from a 3 to a 5

* Ran a half-marathon

* Read (or listened to) 32 books

* Wrote about 30 blogs on writing (with 20 in the last 20 days)

* Added 400 subscribers to my email list (and monetized this list)

* Sold over 1000 copies of my first novel 

* Discovered how to be happy, single, and alone with my thoughts

* Discovered the power of meditation

* Faced my crippling, public speaking fears and did a presentation at an event for work in front of 80+ people

* Got over my social anxiety and now enjoy being at social events while sober

* Finished the third draft of my second novel 

* Came up with a complete marketing plan for my second novel

* Published 3 short stories to literary magazines

* Started a podcast with a good friend (and am now 15 episodes deep!)

* Increased all my compound lifts (squats, deadlifts, bench) by about 30+ pounds

* Am proud of what I look like without a shirt on for the first time in my life

* Also removed any shame I have over showing that body (and why should I? I generally find people who hate on others for showing off their body are projecting insecurities of their own).

* Got a director role at my marketing company and a large salary increase

* Edited my good friend's first novel, which inspired the next point.

* Sold my first full-length novel editing freelance project to a stranger.

* Travelled without drinking

* Saved $20,0000

* Wrote (Nearly) every day

* Took 2 writing classes at the University and got an A+ in both.

And that’s just the beginning. 2020 is only going to build on this success.

I gave this analogy to recently to a friend on sobriety: 

If I told you there’s a pill out there that will improve your body, your confidence, your intelligence, your focus, your productivity, and your happiness by 20%, would you take it?

Almost everyone would say yes in a heartbeat. Well, there’s an anti-pill. It’s called stopping drinking. Stop taking it and you’ll see almost every important statistic in your life rise by 20% (a number I just made up on the spot).

And I don’t mean this to sound preachy. Your mileage may vary, but this has just been my experience, and may not be yours. Some people are out there crushing life with enjoying the odd drink. This cannot be me (and unlikely, for most people in this subreddit, cannot be you either). 

But I’d highly suggest giving it at least 30 days and seeing how you feel and January / February are the 2 best months to give it a shot, in my opinion.

----- 

But I’d also like to remind everyone, that it’s not all peaches and cream.

In case you go through this, I’ve also had major episodes of depression, anxiety, insecurity, boredom and unsureness during this period, because not drinking doesn’t fix everything (and these are completely normal emotions that shouldn’t always be feared. Sometimes they’re simply telling you something).",43

- Go to therapy regularly
- Start BJJ lessons
- Start Guitar lessons
- Start working out

How did I do?

- I have regularly scheduled meetings with my therapist.
- I have investigated local BJJ instructors and have selected a class.
- No progress on guitar lessons.
- I have been doing a lot of physical outdoor activity, but no structured workouts. Skiing, hunting, hiking. I start structured workouts today now that holidays and whatnot are out of the way.

I've lurked here for months, but this is my first post. I've been drinking heavily for almost 20 years. I managed 7 months of sobriety in 2014, but I couldn't maintain it when work got stressful. I've been unemployed for four years, overweight for 17, and depressed since I was 5.

I've been dreaming of sobriety for months. If I want to survive my 30s,  I have to do this. New Year's Eve (well, early New Year's Day) was my last drink. No crazy party, no blackout binge, just a long-awaited, almost unimaginable goodbye to two decades of self-destruction and cowardice. 

Last night saw the end of a relationship that's defined my life for the past 4 years. The end was and wasn't expected, and it was and wasn't the result of my alcohol consumption, but it was inevitable. I despise who I've become. Alcohol didn't make me into that person, but it played a role in allowing me to ignore my moral compass. I hate the ways I hurt the other person, ways I hadn't dared to face before last night. Alcohol allowed me to avoid being honest with myself about my motives and actions. I thought I needed it. I do not. 

As the conversation died down, I knew what was going to happen. I was going to CVS at 1:30 am to buy alcohol. If anything ever called for a drink or 6, this was it.

But somehow I didn't. Instead, I cried. I paced. I watched in my mind's eye as a decade's worth of insights and regrets rolled over me. I cried more. And I went to sleep. Sober.

I woke up. I made coffee. I am heartbroken. My children are hungry.

Specifically, memories with her kids. 
Mine is gratitude. Like.... being able to fully experience it. I sometimes have these moments where time seems to stand still, for just a second, and I am in absolute awe of the abundance of my life... the abundance of love and family and all of the blessings that have been bestowed upon me. 
Now let me be clear: by no means do I LIVE in this state LOL. When I say I have these moments, I mean a few seconds here and there. However, this is something I never experienced when actively drinking. Contrastly, I knew that I SHOULD be feeling these thing, I have always been aware, like on a logical level, that I’m extremely lucky... but it was like I couldn’t FEEL it. This brought another layer of guilt along with it. Does that make any sense? Maybe someone here can articulate this better for me. 
Anyway... this ability to get  submerged in authentic and overwhelming gratitude, if only for a moment, is my non-negotiable. I’m pretty sure that when I’m in the cycle of addiction, I don’t fully experience any emotion. This is a trade I’m not willing to make.

I cannot believe of how a good a year I had. It all started January 4/2018. It wasn’t a New Years resolution to quit drinking either. I won’t get much into it, but I did something terrible. No one got hurt in any way, which is the only good thing that happened that day. 

I am currently 28 years old. I’ve been a severe alcoholic for about 3 years before I quit. I’ve been to treatment. I’ve been to psychiatrists. I’ve been to doctors. I’ve been to AA meetings. The power of alcohol was greater than my will to stop drinking. It was very controlling of me. I honestly thought I’d never be 3 months sober, let alone a year. I honestly had no real plans of quitting either. I just pretend quit to make my immediate family and my employers happy. 

Anyhow, I am extremely excited about my milestone. This has literally been the best year of my life. And what made it so good was that I have one year of sobriety under my belt. I attend AA too. My friends that I met there are the real MVPs. Without them, I wouldn’t be writing this. I lost most my lifelong friends because of alcoholism. I am super happy now though. That is the past.

I went home. And I kept going home after every shift. I have a nice pile of ginger beers now. I tried quitting last year, I got around 50-60 days. Since then, even though I was drinking again, I never (and obviously still don't) keep alcohol in the house. I thought that was enough. It wasn't.

I (31F) am an alcoholic. I've known for many years now and I just recently admitted it and started taking becoming sober serious 8 days ago. Hardest decision ever but I am taking it one day at a time. So now my mother (55) and best friend (31F) also have a serious problem with abusing alcohol but I don't know if I should express to them they should consider stop drinking as well or just focus on my own problem. I don't want to come off like I'm judging them. I know first hand them type of "" you should stop drinking"" conversations normally dont end well. I also dont want to seem like since I'm 8 days clean I'm better then either one of them because I know I'm not. I just can see how the alcohol is ruining they life since I haven't been out of my mind drunk lately. For ex. Over the pass 8 days I received calls from both of them 6 out of 8 of those days with completely crazy stories & events that could of ended so bad for them both and I'm genuinely concerned at the end of the day. 

A little back story...as you can imagine both of them was my drinking partner, anytime we got together it's bottles all morning, noon & night. So I dont want to seem like a hypocrite at all but I would like them to join me on this journey as well before it's too late. I just don't know how to go about it the right way, if it's even a right way or if I should just leave it alone & mind my business.

Thank you guys in advance for any advice &  feedback.

I was tempted - but not that much - thanks to all of the good advice and warmth from this place.  I knew I was only being driven by the idea of my first drink.  I knew what it would lead to (having 3 or 4 mixed drinks, driving my kids home and stopping to get more booze to drink at home).

They craving started; a cold fist in the pit of my stomach, so cold it hurts; constantly lying to me, saying the only fix is the sauce.  My drive home was filled with a vicious internal argument.  I checked /r/stopdrinking, and found several people had posted to support me; and one even checked back on me to see how I was doing. THANK YOU ALL WHO DID THAT. Just seeing that nearly... VERY NEARLY... pulled me back from the edge.

Still I failed, and got my pint. I was just at 2/3 through it, when I remembered again the people of this community.  My check in yesterday was my very first one. My post yesterday was my first post on /r/stopdrinking. (heck it was my 2nd actual post on reddit in 8 years of lurking) and my first check-in got voted, and responded to. My first post got voted and responded to. This community jumped on the new guy and said WE WILL HELP YOU, YOU CAN DO THIS. And there I was, drinking anyway. I stared at the remaining few shots in the bottle, and angry at my failure, I dumped them down the drain.  That made me feel a little better about myself, in spite of my failure. 

So I want to say I am sorry i failed last night, but I am trying again. Thank you all that jumped on my posts yesterday to help, (Posts that caused my inner reddit lurker to scream in fear!) and thanks to anyone in the future who keeps responding. I will keep trying.

Before that, I knew I needed to lose some weight (around 10-15 pounds). I ate mostly real food (not much processed stuff) and exercised 2-3 times per week so I just “couldn’t understand” why I wasn’t losing weight. My healthy choices weren’t enough to keep the weight off when I was drinking every weekend.  I can’t believe I allowed myself to feel like shit for so long because I didn’t want to stop drinking. 

Fast forward to now: I’m down 10 pounds and I’ve started a new HIIT/Yoga class that kicks my ass but makes me feel so empowered and strong. Alcohol never made me feel strong or beautiful. Truly, it made me feel gross and tired and bloated.

I am very grateful to wake up hangover free this morning. I’m also grateful that I’m not bloated, and my pants fit 😋. It’s the little things. IWNDWYT.",196

At least 20 people in my department resigned because of the way they were treated.  My direct boss quit and I had to report to someone who was a nightmare - abusive, bullying.  The day my boss quit, in August, I drank for the first time in 500+ days.  

After that  drunk, I went a month or so sober.  But then I fell back to the old habits: daily drinking, binges on the weekends.  I'd spend the days I didn't have to work in a state of unconsciousness, drinking myself back to sleep as soon as I woke up.  I wanted to die.  

I got a new job, which promises to be wonderful.  I start in a few days.  But the new job didn't fix what was wrong with me.   Despite the good news, I kept drinking.    After the last day on the old job, when I should have felt free, I went out and got whiskey.    

I couldn't stop drinking. It was hurting my relationships with my girlfriend and my children.  I was doing damage.

On December 30th, I went to AA.  This was very difficult for me because I'm such an introvert.  But I found out AA is wonderful for me.  The stories of hope, the wisdom, the fellowship.  AA is helping me learn that though the job was very bad, the root of why I drank was the way I dealt with it.  Instead of accepting the situation and doing what I could  to change it, I sought oblivion.    

I've been going twice a day to AA.  I'm going to do 90 meetings in 90 days.  I also know I need therapy for both my underlying problems and the trauma of what happened at the job.  I'll go when my new insurance kicks in.

There so many here at stopdrinking who have supported me through this difficult time. Thank you for caring.  I'm going to keep going, one day at a time.  IWNDWYT",21

After a really ugly relapse I basically drank myself into the hospital. I got a cough 12 weeks ago that I ignored, powered and drank my way through. I kept drinking drinking drinking and ignoring the situation which led to pnuemonia and a flu that sent me to the hospital. I would have asthma triggered by the drinking but still just couldn’t stop. I’m home now and so beaten up. My lungs are so fragile and damaged. My emotions are a wreck. But I will not drink today and I am so so done. I’m so scared. There is an invisible thread that propels me to that next drink and I am so so scared it will happen again. This feels like a turning point. And I know the pivot towards drinking again will be ruinous. And I’m fearful of facing life sober, but I’ve got to take it one day at a time (one breath as the case might be in my current recovery). I need some outside help to cope with long standing crushing anxiety. I have that appointment Monday. I plan to go to an AA Mtg when I’m a bit stronger to reconnect with some IRL sober connections. This disease progresses, I am learning that. I don’t want to see how much farther it plans to take me.",3

I waited until we were alone later on and told them I had misgivings about a lot of my actions in 2019, and was going to make an effort this year to change. I said I did more things in 2019 that made me sad than any other year.



It felt good to open up even a little bit in person.

It’s been quite the ride so far, but it’s worth it every day. Even on the hard days. Adding to problems by drinking will never make those problems easier to handle.


I can not do this alone. I needed all the help to get sober and I need help to stay sober. Doctor, therapy, AA, this sub, the chat, my friends, my fellows, literature, gratefulness, willingness, an open mind, connection, routine, honesty. The whole lot :). Getting help is a good thing, I needed and wanted to save my life. I am doing this for me, and by doing this for me, I can be reliable and present for the people I care about.


I wanted to be sober more than anything in the end, I wanted to live. To have a chance, to live a life with joy, laughter, peace of mind and honesty in it, instead of being sick and miserable all the time. I was so scared that my drinking was going to kill me, one way or another. What my alcohol addiction has done to me and the people around me is horrible. I never want to forget that. Like I have said here before: My drinking was robbing me of me. I hated every minute of it in the end. 


Is it hard work? Some days yes, the first months where especially hard, but each day I‘m learning more coping skills, each day I am grateful to wake up sober. I love that I have found my strength again, instead of feeling worthless, ashamed, anxious, depressed and completely lost all the time. I’m learning to embrace my life, the only one I have, one day at a time. I’m learning how to cherish it, with all the good and bad ( bad things still happen, also in sobriety) that life brings, instead of ruining it and feeling trapped 24/7 in the horrible cycle of drinking. 


Thank you all for being here. From day 1 to day 1000+ 
We need each other! To support, to celebrate, to learn from each other and to share our stories. 

Sobriety is the biggest gift I could give myself and the people (and animals) I care about, I am worthy of it and so are you! Don’t give up!! I will not drink with you today.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to \[/r/stopdrinking\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\*

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in \[/r/stopdrinking\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)), we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\*

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at \[/r/stopdrinking\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn’t:\*\*

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Two years ago I was living in San Diego, engaged to a wonderful person, dream job, beautiful apartment, etc. and I absolutely hated my life and who I had become. Now, I only drank beer and very occasionally hard liquor; so I couldn’t be an alcoholic, surely. I never drank in the mornings. I never missed work because I was too hungover. My girlfriend had said yes when I asked her to marry me, so my drinking couldn’t be that bad. I had what looked like a pretty successful life for someone my age. Thing was, I couldn’t go a damn day without having a drink. 

That morning I went to a 7am meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous. I kept going to meetings. Some were good, some weren’t for me. I found a sponsor that I could relate to. I worked on understanding the whole higher power concept. I worked the steps. I made friends with guys in the program. I became of service to others.

That’s why I am posting this tonight. For anyone who is questioning their relationship with alcohol, you’re in the right place. Whether you decide to stop drinking today, tomorrow or next year, /r/StopDrinking will be here for you, like it was for me. And I will forever be grateful for that.",55

Five years ago I got a DUI, quit for 2 years (mostly because I had a mandatory sobriety piece of my sentence) and felt fantastic. I started drinking again very slowly and carefully and within three years was back again, drinking a ton, blacking out, hiding booze, etc. 

When my family came to talk to me, I freaked out in so many ways. I immediately stopped, then drank a little bit over the holidays with the idea that I was getting ready to be done for good soon. 

I was angry at them for two months, but they were right, and it’s a relief in a way. I’ve been finding blogs, books, podcasts, audiobooks etc and have I pulled together a little cheering squad of sober friends and I’m working with an addictions therapist. 

Sounds like I’m set up for success, right? But I am scared and grieving and feeling lonely and impatient. 

I quit for good on New Year’s Eve, not New Year’s Day I loved this decision because I woke up feeling great and I’ve had a good couple days until this afternoon when I thought I was going to lose it. But I didn’t drink. Watching Netflix and I’m going to have some ice cream before going to bed. 

Check out a brand new book called Quit Like A Woman by Holly Whitaker. also Russell Brand’s book or audiobook called Recovery. They present two different views but are both excellent. 

So happy to find this forum. What an amazing, strong group of people! I appreciate your support!!!! 

I don’t get how to change my “profile” to reflect how many days I have???

2020-01-03 22:34:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ejr03q/thoughts_from_a_substance_use_therapist/,Thoughts from a substance use therapist.,"This is paper I wrote for fun from my experience as a counselor. 

Addicts experience something breathtaking when they can stretch their vision of themselves from the immediate present back to the past that shaped them and forward to a future that’s attainable and satisfying – Marc Lewis
 
How do you convince someone that their ability to make decisions is compromised as a result of something in their brain that is influencing the determination of their decisions before they even make them? This phenomenon becomes more prevalent on a daily basis when working with those who are suffering with substance use disorders. The predicament arises in the fact that because individuals are conscious, they believe they are in complete control over the decisions that they make. These decisions that are made, to the individual, are grounded in reason and rational thinking that is aimed with their best interest in mind. Unfortunately, these decisions have the capacity for self-destruction because due to the troubled history that each person has encountered. Memory has an integral role in decisions. Memory utilizes the past to understand the present to anticipate the future. If an individual’s past has had trauma and many forms of distress, their memory is going to ensure that their decisions are protective in nature. This means that decisions will be geared towards the avoidance of pain, avoidance of discomfort, the avoidance of stress, and ultimately, the avoidance of change. This is troubling because when exploring healthy life changes with someone, a therapist will encourage that individual to identify changes that can be made that will hopefully improve that person’s quality of life. That is where the challenge arises. Ideally, someone can gain insight and harness motivation to change to make positive life adjustments. The thing is, this does not always work out because something stops that individual from drawing power from their insight and turning it into behaviors that are conducive to a new way of life. This leads to frustration, shame, guilt, and eventually depression as someone who has all of the desire to make changes, just cannot put it together to make a difference. One begins to learn that the unconscious mind often has a completely different agenda than the individual. One learns that there is comfort in the chaos because it is familiar, even to the point where the chaos leads to complete isolation, socially, physically, and emotionally.
​When looking at the benefits of using substances/alcohol, it cannot be ignored that the effects of the high, produce such a powerful feeling of safety and security. The high is a safe experience and no matter how much pain an individual encounters, the high is there to shield them from the full impact of the situation. It is impossible to isolate addiction to one singular event in time, however, different forms of trauma are the one trait that all of my clients have experienced. I have learned that addiction always begins with pain and always ends with pain. The high feels like that surge of warmth and protection that comes from the embrace of a loved one or the love that was missing for an individual who never had the opportunity to experience it. It is no surprise that opioids are the endorphins that are released in the human body when a mother is holding and begins to soothe her distressed infant. Unfortunately, the high turns on the user and the individual becomes even more trapped in walls of isolation that are reinforced by bricks of shame, fear, and despair, but this is still a state of being that is desired because life on life’s terms is too overwhelming and unbearable. The frustrating part of addiction is the desperation to get clean when using, but also the desperation to get high when clean. Where does someone turn when stuck in this persistent state of hopeless of always knowing where they want to be, but never being where they are?
​The effects of the environment on the individual are impactful. Fortunately, this is something that can be utilized to foster change. I have heard that the goal of psychotherapy should always be security. This is a challenge in itself because if someone has grown up in a toxic environment with abuse or neglect, the body is going to not allow the individual to feel secure and thus change is ultimately prevented. I have seen and explored this problem through my work and through my own experience. The answer has to be connection. Connection to a person, who provides unconditional positive regard, like Carl Rogers emphasized. This person can be the therapist or another person, who can provide the stability and unwavering support that conveys the message that I am here with you no matter what your emotions and feelings tell you. The therapist/person has to show the individual through their personality and support, that they can be the safety net the person needs. This happens through sending cues of safety that help the other person start to turn off that flight or fight response system or the withdrawal system. This is not an easy process, but through consistent support, it can be accomplished. If an environment caused an individual to make decisions that are protective to adapt to that environment, an environment can also be fostered to illustrate to that person that they don’t always have to protect themselves and that there is so much power in vulnerability. Through trust and support, a person can learn how to tell his or her body “calm down, were not in danger,” and allow themselves to experience the freedoms that connection can offer. Through co-regulation (learning how to manage emotional states with someone else) with someone, a person can eventually learn self-regulation (self-soothe). They can learn that they can manage the pain that is inevitable in life. People will always experience pain in life, that is a reality. The growth starts when people lead that they don’t have to face the pain alone. Through connections with other people, those suffering with substance use disorders can learn that they do not need use drugs to get their needs met because they can get those needs through other people, naturally. Change will always be hard, but through support change doesn’t have to about suffering and can lead to new meaning.",10

Longtime lurker. First time poster. I don’t know if I am able to post this here but it seems like it fits. 


I have had a bad relationship with alcohol for some time now. It’s always been in the back of my mind whether or not I would try to be sober.  I tried practicing sobriety in solidarity with some friends of mine who started AA programs but I ended up not really being successful because of my own faults. 


A couple days ago, I hit a terrible low in which I almost got severely hurt. The next day, what I thought was a hangover from hell was actually alcohol withdrawal-like symptoms. Yesterday I made a phone call to figure out where local AA meetings were and I went to my first one today. 


It was really embarrassed at first. I haven’t told any of my friends or family that I’m doing this because I really want to do this on my own. But I walked in and I felt really good about it. I felt understood for once.

And had a really close call,"We just got off a cruise that was a year in the planning.  While onboard I hit my official 6 month sober  (On New Years Day no less) of which I am very proud.

Some thoughts -

 1. I had a really close call that scared me even if it wasn't my fault.   I treated myself to the unlimited mocktail package for the week and was having a great time sampling all the virgin drinks.  I was careful to watch the bartenders closely to make sure because  I have always been paranoid that I would accidentally get alcohol.  Well, it happened.  At dinner (I couldn't see the bartender from our table) I ordered a club soda and cranberry juice and one sip and I realized it had a good double shot of vodka in it.   It was an honest mistake - the bartender must have just automatically threw it in.   I pushed it away and I said ""I can't have this.  There is for sure alcohol in here!"".  The server felt bad (not his fault).  While I don't count that as a slip, I still felt BAD.  What I am taking from that is how instant the repulsion was when I tasted the vodka.  It was instinctive to push it away.  I think that is a good sign

2. It was surprisingly easier than I thought it was going to be to not miss booze.  Hotels/vacations have always been excuses to drink for me and I was concerned I would have that longing especially on a ship where everyone is drinking all day and night.  I didn't feel like I was missing out and I think that is because I had so many really great alternatives that were all included and unlimited.  I chalk that success up to being prepared/having a plan and alternatives 

3. I made it to 6 months!   If you had told me a year ago I would now be 6 months sober I not only would have laughed in your face, I would have asked why the HELL I would want to do something like that.  But here I am- proud.


Onwards and upwards - I SEE YOU, one year.  I am coming for you.

I wasn't not totally dry but cut down a huge amount, I can count the number of times I drank anything and can describe in detail the two or three times I drank too much. 

  This took a lot of effort which mainly came through reflection and a major change in fundamental attitudes. 

  But I think it has pre-occupied me often. Often I would sit and read posts on here when I should have been doing something else like studying. I would spend long amounts of time brooding over something someone said to me about not drinking. Feeling sorry for myself because my social life is not what it was, or feeling smug because I'd reached another month without drinking. 

  What I want to do now is get on with sober living without constantly dredging through the past, but this is hard. I often think back instead of thinking in the here and now or thinking to the future. I quit drinking because alcohol was defining me, and I don't want to be defined by alcohol now I am not drinking. 

  Does anyone have the same problem? I'm thinking of tactics to move on a little. For example, I think cutting Reddit and social media right down to the bare minimum would help, as I won't be mired in memories.",5

Last time I tried in early 2019, I only made it 3 weeks.  After spending new years with my girlfriend's family (and lot's of young, coughing babies) I find myself coming down with a cold. When I drank, having a cold on top of being hungover was horrible. Having a sore throat, fever, aching body in addition to dry mouth and a headache? It was always so bad that I would find myself drinking as soon as I got home, so I wouldn't feel anything. 

It seems like I forgot what it was like to be sick while sober. It's... not that bad! I mean don't get me wrong it's not ideal, but it's not half as bad as when I was drinking.

I’m getting married this year and we’re beginning the steps of planning a family... I want to be in the best shape physically and mentally to remember and enjoy these eventful moments. I will not let alcohol control my life anymore. It is time to take care of myself and learn to love who I am. It’s going to be hard and I’m scared but today is day 3 and I’m still alive.

2020-01-03 19:56:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ejoy8u/made_it_3_days/,Made it 3 days,"As title says: made it 3 days. Made it a bit further last month. At the start of December, I wrote here, and then made it a week before my spouse said “are you not drinking *forever*?” at an event with alcohol and I broke and had a couple beers. My month didn’t go crazy after that, but I knew I’d have to reset my badge and decided to wait till New Year’s. I did.. and made it to today. I don’t know why I broke and why today of all days I had a beer. I felt great the past two days. I drank cranberry juice in my favorite wine glass last night and went to bed feeling good. I was so proud of my good decisions. 

But for some reason, beer was all I could think about today. I had a first visit with a new therapist — which was good, and I felt brave enough to explain that alcohol has been a problem for me — but ended up stranded after the appointment due to a flat tire. I was next to the street in my town that has many of the local bars. I made it a few blocks walking... and then I decided to get coffee at a local art gallery. but when I came in, it turns out they have beers on drought as well. I was weak. I ordered one. I drank it, feeling guilty the entire time. And here I am now.

A few observations of this experience: 1) beer doesn’t actually taste *that* good. We *think* it tastes good, but objectively, it’s not sweet, it doesn’t really taste amazing. It’s kind of like stale corn. 2) it’s not worth it. I think I was craving it because I’m stressed about some things at home and at work. Well — I’m still stressed about the things at both home and at work. And now I’ve lost a) money and b) time in tackling the things I was stressed about. On top of that, I *added* stress by having a thing I have to hide. I had planned on making January a dry month, and talked my spouse into doing it. Now I’ve been dishonest by doing the thing I am asking him to do. That’s just plain not right. I am a person who believes in having integrity and this is not what integrity is. 3) In spite of last two observations, I still *wanted* and *purchased* beer.

I wish I had good answers, about how I overcame this vice. I wish I did. Instead I am looking to you. How did you overcome your cravings? Help me learn from your experiences. If you managed to hide your addiction from most people in your life (this is what I’m trying to do), how did you find support in weak moments? Who can I turn to? I’m in a situation where I am new in my community in general and seeking mentorship from a particular person (who does not know that I struggle with alcohol, but I know she had a parent who did). I am afraid to ever say anything about alcohol lest it color that relationship. 

Any help and advice appreciated, because I’m feeling pretty overwhelmed right now.",5

2020-01-03 19:39:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ejoq30/struggling/,Struggling,"It's been hard these past few weeks, friends. Harder than it's even been since I quit. I desperately want a drink.

I know, logically, that it will most likely lead to me falling back into the old habits. It will be the first of many drinks, until I (hopefully) get fed up again and quit again. 

But I really crave that oblivion the drink gave me. I want to go away for a while, get out of my head, stupify myself until I pass out so this night will be over. I want to shirk all my responsibilities, I want to throw away everything I've built for myself. I want to burn all my relationships to the ground, I want to punish people for getting close to me, I want them to hurt. I want to watch from above--an outsider, indifferent--as I throw my life away. 

But I keep talking myself out of taking that first drink. I keep dragging myself out of bed in the morning, going to work, coming home, sitting here alone, trying to get out of my own head long enough to accomplish something. Some days are better than others. Some are worse. Sometimes the melancholy gets so strong I feel like I can't breathe. 

See, I know that drinking won't help make my life better. I know it will only lead to pain. The hard thing is that sometimes my brain tells me I want that pain. Maybe it's because I'm so used to it, like I'm feeling nostalgic for it or something. That's the thing I have to focus on. Figuring out why I want that pain and seeing if there's anything I can do about it.

I know one thing for sure, though. This place, you people, gives me strength. I feel like when I read these posts and participate, that it isn't so bad, that I can do it. That we can do it together.

I’m wondering if I could ever be happy with myself again after losing all that.

Has anyone who has lost something as massive as their wife or partner even become happy with their new life?

I also feel like I’m the only person to have lost so much. But I’m guessing there’s other examples of people with an amazing life and partner who have lost it all... and ended up broke in a public rehab feeling like the lowest tier human in society?

1. I drank alcoholically for 30 years,
2. I am just about the least disciplined person I know,
3. I was a spiritual neophyte,
4. I consider myself to be very independent,
5. I am a painful introvert avoiding groups,
6. I dislike being told what to do or following directions,
7. I would rather learn from my own mistakes than from others' experience,
8. I had multiple co-occuring addictions, 
9. I suffered from anxiety and depression, and
10. I am spoiled and want to get my own way, right now (impatient).

Despite these impediments to recovery, how is it possible that I received longer-term sobriety?  Alcohol beat me into submission (3 DUI's, divorce, health consequences, etc.) and I became desperate enough to want and seek help.  I simply had to stop drinking because the consequences of my drinking had become too painful for me to bare.  I begrudgingly went to AA, followed directions I didn't like, and haven't had to drink or drug since January 3, 2004.  

Early sobriety was an emotional roller coaster as my body and mind healed.  My mental obsession with drinking was removed once I completed the Steps during my first year of recovery and I haven't had a troubling thought about drinking in the 15 years since.  This is just my own personal experience.

I have not posted on Reddit before.  Although this forum helped me when I stopped drinking 4 years ago.

As everyone says here, there is no one way.  Support of either family or friends is extremely helpful. 

I sank to a low point 5 years ago.  I was sneak drinking almost every day.  Stopping for nips on the way home from work. Going to sleep crying every night why can't I stop.  Waking up each day with a conviction to stop drinking starting that day.  A conviction that would slowly fade in the early afternoon to the rationalization of just one more night of drinks wouldn't hurt.  To getting in my car to head home and feeling like it was on autopilot to the liquor store. An incredibly destructive daily cycle - physically and emotionally.

I had a extended family vacation coming up that was a source of fear and anxiety.  I was lucky to find this reddit thread along with a few other inspirations that brought it all to a head for me in late 2015. 

I felt a shame of feeling like I couldn't control something that I felt like I should be able to control.  A switch went off in my brain when I realized that control was a false narrative with Alcohol.  In retrospect, a true epiphany for me and a liberating feeling to realize that control was not in my power. 

The next step for me was to be able to tell those that I loved that I was an Alcoholic.  I knew it would be difficult to say outloud so I decided to send an email. (I have copied that email below).  It took the better part of two days to draft the words - editing and reediting.  I finally realized I was trying to find a way to delay, I ultimately just had to hit send. 

I feel lucky and blessed that I am 4 years Sober.  I don't want to minimize the struggles that one of you feels.  I want to offer what helped me in terms of stopping.  The admitting I had a problem and that I could not control the problem openly to my family and loved ones was the key for me. 

Find what works for you! You can do this!  Don't stop trying!  There are people you love or that are close to you that will help you.

Good luck to all in 2020!

Email I sent to family:

I drafted this yesterday.  It was difficult, but felt great when I was done and I slept really well last night.   I have read and edited it a number of times.   Don't parse the words too much as I think the continued editing is a delay tactic for not sending.  I just need to hit send.

C, M, J, M, K

I have been contemplating this email deeply over the past several days; unsure how to express my thoughts – or even if I should.   Amazingly, this is one of those times when it feels like divine intervention has occurred - a real timely life line of sorts for me.

I really don’t want to sound melodramatic, so please bear with me.  I know I don’t have the courage to say this to all of you aloud, which is why it is imperative for me to get this out in writing to those I love the most.  I am an alcoholic.

As I have told K before, I feel ashamed and humiliated that I can’t control this.  I hate how I feel, who I am, what I say (among other things) when I drink.  I hate sneaking drinks and lying to K about it - living in fear of being asked am I drinking again.  I realize that I am living the lie of being able to control this.

I set out on a great path after our vacation in 2013.  I got into a great rhythm stopped drinking, ate well and was exercising regularly. 

 Mid 2014 was a disaster.   A confluence of events: S\`s summer troubles, L’s paralysis and K's health combined to elevate stress.  Instead of asking for help,  I started drinking again, thinking I can handle it and work my way through it.  Obviously a mistake.

Now, 17 months later, I am looking in the mirror having gained all of the weight back.  Seeing a reflection of a person I do not like – physically or emotionally.  I have been thinking of this 2015 vacation with more dread than fun and anticipation.  Dread of the shame of how far I have fallen in the last 17 months.  Dread of the humiliation of facing all of you all and not being able to explain myself.  These thoughts accelerated my drinking.

I know I have been withdrawn over the past 12 months – a real negative space.  Trying to avoid answering questions about how I am doing.  In a circular path of self destruction.   As a result, I have added a tremendous amount of stress to K’s life -  for that I am truly sorry.  I need to change.

Back to the divine intervention of the article - gratitude and stress.  I have not stepped back recently and really thought about what I am grateful for in my life.  As I started to think about it, I realized it really did help to focus on the  positives and relieve some stress.  Obviously not an end all, but it got me to this point of sending an email.  I realize I need to head down a different path from the one I have been on for a long time.

I am grateful for a number of things – most if which revolves around family.  I am grateful to have K with her love, understanding, and patience.  I am grateful for our kids S, L and P – through each of their individual travails, I see strong, good, decent, loving people.  I am grateful for mom – your strength and desire to push and challenge.  I am grateful to my siblings  M, J, and C for all of your help, guidance, and love over the years.  I can't overstate how important you all are to me.

The epiphany for me was finally understanding that the shame and humiliation I felt for not being able to control my drinking is really misguided.  I have come to realize this is not controllable it is a real disease.   What I need to focus on is help and trusting in all of you.  I need to be able to say it aloud to those I trust and work hard stay the course.

As I said at the outset, I really wasn’t sure I could say it out loud to each of you.  I may have downcast eyes at first when I see you in a few days.  However, the cathartic feeling I have right now is powerful.

I know I am doing the right thing by telling this to everyone now – ahead of our holiday together.  I really wasn't sure how I would be when we are together.. Living the lie and trying to maintain a facade.

There isn't a dire emergency circumstance.   No need for immediate concern.  I really do not want or need a drink.   Mainly,  I feel empowered and am just looking forward to seeing each of you over the next few days.  I truly just want to hug you all and tell each of you how grateful I am to have you in my life.",12

- Over the holidays, found myself pausing to look at beer or champagne and consider drinking some
- Didn't though; power of the not-drinking habit is real
- 511 days feels like way more than a year and a bit
- The longer I go without drinking, the more I notice how prevalent and normalized it is
- I had a weird moment where we had leftover champagne from a party and I encouraged a friend (who drinks) to drink some to help us get rid of it - I'm still occasionally defaulting to drinking culture
- Overall, I rarely think about drinking
- I'm really happy with where I'm at now compared to where I was last year
- My rock bottom was good for one thing: motivation to change. The further away I get from it, the less motivated I act. How to hang onto that motivation?

Not drinking is solidly the best choice I continue to make every day. If you're just starting: https://i.imgur.com/i00ueKV.jpg

2020-01-03 15:21:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ejl409/a_love_letter_to_antabuse/,A Love Letter to Antabuse,"This time last year I was in a 28 day inpatient rehab. I spent Christmas and New Years. I was reluctant to go, as it would mean I would be missing Christmas and New Years with my toddler. In the end I told myself “I’m missing this time with her so I will never have to miss another.”
Rehab changed my life. It was an incredible. I learned so much about the brain, addiction, the coping skills that were killing me.
I was sober for six months, and then one day I thought to myself “I can drink this one time.”
The trigger was a new relationship. I was visiting a guy out of town that I really liked. I thought that if I have a little to drink before our reunion I would be more relaxed, open, fun. This was not the case.
Of course, this done drink turned into months of abuse. I would binge, spending days locked away and alone (I am a secret drinker. I even hide the bottles in my home between chugs.) I remained this way, and it kept getting more and more out of control. Every morning I would wake up, look at myself in the mirror and say, out loud “Remember,  you do not want to drink. If the voice tells you it is ok to do tonight it is lying. It isn’t you. Don’t listen to it.” I quit my job with the knowledge that I would be fired for never showing up.
That didn’t work. I was drinking around the clock, spending my weekends in blackout, drinking 8-12 bottles of wine in a 24 hour period. (I am 33, 5”4’ and 115 pound F)
Three weeks ago I could have died. I only remember bits of it. I had a boy over and decided to have a couple drinks before he arrived. I don’t remember him leaving. The next memory is my ex standing in my door way saying he would not give me our daughter (I was to have her late that night) he had been pounding on my door and I was out cold.
Wanting to escape myself I picked a bag. I wanted to vanish, disappear. I wanted to leave this earth and leave the minds of everyone around me. I am not suicidal, so my actions don’t go to self harm but dissociation. I completely lose my self and inhabited by the demon of addiction. The next memory was of me walking around my neighborhood. Then a quick memory of me checking myself into a hotel.
In my black out I called my friend and he came to my hotel. He slept with me (slept, as in stayed with me and held me). Black out. Charge another day to hotel and continue drinking. Mind you, this hotel was in walking distance to my home. I felt I did not exist in this world while drinking in this empty room. Next memory is taking a cab back to my apartment, and then I go black again, spending 4 days drinking, sleeping. I did not eat for three of them.
I completely left my mind and body for nearly a week.
I wake up with the utter fear of death. This was going to kill me. I had zero control.
I don’t “crave” alcohol. I don’t go to a bar and feel tempted, nor do I feel triggered when others drink around me. No, I drink to leave myself, leave this world when I feel shame, guilt, or overwhelmed. My instant reaction to life is to take myself away of from it.
I began Antabuse. When I was pregnant I knew there was absolutely no way I could drink, and 9 months flew with the freedom of temptation. I simply can not drink on Antabuse. I am smart, I can always find justification to drink and I can always find a way to do it. Not with Antabuse, I can not drink. I just can not drink, it isn’t an option anymore.
Since taking Antabuse my life has felt this incredible freedom. Prior I had felt constant fear. It was as if my addiction was always lurking, stalking me and ready to kidnap me in my most vulnerable moment. It was an evil I was running from but was aware he would catch up to me at some point. Antabuse has given me freedom and has taken away the fear. I feel as though my addiction has been sentenced to prison. Like a victim a stalker, I don’t have to keep looking back in fear that he is following me.

Addiction is a life sentence. Let’s lock it away. Let’s win.

It lasted until Mid-Aug where I proceeded to blackout a a good friend’s wedding. Since then my life has been in a state of flux. I had got a new job, moved, and struggled to settle in to what should have been a familiar and welcomed transition. 

I kept drinking but was able to do so with an essence of moderation. Then New Years Eve and Day happened. I was reminded of the shame, embarrassment and guilt I have when it comes to my inability to enjoy drinking casually. Something I had also felt last New Years, where I was called out for my behavior. It was called out in a living way but called out nonetheless.

Yesterday was a foggy hangover that only had one component of clarity; a feeling of self-loathing coupled with fear. 

Let’s try this again. I only can hope that this sense of guilt and shame will transition into feeling empowered to remain sober. Today and everyday after.

I'd internally bemoan the fact that I knew I wasn't yet strong enough to go back to my old haunts, and stay sober.

Eventually, I found some some success, with a myriad of support channels: this sub, *This Naked Mind*, local meetings, and a SO that has quit with me.

So, now I go back to one of my old places.  I'm not tempted to drink but any means.  But it's where some of my friends work, and SO and I eat dinner there a couple of times a week.

I've done similar stuff at other places.  Have dinner, hang out.  Maybe find a karoke bar and sing a bit.

I thought I'd found the sweet spot.  And maybe, for some, it is.

But earlier today, I was reflecting on the past year, and thinking about a couple of karaoke nights in particular.

I look back, and... yeah, it was fun.  But I feel like I was trying to force my new, sober self into old ways of drinking entertainment,... just without the drinking.

I've also been shifting other things in my life.  So, late nights are being exchanged for early bedtimes & early mornings.

And i I'm thinking... I don't need that nightlife right now.  As much as I love singing, I don't love the rest of it.  Certainly not enough to exchange my health, sleep, and overall fitness just so I can sing a little in the middle of the night to a crowd of drunk people.

I'll take the quiet solitude of early mornings, thanks.

Took me eight months to realize that I don't *need* or even *want* my old lifestyle minus alcohol: I want something completely different where alcohol isn't even on the menu.",92

 So here’s my thought, I can surrender to the idea of a life without alcohol, as much as I miss it-I know I am unable to live a normal life with alcohol. But having sobriety be my identity as a 24 year old female just does not sit right with me. Have any of you stopped drinking but continued to smoke weed? I don’t think straight-edge fits me.

It's good not to be focused  on  when happy hour starts and planning  the day  around  it. I went through  a  period where I  felt a little  isolated but I  found reading   the  posts  here helped.  
I am amazed  at how well I  have been  sleeping and my blood  pressure dropped to normal.  I also  dropped  20 pounds.  If I  started drinking again  my doctor  would  certainly be  able to tell.  
At this stage  the big danger is to start thinking  I  have this alcohol  thing under control  and I  can be a moderate  drinker.  I will admit  that  when I  am tempted it's  difficult  to  think into the future  consequences of drinking.
The peace of mind that comes with success in staying sober is worth  the struggle and effort.  
So my advice  to anyone  struggling  with  staying  sober is to tough it out another  day. You will be proud of yourself  and that is a  victory.  Our lives improve sober one day at a time. Not quickly  but incrementally.  IWNDWYT",37

I have worked hard to build a life I should love- loving and supportive husband, 12+ years tenure at my enjoyable and well-paying job, close family near by, and the privilege of freedom to do anything I wanted. 

For no reason, I chose to spend all my off-work time drinking whiskey or rum right out of the bottle. At least a 750 every day.  Every day, trip, and event plan hinged around alcohol.   I don’t remember choosing to drink to excess; it was a gradual habit that escalated over the last 12 years since turning 21... until October 3rd. 

For me, this was the day of the harsh realization that i made myself so uncomfortable with how wasteful I have been with time, energy and health. 

I talked to a psychiatrist about medication options, ultimately deciding to try will power and accountability to myself, and my husband first.   

I haven’t had a sip, nor have I been seriously tempted to. Alcohol is a depressant and I think back to how worthless I felt Oct 2nd.  There is no elixir that will give back the 12 years of wasted time (no pun intended) and I never want to feel that self-inflicted sadness again.

Why the heck do I miss going to a microbrewery in the middle of the day?  I mean it is tied to an idea of fun that I had for years, but really it was just me sitting by myself in a room full of strangers (most of whom were there with other friends, kids, and dogs).  My Fiance is at work and a lot of times if I had the day off while she was at work I would go around the corner and have a couple, but in reality it would be hard for me to stop.  I hate the sensation of sobering up.  I usually just kept the buzz going throughout the day until I went to bed and sobered-up in my sleep.  Man, today is hitting a little hard.  Only day nine so it is still very early days and I am trying to retrain my head to not default to want a drink as my means of passing time, but boy is it a little rough at the moment.  I think there was a James Bond book that said the best drink of the day is the one right before the first one.  The idea of the drink is better than the drink itself.  For me having one only elevates the desire.  It does not satiate it.  If I have one today it will be a terrible struggle (and very uncomfortable for me) to try and hold-off having any more.  The struggle with myself to stop after one or two is so much of a pain in the neck that it really is better (at least right now anyway) to not have any at all.  Sober right now.  Sober this second.  Oddly enough we have a lot of booze in the house from NYE which we are going to be giving to a friend and it did not even cross my mind to drink any of that.  Do not want it really.  I guess I just want to get out of the house and socialize or at least be around other people for a few minutes.  I guess in reality I am not craving the alcohol.  I could drink in the house right now.  I mean, I do not want to throw away my nine days of progress, and really when I think about the booze in the house I still do not really want to drink it.  Not just for the consequences, but because I kind of really do not need it at the moment (or at all, if I am honest).  If I was alone I wanted to drink to enhance my solitude.  If I was with friends I wanted to drink to enhance the sense of camaraderie.  If I was home I wanted to drink to dive deeper into the program I was watching.  If I was out I wanted to feel the unique effect of drinking while the sun was up or by being tipsy in a new location (or even while doing chores and errands to make them more fun).  If I was sad I wanted to drink to escape the thoughts and if I was happy I wanted to drink to enhance the pleasure.  A Fosters, or a glass of Apothic Dark, or a shot of Cabo Wabo are all the same thing.  Sure, they feel a bit different, but they are just various delivery mechanisms for the same things: alcohol.  Alcohol is all the same in the end.  So why do I not crave the can of beer in the house, but want to go to the microbrewery?  I can only guess it is the location.  The out-of-the-house-ness.  The public world.  Not the booze.  The booze has been tied into my sense of what I enjoy.  It is not the alcohol, it is life which I enjoy.  If that is the case I can build-up enough strength (hopefully, one day) to be able to go back and visit the places I liked but not drink as the drinking is not what I really enjoyed the most there.  Freedom.  Independence.  Friendship. Community.  Conversation.  A change of pace.  Not intoxication.  Plus there is a little something bad-ass about going to a bar and NOT drinking.  A little punk, counter-culture, anti-politics thing to it.  We shall see.  Thank You for letting me work through my thoughts here.  Thanks for reading this massive post.  Sober right now.  Sober this second.  And this second.  And this second.  I plan to go to sleep sober tonight. Double digits tomorrow!  Thank You.",9

I would sometimes took a few nights off a week when i was so hungover i couldn't stand it.  Alcohol began to consume my daily plans, thoughts, etc the most over the last half of a decade.  And the last 2 years things really got out of control as i started to realize that i could not stop once i started until all alcohol in my home was consumed or i had passed out.  Drinking on into the night after my family had feel asleep.  thinking, hummmm i really would do laundry - but i need to get some beers for ""cleaning.""  Feeling tired, disgusted multiple mornings during a work week.  And ultimately when buzz and happiness i used to feel when drinking was gone, almost to the point of ""i really don't know why i do this anymore, I am so sick of the same thing every week/weekend""  I knew i had to change something. 

So i decided to take charge of my life, call it what it was, alcoholism, and push as hard as i can this year to stay sober.  the first three days were rough, the next 2 i thought ""you know this wasn't as hard as i thought it would be"", yesterday, ""man.... i had this beat"".  Today..... oh today ... such a different feeling.  Anger maybe? frustration? why i can't just be like other drinkers, have a good time Friday night and then move on with my life?

2020-01-03 12:05:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eji990/i_need_to_stop_drinking/,I need to stop drinking,"Hey guys. 

Brand new here. I signed up for this account after finding this subreddit. 

My entire body is drowning in shame and anxiety right now. I had 6 cocktails in roughly 6 hours, but I blacked out at the end of the night. I was drinking solo. 

I believe I was charming with extremely positive convos and interactions with strangers throughout the night. However, things got hazy at the end towards closing time and I came to being confronted by a guy who seemed angry. It was closing time, so I grabbed an uber and went home. Luckily, I wasn't attacked outside, and nothing escalated. 

I'm now realizing that I have a problem and need to stop drinking. But guys... the anxiety of not knowing is killing me. 

I've read through a good amount of posts and am relieved that I'm not alone in this. How do you guys cope with the morning after? 

I'm coping with it in sherlock holmes mode by thinking of the following: 

1. I was not kicked out of the bar
2. The bartender laughed when the guy confronted me (which I'm assuming means it wasn't the worst case scenario)
3. I was having nice convos with people outside of the bar and was even invited by a group a few minutes before being told off by the guy
4. I made it to closing time and was able to wait inside until my uber came
5. I was in a pleasant mood the entire night, but was likely making crude jokes or just being obnoxious 

The anxiety is killing me, and I have no one to talk to about it. I'm writing this post to acknowledge I have a problem and need to stop, but also to reach out for some help with my thinking. I can only think of the worst case scenarios and I'm going insane. 

If you made it this far, thanks for reading a random stranger's anxiety riddled ramblings.",2
2020-01-03 12:02:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eji855/60_hours/,60 Hours,"So I decided to stop drinking for New Years because I was coming to realize that I was using it as a crutch for stress and anxiety and drinking more and more over time.  My average drinking schedule would be: Sober Sunday, drink Monday (4-5 beers or 2 to 3 vodka drinks), Sober Tuesday, drink Wednesday (same as above), sometimes Sober Thursday and if not, about the same as above) and drinking Friday and Saturday, depending on what I have going on, but usually 5-7 beers or 4 liquor drinks.   Liquor drinks consist of 1.5 shots of vodka and crystal light and water.  So on a weekend I might have 6 shots of liquor in a 5 or so hour period.

I only drink after work but I am still drinking 4 to 5 days a week, mostly 5 days.  Its been getting worse over the past 5 or 6 years I imagine.   Slowly progressing into something I don't want to be. So I have taken on dry January and come to realize its harder than I thought to not have that drink after work. I do not like that.

I am also a chronic medical worrier.  Always have been. So now, I have myself worked up that because I am experiencing  withdrawal (some anxiety, a little irritability, headache and having a hard time sleeping through the night).  I play google doctor and have convinced myself that I am going to have DT's because I was drinking almost daily and they don't occur until day 3.  I have no idea what I am doing!  

I guess I don't know why I am posting this.  Maybe just accountability?  Maybe encouragement that I am not going to have DT's or seizures? Maybe because I am scared of what I have done to my body over the last several years.  I have no idea really.  I just know that I won't drink tonight after work. I have a plan for that.

I have 5 years sober today. I woke up to help my nephew, had a cup of coffee, did some reading & journaling. Gonna head to work. 

5 years ago today, I woke up & felt such shame, guilt & remorse. I couldn’t stop crying. I wanted something, anything, to take away that feeling and pain. It wasn’t my worst night but it was my last night. I knew if I didn’t stop, I would eventually die. I was so hopeless. 

I started drinking when I was 15. I stopped when I was 31. I didn’t lose a house, car, relationship, or go to jail. But I also didn’t have any of those things—I couldn’t handle those things. I thought my life was going to short, brutal and harsh.  Now, I have a cute apartment (which I sometimes forget to pay the electric bill on), a new car, a boyfriend and I help people stay out of jail, lol. And now, I have 5 years of the Sobie life.

My sobriety date is also the date my dad died. He was an alcoholic & I watched him drink himself to death, he died from cirrhosis of the liver. The day I got sober, I didn’t remember it was his anniversary. I remembered it after I cried on the shoulder of a woman after an AA meeting. That I got sober 15 years after my dad died on the day he died...that is not a coincidence. That is someone looking out for me. I was meant for the Sobie life. 

I don’t know how I got 5 years. 6 months ago the work on My sobriety was non-existent. But the universe knocked me on the head & reminded I have what I have, because of it & my sobriety. I am grateful for that hit, otherwise I don’t think I’d have 5 years. 

I have hope now. I hope I stay sober and continue to work on it. I hope I keep growing & I have the strength to meet life on its terms. Because If I meet it on its terms...the fruit from it is bountiful. 

SD was where I came on my first day of sobriety. It works for me. So I’ll keep doing it. I hope it works for/helps you too. Stay safe my fellow sobies. Thank you for celebrating 5 years with me and continuing to be here.

I have another kind. I’m not drinking and don’t want to but I feel like the motivation train left the station without me this week. It was so hard to get through the holidays. I did it. I made it without drinking. But the lack of regular work schedule has me all screwed up. I feel low level depression creeping in, I can’t seem to string two successful activities together in a row. For example maybe I’ll make it to the gym but then have no motivation to properly feed myself. Like I’d be content eating cereal the next ten meals. Or I’ll make it to work but have to skip the gym.  I just feel exhausted. I’ve been to four meetings this week.  Just don’t want to do ANYTHING 😞 how to push through this funk???

Edit I just want to elaborate. The last 7 weeks of sobriety I’ve been very structured. Getting to the gym 3-4 times a week, eating decently healthy despite the addition of holiday junk, getting up early. Just generally a very structured and full routine. The lack of routine and weird days off have just propelled me into a napping/sleeping late/ laziness I haven’t had since the height of drinking. I feel like a lump right now and don’t want to",3

The addiction cycle had me in a place where I couldn't consistently use dumb-ass stickers to whiten my purple-grey teeth.  What kind of stupid is that?

Also went to an AA meeting this morning.  It's one that meets everyday at 7.  My feelings about AA are ambivalent at best, but I'm soon moving to a totally new place and there's a daily AM meeting there too.  It would be easy to isolate and pour alcohol on my fear in this new place, but that can't happen.  It's my goal to make a full week at the AM meeting here, so I can move and be in the swing of things.

Summer was over long ago. No vacations scheduled that I will want to drink on. No baseball/football/hockey games to go buy $10 beers at. Made it through the stressful/merry holidays. 

I'm completely tired of this terrible lifestyle. I would like to have a real life that doesn't revolve around alcohol, paying for alcohol, eating drunk food, gaining weight, hanging out with drunk people, not being able to drive and do things I want because I'm drunk at some shitty bar. 

I hope for this Friday that I can make it to bedtime without a drink. If I can do that, if I can wake up tomorrow sober, I think I can get through this weekend without a drink and hopefully that will give me some much-needed momentum in pursuing sobriety. 

Free time seems to be my biggest trigger, those hours between work and bedtime that I find it hard to sit with my own thoughts and anxieties. And weekends. But I've done it before and I can do it again. My plan is to work a full day. Come home. Make a nice dinner. Try to work on some hobbies or read or something. Watch some TV. Go the gym (maybe).

These symptoms include tremor, anxiety, agitation, elevated pulse/temp/respiration, sweating, and insomnia ( about 2% have seizure, and lower percentage for DTs).
But after the initial withdrawal period of a few days, mild levels of these symptoms may persist for months (4-6 months).

So dont feel hopeless if you are only a few weeks or even months out. Theres still time needed to reset the body back to it's normal homeostasis.

I’m meditating, I’m exercising, generally taking better care of myself. I’m seeing a therapist every couple of weeks. That helps.

I still get cravings to drink… like it was a tough day… I deserve just a small one. The subconscious mind is constantly floating ideas as to why I should drink.

To my challenge. My wife of 2+ decade’s likes to drink. I guess we were for the longest time been codependent on drink. We enabled each other. I’ve stopped. She hasn’t. Its difficult to have a rational conversation with someone once they are drinking, as reasoning goes out the window.  She says she doesn’t have a problem. Maybe she doesn’t, but she knocks bock a bottle of red a night and sometimes more…. .  And she will occasionally encourage me at time to drink. Ahh just have the one. You can always stop again tomorrow if you want too.

How do I keep the peace, keep myself sober, assist her and basically better both of us.?

Or do I just focus on myself?

Hi everyone.

2019 was a crazy year for me, so was 2018. In 2018 I got my first apartment by myself and the freedom really got to me. I was drinking daily, sometimes even before work or on my lunch break. I lived near a 24/7/365 liquor store (literally hadn't been closed once for years) so I would be able to get top ups at 3am if necessary. I was somehow able to work 60 hour weeks despite all my drinking and was making decent money. It all went on booze and cannabis (to take the edge off hangovers). I neglected my body and gained approximately 50lb and neglected my rent which led to me being evicted.

I moved in with family in January 2019 and started taking antidepressants. Lost all the weight I gained and was feeling good, even cut down on my drinking significantly. This lasted maybe 3 months before old habits crept back. There was a few weeks of heavy drinking which culminated in a suicide attempt. I ended up being placed in an inpatient facility for a while, was diagnosed with a personality disorder and put on some pretty heavy meds. Even while I was inpatient I would buy alcohol when I was allowed off site. I even managed to sneak some into my room. On discharge I fell through the cracks in the system and pretty much went off the rails again, probably drinking around 200 units a week, from dawn to dusk. God knows where I found the money as I was only receiving a small amount of disability for my mental health issues. Another suicide attempt, another inpatient admissions. Things were better the second time I was discharged and I had a mental health worker who visited me weekly, as well as psychiatrist and psychology appoints. I was still drinking up until this week. I decided that 2020 wasn't going to be like the last 2 years that I've lost. I'm on the waiting list for therapy which should start in Feb/March, my old boss wants me to go back to work for him and I've got the motivation to get better.

This week has been tough, flu like symptoms and terrible insomnia, even when I do get to sleep I wake up in the night drenched in sweat, my heart is pounding out of my chest. Surprisingly though I haven't had cravings. I spent money I would usually spend on alcohol on clothes, gym membership, books, good food etc to fill the gap. As tough as its been I really do feel good about the year coming and want to make up for all the time I've lost due to alcohol. I'm lucky I've even made it to 2020 after things I did to myself last year. IWNDWYT.",15

my parents drove 3 hours to come see me. i told them that i had been drinking and fell on ice walking home, but didn’t exactly remember because of how drunk i was. i kept some of the details from them but was adamant that i would not be drinking for awhile. we went out to dinner with my roommate and her boyfriend. they all ordered drinks. they did not do this with ill will towards me, but it did make me think that maybe they don’t understand the seriousness of what happened. i didn’t want to drink with them today, but i know that i will want to with someone soon enough. i am worried about what my social life, which has revolves around drinking for years now, will look like, especially with regards to dating, but i’m tired of waking up fucked up and i’m tired of fucking things up for other people. i woke up with 2 black eyes about 3 months ago after running my mouth. now this. 

this is long and rambling, but i needed to put it down somewhere. i will not drink with you today.",167

I’ve lurked on here for years, but never posted. My son got upset due to how drunk I was on NYE, I also normally go out on new year day but this year I didn’t. Instead spending a miserable hungover day with my wife and kids. 

Once I’d passed the witching hour from 10am - 8pm from wanting a drink, I did feel a sense of achievement however. Particularly seeing the texts and updates from friends who were out on all day sessions. 

I hope to complete dry January and move on from there. I’ve managed a 5 week dry period last summer following the death of a parent and just want to do it again. 

My drinking habits are usually every weekend, with an occasional Thursday start, Sunday finish. 6-8 cans/bottles of beer (6-8 pints in uk)

Biggest problem is feeling jaded at work, or worrying about sleeping in to spend time with the kids on a weeekend. 

I’m at the point where I don’t get much enjoyment from alcohol, and would be better using the time being a productive parent.

My poison is strong liquor. I do love the burn and the taste. Now I am doing a sober January and in the evening I still have a hankering for the burn sometime.

So what I do is I make one of those 'instant chicken soup' things. You know, put the powder in a cup, add hot water and stir? I also put several helpings of cayenne pepper into it to make it extremely hot.

I sip it like I would sip a glass of liquor, and every sip will burn my mouth. It's not exactly the same, but it does seem to satisfy my brain. I guess if you don't like spicy food this is not much of a tip but if you do it's a healthy way to replace a bad craving with a harmless one.

EDIT: With respect to the 'sober January' I feel I should add that I never went down the addiction rabbit hole. If you look at my history you'll see that I had a daily habit of taking a 'night cap' that was making me uncomfortable. After a half year without alcohol I now drink the occasional shot in the weekend, but still I think it is important to go a month or more without, once in a while.",10

Felt pretty normal most of the day, though I've been unusually hungry and having some difficulty eating.

Got some stuff organized around the apartment, but not nearly as much as I should have.

I've just been sitting around reading and occasionally watching TV. I drank a lot of water today, and now I've having some tonic water to settle my stomach down a bit.

I feel a bit ""off"", but not terribly bad. No shakes or weird symptoms. Same thing happened when I quit for about a month last year. How I could avoid serious withdrawal symptoms with the amount that I've drunken over the last 3 or 4 years is nothing short of a miracle.

Tomorrow's a new day and I'm ready to give it a shot again tomorrow. I really want to get my blood pressure and liver enzymes down. Alcohol has been a real drag on my health for a long time.

One struggle I have since I stopped drinking is my stomach is bloated and it is killing me. I can barely run on my treadmill but I still force myself at least 20 minutes a day.

My smart ass thought I would be able to fix it on my own so I google it and figure there is a natural way to reduce the acid in the stomach by eating peppers. One component is actually recommended for that. They even make cayenne pepper pills and cream to help with inflammation.

So I went to the store and here I am this evening making a peppers soup with cabbage and soy sauce. Smelt pretty good. Half way cooking, I ate one cooked jalapeno pepper. It did taste really good and I enjoyed it. I was happy with myself, ready to fill my belly. A few minute later I start having those horrible pain. I laid down on the bed and passed out because the pain was so unbearable. I just woke up 3 hours later wondering what happened.

First post

The grape and the grain, the gripe and the pain

I would like to use this opportunity to introduce myself and greet everyone in this group, as well as congratulate you on embarking on a journey to try and improve your lives.

I have never taken part in a support group, and the idea of sharing my private life with others has always seemed uncomfortable to me. Perhaps the cloak of digital anonymity will make it easier for me to share, rather narcissistically, my experience with the bittersweet concoction holding (or failing to hold, I hope) a grasp on the members of this forum.

CAUTE: I would like to apologize to everyone present for the odd grammar or syntax mistake, this being a result of not using my native tongue to write this text.

I drink. Excessively so.

I try to remember what my first recollections of alcohol are, and I believe that they are of being an infant sitting at some celebration and watching adults drinking unknown but strangely appealing drinks. At that time, I believed them to possess an exquisite taste, since they were consumed in copious quantities and resulted in much merriment. I remember being given a sip from a glass containing this mysterious potion and reacting with revulsion. How could such a foul liquid be used for enjoyment? But I accepted it as another secret held by maturity, one of the many strange rituals my elders were engaged in.

I have been afraid as far as I can remember. Afraid of being abandoned, of failure, of things that were clinically deemed (too late, in my opinion) as obsessions. I was scared of getting lost in a mall, of not getting an A in a schoolwork assignment, of not keeping my room in perfect order, not washing my hands properly. Fear ruled over everything I did, never letting go of its arctic grip.

When I was 14, I reached intoxication for the first time. Finally, I had understood. The euphoria, the loosening of the claws of fear was the result of passing an unsavory drink through the throat. From then on, occasional excursions to meet Bacchus would ensue, all the way until my completion of high school.

Then adulthood (at least, in a legal sense) came.  I had to choose a career. A significant part of me always craved for recognition and admiration, which probably meant a lack of self-esteem. I wanted to excel in the arts, but my ambitions surpassed my talents. Because of this, as well as the fear of taking responsibility, I chose psychology, since it seemed easier to memorize things, and then throw them away. It was just like school, and the high grades would keep on coming. But I felt unfulfilled, and alcohol started to become a steady companion. If I couldn´t achieve what I desired, I could at least halt the avalanche of self-deprecation. If I couldn´t attract the women I desired, have any talent whatsoever, why couldn´t I leave this cruel and unkind world for a few hours, and hide in blissful stupor? By inertia, I completed my masters in social psychology, and am currently doing my PhD in clinical psychology, developing an online program for problem drinkers (I have always treasured irony). While I briefly worked at a certain automobile company, my drinking was kept in check because of a nine-to-five job, and I spent all week waiting to reach that island of temporary relief. However, my current occupation allows me to have more a more flexible schedule, which has resulted in a significant increase in intake.

A “rock bottom” is frequently mentioned when talking about alcohol abuse, but I honestly believe that the pit is bottomless. I have broken two bones in separate occasions, engaged in drunk driving, made inappropriate advances towards a female friend who is in a relationship, among many other transgressions. None of that has curbed my drinking. The law of diminishing returns has long ago kicked in, but I continue to drink. Part of it has to do with the fact that I have no previous fulfilling life to return to, although that is something one probably has to work on when sober. I have always doubted my abilities as a clinician, but it seems that I have been a better counselor while intoxicated. I have also been a more attentive partner while under the influence, as was attested by a former girlfriend.

I am currently seeing a psychiatrist who recommended a stay at a rehabilitation clinic, but that is unfeasible due to my work and budget. I stayed sober for seven weeks some months ago, but I missed feeling happy, so my drinking resumed. A life that is considered meaningless and devoid of any pleasure is certainly a big incentive for alcohol abuse.

I found this group accidentally while searching for online forums, and I thought that being part of a support network might help me reduce or suspend my alcohol use. I believe I have bored the accidental reader of this post long enough, so I will stop at this point.

Thank you for your attention, and the best of luck to all of you.",6

I really appreciate the support of this group and also feel like I can’t get the full effect of this group if I am not honest. Throughout the end of December there were a few days where I drank, which led me to drink on NYE. My excuse was that “I’ll just have two glasses of wine maximum” but that clearly didn’t work. At least I found meaning in that I am 100% confident that I am not that person. On NYE I had a few too many and came up with this made up scenario in my head and started a huge fight with my SO. I am not going to go into too much detail but it was toxic. I squeezed his arm so hard it left a bruise and I am ashamed especially cause it was in public. Drinking creates a chemical imbalance in my brain and makes me create these false scenarios in my brain and leads me to become infuriated. It triggers my deepest darkest emotions and I become a very toxic person. Drinking is a problem for Me it will sabotage my relationships. I’ve beaten myself up quite a bit but I found meaning in this experience. Now I know I am not a two drink kind of person. Now I know there is a lot of mental and emotional issues and anxieties I need to actively work on that I have been putting off. I’m very self aware but this experience triggered me into actually taking action. I’m grateful for a SO who is forgiving but I am taking it for granted. In the bottom of my heart although he says we will move forward I still feel he is seconding guessing being with me. This has made me feel insecure. I will be better. I don’t want to ruin the relationship I have with myself or my SO. The emotional pain I experience and make others experience is not worth that first drink. I appreciate this group. And I will do better.",9

I feel in general previously I could handle my drinking outside of a few incidents through the years.  But since I lost weight drinking has become problematic.  I black out sometimes.  I keep drinking like a fiend even though I’m already sloshed.  And the anxiety and depression I experience after binge drinking is excruciating.  But when I think of a life with no alcohol in it... I honestly cannot even picture it or imagine myself without it.  I don’t drink every day.  I have never physically had to have a drink.. but every few days I feel the urge to get a buzz or get drunk.  Lately the guilt over the money and time I’ve wasted drinking is crushing me and causing me even more anxiety.  Yet the thought of giving it up or having to give it up... I feel like I would be erased.  I am barely touching the surface of even the thought that I might need to stop.  I lost a best friend recently to a DUI... my friend and the other driver were both over the limit.  She was a careful person... not usually one to drive over the limit.  I’m so baffled and destroyed by her death and the manor by which she left.  And part of me is horrified by the thought that she had to go in order for me to wake up to something.  I have this awful nagging about it all that won’t go away.  I don’t know if I want advice or just need to let this out but if anyone can relate I’d like to hear your thoughts.,5

Everyone was very welcoming and friendly, including offering us these whiteclaw-like seltzers they were all drinking and discussing.  I had just gotten there and felt really awkward saying ""no I don't drink"" so I took one.  I sipped it once to give my thoughts and then one other time while I ate.  That's it.

However today I ended up in a meeting with just me and the chairperson and I got the chance to be honest with all of the shit I've done and had been lying about and hiding from everyone the past few months. It wasn't even that embarrassing, instead it was liberating. I felt like I could maybe do it this time.

I'm clean now.* But It has been hard to see my younger siblings not realize that they are drinking their lives away.

I did, however, get a chance to share my story of learning about alcoholism, and my own realization that I was an alcoholic, and my journey to sobriety.

I tried moderation but it didn’t work. I managed to stop drinking in secret but socially I still drank and got wasted over the holidays. There are gaps in my memory about what I did NYE and wasted mornings where I couldn’t get up to do anything for the past week, leaving others to care for my kids until
i could get my head together.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to \[/r/stopdrinking\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\*

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in \[/r/stopdrinking\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)), we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\*

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at \[/r/stopdrinking\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn’t:\*\*

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hi everyone!

There are so many newcomers to our tribe this week! I want to extend the warmest of welcomes. If you’re here, you belong. 

I had countless day 1s before I figured out my formula, and every time I failed to stay sober I looked at what hadn’t worked. 

I’m going to share with you something I wrote to another of our members about my thoughts on how to make it stick. Keep in mind this is only my opinion:

“...I think it’s different for everyone.

I’ve been in that sickening cycle where I was desperate to stop drinking and would manage 2-5 days then drink again. The self-loathing and feelings of helplessness and futility were intense. Such misery. Every waking moment - including the middle of the night when I’d have drinker’s insomnia and would listen to “Overcome Alcoholism” self-hypnosis tracks - was devoted to getting sober. Audiobooks, meditation, quit lit, exercise, therapy, SD, supplements, amino acids...I had it all in place.

The thing I had a block about was speaking with my doctor, because I was convinced I could do it myself. I actually couldn’t.

I posted on SD one day, completely fed up and full of shame and despair, asking you guys to give me a kick in the arse. The replies were so gentle.

One long-time sober member asked me what my plan was, and in writing out a response I realised the doctor was the only thing I hadn’t tried. Then one of our mods suggested medical assistance (which I thought was only for real problem cases - haha - the joke was on me!).

Between the two of them, they handed me the key.

I rang the doctor. They’d had a cancellation for an immediate appointment, so I took it. I’d never met this doctor before, and she was unreal. I spilled my guts to her, and she was kind and strong, and took me under her wing. Naltrexone and Lexapro (anti-anxiety) have helped me get on track.

So I guess what I think is this. One of my lessons in life is to let people help me, and allow myself to be vulnerable. This streak of pride and independence manifests itself in little ways, like not letting my mother-in-law help me make a family dinner because I want her to relax and have a nice time (and I can do such a great job on my own!). It manifests in big ways, like 52 hours of labour even though the obstetrician was advising an emergency caesarean. I wanted to give birth like a goddess! Lol. Stupid. He had to scream at me “if you don’t let me cut you open, you and your baby are going to die!!!”.

When it came to my addiction I had a block about admitting I couldn’t do it alone. Talking to my therapist about it was okay, because it was me working on it, trying to find a way through it. Talking to my doctor required me to walk in the door with my hands empty, nice and humble, and ask her to please help.

Maybe for you, if you can find your point of most resistance and chisel your way through it, you’ll find sobriety sticks.

I think it’s a deeply intimate, personal process, and it’s not just about stopping drinking.

For some people it might be finally staring a terrible trauma or loss in the face. It might be learning scary new social skills and pushing themselves to make connections with a community. It might be creating a relationship with their bodies and learning to ground and care for themselves physically. It might be learning to stick it out and stay put when things get rocky. It might be about learning gratitude and applying it. It might be about developing self-love and learning how to self-soothe.

Maybe you could journal or walk in nature or just ask up and let the answer come when it’s ready.

Maybe you just haven’t found your key yet.

And I don’t mean to imply that I think I’ve got it. Some days are hard. I devote myself to it daily, and spend time on myself and my growth. It’s working for now, today, and that’s good.”

The first week is hard and easy all at once. The hangover/guilt/shame are still fresh, but the addiction is still biting hard.

Sobriety is a commitment to yourself. Don’t expect it to be easy, but do expect it to be worth it. It’s a journey of healing and wholeness.

I hope my thoughts here are helpful.

Much love,

Starlight

Like, I could feel myself get bourbon out of where I know the bottle is— and I wanted so desperately to just. Drink it. 

If this was my house and my booze, I would have gotten rid of the bottle. However, I’m staying with my parents, and I doubt my dad would be happy about me tossing his favorite drink. Anyway, 

I went to the guest room and opened my 30 Day Sobriety Solution instead. Tomorrow I’m going to join one of those chain gyms so I can workout wherever I travel and get this energy out. Hopefully working out will make me tired enough to sleep too. These first 4 days were awesome because I’m excited to not be hungover every other morning. Today, though. Fuck. The only reason I didn’t pour myself a glass is because I know— KNOW— it wouldn’t end there. I have a lot of plans for tomorrow morning, one of which is to show up for a super early lunch for my Moms birthday. 

I’m happy to know I won’t be hungover while she celebrates. IWNDWYT",6

I am so very grateful. BIG LOVE TO Y""ALL!

And if you've just started here, with a new year's resolution to stop drinking - know that you are doing an AWESOME BADASS thing. not drinking is a super power.

Eat all the cheese. drink all the sparkly water. take all the naps. One drink you don't have at a time really does work.

So, I will NOT be having that one drink with y'all today. I won't be having it tonight, and I won't be having it tomorrow either. I am aiming for the 20s to be a terrifically sober decade, because 2020 clear vision tells me that not drinking is the best way for me to live.

I am 5 days sober. I am almost finished with This Naked Mind (thanks to this sub for introducing me!) and truly feel like I’m done with alcohol.

While I’m happy I feel this way, I know I will be tested. I’m wondering, what are the hard moments going to be? 

I was hoping some of you would share what some of the moments that tested your resolve were, so I can better prepare for the road ahead. I realize we all have our own journeys, and the tests will be very personal, but I believe we can all learn from each other. 

Side note - I have had to tell two friends - one who was supportive, one not so much - and I had no problem telling them or worrying about their reactions.

I was beginning physical dependency and the taste of Budweiser was my heart a d soul. I mean that. I loved beer more than anything. I was grumpy all the time and beer made me a happy camper. My two big wakeup calls were waking up covered in urine and piecing it together that while blacked out I huffed inhalants to unconsciousness , with video evidence that I cared very little if I died,which I easily could have. Number two was drinking colt 45 out of a Burger King cup at my 5 year old niece's birthday party. Some of my earliest and fondest memories of my uncle's involve the heavy scent of beer on their breath or what I've come to realize was drunken behavior. It was alarming to realize I'm perpetuating a cycle by continuing to be the rough around the edges, diesel breath uncle to these kids. Basically, I was a real piece of shit.",36

Doesn't feel like starting over, more like picking up where I left off.","I didn't drink in January, July or October last year, but otherwise I drank every day and it really ramped up until November when I decided to take it easy. I didn't drink from Thanksgiving to Christmas, so about a month. Longest I've ever gone and it felt great. I honestly didn't realize how much of a success it felt like, 25 percent of the year. I realized that alcohol has been the biggest factor in my anxiety. I was having a great time until the day after Christmas, then spent the next week sober, but feeling like I was living in a nightmare.

Well, I went nuts and drank 12 beers (I'm pretty sure I had more, just lost count at 12) at a party on New Years and it happened again. Spent the next few days of my vacation off work living in fear.

Thankfully I slept great last night and had a great day at work today. I'm taking it easy this weekend, but definitely going back to not drinking. It wasn't hard to stay away from it before the holidays, maybe the social pressure made it easier to drink. And I definitely rested easier and relaxed easier knowing alcohol is a huge trigger for my anxiety that I can choose to stay away from.

Oddly I don't feel like I failed myself or will need to ""start over,"" and that I have the tools I need to handle this. I'm looking forward to a dry January and beyond. I don't like the thought of this, but if I stay sober all year and end up breaking down again over the holidays, it'll be the most successful I've ever been since I turned 21. I'm 27 and now is the time to realize my body is telling me that what I've put it through for 6 years needs to stop. With 4 staggered, but sober months in 2019, I'd like to make it to 12 consecutive ones this year.",37

Not bad for someone who was gulping down Maker's Mark on Christmas Day night, not having had a sober week in  6 months.  Some initial thoughts from the past week and stuff I have learned trying to get sober over the past years: 1.) Alcohol is addictive to everyone, not just those who are addicted to drinking a 12 pack a day. If someone has two glasses of wine a day, it might be just as hard for them to go a month without it  as me.  2.) Doing stuff like having lunch with friends, drinking unsweet tea, and then spending three hours in a beautiful park by the water talking and goofing around is not needed to desperately keep me from drinking, those are the activities of healthy people who do not develop drinking problems in the first place.  3.) (Stolen from my Fiance) Being an adult is just being a good parent to yourself.  Doing things like eating a vegetable, going outside, getting 20 minutes of exercise, joining a community of some kind, making a friend, getting some sleep, drinking enough water...these are not the activities of someone who desperately needs to work to get clean, they are the activities of folks who never ended up in an environment where they needed to escape from their own heads when they are depressed or in need of heightening enjoyment when they are having fun.  4.) I do not NEED alcohol, alcohol needs me.  In order for the stuff to work it needs a host.  It needs a body, somebody, anybody.  It is just a type of computer virus hoping to download itself onto a new hard-drive and alter it.  Some folks get rid of the malware, some folks are loaded with it, and other folks have a few annoying pop-ups they do not bother to get removed.

Ran into my ex this evening in the parking lot, which she coldly didn't even acknowledge, until I knocked on her car window before she drove off. I said hi, and asked if she wanted to talk, her response ""highly unlikely"".

See the thing is I said and did some terrible stuff after not respecting boundaries.

Had a key to their place when we dated and after a night of us drinking went over and tried to sneak some of their special whisky, which on a very deep level was important to them. An old friend of theirs passed and was their favorite when they where still alive, and was saving it for when the group got together by a fire had a drink. They forbid me from touching it when it was bought, and after being drunk that night I was caught taking a swig, thusly saying some fucked up shit to them when confronted. Zero fucking boundaries sometimes when I drink, which makes even sometimes way too much.

Thing is she never had big issues with drinking, and as far as I know her friend circle doesn't either. Though she does have an alcoholic father, and the stories she told me where pretty profound.

Weeks ago she wanted to talk about me and boundaries a few days later and I coldly shot them down (was running late to work and kind of hungover), and by the time I could actually talk about things the relationship had long been over for the past few weeks. Regardless I knew there was a date of expiration on this relationship simply because of the paths we're going in our lives. The drinking made me self destruct the relationship instead of being an adult about it, and possibly keeping a valuable person in my life.

This is the thing that hurts the most, and I'm responsible for all of it.

I also almost completely ruined a relationship with my best friend of 15 years last year, again, saying terrible shit, taking advantage of their generosity and trust. We hadn't talked in nearly a year and reached out to them yesterday, telling them the truth, the struggle, and owning my own shit for what was said and done. Was surprised to hear back from them, and even sent me a picture of a journal I had gotten them last year. They never got rid of it even after all the terrible hurtful things I said and did.

Through all of this, drinking was the last thing on my mind to do today. Though I did break down and smoke half of a cigar 15 hours into my nicotine quit.

Signed up for a Krav Maga class today to counterpoint my weight lifting routine. The $210 in month membership fees associated with these two things cost about half of sometimes what I'd spend on drinking.

Bittersweet today.

Been lurking for a while. I've always felt comforted by this sub even when I wasn't consciously sure what brought me here. I was in a bad relationship a while ago and we started doing hard drugs together for a while- something I had never really done before and I am now 1 year & 4 months sober from cocaine. This has been a huge learning experience for me in looking deeper at bad relationships and renegotiating my use of substances. I think it's probably fair to say I'm an addict, but moving on idk labels are confusing and sometimes I don't feel I've ""earned"" the title or something.

&#x200B;

I don't know if I can say I'm an alcoholic or what really constitutes being an alcoholic. I do know that drinking has stopped being fun-- in fact I'm not positive it was ever that much fun. There were fun consequences of drinking... comradery, goofiness, a sense of comfort in my skin, but that wasn't the drinking itself. And I believe I can accomplish all of those things without drinking as well. 

&#x200B;

I know that more than anything I drink when I'm upset, not when I'm overjoyed or celebrating. That realization took a while. I know that sometimes drinking just fills the void and quiets the existential dread of being alive for just a moment. I know I wake up the next morning feeling like shit physically, mentally, and emotionally. I know alcohol doesn't add anything to my life in a meaningfully positive fashion. I know that I have a shooter of vodka in my freezer right now and as I was writing this I just stopped and wondered if I have the strength to not go home and just chug it for no reason at all. 

&#x200B;

I don't know why today is the day, but I know it's been coming. I'm not having fun anymore and it's really fucking hard for me to have days where I don't drink. I want to be in control of myself and I want to make choices that reflect that I love myself rather than slowly poisoning myself with hate. I'm really grateful for this sub even if no one sees this or finds my writing long winded lol-- the encouragement here has given some hope.

https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dybthu/reasons_not_to_drink_on_rare_occasion/

So, I drank on NYE. It was very, very planned out. It was fun. No regrets. As planned, I got a little bit drunk. Six-ish drinks over 5 hours, with food and lots of water. It turns out I don't really even like being drunk anymore. I already planned to never get dangerously drunk again, but now I realize I don't need to get drunk again period. Buzzed is more fun than drunk, so that's what I'll stick with in the future. Next time I get to drink is after April 1st. I think it will be bowling and beer with my partner. 

I'll update periodically to let y'all know how my ongoing experiment goes. I've never heard of anyone doing this before; neither abstaining entirely, nor trying ongoing moderation. This was after 17 months of abstinence. Before my period of abstinence I spent a long time trying to moderate, and had some good success, but when my PTSD got bad, I'd always start drinking more again. I've determined that I can't have alcohol be a regular part of my life, it's just not sustainable. But having it be a 4-times-a-year party drug is different enough that hopefully alcohol will continue to feel off-limits for coping.

Edit: To clarify, I'm not moderating. I don't think I'm capable of it at this point. I'm sober except for four days a year. It's really different. With moderating, it's really easy to slide back into drinking too much. It happens gradually, with lots of little decisions, and can be hard to see until things are getting bad again. With this method (occasioning?), 361 days of the year I will continue to think of myself as a non-drinker, and I think that's key. There's no way to gradually start drinking too much again. There's no wiggle room. There are no decisions to be made. I don't drink. Period. (Until April.)",7

I have now been sober for 7.5 weeks and it feels amazing!

But now the course is ending and I'm worried. The thought of living the rest of my life without ever drinking seems unreal. Like I decided to travel to Mars, and am now contemplating never returning to Earth. I've been able to muster the short term will power to make this change, but now I'm having a hard time deciding I want to stay here.

Is it possible for a person with a pretty long history of alcohol abuse (25 years) to become a moderate drinker? I really want the answer to be yes. But even the fact of that desire makes me suspicious. It took me a long time to admit I had a problem, and the biggest barrier to my recovery has been maintaining the conviction that it was/is a problem. There's a part of me that feels like I won't be able to give up drinking completely until/unless I \*prove\* myself incapable of moderation.

One of the last activities for the course is to set a goal for alcohol consumption post-therapy. Should I try setting a limit and try moderation? Or am I doomed to fail without abstinence? Any advice is very appreciated!!",4

Hoping others here have had similar experiences and can help me figure out how to move forward from here. I’m not implying i’ll never drink again but it wont be anytime soon and IF it happens It will be in moderation IF at all. 


 A little backstory, i’m only 23 years old and thats partly why i’ve decided to give up drinking because I can’t imagine doing this for the rest of my life. Either i’m going to end up dead or wishing I was. So growing up I never drank. My friend group always smoked weed, so as a kid we would spend our weekends getting high. I had my first beer around 16 and didn’t get drunk until I was probably 19. 

I have never been good at moderation with anything in my life. When I was young it was food. As I got older I started smoking and my eating habits got better as I could fill that hole with something else. A few months before I turned 21 weed started to stress me out and give me panic attacks so I quit. Coincidentally my friend had just turned 21 so he would buy us a fifth on the weekend and we would kill it together. As time went by I had him start buying me a fifth I could have to myself. I was stingy with it if I knew I couldn’t get more immediately. I felt like loneliness was alcohols best friend, or visa versa. 

Skip ahead a few months and I turn 21, living with some friends (all drinkers) and now I can buy it myself. I went overboard with it fast. First a six pack a night then soon it was half a fifth a night. It was less expensive and more simple that way.(less bottles) Half a year later I have a row of empty vodka bottles lining my desk I would weekly throw into a garbage bag and make the walk of shame to the neighborhood dumpster, clinking the whole way. 

I would move in and out of places over the next two years and while I was consistently drinking I wasn’t always getting hammered. I would have ups and downs and during the downs I would find myself binge drinking. 

Relationship falls apart: go on a bender. 
Work isn’t going well: go on a bender.
Lonely: go on a bender.

I told myself it was a phase and I would grow out of it. Each time I would go through these phases it was the same story, buy a fifth and let it ride me through the day into the night. I would strategically make sure I had enough to get me through the morning until I could go buy another fifth and do it all over again. It didn’t help that I was good at handling myself drunk. My friends usually couldn’t even tell that I had been drinking unless I overdid it. Basically during these multi-month long phases I would spend all day buzzed until night came around and then I would get progressively blacked out until I woke up in bed the next morning. Take a few shots to get my hands to stop shaking and do it all over again. 

Before this last bender I had been cutting back quite a bit, maybe a pint of liquor starting around 5:00ish and then into the night. Well I had a bad breakup around mid November (just in time for the holidays) and I lost it. Back to drinking a fifth, maintaining a buzz throughout the day and then blacking out around 11pm only to wake up around 7 or 8am to do it again. 

One day I looked at my bank statement and realized the horrifying amount of money I had spent on alcohol alone the last month. Decided “this is it i’m going to stop” So I went cold turkey. 

Big mistake

Now I have gone cold turkey before for various reasons and have had withdrawals. Mostly heart palpitations. I suspect the nicotine (juul) had something to do with it because once I stopped vaping they went away. I’m not finger wagging, just thought I would mention the fact that vaping/smoking cigs probably wasn’t doing any favors for my heart. 

Regardless, this time it was different. I woke up around 5am shivering drenched in sweat. Like I had just run a marathon or stepped out of the shower. I was freezing but also burning up because I was under three blankets (also soaked in my sweat). My throat felt like sandpaper and my chest felt two sizes too small for my organs. My heart was beating 100mph and felt like it was going to burst out of my chest. I could only take short sharp breaths like my lungs were designed for a child. My hands wouldn’t stop shaking and my muscles and appendages were spasming. I tried to sleep but even though I was exhausted I couldn’t. All I could do was lay there curled up in a ball and sweat it out. Passing out every hour or so and wake up half an hour later until the sun came up. 

Probably the worst part about WD isn’t the physical symptoms (even though they’re awful) but the mental aspect. You feel this ever present impending doom. Like any moment you are going to die or something terrible is about to happen to you. Which considering everything else going on at the moment isn’t an irrational thought I guess. I felt helpless and trapped. I wanted to scream. 

Eventually I felt good enough to get out of bed. But I know what happens next on this rollercoaster and I really didn’t feel like getting DT and dying. So I drove down to the liquor store and bought a few pints. I spent the next week tapering off a little everyday until yesterday I woke up without any symptoms. Scary shit to say the least. 

Laying there curled up on my bed I swore I would never do this to myself again, but as I sit here typing this I feel completely fine and all I can think about is getting a little buzz on...



TLDR: I really messed myself up drinking and I have come to the conclusion I can’t control my alcohol consumption as of now. 

With all that being said. How do you push down that little voice in your head? The one thats constantly trying to convince you to have just one little drink...",10

It was not innocent. I blacked out and hardly remember the night. I am covered in bruises and my body feels like I was hit by a train, even today. And I am so, so disappointed in myself. This was not my first try at sobriety. I am starting to become very afraid that I am incapable of maintaining my sobriety. My husband (while very supportive) is tired, I can see it in his eyes. I'm tired too. Tired of feeling this way, and tired of letting alcohol control my life. I hate alcohol. I hate what it turns me into. How come I can't just let it go?

I could see how easy it would be for someone to slip into a bender over this. But I refuse. I am not going to die a pathetic drunk. I am not pulling all this damage and destruction into a new decade.

5 years ago, tonight (unbeknown to me), I was taking my last drinks.  I am looking at my 5 year sobriety date coming up tomorrow. Right now, I have 4 years and 364 days, lol. One day at a time, right? 

I just saw old pictures of the night of my last drink. I honestly, don't know how I am getting 5 years, because it feels like yesterday. The last 3.5 months of sobriety have been emotionally, mentally and spiritually rough, it is what I imagined starting all over again feels like. I didn't relapse (thank goodness) but I wasn't working my sobriety the way  I had for 3.5 years; I guess I had an emotional relapse. I wasn't on here, didn't go to meetings, didn't have a sponsor, never went all the way through my steps. I had just strayed. But even when I strayed, the universe still gave me what I wanted: I have an amazing life, one that I know I wouldn't have if I had not gotten sober. 

The universe gave me what I wanted and that's a double edged sword. I got what I wanted and strayed farther from my sobriety. Then, it almost got taken away and it was a wake-up call: my sobriety and everything I had done in it taught me how to deal with the ups and downs of life. Without my sobriety...dealing with life is harder for me. How did I deal with life? I drank. 

My sobriety is a living organism. I have to take care of it, feed it, love it, nurture it, be good to it. Or else it will die...and so will I. Without my sobriety, I will drink. If I drink, I will die. That is my truth. When I took care of my sobriety, I saw the fruits of it. Some of those fruits were fast...others took time (years, lol). If I put anything else before my sobriety, I will lose it because my sobriety is the fertilizer, I need it to grow everything. It is the bedrock I build all other things on. 

I hope I get 5 years tomorrow. I hope to have the flowers that are blooming; to see what flowers will bloom in the days to come. I hope my bedrock stays firm. But I have hope...and a little faith, which is more than I have 5 years ago. 

Stay safe my fellow sobies. Glad ya'll are here. Thanks for being here. Kitten out.",274

Anxiety disorder with OCD, recovery from an eating disorder and a whole bucket load of insecurities that meant I lashed out at those closest, projected my issues onto others and lost every job I ever had because I rage quit when they tried to discipline me. I also drank, a lot.

I have been sober for a while now and it’s only when I started getting therapy, reflecting on myself and stopped using drink as an excuse to numb myself to the consequences of my actions that things started to improve. It was slow. I relapsed after 6 weeks, 2 days, and finally made it stick.

I don’t think I could have done any of the work I needed to improve myself while drinking, it fed my worst compulsions and I almost ended up alone and homeless. 

I have spent the last couple of weeks questioning whether I should continue my sobriety because that demons in my head are telling me the job is done. However, the work is far from over and I wouldn’t swap a single second of my sobriety for a drink now.

This journey is full of self reflection for me.  It's not ""just say no"", as I had expected.  There is a lot of seeing, and recognizing the **why** and the **how**, in so far as my own feelings, and more importantly my own behavior.

I have been a long time off and on binge drinker. I would drink heavy on the weekends, and then pull myself together during the week for work. Sometimes I would drink heavy on a Thursday, but I wasn't pounding the bottle every night. The problem for me has been when I get a long break from work. I recently went on a lovely ten day bender that ended about 48 hours ago.

Yesterday was TERRIBLE. I thought I was dying. Shakes, disassociation, dizziness, puking, diarrhea, everything. I thought I was having a heart attack. Chugging water and drinking cranberry juice and hanging out with someone I was comfortable with helped me calm down. It was pure panic, and maybe my blood sugar freaking out. Couldn't sleep. Eventually passed out and logged ten hours of the deepest sleep I've ever had.

I have seen/heard so many spooky things about DT's. Its like my anxiety about getting them is currently the most crippling part, not even the urge to drink. I don't know what im looking for anyone to say here, It just makes me feel better writing.

TLDR: Long time binge drinker, went on ten day bender, yesterday i thought i was dying, todays much better but worried about DT's. 48 ish hours sober. Went for a two mile run to try and shake out the anxiety. Dont want to die from DT's.

2020-01-02 15:22:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ej3ne0/momentary_triumphs/,Momentary triumphs,"After realizing I’d spent more nights drunk than sober in the last month, I’ve been pushing to drink less and less often. I’m now consistently hitting four or five days between drinks. However, my last day one was so much harder. For no discernible reason, all the old justifications hit at once. “You already drank one night, what difference does two make? You don’t have any responsibilities till the afternoon. Your wife is already asleep, so no one will know. It’s just one more day.” Etc.

I think I sat for almost a half hour, wanting to drink too much to eat something (I always drink on an empty stomach because I’m cheap like that) but not quite giving in.

Eventually, I had a weirdly blissful moment. I realized I could go eat a big bowl of soup, even have dessert or some chips. I could pretty much pig out, and none of it would be as disastrous to my health (or have as many calories) as one night of binge drinking, and in the morning, I would have energy, feel happy and a bit proud, and best of all NOT deal with whiskey shits.

One bowl of soup and a sparkling water later, I felt good about myself for the first time since I started this journey. I requested my first badge to start counting days and no matter how many resets might be in my future, I know every night sober is another day here with my wife, healthy and alive.

2020-01-02 15:16:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ej3key/keep_coming_back_no_matter_what/,Keep coming back. No matter what.,"Happy New Year.  Here are some ideas that have helped keep me sober the past 14 months.  I thought it would be timely to post these for those who are newly sober and even for long term sobernauts.

For me sobriety had to be my top priority.  No matter what.  This meant I had to take time to go get help from an intensive outpatient treatment program.  I tried doing it on my own before.  I tried only working this sub.  I tried quitting drinking cold turkey.  It didn’t work.  I had to get help.

The IOP program helped me develop a plan.  Establish a routine.  Go to meetings.  Take care of yourself.  Eat when you are hungry.  Rest when you are tired.  Go to meetings when you feel lonely.
 
I was easy on myself the first few months.  I ate what I wanted.  I slept.  A lot.  I avoided social interactions that gave me anxiety.  I worked out.  

My anxiety levels increased in the first ten days.  If you recently quit, that is not unusual.  For me, they peaked around days 7-14.  Within two months, they had disappeared even though it was Christmas and my father was dying.

I read postings and shared with this sub often.  Whether I felt like drinking or I felt cocky.  Either way, I reached out to the loving and caring strangers on this sub.

For unavoidable social interactions at work, family or life, I always have an exit strategy.  I Uber or drive myself many times.  Sometimes I would even pretend to talk to someone on the phone and walked out if I got too anxious.  It didn’t matter.  Sobriety first.

I started to go to AA.  I was slow in the beginning.  Over time I visited many different meeting before I found a group where I fit in.  It is a secular group.  I did not do the 90 in 90.  However, I found 3-4 meetings each week to be to right number.  I was patient with
AA.  I still am patient with it.  Through AA, I have learned empathy, listening skills and insight into what makes me drink.  I increase my meeting attendance when I feel anxiety and when I feel like my ego needs to be checked.

That’s all I have.  Have a Happy New Year.  Keep coming back to this sub.  You are always welcome.",16

Without getting too much into it, my wife and I have been struggling to keep our marriage alive for the last year or so. Our problems have always revolved around drinking. This last weekend was our worst fight ever, and  alcohol was definitely a catalyst. This coming weekend is our 5th wedding anniversary and I’m afraid we won’t make it to 6. 

In the few days aftermath of our biggest fight ever, I made a promise to myself that I would not drink anymore.  Finally, I can admit that drinking didn’t always cause problems, but the worst problems of my life included alcohol consumption. I am tired of apologizing and messing up. 

I made it through New Year’s Eve/ New Year’s Day without a single drink.  and  I’m determined to get through the weekend.  

Cut to today: 5 days, zero alcohol.

A friend of mine has been sober for nearly 13 years. He just came forward and said that he had started ""dabbling"" with drinking again, and that on new years eve, got too drunk and did things that hurt his wife and close friend. He's back on the sober train. He's someone I reached out to a few years ago when I was first starting to realize I had a problem. Just goes to show that we have to be vigilant every single day, no matter how many hours, days, years, decades of sober life we have. It has to be day by day. Can't get overly cocky thinking you beat the monster because you made it so long without. That monster is still in there waiting for the poison so it can come back to life. And that monster is an asshole.

EDIT: this wasn't meant to scare anyone. For me, it put in perspective that being sober has to be a daily choice. Every day we have to make the decision not to drink. No amount of years under your belt will change the fact that people like us simply can't drink. I would if I could, but I can't. So every day IWNDWYT.",129

So far I feel absolute great! It was slightly funny when I woke up on the first expecting myself to have a hangover but then I remembered I spent nye sober. It was also a wake up call to what I've been putting my body through the past years. Wish me luck!

Learning healthier coping mechanisms, and learning how to understand my addiction, and what it's truly doing to myself is all I want to gain from this experience as well as abstaining from drinking.

For a while I thought I could just tell myself to not drink, but it's just caught up to me, and it's actually made my habits worse. I encourage anyone who thinks they might not be able to handle fixing their drinking on their own to start a program, or at least go to AA.

I've thought for a while that I'll be able to drink less when going out, but I can't - when I drink I can't stop - I can't control it. So this is it I finally admit it I'm an alcoholic, I don't drink everyday, and I sometimes have weeks when I don't drink, that's actually a lie I don't have any weeks when I don't drink. When I drink, I drink about 10-15 beers or glasses of wine by the least. I have a hard time liking myself the morning after and I often regret my decisions. Recently one of my friends brought to my attention that I get ""too much"" when I drink - what he meant is that I go Bonanza and get ridiculously drunk which is true. I'm afraid that I won't be as liked as person if I stop but I know that's a lie, and I also know that I'll like myself a lot more if I stop. I've quit twice before and actually had good results. The times I quit, I quit for about a half year due to mental issues - I have anxiety. My anxiety is actually under control and I think I would be able to develop myself as a person if I quit.

So what is all this blabbering for? It's to conclude that from this day i recognise that I need to take this issue seriously! I can't drink my way around it, I can't just cut back a couple beers (If I could this wouldn't be a problem) and i'm not able to learn it.

- I spend the next day hungover, so I miss out on an entire day of life
- I use alcohol as an emotional bandaid; to numb my nerves/anxiety
- I drink to a point where whatever I was trying to numb/cover up comes out anyway, only now I’m drunk and past the point of reason to work through it and get unreasonable/emotional
- I take out my shit on my family

(I didn’t start yesterday, because I wanted a couple mimosas in the afternoon.) I’m 43 and I know that my drinking habits have increased over the years. Almost four years ago I got married and became a stepmom. Adjusting to married life, with kids, after being single and on my own for several years was quite difficult at times. Drinking increased as I tried to deal with the stress of a new life, and the loss of my old one. 

Almost two years ago my mom died. She had lung cancer (not a smoker though) which was discovered when her right hip began to cause serious pain. Two tumors were found there which quickly led to a cancer diagnosis, but by then it was too late. The cancer was too advanced. My mom lived with my husband and me in the final 4-6 weeks of her life. Watching a formerly active, upbeat, strong woman become a shell of herself was awful. Just 2.5 months after her cancer diagnosis, she was gone. My sister and I were very close to her and 2018 was just a terrible, terrible year. I drank a lot during her illness, and after, as a way to cope. It didn’t go very well most of the time.

Sometime this year I decided that I had to cut back. I was sick of going to work hungover. I was sick of the migraines I knew I was causing. I was sick of my weight gain and bloat and not being able to fit into a lot of my clothes anymore. I’ve been mostly successful at cutting back I guess. I have gotten into decent shape and can wear my old jeans again. I haven’t gone to work hungover in quite some time. I like waking up early on a weekend morning and working out. 

Still, I want to challenge myself even more. Maybe subconsciously I know that my “cutting back” is still not good enough. I should do more. I read about Dry January in this group and knew this is what I wanted to do. I told my husband yesterday and he instantly agreed to do it with me. I also told my sister when she came over for lunch. She said that she was contemplating something similar, and also said that she would join us for Dry January.  

Today will be my first sober day in who knows how long. We have a fully stocked bar which will always be a temptation. However, I’ve always been very good at being strict with myself when there’s something I want to accomplish. I don’t know where Dry January will take me. I suppose that’s something I’ll have to figure out on January 31st. I am looking forward to feeling and looking better and being proud of myself for being stronger than the temptation to drink.

I am wary of the weekends and how I will successfully get through without my drinks. I am wary of how I will deal with teenage stepkids when I can’t drink. As the saying goes, I guess I’ll take it one day at a time, or maybe just one hour at a time.

Thanks for letting me ramble. I will not drink with you today.",4
2020-01-02 13:48:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ej2ap5/making_it_official/,Making it official,"Last year I tracked my drinking using a single page calendar. I simply put a blue X over days I stayed sober and a red circle around days I had any alcohol. No amounts, no judgements about myself, knowing I was trying to slowly cut down. Over the course 2019, I drank 147 days, or approximately 40% of the year. Now 2018 and every year before that since I was 15 was probably in the 80-90%, so there is progress there, but I was still shocked at how high that number remained, and ashamed in looking at problem months like August were I just fell off the wheels and fell back into daily drinking.

I had my last drink at a work Christmas party on December 13th 2019, where I spent $75 on over-priced beer. We're in 2020 and I'm never drinking again. I told myself that I was going to quit drinking at 35, just like I quit smoking at 30, but my birthday isn't until February. So maybe a New Years resolution? But again, if I'm quitting for the right reasons, and there are ONLY right reasons, why wait. So I stopped on Dec 14th 2019.

The book The Naked Mind really helped. Tracking my drinking really helped. The sub, despite myself only lurking what seems like the past 2 years has really helped. I told my family and friends I don't drink anymore. I told my wife I will do whatever it takes to keep myself honest and true. I will post here in 1 year and announce my sober results.

Good luck to everyone and they're goals in 2020.

I've been on SD since 2013(!), and this is my year, my decade.  It's tempting to change my avatar, but I'm keeping this one with a million badge resets. 

I was a high-functioning alcoholic, and I have progressed to a quasi-functioning, scary-bottom alcoholic.  I'm now a bad bitch who doesn't drink.

I have been lurking for a while, commenting occasionally, but I haven’t really introduced myself. Sorry, this might be a long one. 

I’ve been a weekend binge drinker for almost 10 years now, but in the last 2 years I have been slowly getting worse, to where I am lucky to go 2 days without drinking; and when I drink it’s always heavily. 

I got concerned I may be an alcoholic; I would ask my non-drinking friends if I am an alcoholic, and tell them how much I drank, and they always said “No, not yet, you are still working, you don’t drink when you go out, we don’t think you are an alcoholic”. So I didn’t worry. 

Suddenly when I \*wanted\* to skip a weekend, I couldn’t. I would always talk myself back into it.  So I Googled what it is to be an alcoholic; and the answers were not helpful. I always had a few of the signs, but not all, and so I thought maybe I hadn’t crossed that line yet, so I didn’t worry. 

I never drank before 5; until I started doing it. I never drank during the week or before a workday; Until I started doing it. It seems that every line I had drawn in the sand and said “I will not cross this” was being crossed; every rule broken. In the last year, I stopped bothering to try to follow my rules. 

I told everyone I love that I thought I was an alcoholic, and wanted to try to stop or cut back. They were all very supportive, and helpful, and it bought me a week before I stopped bothering to tell them about my successes and failures, and everything returned to “normal”.

One friend, who is several years dry now (she used to be a heavier drinker than me even now) suggested I go find a meeting, so I can talk to people who have been here, or are here. I do not believe in a higher power, of any kind, even metaphorically, so AA is not for me. I have looked into some secular options, but depression and anxiety has kept me from taking the step. 

Then, a bare few weeks ago, I found this subreddit; and started reading. It was an eye-opener bordering on epiphany. It’s like you all were reading my mind and putting it on reddit; but these were your experiences. The same questions, the same descriptions of that craving clawing at your gut, the same excuses to drink…. It is all right here, and staring me in the face. 

I may not be as bad off as some here, and I am worse off than others; but without a doubt, I am addicted to alcohol; a drunk; an alcoholic; one who only drinks to get drunk. And it is /r/stopdrinking that has finally shown this to me, and answered the questions my friends and google could not. 

So here I am, again, on Day 1. Making this post is already anxiety inducing, but like any community of this sort I will only really benefit by participating. So, today, I once again reach behind me and tear that Demon of Addiction from my back, look it right in its Jaundiced eyes, and say, with all the conviction I can muster: Not. Today.

Then I figured one mixed drink couldn't hurt. And I'll be damned if it wasn't so tasty! There couldn't be that much alcohol in it if it tastes this good right? Turns out there were 3 shots of gin in each glass. So I spent the first day of the new year feeling horrible, depressed, and hungover. I tried to remember if I made an ass of myself, and why the hell my whole body hurt.

We apparently ran a semi naked race, where I fell and screwed my knee and elbow up. I cracked the screen on my brand new smart watch. I had my first legit new year's Eve kiss and can't remember it at all.

&#x200B;

* **I want to lose some weight.** My whole adult life, I've hovered around one weight. Always wish I was just a handful of pounds skinnier, but overall, am happy with my weight. But in the past six or eight months or so, I've gained a notable amount of weight. My old favorite jeans don't really fit anymore; I've had to buy a couple pairs in a bigger size just to be comfortable. I'm going to turn that around. 
* **I want to stop taking my antidepressant**. There's nothing wrong with taking an antidepressant if you need it; but the thing is, I never needed one before this year. I have been reading up on the impact alcohol can have on anxiety and depression, and I think that's a huge factor for me. While there's no shame in taking antidepressants, I'd really rather not take them if alcohol is the only reason I need them. (Also, I've been kidding myself by pretending my weight gain is due to the pills. I know it's a possible side effect, but at the same time, drinking 4,000 calories a week of beer isn't helping my situation at all. Even if it turns out I need an antidepressant long-term, I bet I could be skinnier than I am, just by cutting out booze. Skinnier, and happier.) 
* **I want to help my skin.** I'm 34 years old, and have had clear skin for most of my life, but lately my acne just won't quit. And my skin looks dull. And I always look tired. Aside from the alcohol, I'm a pretty healthy person; I should look way better than I do. I eat a good diet. I could exercise more, but I'm not entirely sedentary. There's no reason for me to look as tired as I do. 
* **I want to sleep better.** I have sleep apnea, diagnosed in the last several months. I've been using a CPAP machine to sleep, and it's helped a ton. But I've also been tracking my usage, and my breathing stats, and my blood oxygen, to maximize the benefits of therapy. And WOW does alcohol make a difference. I had 5 drinks on NYE, and that night, even with the CPAP machine, my blood oxygen got down to 79%. (Normal levels are above 95%.) On nights I haven't had anything to drink, my level never goes below 96%. 
* **I want to focus better.** I have ADHD. It's not severe, but it is sometimes a barrier to getting my work done and achieving my other goals. I have a feeling I could focus a lot better if I wasn't constantly on an alcohol-fueled dopamine rollercoaster. Maybe I could stop taking my stimulant medication, as well -- what if it turns out I don't NEED stimulants and antidepressants, and I'm just medicating myself to deal with the effects of alcohol use? 
* **I want to have better digestion.** I've been dealing with some IBS symptoms, a lot of gas, some bloating, some general unsettled feelings for a few years now. And I have a growing list of foods that seem to irritate my stomach. I wonder how much that could improve if I wasn't drinking poison daily? And if I didn't have alcohol-fueled anxiety further complicating every process my body does? 

If I sleep better, I'm going to have better skin. I'm going to have better mental health. If I drink less, I'm going to have better mental health, and I may not need to take a pill with weight gain and loss of libido as possible side effects. I'm going to think more clearly. I'm going to thrive. 

I have a lot of health goals and alcohol is the #1 barrier to achieving all of them.",19

But looking back over last year I was sober for at least 5 months of it (possibly more, i would have to go look where I wrote down my dates) which was a cool accomplishment, even though they werent all consecutive 

I also forgot how dehydrating a hangover could be and the bad sleep you get.   But as I've read, not to be too hard on myself for this and to consider it as field research to remember why I quit in the first place

I’ve even gotten my partner on board to do it with me. I’ve told him that this means a lot to me as he is a daily IPA drinker and his support will make this (hopefully) the tiniest bit easier.

However I’m thinking that I want this to stick. I’ve thought of removing drinking from my life countless times, I can’t even count. But I always resort back to the same daily drinking as before, waking up loathing myself, feeling horrible not just physically and mentally. 

When I think of all that alcohol doesn’t do for me it far outweighs a life with it. Since I’ve been a daily wine drinker it’s like someone has taken so much from my life, especially the last few years - feeling the highs (and the lows) and just feeling more deeply in my body and soul. It seems simple but so true.

I do however know that this is not going to be easy. This is not the first time I’ve tried this, but I want this to be the first time I’ll succeed and stay sober. I want to show myself how good life can be and how much I’ve been missing. Any words of encouragement  or help from those that have more days under their belt would be appreciated.

A problem I'm experiencing now is that NYE I attended a concert with my boyfriend and best friend and some new people that stayed with us as our concert was in my city.

I stressed so much about seeing people (none of it actually mattered) and felt so out of place in my own home when everyone showed up. For all the times I'd been before I felt like I didn't belong.

More carnage and mayhem. Been horrible.

Now I had my last drink, I have issue's staying off it. Loneliness, boredom, that inner emptiness that calls to be filled with destructive things.

I find meetings very hard. I've attended two since I last drank. 

I am a loner and hate crowds and get anxious at them. I can bypass the religious thing as its not a big deal compared to stopping drinking, in the end its only a miserable existence the way I drink.

Just after attending a funeral of a good friend who passed away, ho had issues with addiction and its been heart breaking to witness the devastation of what is left behind.

It made me realize it isn’t worth it. Today I begin again, with you guys!","I was doing great and had a sober NYE and New Year’s Day after 5 days of sobriety. Last night I went to dinner with a friend and acted on impulse to have one glass of champagne. I felt proud that I only had one and knew I could still drive, sleep, take care of my obligations, etc. But the thing is, I realize that I can’t go into these situations not knowing if I can stop at one or if it will trigger a binge and then send me back down the slippery slope. I am a problem drinker. Having even just one isn’t worth it. 

My partner came home from work sick yesterday and told me he couldn’t take our daughter to daycare because he’s too sick. Deep down I think it’s because he has been drinking a half a fifth a day and his body is pissed. I know it will be a challenge to quit when my partner is in active addiction but I’m hoping that he’ll see the benefits of quitting and quit too. We’ve both been alcoholics and drug addicts since our teen years. Still highly functional (usually), but it doesn’t last forever. I told him I wanted to quit and he supports me and says it would be so good for me, but he isn’t ready to stop I guess. 

I started reading Allen Carr’s easyway to quit drinking and it’s great!! The message so far is basically that you should rejoice in not having to be a slave to alcohol instead of feeling deprived, because we’ve all been lied to and lied to ourselves about what alcohol does to us. 

I thought i could just switch to smoking weird instead of drinking, but it’s the same difference for me. I got high yesterday and lost my car keys sledding and my friend had to give me an hour long round trip drive home to get my spare. The day before I lost my phone and had it returned to me. I’m not sure why I’m so desperate not to be sober, why I feel like I can’t possibly cope with every day life, but I realize I am just going to have to learn to live inside my own head.

Nostalgic and so much fun.,"Perspective is everything. In an attempt to reform my unconscious understanding of what alcohol is, I’ve been challenging my perspective at every turn and this was SUCH a gratifying one.

My best friend lives 2 hours away. About once a month, we would get together and drink to oblivion, catch up, and crash at one of our respective apartments. 

Last night, while not drinking, I had a moment of clarity where I found myself saying “wow when’s the last time we had a sleepover?! I feel like we’re 17 again!” My friend looked at me confused, and reminded me we always do this (she had been drinking all night). 

I realized that the difference was that I was having so much fun ordering food, talking about life in our pajamas, getting overly invested in the Great British Baking Show, and laughing hysterically at the Rotten Tomato’s reviews of Cats because I was genuinely present for those moments. I was brought back to my younger self when the joy of a sleepover was the sleepover itself. I was flooded of memories of being a teenager and painting our nails and talking about boys and mixing popcorn with chocolate and watching scary movies and NONE of that fun was booze. 

Alcohol truly robs you of the ability to feel pleasure in every day things. This is so clear to me this morning. 

In all my doubt about whether I can do this or if it’s worth it, I have to remember this perspective. There must be other precious moments that have been lost to me and I want to give myself the opportunity to rediscover them. I can only do this sober.

I'll spare the nitty-gritty because there's plenty of other posts here that share triumphs and struggles better than I ever could, but I'd really just like to share one insight I had about this trip. 

I'm sure many of y'all can relate, but I'm definitely not one to ask for help or even mindfulness about my drinking when I'm around my loved ones. I try to go out of my way to make as little of a deal about it as possible because I HATE feeling like my inability to drink safely could get in the way of other people's enjoyment. Spoiler alert: it doesn't. 

Without telling me, my family made a concerted effort to conceal their alcohol intake as much as possible over the trip. To store their booze, they bought a mini-fridge with a lock and kept it hidden in their closet. They bought a set of YETI thermos cups for everyone, one color designated for those drinking alcohol and one that wasn't. They didn't tell me this, they just said, ""here u/Throwberaway, this is your YETI for the week, everyone gets one, make sure you use yours."" They also cut down their intake considerably: I could never tell when they were drinking unless we went out to eat and wine was ordered for the table. I found myself getting rather annoyed when their levels of inebriation reached a certain point but it wasn't triggering or anything. Even my sister's fiance, a pretty heavy drinker (not an alcoholic) barely drank throughout the trip. 

All this to say, my family and I have learned from past mistakes. I told them repeatedly that I didn't want any special concessions made on my behalf and that I wanted them to enjoy themselves. They took it upon themselves to do it anyway, and I'm really grateful I have them in my corner. I wasn't triggered once throughout the trip and had an amazing time! 

It did make me realize that I can't do this alone. I need to be more vocal when I need help. I need to be more present and attuned to how my body is feeling. I need to remember the past, what's worked and what hasn't. I need to be less prideful and start making my needs known instead of burying my discomfort until it boils over. The greatest Christmas gift I could've given them was the sober version of me, and I was able to do it. It feels really good have all this momentum and I can't wait to see what this year holds for all of us!!!",4

Here's a list of things that bothered me 4 years ago that I don't think about anymore. 

&#x200B;

Very helpful to keep a journal, shows how far you've come. 

&#x200B;

1. **Suicide** \- I had my head in a noose for a lot of 2015. Really for a lot of the years before that too. I don't even think about it anymore. My emotions are level. (here's a post from 2 years ago about it -  [https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/7i1il9/im\_not\_going\_to\_kill\_myself/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/7i1il9/im_not_going_to_kill_myself/) )
2. **Money -** Do you know how much money you could get right now? I don't. I used to always know. I know it's not endless but I also didn't get stressed over Christmas. I thought nothing of spending 100 euro on lego for myself. Of course my bills are paid. When your most expensive habit is travelling (and you live in the Ryanair zone), you suddenly seem to have plenty.
3. **Weight -** I don't know how much I weigh. My clothes fit nicely. I can just about touch my toes.  I know I lost 20kg in 2016/2017 so I'm probably around 80kg. Still eat 3am kebabs way too often but always being willing and able to walk and cook and sleep properly clearly helps. I'm healthy. Not running a marathon tomorrow but I don't get winded going upstairs.
4. **Being a good person -** I can't tell you what a relief it is to wake up every day and not be instantly consumed by the feeling that I make the world worse. Probably linked with point number 1 but I know I'm not actively making the world worse. I'm not stealing from other people. I not making people uncomfortable. The health and law people aren't wasting time on me. I plant trees. I make funny faces at kids on trains. I can & do volunteer. I'm not perfect, daft to think anyone is, but I'm not awful.
5. **Sexual anxieties:** My penis works. I can feel when it's being touched. I don't feel embarrassed to take my shirt off. I know the names of everyone I have sex with. I'm happy I want to have sex with them and we aren't just two idiots playing STD roulette for 10 minutes of nonsense you can't even feel. 

&#x200B;

I could probably go on but man, those are 5 giant things. People go their whole lives in a panic about these things. I've replaced them with other daft worries, I assure you, but I am so thankful to have those worries.

I can't , and I won't, say you can stop drinking and all those worries will go away. I'm aware I've got a bunch of lucky bounces along the way but I also think, I *know,* that these 5 things would be exactly the same today if I didn't stop. To be any better I had to stop drinking. 

To play the game I had to play on easy mode.  

Happy New Year. Play another round of easy mode with me today. 

Hell, why not play all year?",158

Also I'm struggling with how to go from here, I've been reading all of these successful stories about people getting their lives back, how their depression and anxiety slowly decreases, of how they're losing weight, gaining their motivation, happiness and health back, almost as if sobriety is some kind of guarantee that life will become so much better.I know it's not going to be that easy for me, that I'll still be the same person with all of my problems that I haven't been able to solve, even before I started drinking. I'm trying to not rely on sobriety itself, as it's doomed to set me up for disappointment.

Simple does not mean easy. I've proven over many years that sobriety is not easy for me. But it can be simple. I'm stripping away all self-imposed expectations. I don’t need to fill the sober time with something productive or creative. It'd be nice, but it's not required. I don’t need to worry about not “wasting” my sober time. I just need to be sober.

Recently I started thinking about cost-benefit analysis when it comes to drinking. the other night we started drinking at 7pm, until 12 midnight. So 5 hours of drinking. Those 5
hours costed me the following whole days worth of recovery and feeling like shit. Is this even worth it for just a few hours of fun? I don’t think so.

I've just joined this group today. I've read many of your stories and mine is the same but different. This might be a bit lengthy so thank you in advance for indulgence.

I first got drunk when I was 14 (I am now 58). I have been drinking ever since. Not constantly, but I am one of those drinkers that has no 'off' switch and will keep going and going till I fall over. Literally. None of this would be that much of a problem but I tend to make a twat of myself. I see now that alcohol has been covering for a lack of self-confidence but I've lost more friends drinking than I've made with my alcohol-fuelled wit and phony confidence.

I had a mastectomy almost 10 years ago and was on a hormone blocker for what was effectively six years. This did awful awful things to my head and emotional state - just what every alcoholic needs! Like many, I knew I had a problem and tried moderation: weekends only; then weekends and Fridays; then weekends and nights I hated my job (most of them). That failed spectacularly. Not only that, my alcohol consumption actually increased.

Three years ago my alcoholic father died (no sympathy please, we had long been estranged - something for those of you with children to ponder perhaps). After he died it slowly became apparent how much of my childhood had been blighted by his constant drinking. That included his mistreatment of my mother. Finally in early December 2019 something snapped and I stopped drinking. A couple of weeks later I realised it was almost on the anniversary of my father's death. It was like something in my head had said 'enough is enough'. 

And it has been. OK, I lapsed on NY eve, mostly because we have dogs and it is very stressful with the fireworks. What stunned me is how awful I felt the next day. Did I really just spend years feeling this bad but not know it? Sober, I'm sleeping better, am less anxious and am starting to do more of the things I love. I hope to keep this up.

And just as a final kicker, I've just had a chat with my partner who tells me he is very proud I'm on the wagon. What's not to like?

Thanks for your time. For anyone reading this who is wavering - please stick with it. Alcohol doesn't make your anxiety and depression go away: it hides it, for it only to pop out unwelcome at an inappropriate time later on. Best to all of you.",16

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to \[/r/stopdrinking\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\*

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in \[/r/stopdrinking\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)), we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\*

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at \[/r/stopdrinking\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn’t:\*\*

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hi everyone!

(Sorry this is late - there were technical difficulties and we had to catch the gremlin in the SD machine...)

**Hey guys, can you upvote the post so it gets to the top of the “hot” feed please? There are two posts stickied so this one isn’t today! Thanks...**

I don’t seem to have much to say today! I’ve written and deleted about 1000 words so far, trying to get into my groove, but it just ain’t coming. Three or four drafts, gone. 

I hope it’s enough for you to know that I’m here. I guess that’s true in all relationships, isn’t it? Sometimes you have a lot to contribute, other times it’s enough to just sit quietly with someone, letting your presence wash over them. I’m here. With you. Today. Not drinking.

My 13-year old son said something earlier today that I'd like to share with you. We were standing at the beach together chatting, and he suddenly said ""how long have you been sober?"" I was surprised, because I haven't used that word when I've spoken to him about it. He just knows I've stopped drinking. I told him ""just over three months"". He gave me a million-watt smile and said ""well done, mum"" and abruptly changed the subject. Carrying that moment through my day has been like holding the sun in my belly. Warm, comforting, life-affirming.

Have a great day, my beautiful friends. 

I’m so proud to be here with you.

Love,

I proved I am a selfish, manipulative, destructive maniac with my actions.

My thoughts and feelings at this exact moment are how incredibly thankful I am to all of you here.

&#x200B;

This is my first post, and rather a long one, but I've been coming to this community off and on for the last few years. First of all, the people that participate here had probably one of the biggest impacts to my internal dialogue when it concerned my drinking, even when I wasn't thinking about it, knee deep in a bottle either alone, with a friend or a group. 

For the background of my drinking, it started early, but never often. Took my first drink of beer at my 6th birthday party accidentally as my father left a can of beer on the coffee table. My mother was pissed about the situation then, but eventually thought it was cute many years later. Alcohol always seemed kinda harmless personally, but something only adults did to 'cut loose'. My whole family drank, and at holiday events then the booze ran deep sometimes there where fights. We came from a solid middle to upper middle class background so at least that fundamental base was there for me. 

Fast forward when I hit late middle school. Got wasted for the first time, I mean absolutely wasted drunk at 15 years old at a friends brothers 21st. Never touched it again until final year in high-school, when I was allowed a beer after graduation, then boonsfarm my older sibling and friends would buy that summer off before college (probably drank 3 all summer long). Then 21 hit, didn't barely drink, in fact didn't even have a chance to drink as the stores stopped selling by the time I actually wanted one. Then 22 hit and my friends/roommates where all partiers, etc. Slowly over the years the habit began taking shape, so subtly that I could not put two and two together that when I drank my life turned to shit for the time being, until I stopped and things started going well again, extremely well. 

Overall cost of drinking where lost relationships, time, money, friends, and career opportunities. I'm not going to externalize this as the booze was the issue, the issue was me and the booze. It made me dishonest, petty, not respecting peoples boundaries or feelings. The boundaries thing always was disrespected when I drank, basically made me a terrible version of myself, most especially to the people closest and dearest to me. 

I've had many stretches of not drinking for sometimes several weeks or months at a time (probably three total months last year). Though like everyone here, we've tried to 'manage' this after a bit of time away from the bottle thinking it won't slip back into those dark places, those dark cracks in our psyche when it comes to this drug that we forget about after enough time passes. 

Though something clicked recently, and finally by the Grace of God and actually talking to someone about this made it all roll into place to stop. Someone at my work whom I respect deeply not only as a coworker, but as a person had dropped subtle hints about them not drinking. I picked up on these hints over the last few months and pulled them aside and asked them off the cuff with total respect directly about it. My older sibling had, and probably still has massive issues with this drug as it's ruined their life, and know first hand their struggle for decades. Years and years ago, when we where closer siblings I'd sometimes go to meetings with them (even though I barely drank, or even at all at the time), so knowing the subtle signs and phrases used by sober folk wasn't obtuse to me personally. Never having attended any meeting or recovery groups for myself, I know what a ""Friend of Bill"" means. 

It was this conversation I had with them, that for the first time there was a huge sense of relief, actual, fundamental relief. It's as if all of these stories I've read on here, personal experiences, knowing people that died from this, the worst times in my life, a ton of self reflection that sometimes can be so easily forgotten came together. It was as simple as talking about it with someone that had an air of trustability, candidly. 

I'm not much for steps or programs personally, but whatever works for others I'll try it. My plan is to go to a meeting, and simply talk. Don't have any intentions other than talk, interestingly enough the person that cuts my hair has always been open about their sobriety. Two days ago I talk to them about this, got their number and am having yet another ally on this train. 

Regardless of my craving pretty badly this late evening for a few hours the desire to go pick something up, deep down wasn't there. Knowing what was learned this whole time would be forgotten, and the tried and true guilt tomorrow morning after drinking might overshadow all of this. The years of learning that where condensed down to a singular moment to finally stay away from the drink, might be erased, for good. That is the gravity of this to me, and I can say never again, but for now and tonight I won't be drinking with you all. 

I can share so much more, but for now I'll go ahead and leave this here for others.",31

So last night I went to a apartment party at a high rise in Chicago. About 10 people. Amazing setting.   Some how the word got out, before me and my GF arrived, that I'm sober.  So I have this weird self inflicted pressure that everyone will think negatively about me not drinking.  I think most newly sober people will have these thought.

  Right off the bat, a guy I just met tells me theres Baileys in the frosting on the cup cakes.  I'll eat things with trace amounts booze in it.  I just dont drink it.  Personally I think that is extremely thoughtful of him. I thanked him for his thoughtfullness and proceeded to smash 2 cupcakes. 

Next, we all sit down to play about 3 drinking games in a row.  Ones I remeber very well from my drunk days.  Circle of death, shithead, etc.  I sit down with my NA ginger beer and commence the awkward act of choosing people to drink their drinks. Not one person chose me to chug my beer.  It was weird.  I'm not really sure how I feel about the whole thing. I'm sure it would have been more awkward to sit back and watch the whole room play from a lonely corner.  I chose to play and deal with my awkwardness.  I'm glad I did it.  They were the most accepting, understanding, and thoughtful people. They do exist.

Everyone was drunk.  I obviously wasnt. It's so strange dealing with your feelings of being sober around 10 wasted people. In the end, it was a great mental exercise. I'm not sure if I would reccomend people healing with sobriety to put them in this scenario.  But it will teach you alot about yourself and show you that its possible to stay sober in the most awkward of times.

Last night I was out to dinner and saw a non-alcoholic beer on the menu. It wasn't true NA, it was 0.5%. In a split second decision, I decided to order it. 


Here is the problem. I craved alcohol and gave in to that temptation. I also knew it wasn't a true NA, and decided to drink it anyways. I had several sips and felt guilty, so I ordered a soda instead. (It helped that it was a pretty bad beer.)

So, do I reset my counter? Is today day one again? I didn't REALLY drink, but I gave in to the temptation to drink. Or am I feeling guilty over something insignificant?",3
2020-01-01 23:56:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eitlt4/my_wife/,My wife,"I’m about 6 months sober, after almost 20 years of hard drinking. I started working very seriously towards sobriety after I got acute pancreatitis - I realized I didn’t have a choice any more. It has not been easy of course but I am proud of where I am today.

as I go to sleep on Jan 1 of a new decade I wanted to write a public shoutout to my wife. It’s one more entry in my public Reddit diary cataloguing my path to long term sobriety.

My drinking worried her always, but... I managed to have a damn good career and I also took care of all my shit for the most part even though I was drinking basically constantly all day. I somehow managed life, though it never was my best life obviously.

I put her through a lot of stress, a lot of worries.

But not once has she made me feel bad. Even after the pancreatitis, when this woman had started a brand new super high profile job and she had to prep special food for me for a few weeks, had to help me with anxiety and digestion issues, had to help me use the toilet, etc ... 0 complaints, 0 anger, 0 blame, 0 resentment.

She views it as an illness that we will conquer together. she expects honesty from me - and that I give, it is all I can give to her on this.

She also decided to stop drinking herself, to make it easier for me. And it has. My favorite person who I hang out with most is my sober buddy.

Every step of the way through this lonely and vicious battle, she has been there for me, with me. 

She is the light of my life. The mere opportunity to spend one more day with her makes me want to wake up tomorrow. Surely there are other fortunate people in the world, but I feel none are as lucky as me for there’s only one of my wife.

I wish you all a happy new year, may this be your best year yet.",434

Part of my freelance earnings come from writing about bars, and most of my community continues to imbibe especially for weddings and stag dos so I’ll inevitable have to drink a little bit during this month, but where and whenever possible, I’ll be sticking to non-alcoholic drinks.

We stayed at a hotel and on the way home, I got pulled over for speeding. And you know what, it felt GREAT. Obviously I didn't want to get a speeding ticket, but it felt amazing knowing that there was no way I could get a DUI from drinking shenanigans the night before. No FSTs, no PBT, no suspicious glares or questions. Just a nice cop telling me to slow down and that if I pay the fine, I'll get no points.

My addiction took off nearly 10 years ago. For 7 years I was an IV heroin, cocaine, crack, and meth addict. After two overdoses, homelessness on the streets for nearly a year, jail, friends dying at my house you think I would have quit. There is a demon inside of me, and the demon is my self destructive and disconnected soul.

I have made progress since I have began to get clean. I quit shooting any drug and heroin, crack, and powder cocaine for good nearly three years ago. The last time I shot heroine I was arrested and spent some 60 days in jail. After jail, I was released with my shirt on my back and moved to the Florida the second days after release, I was off to restart everything. I did make major progress. I lived at a halfway house for support, got a job, and supported my myself for the first time in well... ever! After a year of doing great... I turned to the bottle. Drinking everyday and every hour was my new job. Started drinking a half gallon of whiskey a day... continues like this for 8-9 months. When I finally came to the end I decided to quit on my own and wound up in the hospital for 26 days after two seizures and an alcohol psychosis were I was picked up for screaming through the neighborhood someone was trying to kill me with a car. My family came and took me back home.

It’s been two years now. I got home and again made even more progress. I stayed at a sober home competing the stay at a year! I was able to get my license back, a car, and have even began to pay off my debts I owe people. I started at a restaurant right when I moved in the house as a server and still have the same job right now and have been hired to be the general manager. But... there is a problem. I have been on a crystal meth binge for 6 days in a row, culminating into today waking up after sleeping 12 hours with guilt, shame, and remorse. I am staying with my mom at the moment and didn’t want to disrespect her by coming home all tweaked out. So I have to take the walk of shame back home and tell my family. My mother already told me if I did anything like this she was going to kick me out.. so that’s what I am expecting. I came into a couple shifts this week pretty high and all though not in trouble at work... def wasn’t a good look. I am going to look at the coincidence of my binge ending this day and the fact that this is resolution (New Years) as something Devine.

I have gone through about 10 detox’s, 4-5 treatment centers, lost friends to drugs and to the game. Lost tons of meaningful relationships and family too. I am used to losing things, I am so tired. I have pulled just enough together to give this a shot again, but honestly I don’t know how many more I have left to give before I just fall to the game...

This post isn’t a cry for help because I have part of a program for many years and know exactly what I need to do by now. Rather a request. Anyone reading this post that is struggling through the same just know I am too. Let’s all pray for each other and live the life the universe intended for us. If no one has told you today, I love you, and you are worth it. Let’s all do this together.

UPDATE: So, yesterday I came home and told my family. Went just like I had planned, horrible. I am able to stay at the families while I detox thank god. I got home from the trap motel, ate, drink water, smoked pot, and slept about 10 hours until I had to get up for work at 630. Texted my sponsor when I got to work to stay accountable. Had a productive day and walked from work with about 200 in cash. I was feeling antsy as time neared to clock out, so again I reached out. I told my mom to expect me shortly and turned on my location for her to see. I called my sponsor leaving work and when I got home. Just gave my mom my car keys for the night and plan on eating and sleeping until work at 630 Tom morning. After work my sponsor is taking me to a meeting. I finally told my mom I still had my pipe, she is letting me throw it in her trash. I feel better. We will see how tonight goes and what tomorrow brings, feeling positive for now. Keeping everyone updated through my journey. I hope this helps someone in any way. God bless.",52

I can without hesitation check off all but one of the 11 symptoms of alcohol use disorder. It's gotten so bad. 

I've managed (with quite a lot of effort) to take breaks here and there. And trying to see more of the friends I made before I developed a drinking problem.  

Still, around all but a handful of the people I consider friends, even very close friends, I tend to be self-conscious when I'm sober that I'm not ""fun"" enough.  One friend in particular who I've known for more than a decade, and whose friendship I really value, is really sharp and quick-witted and I can tell when she's secretly impatient in a conversation. That sort of energy makes me really self-conscious and I tend to get stuck in my head and I'll mess up stories and my sense of comic timing if totally off, if I even think of anything funny to say. The only way we were able to get close in the first place despite having a lot of mutual friends was by going out and drinking together. She barely drinks now, so usually I don't drink when I'm hanging out with her, but recently I had brunch with her and a couple other college friends and had a bloody mary. Afterwards she and I kept hanging out one-on-one and I got her to crack up like I used to be able to all the time, especially when we'd go out drinking together, and it made me so happy. 

That's one example, but I do have a lot of other friendships that I value that I just I'm scared I wouldn't be ""fun"" enough to sustain without drinking. That's not even counting the friendships that revolve almost exclusively around drinking together, which I have no doubt will fade if/when I give up drinking entirely.",11

Pretty scared to go back to work on Monday, I took advantage of the 2 weeks holidays to stay home, not going anywhere, not going to a party or see friends to celebrate, I know how people look at you when you say no to a beer (even my parent do). So just me and my daughter, it was easier. And after day 4, I did not really want to drink. Well I want to drink, to feel better, to feel ""happy"" for a few hours, to get some ""rest"". To drink to be drunk like many of us says.

On Monday I am afraid of the cycle to start again. Wake up early, make breakfast, take the kid to school, go to work, take care of business, drive back, pick up the kid, make diner, laundry, take care of stuff. And by 7-8PM I want my reward for a good day of work. Driving home, I go in auto-pilot mode, pass by a specs and before I know it I have a bottle in the trunk. After that, I feel calm, excited, happy already, lying to myself why, I have more energy. I keep taking care of business, lying to myself about this bottle being there and then come the moment. I am on my own, it is time to sit and relax and enjoy the time off of the day. One sip and it is over, my brain already said fuck it, fuck everybody I deserve this time of happiness.

No i do not want that to start again, Monday will be Day 13, a goal I did not met in the last 7 years.

I am not expecting a response here, I feel stupid to be so weak and already almost give up, Probably the lack of sleep, I don't know. every 1st of the month feel like a January 1st to me so I do not have the new year resolution pressure, I do not really care, this month or another, it is the same battle anyway.

I was anxious all day yesterday leading up to hanging out. I was going to avoid it all together. But I’m at this point where I’m tired of being a social hermit (although I find it necessary) and I really just needed a night out besides being alone at home. I just tried to remain as positive as I could about not drinking at a bar on a drinking holiday (and not drinking beer at a punk show).

Anyways when I first got there I was there before my friends feeling kind of awkward. Almost wanting to leave. But I talked myself out of leaving. And started conversing with people. My friends came and my friends gf who I have met a few times was super sweet and just thought I was awesome for being sober. I drank monster energy drinks like I was 15 again and danced and moshed and it was an awesome night.

Another friend of mine commented on my 3 months, he was like yeah, you can’t metabolize alcohol. Lol. It is true though. I have always been a next level type of drunk compared to everyone else. I got a text from my friend this morning saying that I’m fun to be around and better sober. So it was a win.

I’m proud and happy. But the demon that wants me to drink is still around. I still miss it and I’m still getting used to social events without a buzz at the least. I felt a little uncomfortable last night. Almost like I wasn’t myself without being drunk. I don’t know how to describe it. Sometimes I felt like I had to force having fun a little more than what alcohol kind of just did for me.

My boyfriend went ahead and stayed for an hour or so and then sprinted home to kiss me at midnight. Later he told me he thought it was a good thing I didn’t go because there was tons of alcohol and everybody was wasted. 

So we finished Watchmen (excellent series) and had amazing sex and went to bed, both of us stone cold sober and very happy. 

Not sure why I felt like sharing this story, but maybe I should share this piece of wisdom my bf gave me: there’s no point in putting yourself through unnecessary temptation and making your life harder than it needs to be. Eventually, I’ll get to a place where I can go to those parties and not care that I’m not drinking (or even be glad I’m not drinking!) but I’m not there right now, and that’s ok. I suspect it’s that way with a lot of us right now.",21

THAT IS NORMAL AND OK.

Getting sober is really hard. That is why there are entire recovery communities and organizations built on it. 

There is plenty of time to cut back on sugar or ice cream or laying around in bed or whatever else in a few weeks, or months, or even next year. However long it takes you to feel secure in your sobriety. 

Unless your doctor says you shouldn’t, go ahead and enjoy a couple Cokes and a pint of ice cream or 3 and appreciate how much nicer a sugar hangover is compared to a real one.

Recently I had a rough couple of weeks at work, getting stressed out, almost having panic attacks over concerns I was about to get fired. Over what, I'm not sure but I finally talked with my boss and her basic reaction was ""what the hell are you talking about?"". After talking with my wife, I came to the realization that much of my anxiety and depression in life is from drinking too much. I live in Illinois and I was able to buy weed today. I figured I would try replacing drinking with smoking but just like every other time in the past, I hated it. I felt extremely anxious with my heart racing. That wasn't the solution. 

So I am going to try something else. I had a talk with my wife about wanting to quit entirely and she said she is on board to keep an eye on things. And I will try hanging out here. I also found in the past if I take a small amount of benadryl I tend to fall asleep right away and get too tired to drink, so maybe having some of those handy might help? That feels like a better solution than just getting high every night, even if I did like weed. 

If all of that fails, I will call the doctor and see what they can do for me. But let's give it a go. Day 1",6

Anyway I WILL turn these negative thoughts around and reset to day one again and I WILL taper off the Adderall and reduce my caffeine, eat healthily, and become a better mother.

It was sad to see all my old sober dates that came and went over the year, but it was also exciting to see the changes in how I've been writing about my sobriety these past 39 days. This is the longest I've ever made it, and I can even tell in the tone of my writing that something this time feels different. 

June 24 - ""I can't have a positive or even normal relationship with alcohol. It triggers my anxiety. It turns me into an asshole or an idiot, or both. I can't stop after one or two and I end up wasting my whole next day sick and irritable. Last month [spouse] planned a surprise day up in [big nearby city] for us, including tickets purchased and reservations made, and we couldn't make it because I drank too much the night before. And I was so damn disappointed, and sad, and guilty because god...I was such an asshole to do that.""

I can't fucking wait to *never* be that person again. This year I am saying goodbye to that version of myself, and hello to the sober me that *never* misses out on life because I was a drunk asshole the night before. Cheers to 2020, and to our sober, better selves.

It used to be other drugs when they were younger but today they are mostly addicted to alcohol. Her father is completely and enabler and sees nothing wrong with his actions. He says he drinks because he likes and and no one can stop him. Unfortunately on the other side is her mother, who as well is addicted to drinking and sleeping pills. Within the past year it has gotten to the point of her hiding and stashing bottles and being belligerent at even family events (she used to be sober even at those). 

The issue is she won't accept help and her father being an enabler doesn't stop or even try to help. He admits she has a problem but isn't willing to address his drinking problem. 

Her mother was in the hospital from withdrawal and finally admitted she needed to go to rehab. However her dad talked her out of getting help and even bought her another bottle. Her friend also enable her habits.

My gf and her brother (he's 18 and still lives at home, my gf lives with me) try to talk to them about their substance and alcohol abuse but of course they're in denial. Her mother is at the point of sitting in bushes in the farthest corner of the backyard, chain smoking and drinking. Taking sleeping pills and sleeping/wetting herself wherever she passes out (even outside during winter). She also recently stole money from my gf's wallet.

We're at a crossroads with what to do with her parents. Her dad is still functional, as in he still goes to work to at least pay the bills. But her mom is to the point she's a few drinks away from a serious medical emergency. If you have advice or tips of what to do. We want to get her help and the stress is really taking a toll on my gf's brother.

So I have been trying to fix that amongst many other things, and it’s been hard and stressful, but mostly sober, trekking with some slip ups. 

Well I’m not the most strong willed when it comes to this girl, and she comes over with a tall boy of mikes harder, claiming that if I can drink with my girl friend, then I should drink with her. I felt like it would have escalated to a fight, so I had some sips here and there. I didn’t catch a buzz, but I felt it just a little. 

Just a little is a little too much. 

On the following day, NYE, I was feeling shitty and depressed, like I usually do, and with no willpower whatsoever went and bought a 375 of Vodka from the liquor store that’s literally a block away. I polished it off, and woke up feeling awful. 

Then today I went and bought a second, the entire time thinking to myself, „wtf are you doing dude, this shit has ruined your life and will kill you“, but I felt completely out of control. Like i was aware of what was happening, but I couldn’t do a thing to stop myself.

Now I’m in an intense mental battle with myself, staring at this unopened bottle of vodka. So I need your Support.

Who‘s with me and lost their battle in the new year? It’s the war, not the battle, I tell myself. Lord, please grant me strength, but there is none.

How can I even be doing this? How is this even an option? I went to the hospital a total of three times last year for alcohol withdrawal. This is the most illogical bull**** I have ever experienced, and I have no control. Or so it feels like.

I started to idealise drinking again and missing the old, party-me. The social butterfly who loves to dance and talk and connect with people. When Im sober I get so easily tired of parties and social gatherings. But with a drink I am suddenly so social, confident and emphatic and I enjoy people much more.

So the thoughts of drinking again played in my head a lot lately. I also started to abuse adderall again, which made me more in the ""fuck-it-mood."" Besides that, my therapist told me in on of our sessions that the goal for me is to moderate again with drinking. 

So  I was working yesterday and my boss offered us all shots. I refused. But after a while everyone around me started to get tipsy an giggly, while I was having an adderall-comedown which made me a grumpy mess. I thought: fuck it. I'll drink. lAs soon as I took it, I felt euphoric and guilty at the same time. The feeling as if your about to date your ex again: you know it's not smart, but the old love-feelings make it too hard to resist. I felt social, funny and happy again. All the self-doubt, doubts about my life and grumpiness went away.After that I went to my family and continued drinking in moderation. I was the old me again and shitty to say: I really loved it. After that I went to a houseparty which I normally wouldn't like, but with the pink shine of booze everything was fine. I was fairly capable of moderating this night. I didn't cross 101 limits like I used to (with drugs, sex, and way too much alcohol), but I still regret it somehow. Because I stayed way too long although I didnt really like the party. Because I drank this away. Because I also could have celebrated nye with family who I love, in stead of a house of random strangers who talk about rubbish and listen to rubbish music. Because I lost my keys and my jacket and whatsappt my ex.

This morning I woke up depressed, tired, hangover and with mayor selfhatred and guilt. I am scared. I am scared because I still love the feeling alcohol gives me. Because I still, partially, like the person I turn into with alcohol. Because I don't know if and how I should moderate. Because I dont want to start all over again. Because I think way too often that life and social gatherings is boring without drinks. Because I don't want to relapse like I used to do, with way too much unprescripted adderall and alcohol.

Can someone please give me advice or some encouraging words? 

Thank you and IWNDWYT <3",6

She never tries to fix anything but is entitled to have her life get much better, it’s always everyone else’s fault and every person she met during her day pissed her off. If I’m within earshot, for years, I’ve had to listen to her resentments of everyone from her boss to her co-workers and customers. If I tell her about anything that’s wrong in my life, she either tells me to get over it or tries to do a oneupmanship thing where she just names off more things wrong in her life. Every once in a while, I’ve tried to hard steer her away from this constant fucking performance and she snarls something like “I have the right to talk about what I want!!!”

Finally, I had it with her last Friday. I’m in my early 30s, I spent about 2 hours after my full time job at her home trying to get her Internet fixed, she’s been bugging me because she doesn’t know how to handle her finances and refuses to research things and I finally told her that if she wants to survive, she needs to change something. Get a different job with better benefits since she hates her job, save more, something, anything. At that point it was 11pm at night and I’d been catering to her needs for hours after being up since 6am.

She starts snarling at me about how I shouldn’t “judge” her lifestyle and I finally just got in my car and drove away. She starts calling and saying a bunch of threatening stuff about kicking me out of her will when she isn’t even going to have any money. She starts snarling about her right to this and that and she can say whatever she wants.

“You know what?” I said. “You also have a right to control yourself and you never do, I’m done. I have the right to hang up.”

And I did.

If anyone had a parent like that, especially parents who love “rights” you have rights, too. Use them.",12

2020-01-01 15:08:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ein0qb/i_could_use_some_advice/,I could use some advice,"Hey everyone, im coming here to open up some and to ask for some opinions and/or advice about my drinking habits. I have never really been able to open up to anyone about my concerns about my drinking and how it ties in with my mental health. 

I have a love hate relationship with alcohol. I have recently accepted that I have a problem with overdoing it, nothing really bad has happened from it but I simply don't like losing control and over doing it or waking up and forgetting the end of the night (and the anxiety of what I might have done/said/ect). The problem is that booze is a major crutch for me socially. I struggle with major anxiety and generally end up being super reserved and quiet when I socialize sober. The lower inhibitions of booze feel like a blessing to me, once I feel a buzz I feel free and people generally like me more when I am drinking because I actually open up and show what feels like my true personality. I would be fine if I could stop with a buzz, but sometimes I will cross a line and I won't stop drinking till I pass out. 

A large part of the culture of my friend group from my teens to mid 20's was getting absolutely trashed and partying, I feel like I have a hard time shaking that part of my past. During that period of time my drinking WAS SUPER out of control. At some points I was drinking a fifth a day. I never considered it a problem because that was what all my friends were doing as well (which for most, it turned into a drug habit). I never missed work and thankfully nothing particularly bad occurred because of it. I never tried to cut back or stop so I figured I was fine, I would joke about having a problem like the amount I drank was an accomplishment. 

I cut back drastically 4-5ish years ago or so with some minor road bumps but I felt like I had it under control and was using it responsibly....but occasionally something switches and I drink until I blackout. Part of me wants to walk away from it entirely....but I am honestly scared to. I have a lot of wonderful memories drinking in a responsible manor and honestly... I am generally a pretty miserable person sober. I got black out drunk last night on new years eve, and I feel great today (besides some concern about how the night ended or if I made an ass out of myself), it is like my depression and anxiety were alleviated....sometimes after a night of heavy drinking this happens and I love it and feel no desire to touch booze because I am loving life (minus some minor hangover symptoms). It is like sometimes it resets my mentality and it slowly tapers off in the following days as life happens and the depression returns and it kind of ends up like a cycle. I think I would be fine with quitting drinking 100% if I could feel like I do now most days. 

I wonder if quitting drinking all together would help me mentally, but then I also wonder if my spurts of irresponsible drinking is stemmed from other issues in my life. I have a tendency to overindulge in a lot of things. I also have issues binge-eating. I have a nicotine addiction (I use a vape now, at my worst I was 2 pack a day smoker...this was the same time as my peak drinking). If I like a series, I submerge myself fully in it and escape reality. Same with games, books ect..

&#x200B;

TLDR;

I want to work on bettering myself and I know I have plenty of work to do.....so I guess I am asking you all to help me reflect on my relationship with alcohol,. Sometimes I get concerned that I may have more of an issue then I think I do but no one in my life really seems to think so because I have never skirted responsibilities or commitments due to drinking and I tend to be more likeable when I do drink.

For me, getting educated has been key. I really thought I knew everything there was to know about alcohol. I thought the only price I had to pay was the $$ lost and coping with the fallout the day after. But there is always more to learn and I am seeing alcohol in a whole new light. A poster here described the appeal of a glass of wine to drinking a glass of sand. I feel the same way now. 

Perhaps others can add to this which books/podcasts/blogs have been helpful to them. Alcohol Explained started it all for me. Here is the author summarizing what alcohol does to our minds/bodies EVERY time we drink it.

Not enough exercise. Not enough water. Too many carbs. Indulging in something other than alcohol to attempt to feel better leading to a crappy morning the next day. Guilt of not performing proper self-care and a sense of worry about the upcoming day/s and weeks. I used to think that alcohol was the only reason I was tired or dehydrated. And that my anxiety only came from the hangovers. Been attempting to quit many many times over the years and been changing huge amounts of my lifestyle over the last five years. Especially 2019. Change in eating habits. Exercise. Therapy. Expanding conversations with loved ones. Forgiving. Working to live without judgement and trying not to put myself at the center of situations. It lead me to a weird reality: that being stressed or needing to take care of one's health, both mental and physical, and the need to get sleep and deal with emotions are not only things that someone struggling with alcohol needs to deal with. Huh. What a revelation. Geez. It is ok to be tired or angry. That is how people are. The alcohol is what we use to escape or enhance our sensations. Not what originally caused it. It contributes but is not the original problem. Of course this is commmon sense to those of us who have been working through a lot of these issues for looooooong periods of time. But today I got to start feeling that for real again. Here's to 2020 vision folks. Thank you very much.",7

Me, my son and partner visited to wish her a happy new year.
We asked her how her evening went at my aunt's new year house party ? She told us that it was great before showing video footage on her phone of them all drunkenly singing Come On Eileen followed by Abba's Dancing Queen, which was sung in tribute to my late mother as it was her favourite song.
As time passed my uncle and two of my aunts who were present at the party had come over to my nan's house. Here they were all trading stories from the night before. I couldnt help but feel left out. Maybe it was largely due to the fact that I wasn't there ? Even if I was, I doubt I would have had the same level of enjoyment as they were all seemingly drunk, judging by the video I seen and judging by English drinking culture.
I hope one day I can join them an have that same level of fun without the need for alcohol, because in all honesty I feel like I have missed out.

I look back to March of last year when I spoke to a distant relative at a funeral who had stopped drinking several years earlier. He is a man in his 70s an he told me that stopping drinking was the best thing he has ever done.

I was thinking about this yesterday while cuddled up on the couch with my dog. I didn't start REALLY drinking until 2016 (turning 25 in a few weeks) but for whatever reason, I've been sober on NYE every year ('17,'18,'19) since then. It came to me, that I've made conscious decisions to quit, every year for the last 3 years, around the exact same time. Almost to the day.

Just goes to show that the journey of sobriety is not always a consistent one and if you ride a wagon for long enough (especially if you're not careful initially), you're bound to fall off sooner or later. What I've realized this time around is that the most important part about falling off the wagon, is being able to dust yourself off, accept what happened, learn from it, and hop right back on that damn wagon!

It would be far too easy to let that initial slip lead to a full on free fall down a booze-ridden cliff. I think that's why it's so important to not treat relapses as total weakness and failure. Sure, some amount of disappointment and frustration is understandable. But I feel like, the more we beat ourselves up about it, the lower we feel and thus, the more vulnerable we are to continuing negative thought patterns (drinking included) and feeding the downward spiral. 

I guess my point is, to those of you that have slipped up recently (last night or otherwise), please make sure that you give yourself the level of forgiveness and acceptance you deserve. Use the slip as an opportunity to learn. Use it as fuel to BE BETTER. Take notes. Journal. Whatever you need to do to process everything and take valuable information away from the experience. It's more than worth it. I promise. I'm doing my best to do the same, and I already feel it making a difference. 

Maybe that's what sets this time apart from the previous ones. Perhaps it also has to do with having a greater level of consciousness and wisdom regarding the alcoholic hiding within my brain. There's no point in dwelling upon failed attempts in the past. I've learned a lot from them and it's my greatest hope that I'll be able to use that knowledge to make it stick this time around. Happy New Year everyone. Much love to you and yours. I raise my mug of black coffee in hopes of a life-changing 2020, shared with you all! IWNDWYT.",12

Having a clear head again was the best decision I ever made, and knowing you're all on this journey with me is so important to me maintaining that decision. So thank you all.

Spent a quiet day today relaxing and cooking a stupid amount of food to celebrate. I'm doing [Veganuary](https://uk.veganuary.com) and so I've been learning various plant-based recipes - currently about to burst after a heroic amount of vegan lasagne and buffalo cauliflower.

And what a year it was...,"Over ten years of very hard drinking had taken its toll on me physically and mentally. On New Years Eve 2018, my wife set her phone down next to me. I had no idea that she'd done so. The next day, I listened to half an hour of myself being completely belligerent. I need to change. I needed help.

2019 may have the been hardest of my 40 years on this planet. I was diagnosed with Stage 1 breast cancer in July. Two and a half weeks later, I had a mastectomy. Only once during all of the doctor appointments, tests, surgery, and bills, did I have a serious hankering for a drink. 

As a man, breast cancer is rare. Roughly 3000 men are diagnosed in the US each year. There's very little support for men in terms of community and medical studies. As lonely as I was, without my wife and sobriety, there's no way possible that I'd have the positivity required to get through breast cancer. Sobriety saved me from the black dog. He almost got inside, though.

My wife and I bought our dream home two houses down from my best friend. Our careers are going well. I feel whole and good. I've lost 80 lbs. and will continue to fight daily for myself and the others that I care about. The physical and mental benefits of sobriety are real. It may have saved my life this past summer.

I'm extremely intimidated about the idea of not drinking - I won't lie - but I'm also intrigued by it. I want to live life, not be paranoid about my health CONSTANTLY (seriously, it's annoying how much I wonder how my liver is fairing) and enjoy everything. I was going to do a dry January starting after a trip with girlfriends this weekend, but I think I'm going to start now.

I have a doctor's appointment in 2 weeks and I'm just hoping everything looks normal. If not, I suppose this is more reason to stay away from alcohol.

When you stop drinking you need to find things that you enjoy and love and make them your passion. For me it was writing music, playing sports, being more creative, strengthening my relationships. You will be astounded at your own creative output potential. All these things are more worthwhile in my opinion! 

2) If something isn't fun, drinking won't make it fun:
It will just dull your senses. If you don't like something... Or someone - leave!

3) You can still have fun:
You can go the party, or bar or wedding or your own birthday or the concert, or the sports match, and still laugh with your friends and enjoy the occasion. You will just appreciate the occasion more for what it is, and remember it. You may still be the last to leave, but that means it was worth it. You'd be surprised how rare that is, compared to how many times you do it. 

4) Social pressure dwindles over time:
Those that give you a hard time most likely have a problem themselves. Those that give you support and respect are people you want to keep around you.

5) You will get less excited about stuff:
I lost the burning adrenaline rush of Friday night, or that build up to a great party, or that crazy festival. But the trade off of dramatic highs is no dramatic lows. You get stability, you lose anxiety, you are more present about your needs and your moods. You get excited about different stuff, the day time, band practice, pizza, intellectual stimulation, tea. 

6) You become nicer and kinder:
Enough said

I have to read that a couple of times just to believe it.  There was a time in my life where I believed that the only way I would ever accomplish a dry streak of any significance would be if I was dead.  Seriously.

When I post that sentence, it's not bragging.  Bragging is something you do when you achieve an impressive feat that you enjoyed doing.  I didn't enjoy most of 2019.  In fact, a lot of it sucked pretty bad.  There was anxiety, panic, depression, self-loathing, and unhappiness.  Most of the people who were ""friends"" stayed at arms length, on social media, cautiously telling me how proud they were of me.  But none of them came around.  None of them wanted to be associated with a recovering alcoholic.

2019 didn't feel like an achievement.  It felt like a fight.  A struggle.

Why am I typing this?  To bum you out?

Surprisingly, no.  I'm posting this so that you now have proof that it's possible.

I am living proof that if you fight, struggle, and desire nothing more than to become your own person with your own thoughts and your own desires that are not subject to the whims of an alcoholic brain, that it is completely possible.

It is not easy.  It is possible.  Possibility is hope, and hope is recovery fuel.

My single greatest tool in all of this has been to talk with other alcoholics.  Here, and other places.  This place is a bastion of hope.  It's a gleaming lighthouse off in the distance, and if you are sailing your ship through a fog of alcoholism and uncertainty, steer toward this light.  It's warm here.  It's welcoming.  Use the IRC Chat.  It probably saved my life.  I can't say enough good about what it means to me to have the Chat as a tool, and all the amazing people I've met because of it.  

Maybe it can help you too.  

You can literally carry dozens of supportive voices around in your pocket.  How amazing is that?

Whether you just came off a regretful New Year's eve, or if you've been planning to quit today for a while, then welcome.  I've got your back.  There are thousands of people here that have your back.  You can do this, and you're not alone.  I am living proof of what you can accomplish when you realize you're not alone anymore.

I'm new, and I wanted to share my journey to admitting I have a problem.

I'd managed to keep my problem drinking under the radar for a long time in part because I live on a different continent to my family. Last night after everyone went to bed I found myself alone with a bottle of my brother's gin, on top of all the wine I'd already consumed with them. I don't remember what happened after that but my brother says that I pissed myself and passed out, and was ""disgusting homeless person drunk"". I had absolutely no recollection. I was embarrassed, deeply ashamed, guilty, needed a drink so it would go away. Achingly familiar feelings, it seems, to the majority of people on this sub.

 When I got up my mother and two brother's had assembled and told me I was sick. I have the exact disease that my eldest brother, several years sober, had been to rehab for at age 21. But where his disease took hold quickly and severely, mine unfolded over a longer and slower time period. I knew this day would come. I just did not expect it to come on 1 January, 2020. 

I am 28, female, successful, intelligent, popular and kind- people like me just aren't addicts, was what I had thought. This doubtlessly bought me some time. Some suspicions were definitely floating around me - people have most likely also whispered things to each other- but no one had yet made the connection so direct: That Dr\_stop is an alcoholic. Even putting it down in writing like this feels jarring to me. But as I sat there hugged by my crying brother and my mom, I realised it was the truth and that I needed to hear this simple fact directly from the mouth of someone else. It made it real for me. It helped.

The narrative of what would happen, was always going to be that at some point in the distant future I would realise that I needed to get better. It would suck, but it was always going to be future Me's problem, not of any immediate concern to present me. Its arrival today was unexpected. But with it, came something I did not predict in the narrative of future Me getting better: hope, and a different vision of my life. When my alcoholism was my dirty little secret, I envisioned my life kind of drifting by, some memories sticking but most a lot of my life passing through the in a blur. Today, I saw that my future could be incredibly bright and enriched by my decision to take control of my agency, and restore ownership of my memories. I can grow old with dignity, indulge in hobbies, and make the most of my allocated time on this earth. I can start to trust my memories again. It must be nice to have that control. I envy it in non-alcoholics. I was today years old when I realised I can be like that too.  

Make no mistake, I recognise that this is my first step on a long and difficult path. Although this is a lonely path that no one else can walk for me, I am aided by some fantastic crutches and none of them come from a bottle. I have fantastic supportive partner who I know will be happy to join me in sobriety at parties without asking. My family did not drink any wine today when we went to a vineyard for a picnic. They stuck to Diet Coke and sparkling water. That meant a lot, symbolically, as the non-alcoholics of my family are pretty big on their wine (albeit with the annoyingly effortless moderation so desperately coveted by myself and presumably millions of other addicts).

I like this vision, but I always thought I would dread it. Today I will be one day sober, but I know that my life depends on many many more. Wish me luck, friends. It has been comforting to see so many people like me, and it feels good to join their journey. I am also an alcoholic and I cannot continue to drink. It took a long time to get to a point where I can say that.

* The first thirty days were kind of a weird frozen dream (that was why I was able to do dry january three times before doing a full year). I felt disassociated, numb, out of it.
* The first 100 days are torture, all the stuff that booze pushes down comes bubbling up and you gotta deal with it. I described it as ""rewiring my pleasure centers"" in the brain
* Community - even anonymous internet community - has been key. Reddit, [coach.me](https://coach.me), whatever you need.
* You might lose weight, you might not. I ate so much sugar to fill up the carb deficit of sobriety that I didn't really start losing weight until 7 months in. Then I lost twenty pounds.
* I took a lot of selfies even though I rarely post them to social media. Having a sense of what you looked like in the past made a difference.
* I journaled. I kept a food diary. I tracked workouts. Anything that felt like measurement was important to do.
* Changing a deeply seated habit / addiction takes time, and it takes mental space. I had to anticipate triggers (using the HALT strategy at first, then looking ahead on my calendar for weddings, birthdays, dinners with heavy drinking friends).
* Even though it takes time and mental space, you really can have a life while you quit drinking. I helped my mother through a surgery. I had intestinal parasites. I changed jobs (well, I got laid off and then changed jobs). I wrote a book. I got six-pack abs (they actually are great, in case you are wondering).
* I have cravings but they are more cerebral than visceral: the memory of the taste of bourbon or beer, rather than ""I HAVE TO DRINK RIGHT NOW OR I WILL DIE."" I am never so confident that I think that I will never drink again, but I rarely feel tempted in a way that is out of control.
* I didn't really have a therapist or an IRL counselor / support group. That was probably dumb. It would have made things easier.
* At the beginning of the year my identity was very tied up in my marriage, probably to a codependent extent. My husband is going through some difficult transitions now and I can help him but I don't feel ensnared by his problems the way I used to. Sobriety has been the main factor in that change in perspective.
* I don't have a ton of close friends to begin with; none of the ones I care to see really gave a shit that I stopped drinking.
* People \*will\* ask you about stopping drinking, especially as you click in to 3, 6, 9 months. Most of them won't say that the envy it ... but sometimes if you look closely you can see the respect and love of people you care about, even if it is left unsaid.
* One year on, I think relatively infrequently about the good times I had with alcohol. I remember how rude I was. I remember fighting with my husband. I remember being a dick to a famous poet. I remember waking up in my home, wondering how on earth I didn't crash the car or get a dui. That was also the night that I screwed up what was turning into a decent friendship with a person at work, I never repaired it. I remember balelful looks from people at the bar as I was sneaking snips of a drink of someone who left. I remember drinking straight from the bottle in the kitchen while my dinner guests waited for me to bring out food. It felt like small shit at the time but in retrospect it is what stuck in my memory.
* I did not suddenly find myself awash in money, although I know I saved a lot, I spent it on other dumb shit. A goal for this year is to at least understand how money moves through my wallet; I'm kind of a moron on that still.
* Other sober people may or may not be your best friends. People quit for different reasons, that you may or may not identify with. My mother and father in law don't drink, but this year has done nothing to change our relationship. That's ok.
* I'm still not totally honest with people - especially people I'm closest with - about why I quit. I vaguely mention health or anxiety. I have never said to anyone point blank ""it was pretty obvious I had a drinking problem and I decided to steer the ship before it ruined my life."" I might do that this year, I might not.
* Now that I've done the time, I do think about future life with alcohol. I tell myself ""there is no reason to make today the day I fall off the wagon - why should today of all days be the one I drink?"" it works a lot. On the other hand, I do imagine myself in the future, older, single -- it is easy to picture me going back. Luckily, the one-day-at-a-time strategy makes these thoughts pretty academic.

Well, that's all. I've been daydreaming about writing this post, well, all year :-) Thank you to everyone. If you are on the fence about stopping, let me tell you that it is the best decision I've made in the last decade, the best by a country mile. I wish you all health and happiness.",14

/r/stopdrinking gathers many new members during the New Year, and we want to welcome all of you.

Our motives, stories, social supports, stage of change and level of problematic drinking may be different, but a common thread echoes in our hearts and mind: something is off with our alcohol consumption.

Here on /r/stopdrinking, there is no one approach. We adhere to a few simple and important guidelines. [They can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index)

Be kind. There is a real life person behind each username, and that person has as rich of an existence as you do. So be kind. We read parts of each other's stories, and we never have the full picture of what is going on. Bullying, intimidating, pressuring, and giving tough love isn't appropriate here.

Speak from your experience. I believe that this guideline keeps /r/stopdrinking going. Keep in mind, this is not /r/advice, or /r/changemyview. This is a place where we share what worked or didn't work for us, and let other people make their decisions. People are experts on themselves, and we do not know what is best for someone we just met on the internet.

Another big piece: During this time of year, people often decide to stop drinking completely. Please know that this can be dangerous! We are not medical experts, and cannot tell you what your symptoms may be like. Please do not ask for medical advice here, we are woefully unqualified!

**So, welcome. Whatever reason you're here, however you found us, how long you decide to stay, whatever your goals are: Welcome. You're among friends now.**

I’ve come to the realization that every time I drink, I end up getting into an argument. Strangers, my boyfriend, my friends, my family. It does not matter. I feel very low and am questioning why anyone would want me around. 


The last few weekends my boyfriend and I have fought while I was drunk. He drinks, but has a much easier time handling himself. Last night, New Years Eve, we ended up fighting. He asked for a couple of days without hanging out or talking because he wants me to decompress and think about things. I mentioned not wanting to drink anymore. He agreed it was a good idea. I love him. My drinking is getting in the way of that though. 


I’m not sure what I’m even looking for by posting this really. I feel alone and I know there are people in my life I could talk to, but I’m embarrassed. I feel so ashamed because this is not who I am. In my deepest heart or hearts I feel like giving up alcohol is the only way to show who my true self. 


This is going to be probably the most difficult thing I do because almost everyone I know drinks. My family has some of the biggest alcoholics I’ve ever met. I’m so scared of what not drinking will do to our relationships but at the same time I know that giving up alcohol is the best way for maintain a worthwhile one too. I want to keep the relationship with my partner but I know he won’t tolerate my problem much longer. He’s at his breaking point and I can’t keep going this. I want to control my life again.",8
2020-01-01 11:32:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eik6so/four_years/,Four Years,"Hi everyone. On this day four years ago, I woke up in the morning at my parents’ house and grabbed some logs outside the back door to put on the fire. I remember loading the stove with firewood, and it all felt more significant than I could understand, a symbolic act of sorts: kindling the fire for the years of healing and life that lay ahead. My resolve was strengthened by the months leading up to that moment: Deep down I knew I could no longer control my drinking and I didn’t want to fight that realization anymore. I had tried to stop several times before, but sobriety never stuck. I would string together a few days, sometimes a week or two (one time four months!) but I would always go back to drinking, and it always got worse.

But that New Year’s Day, January 1st, 2016, was different. I was ready for a new life, and I knew it was buried inside of me, beckoning me, urging me to acknowledge it and nurture it and bring it to light. A voice within was calling out to the part of me that had lost control in the storm of drinking.

By the grace of God, I walked back outside that morning, collected some more firewood, then dragged one of our Adirondack chairs onto the snow-covered lawn and sat there the winter sun, eyes closed, ready and willing, praying for a change that would stick. I remember sitting there for some time, easing into what would soon become the most transformative year of my life. 

For those of you who are feeling out of sorts today, or are hungover, or are trying to string together your first week or month of sobriety, or are just logging on to this sub for the first time and claiming today as your Day One: I see you. I was right there not too long ago, and I just kept coming back. We’re all here to support each other and share our stories and successes and failures. And if today is your Day One, I commend you for being here and for honoring that voice inside you, that voice of deep knowing. My Day One, four years ago today, was special and monumental and my most important Day One, because it was the day I took full control of my life again. 

Everything I have now is possible because I quit drinking. I am so thankful for all that has filled [the space that alcohol used to fill.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/5lhql7/my_thoughts_on_one_year_sober/?ref=share&ref_source=link) I feel more alive than ever.

It sucks not being able to drink, can’t lie. But I have little to gain and lots to lose from drinking, and that’s my motivation not to. I’ve already scared my mom shitless, endangered myself and others numerous times, wasted hella money, lost someone I really fucking love, ignored my responsibilities, forgotten significant moments, and had the least productive year of my life. This is the first time since 11th grade that I’ve felt like I’ve had my shit together (not that I was drinking then). AA isn’t only about changing your drinking habits, but your lifestyle too. I hate that so many things had to happen for me to get myself together, and some stuff I don’t know if I can ever forgive myself for, but at the very least I can be glad I’m doing it now. I don’t “believe” in New Year resolutions, but I just want 2020 to be better than 2019, and that’s dependent upon me and the decisions I make.

A while back I did 23 days sober. I got through Christmas and New Years without drinking and now I look forward to getting through my birthday without drinking. 

I have to be honest though, it is pretty hard. I think about wanting to drink when I play video games with friends. I haven’t played anything since I stopped drinking and it because I’m so used to drinking and playing.  I’m also thinking about how I won’t be able to enjoy a beer with friends and family. Now, maybe in a few years I might learn some discipline and be able to control it, but sobriety is too important to me right now. 

There are huge benefits though. For starters, I’ve been going to the gym almost every day with a bodybuilding routine that I’ve stuck with. I might even see some of you in there today after work. Another benefit is that I will be able to better focus on school and a coding boot camp I’ve enrolled in. I would not be doing these things if I was still drinking. If I hadn’t stopped 21 days ago, I’d be hungover as hell right now and making shallow New Years promises to myself that I wouldn’t be able to keep. 

So to those of you that have good chunks of sober time under your belt, I respect your adherence to it. And to those of you starting today, I respect your initiative to begin to make things right.

I was chronically relapsing, questioning if I really had a problem, all while I was throwing up everyday, shaking, and always desperate to drink alone. Alot of things were going wrong, my hair was falling out, my skin was yellowy-gray, doctors told me my liver wouldn't make it past 30. But I continued to drink for another year till I found this place. I still stumbled, but I had a new fire lit under my ass. Here are all these people with the same problem, and they can do it, why can't I? 

I'm not on here as much as I used to be. But it's very important to me to keep coming back. Especially in my first year, I would easily spend hours a day everyday here. There is absolutely no way I could have done this all by myself. Coming here gave me strength when I had none. Learning that feelings are okay and temporary made a big difference. 

Basically I am trying to say, I love every single one of you. My life is fuller and happier, and I really owe it to this sub here. When you're struggling, and you have people cheering you on to just make it one more day, it makes a world of difference. 

If it is your day one, or you are struggling, you can make it. Life is wonderful, you only need to open your eyes to see it. 

I will not drink with you today, again my friends. 😊

Instructions for Life:
   1.  Take into account that great love and great achievements involve great risk
   2.  When you lose, don't lose the lesson
   3.  Follow the three R's:
        Respect for self,
        Respect for others
        Responsibility for all your actions
 4.  Remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck
   5.  Learn the rules so you know how to break them properly
   6.  Don't let a little dispute injure a great relationship
7. When you realize you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it
8. Spend some time alone every day
9. Open your arms to change, but don't let go of your values
10. Remember that silence is sometimes the best answer
11. Live a good, honorable life. Then when you get older and think back, you'll be able to enjoy it a second time
12. A loving atmosphere in your home is the foundation for your life
13. In disagreements with loved ones, deal only with the current situation and don't bring up the past
14. Share your knowledge. It is a way to achieve immorality
15. Be gentle with the earth
16. Once a year, go someplace you've never been before
17 Remember that the best relationship is one in which your love for each other exceeds your need for each other
18. Judge your success by what you had to give up in order to get it
19. Approach love and cooking with reckless abandon

20.  Check in daily with all your peeps here in this Sub. 😁",7

I gave myself a sticker ever day I didn't drink.  It felt nice every night to put that shiny pink reward up, and it was a nice way to share my successes with my  3 years sober husband.  

Last night, when I replaced it with my new 2020 calendar, I had an urge to flip through it, but felt like I would be disappointed by all the days without a sticker.  I made myself do it anyway, and I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw.  I HAD A LOT OF STICKERS!  Like, a whole lot of them!  I had *days and weeks and months* strung together where I had absolutely zero alcohol!  Then there were days and weeks here or there that interrupted my string of flowery pink goodness, but there were far more good days than bad days.  

If I hadn't put up those silly stickers I would have considered last year a failure.  Instead, I am very proud of myself, I did some hard work!  I had hundreds of victories!  I'm doing ok!  I didn't have a perfect year, but I sure learned a lot and those are things I can build on to have an even better year.  Being here with all of you on SD has been so eye opening and you all have given me so much to take forward, I cannot thank you enough.  Every single share, whether good or bad is thing to ponder and learn from and every laugh or tear we share is an incredible bond that I can't even imagine living without right now.

Unfortunately I had a slip up a few days later and broke that promise, but a few weeks later in late Jan 2018 I stopped drinking and haven’t had a drink since.

This New Years Eve I made mocktails (soda water, cranberry juice, lime, fresh mint and a hint of cayenne pepper) for myself and some friends, saw midnight in sober and happy. Then got up in the morning and did a 5k Park run.

She came into my room to tell me she had been sick, and I popped right out of bed ready to tackle this mess. I used to get drunk every night after she went to sleep. So in the past, this would have been a very rough situation. I’d be tough to wake up, then groggy, sick, and irritable. And while it’s still not the best part of being a parent, I am SO thankful to be sober, present, and attentive to her needs right now. Like a Mom. Handling Mom things. With love and a pair of rubber gloves. 

I’d love to hear some sober parenting wins if you’ve got ‘em!

Like me 4 years ago, you've probably just overdone Christmas by soaking it in booze. 

I knew I needed a rest from it. 30 days should have done the trick, so I committed to that initially. Reading the accounts of others here helped me realise that moderation is an impossible dream for me.

I hit four years tomorrow and during the first year I had many points where I could have easily caved becuase my mind told me that others would expect me to drink and there's no way I could miss out. 

The truth is I could miss out and as time moved on I began to realise that I wasn't missing out at all. In fact those who regularly drink heavily are the ones missing out.

So if you have doubts about whether you can do sobriety, put those doubts to one side because if I can do it, you can too.

2020-01-01 04:49:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eigpuu/thank_you_to_this_group/,Thank you to this group!,"First time poster, 2 year lurker. Made it a year of being sober! Honestly, pretty darn cool and proud of myself. Tried for a few months in 2018, loved the health benefits of being sober, but caved to the pressures of others and my very own inability to be disciplined. It was not meant to be then..

Gradually, I really missed the feeling of being sober and most importantly, PRESENT with my kids and wife. To be honest, I was jealous of the people and stories I had read on here..how people had reclaimed their lives by demonstrating incredible will power and discipline! What a platform this is! Truly, it has saved me a number of times - bringing me back to reality.

Growing up, I did not come from a dysfunctional environment, actually, the complete opposite. I have two loving parents who gave everything and more to all of their kids (and still do). My drinking was more a by product of the environment I was in from the age of 16-31. 

Being a former athlete, I gradually became more and more immersed in alcohol (bonding w mates, downtime, etc.), and found it difficult to just enjoy A beer. It had too be many and until all hours of the night or morning. I abused the priviledge of drinking alcohol. As it grew, I realized it was not sustainable and definitely was not fair to my family. To make matters worse, I would consider myself high on the old anxiety meter, so of course alcohol would take that chip off my shoulder and I could let loose from my alter ego :) However, in time (mostly while being sober), I have learned to manage and improve this area by educating myself via books, embracing who I am, etc.

So, as I leap into 2020, I just want to firstly say to this group, THANK YOU!!! Truly, this group is amazing. Don't stop posting, you just never know how your story, comments, feedback may impact others. It certainly has helped me get through the past 365 days.

Secondly, to those striving to be the best version of themselves and who aim to be sober, I know there are many obstacles out there and many different situations that people are in, but truly take it a day at a time, reach out to a mentor or confidant, utilize platforms such as this to help in your decision making, but most importantly don't give up (fail, get back at it), you have it in you to do/be better, give yourself a chance, you won't regret it!

Some random benefits I have experienced as well as thoughts from the past 365 days..

1. PRESENT time w my kids and wife, best thing I could've done :)
2. Almost immediately felt the health benefits (I really must have been drinking lots ha) - skin was clearer, regular bowel movements
3. No more wasted days and being hung over!!! Life is too short, time is our most precious gift
4. $ saved to go into savings, personal development or treat yourself/others
5. Be myself and not someone I was not. Realized people like me just as much when I am sober - I respect myself more and more as well
6. Make decisions for myself and not for the opinions/beliefs of others (i.e. ""you need to be able to let loose in this profession"", BS). When someone has an issue w your drinking situation, it's really, a. they wish they had the balls and ability to put their pride aside b. they are just uncomfortable w themselves c. not worth your time pondering..move on!
7. You will be respected more by others and may even be an inspiration to someone abusing alcohol, drugs, not living their best life
8. Designated driver, I am proud and kind of find it fun being given the opportunity to get people home safely
9. My gawd, it is comical seeing people in their drinking state and how foolish they can be when under the influence
10. I have found the more I go being sober, my desire to drink has been drastically dropping
11. I do have non-alcoholic beers occasionally. Best ones I've found are the Budweiser Prohibition BOTTLES and Heineken 0.0
12. I recommend the 'Easy Quit Drinking' app for Android users, cool features, especially health benefits as you go along and $ saved
13. There are people of all walks of life in the same boat..use them for inspiration! To name a few..Robert Downing Jr, Brett Favre, Christiano Ronaldo, Eminem..
14. More time given back to focus on hobbies, interests, bettering yourself
15. I want to remember reading books to my kids, playing sports w them, teaching them this and that, rather than, remember that night I got piled - ah ya, let's not, create real, quality memories you can actually remember
16. Lost 20 lbs., could increase this more if I was more disciplined (2020 NY Reso focus)
17. The high/excitement can be replaced..for me it's my family!
18. Am more aware of how beautiful life is, little things that went unnoticed before don't go anymore..the sound of a stream, the sun rising..
19. More and more comfortable in social settings where I know alcohol will be consumed. I find..I'm still laughing and having fun! There are plenty of non-alcoholic drinking options now a days. I can choose to slip out early or stay late. No regrets the next day and I won't look like a moron!
20. Holy shit, if I'm capable of this, what else can I accomplish?!

Lastly, something to think about..when your time comes, will you be looking back on all the toys you owned? Houses lived in? All the days/$ spent on booze? Time wasted under the influence? Nope, I'll bet not. I bet itll be family, friends, experiences, good deeds done, etc. Live the good life - all the best in 2020!!! Thanks for reading 🙌✌",9
2020-01-01 04:48:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eigpn8/question_about_newly_sober_relationships_with_old/,Question about newly sober relationships with old friends.,"I’ve been sober now since December 10, I have been struggling for months with my drinking. Getting better then slowly slipping back till I have a blackout outburst. I have really strained my relationship with my roommate, we use to be best friends and now we barely speak. I’ve tried apologizing and explaining the only way to really apologize is to stay sober. He’s rightfully angry, but seems very pessimistic whenever he responds to me.

After my last blackout he said he doesn’t want me at the apartment, he can’t stand being around me and that I should warn him if I plan on stopping by. The apartment is mostly furnished by me, and the last time I stopped by while he was out he had it obviously set up for a party which he denied and then got him very angry. 

NYE has been very tough in regards to triggers and I have such bad anxiety and FOMO. All I see are snapchats and instagrams of my friends out having fun, and I feel so ashamed that I have to lock myself away at my parents place just to get through it. 

Something that particularly triggered me was seeing a friends post of my friends and my roommate, in which he is wearing my clothes. I don’t mind lending friends clothes but in this situation it seems almost violating that he’s going through my clothes for his own use when he doesn’t even want to look at me or have me be in our apartment.

I want so badly to start the new year off right and a big part of that is living in my own apartment and fixing the damage I have done with my roommate. I fear that trying to bring this up to him will boil over into an argument. If anyone of you have had similar experiences or advice I’d really appreciate it. I honestly don’t know what to do, being so newly sober I don’t want such added stress. I just want my old life and friend back. 

TL:DR My roommate and best friend doesn’t want me staying at the apartment anymore and can’t look at me, yet is using my belongings.",2

But last night I gave in to peer pressure and stumbled.

My body is punishing me, and far worse, my mind is too. I am ashamed and feel disgusted with myself. I made a fool of myself, said inappropriate things, sent drunk messages to people, embarrassed myself in front of my partner, family and friends.

I don't feel a shred of hope right now, but I have to believe that it is there. I have to believe that there is hope that one day, I will stop being this way.

For now, it's back to the beginning. Day 1 again.

Not a drop of booze anywhere under my roof, unlike the many many lonely, drunken New Year Eve's of my past, and honestly it felt great to be just so genuinely happy and spending time with my kid!

Little dude made it to midnight, and was extra happy to watch all the fireworks going off around the neighborhood. Even waved hi to the police officers patrolling; felt good not to tense up or anything seeing cops for once, I was probably the only sober adult they saw all night...

I'm so grateful to finally honestly say I haven't drank since last year, and I'm going to do everything I possibly can to make it to the end of 2020 sober as well. This sober New Year's Eve spent with my boy and my dog was great, definitely want to make that happen again 😁

What was supposed to be a couple of predrinks at a friend's and then a quiet New Year's with my boyfriend turned into me being blackout drunk before midnight and being driven home by a complete stranger.
I got my phone and boyfriend back, but it still took me until the end of June to get to the end of my line and finally get help.
My 2019 was the shittiest start ever, but the year ended in the best way. The second half of the year I sobered up, stopped smoking, got a dog and finally lost that weight I kept complaining about.
So if you woke up this morning thinking you can't do this anymore, there is hope! You can turn your life around, you just might need a little help to kickstart things of. Please don't be afraid to ask for it. 
2020 so far is off to a beautiful start and I'm hoping this year the roles aren't reversed. It's always what you make of it, so I'm gonna make sure the start of this new decade is going to be amazing.

The results of that reflection: I’m lonely. I very rarely hang out with people my age outside of work. I spent the vast majority of my time alone. I never really experienced that “pink cloud”. I haven’t lost weight (matter of fact I’ve gained like 15 pounds but I started going to the gym about 6 weeks ago to erase those pounds) My sleep schedule is still shit. I haven’t even been on a date. But you know what? Even though it’s still there, my anxiety is significantly less. Way less days wasted from hangovers. I’ve remembered every waking moment of 2019. I haven’t gotten myself into any scary situations while wasted. I’ve saved a ton of money. I learned a new skill and started a new career path. I got my first pet of my own. I’ve survived nights out and weddings sober. The mental clarity is absolutely unreal. I’m getting to know who I really am. So yeah, I guess what I’m getting at is, sobriety doesn’t magically fix all of your problems. It takes deep and honest reflections to realize all the reasons you drank. The clarity of sobriety makes it a hell of a lot easier to pinpoint them. This year I’m planning on starting therapy again for my anxiety and self-confidence issues.

Tonight my family was invited to go to a party where all of the adults were drinking. I did not partake and managed to make it through the night. I just made it home and wanted to post for others who may just be starting their journey.

You can do it.

I dont know where my struggle will lead or if I'll stumble on the way but I made it today and I'm happy about that.

Happy new years everyone and may the next year bring you joy.

Original Post:
Tonight I came home drunk. I didn't drive, I had an uber deliver me to my home. I even had a very intriguing conversation.

I'm a drunk, I've been a functional alcoholic since I was in the military. Some of the stuff you see and do makes you numb, it also makes you want to drink. I used to get wasted every weekend. Now I get wasted whenever I want to.

I dont want this anymore, I want to feel normal. I want to be ok, but my life is fucked up right now.

Tonight I came home and acted like everything was fine. My wife wants to go out for new years, but some days I just dont even want to see her.

Tomorrow will be my first real attempt at sobriety. I don't even remember what it feels like to not have alcohol in my system. But...

Tonight I went up to the fridge to refill my wine glass and found my son's drawing, it says I <3 you dad, it was laying on the floor in front of the refrigerator. I just stared at it, for a long time.

I can't recall the last time I went a week without drinking, much less a month.

No matter the circumstance he doesn't deserve this, he deserves a father who can deal with life. He deserves a father who can explain how to beat his demons. He deserves something better than what I am today.

I don't know what tomorrow brings but it has to be better than this.

I want to stop and this is my last individual attempt to do so.

My next step is treatment, if I have to go that route I will but I need to make a final attempt on my own first.

I applaud all of you who have quit and hope one day I can be free as well.",5

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hi Sobernauts!

How was your night?

My night was tougher than I expected it to be, even though I had prepared for it. We had dinner with my sister-in-law’s family and some of their old friends whom I had only met briefly once before. The topic of my not drinking came up over the dinner table and suddenly the spotlight was on me.

My family knew my history and reasons for choosing sobriety but these people didn’t, and I wasn’t prepared to be questioned. They’re Swedish. Their questioning was streamlined, direct and no-nonsense, but also kind and genuinely interested to hear my full story. I squirmed around it for a little, trying to worm my way out of it, and finally the husband cut through the bullshit said “so, you drank your quota. What was your quota? Did a glass became a bottle?” I nodded, and felt…ashamed. A bit broken. I felt the heaviness of their curiosity, and the weight of attention on me. 

My drinking used to start around 4pm and went through to about 8.30pm. I was drinking about a bottle of wine - creeping up to about bottle and a half when I quit – a night. I felt them wondering, and wanted to justify, defend, explain. I didn’t. I let them wonder. 

I could have excused myself and escaped to my bedroom for an early night, but that would have looked weird, and I would have felt strange about it. I would have woken this morning feeling awkward, and I didn’t want to start the year like that. I just let the discomfort be there. 

My darling brother-in-law gave me a tilt of his eyebrow when he was pouring the champagne just before midnight, and when I shook my head he whispered “would you like something else to toast with?” 

I clunked my chunky mug of sleepy-time tea with their delicate flutes of champagne, and made it all the way to the end. 

Throughout the evening I wasn’t at all tempted to drink. It didn’t even cross my mind. But dealing with my uncomfortable feelings was a challenge. Social anxiety, self-consciousness, shyness and a dose of unhealthy shame. I felt small and unworthy. 

Among us we will have experienced the full spectrum of possibilities. Some of us will be returning here for another day one, feeling hopeless or hopeful. That was me last year. Others will be rejoicing to have made it through.  

Personally, I feel grateful to be sober but a bit flat and vulnerable. 

If you’re here for day one, we welcome you with open arms. Thank you for being here and completing our community. 

Old-timers, thank you, thank you, thank you for your wisdom, for asking the hard questions of us, for pushing us and loving us onward.

I am so proud of us. Look at what we’re doing here! Even though it’s hard, even though we feel shitty sometimes, even though others don’t understand, here we are. Here for ourselves and here for each other.

Happy New Year, my friends.

I will not drink with you today!

Love,
