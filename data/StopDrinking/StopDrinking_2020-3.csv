Early in the morning I started having thoughts of how I could start drinking at any time. No one would know and I still have time to procrastinate on my work. 

I enjoy morning productivity so I started studying instead, made food, tanned outside, and watched YouTube videos. Halfway through the day I started to feel restlessness kicking in. The last half of the day is always the hardest for me. Then I realized what I wanted to do more than drink was to go for a run after the sun went down. It was just a slightly uncomfortable waiting game of filling up my time until then. 

I didn’t get upset at myself or overwhelmed for having thoughts and feelings I didn’t like. I acknowledged them and moved on. 

I studied some more and watched stranger things then went for my run. I came back and walked my cat around the neighborhood in the stroller. Made food, watched more stranger things, and now I’m about to read a little in bed before going to sleep. 

Glad I worked through the problems instead of giving in to them.

Which would be 18 Days Before my 25th Birthday. Now I am ready to kick booze out.

Also I discontinued All tobacco usage in Nov of 2018 (16+ months now). 

I turn 25 on Monday July 27, 2020.

If I went 4 weeks easy in 2018, 5 weeks easy in 2019 and 6 weeks easy earlier this year then I should have no problem being able to stop until that min date speaking in short-term terms, in long-term terms I would not like to drink again.

Wasn't drinking awesome when we were all like 16/17 years old? Maybe even 18/19.

2020-03-30 23:02:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fs55r4/another_90_dayer_baby_how_i_did_it/,"Another 90 Dayer, Baby!! How I Did It","I saw a post earlier from a person who was celebrating 90 days. I looked on the calendar & realized it almost slipped by me!

Wow!! For a person who could barely get to 30 days (tried at least a dozen times), it feels so surreal to be at this point. 

I did this with my husband. He didn’t really have a drinking problem; he would just go with the flow & drink when I did. He, too, is celebrating with me today. 

How it progressed & how I did it:

Weeks 1-2: How many times have we all been here? I lost count. The difference this time is that I threw myself into doing so many things, I didn’t give myself a chance to think about it. I worked extra hard, did extra assignments, did side hustles, etc. I basically became a robot because I didn’t want to think. I knew from the past, if I started thinking too much it would lead to drinking. I didn’t look at this sub either because that would get me thinking.

Guess what? It worked! It was so much easier than the other times.

Week 3: I kept going but started feeling down. Of course, feeling down made me think more. This time I took care of myself. I knew my feelings were probably my brain starting to reset so I let myself be down & if I felt like it, ate 3 bowls of ice cream or went to bed early. 

Week 4: The sad feeling started to lift (a little). I still refused to think about drinking. If I did I would distract myself. I have been a runner for almost 2 years so that was a great distraction along with work.

I knew 30 days was coming up & I never managed to make it past that time frame so I was nervous too. 

I also noticed my skin starting to look good & my face was less puffy.

Weeks 5-6: I still tried to pre-occupy myself as much as time went on as I moved away from that date. I started letting myself think about drinking more - with caution. I even started lurking around on this sub again. I didn’t think about drinking that much. If I did I would be stressed out & would think that it would be great to have a drink. It only happened a couple of times. Distracting myself seemed to be key. 

A weird thing started happening. One big issue I had with drinking is not being able to remember anything - recent things and things from years ago. During this time I had these weird blips where I would be doing something mundane & would remember something that happened when I was younger that I completely forgot about! It was very cool & a little weird.

Weeks 7-8: Pretty much the same as the previous 2 weeks.

Weeks 9-12: My mind started to clear even more. It is a very SLOW process. I still feel a brain fog today but I feel it ever so slightly lifting and you have no idea how motivating that is. 

I am slowly feeling more equipped to handle stressful situations. Sometimes it is frustrating how slow the improvements are. Then I remember that my poor brain and other body parts are furiously repairing damage that I’ve done & I feel thankful. It might be slow, but it’s happening. 

This is also the time the virus hit. I have to tell you that quarantine & being bored were heavy triggers. But since my mind is a little bit clearer, I am more aware of my power & strength to squelch that annoying little addiction demon when it rears its ugly head & starts trying to persuade me. 

My husband also helps because he’s like “Man, it’s nice to go into this crazy time with a clear head & no hangovers!” He is really the best.

My skin looks the best it’s looked in a long time! 

People always ask about weight - haven’t lost any! Maybe it’s all those ice cream bowls I allow myself to have. That’s cool though - I’ll take a few pounds over hangovers and regret any day. 

Congrats to all of you at 90 Days, more than 90 days & less than 90 days! Keep fighting the good fight!",27,"{'virus': 1, 'quarantine': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9977433681488037}"

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. 

**For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!**

This pledge is a statement of intent. Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

We must put in place training & habits now to replace ignorance & ill discipline. Only then can we begin to act differently. Only then will we stop seeking the impossible, the short-sighted & the unnecessary.

Hope you are safe and well. Last week I jumped back on the wagon after several false starts. So I am a few days shy of two weeks sober at the moment. Today I got hit HARD by cravings.

We are stuck at home anyway, and my partner seems to handle drinking just fine. I probably can too."" 

And you know what? If I asked him, or most people in my life, they would probably agree. Just drink a little, it won't kill you. You don't drink THAT much, you're fine, it's all in your head. You are just being dramatic. 

I have given into those (real and perceived) responses time and time again. I have internalized them... but not today! I acknowledged that my cravings were really bad. I didn't talk about it. I didn't focus on it. I did other things, puttered around, exercised, cooked and ate a nice dinner.

It’s still hard for me to be proud of myself for anything because I still hate myself for everything I’ve done in the past and it’s hard for me to move on but to be completely honest I never thought I’d make it this far. My alcohol consumption got so bad that I was actively trying to kill myself with it pretty much. But damn when I saw that 1000 days I did feel a little proud. 


Stay safe during the quarantine friends and I will not drink with you today! Or ever!


Edit: geeeez the amount of support on here is wild and is what has helped keep me sober. Forreal I don’t know any of you but I feel like you are all my friends cause I don’t really have friends in life but everyone here is on the same page that I am and going through the same shit. Seriously, you people rule. If anyone ever wants a chat or anyone starting out sobriety and is having a bad time shoot me a message! I’m not a wise old man that knows everything there is to know... but I sure as hell have been through the shit and lost everything I cared about in life thanks to alcohol and have made it through to today.

Inside my head has been an echo chamber for weeks, with a whisper turning into a crescendo of booming words, six months without a drink, without Drinking, Drink, DRINKING, DRINK...

This lockdown hasn't helped. I've been stuck inside, only going out when I need to, for everything my entire family needs, once a day. Gaming isn't fun like it used to be, it's the same thing again and again, reading doesn't hold the joy it used to, and my only outlet is cleaning and weight training. 

But, I might not be very happy, but at least I'm sober with it. I can rationalise, understand my fruatration, do things I wouldn't normally. So tomorrow, I'm gonna hoover the one area of my house that's often neglected: the stairs. I'm gonna have a good workout, trial some new exercises and then maybe paint the bathroom. Have a sense of achievement. 

And then maybe, just maybe the echo chamber inside my head will grow quiet and still. I will be able to breathe again and enjoy what little of life we can right now.

Once I was far enough in, that year was getting closer and it gave me something to hold onto.

Fast forward to the current global situation - it's really been stressing me out - I've really wanted a drink.  But I still held out until my year was up a week or so ago.

Now, my wife is out of town - I convinced myself that I could have just one night off - nobody would ever know.  I could carry on with my sober life after my night off and just lie to people or creatively answer.  After all, I quit smoking when I was 22, but I still had my share of smokes since then - but that's what I hold onto because that's when I quit being a daily smoker.

My urges got the best of me - so while I was out, I grabbed a 6-pack of some good strong beer.  Driving home though, it ran through my head - if I let today go, what's to stop me from letting tomorrow go?  And the next day?  Could I really tell people I haven't touched a drop in over a year, or would the lying be too much for me?  And given how bad I HAD to have that beer, apparently going a year without it just wasn't enough, because these cravings are completely out of control.

So, I came home, left the beer in the car and drank a 0.0% Heineken.  The beer is still there.  Honestly, I think I'm going to hide it somewhere that only I know about because it gives me a little more control (I have a lot of alcohol in the house, but I suspect my wife would know if I touched any of it).

After rushing to get some clothes on, I opened the door to several policemen and EMTs doing a wellfare check. Confused, they tell me my friend, Emily (obviously not using real names), had come to check on me and  spent an hour knocking on my door before calling them. They, too, had been there a while banging on the door and were about to break in through a window.  This left me asking, ""How has it come to this?""

Since I started self-isolating two weeks ago (minus those trips to the store to buy more beer), my mental health, which hasn't been good for a long time, had been rapidly declining. As soon as I had put my work laptop away each day, I would quickly down several IPAs, then start drunk dialing friends and family and drinking the night away til I passed out.

Thursday night was when I finally had a complete breakdown. I don't remember much of that night, but I do remember deciding that I couldn't handle the loneliness anymore and that during the weekend I would be moving across the country to stay with partner, Ron. I know I called and/or texted Ron, my parents, friends, and even my boss to tell them. However, I don't remember any of the conversations I had. The only things I do remember are a neighbor coming outside to check that I was okay and drinking way more than I normally do.

My rash decision had people worried and Emily told me that Ron had been trying to get ahold of me all morning to check on me. When he wasn't able to, he called Emily and another close friend that lives a few hours away (Tanya) to say he was really worried and didn't know what to do.

Once police and EMS left, Emily and I went back into my apartment and the four of us had a conference call about how to proceed. They were all worried about me, as well as tired of dealing with my drunken antics over the past few years. They didn't trust me to remain alone and wanted me to finally get help for my depression and anxiety, and the amount of alcohol I had been using to self-medicate. It was decided that I would go stay with Tanya for a while since she would be able to keep an eye on me until we could make more long-term plans for my recovery.

I am a few days into sobriety now. I am so grateful for the support system I have and have good feelings that this will be the time I stop drinking that finally sticks and that I'll get the treatment I need for my mental health problems. They have been working to find ways of me getting help, which has been abnormally hard with the pandemic, and reaching out to other people, such as my boss and parents, to make them aware of the situation (well, as aware as they need to be). Tonight we are having another conference call between the four of us to discuss further plans and options. Although I have been dealing with daily panic attacks from the anxiety, I feel happiness knowing I have people who care so much about me.

The last time I quit, I had almost a year under my belt.  I was literally a couple weeks away from getting my ""Dino"" status.  Why did I go back to drinking?  I though I could control it.  I thought that with (almost) a year of sobriety under my belt I was the one in control.  I believed in the myth of moderation for myself.  Some people can and do moderately drink.  I am not one of those people.  It took a little while for me to start slipping up, I struggled hard against that slippery slope.  But here I am.  I've been drinking every day.  With the quarantine in place and working from home, I have started drinking earlier in the day.  I literally can not stop drinking once I start.

It took a really long time to get here but it doesn't consume my thoughts.  The narrative has changed.  The conversation in my brain used to be how am I going to be happy without drinking to now, why am I  unhappy today?  To me that feels like a big shift in my thought process.  I'm now addressing the reasons that I turned to alcohol in the first place.  When I ask myself those questions now, it's not laced with ""well you probably feel that way because you were medicating yourself for years"".  Now it's become me just dealing with myself and my feelings.  I starting to know the person I was suppose to be and what my mental capacity really is without alcohol stunting it's growth.

Take COVID-19 and the world being held captive.  When this went down, I lost several of my outlets that I was using to distract my brain from the grind of life.  I could go into the details of classes I was taking but those are just that, irrelevant details.  The issue was, life changed and I needed to change with it.  But the thing was, when this happened a few weeks ago, I found out I was actually ready.  The drunk version of me would've been pissed about everything and would've used this as an excuse or message that the universe wanted me to drink.  But now, I see it differently.  You can't control the world around you, you can only control how you perceive it.  How you feel about it, how you feel about yourself.  So I adjusted.  I started working out at home, starting playing the guitar more, got back to playing video games, actually started watching shows again and finding enjoyment from them. 

I think what I'm trying to say is, life is going to change whether you want it to or not.  We can't control our environments, or our own bodies for that matter but we do have control over our minds.  It's our strongest advocate to overcome adversity in this ever-changing playing field.  I think now my mind is only just starting to grow again.

I’m writing this while holding my two month old baby boy. It’s fun to have a second monthly lane marker to help keep track of time.

A little bit about me; 39 mother of one, full time worker (essential, though I don't think we are but I digress), high functioning alcoholic for about 5-6 years.   
My journey to alcoholic-status started when I got divorced about 8 years ago (12 year marriage) because buying beer was pretty cheap. When I finally got financially better, I started hitting up the whiskey and I'm so surprised how easy it is to get addicted and how incredibly embarrassing it is to admit it (to anyone, but especially to doctors, in my opinion).  


I don't like to say that I hit rock bottom but this past weekend I started drinking at 7am and went through about 3 bottles.   
Today I feel like absolute garbage with the shakes, the headache, the whole 9 yards of punishment for over doing it yet again.   
I recently started a medication that is supposed to help with the cravings but I'm still finding it very hard to drive past the liquor store on the way home or find a reason to go to the store to ""pick up something I forgot"".   
Luckily I have an amazing partner that is supportive (to a point) but I don't think that he understand how hard it is to put the bottle down.   


I've heard very good things about this sub/reddit, so much that I just joined today so that I can be a part of a community, which I hope will help since I am putting off seeing a therapist until the threat of this virus calms down.

Long time drinker and smoker here. It started at 13 and escalated from there. At my worst, I was drinking at work and finishing a 750ml bottle of whiskey in a day or two. I can't have it in the house or it is gone. I have no impulse control when it comes to this shit. I can drive past a liqueur store and it is a mental challenge to not pull in. I smell pot and my mouth fills with saliva.   


I have not had a drink since March 24th. I have not had a cigarette since March 24th and I have been weaning myself off pot with the help of my amazing wife. 

I just can't have this shit control my life. I make stupid decisions when I am drunk or high and they were ok when I was like, 19 and no ties, but I got this wonderful woman and the lifestyle I have dreamed of since I was a small kid. I can't lose this. I can't risk having children with my wife and then her leaving me because I care more about getting drunk that teaching my child to walk. 

I hit my lowest ever on March 24th and it was time. I burned the smokes (in the fire) and dumped the booze. I suffered bad anxiety and physical withdrawal for a few days but I am through the worst of it. I got me a counselor and we are starting to talk through some stuff from my past that I might be trying to numb with the chemicals. This is a long road, one I think I will have to walk and maintain my whole life, but when I think about a life drunk and stoned versus a life with my wife and our future children well, it is just no fucking competition.",21,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.99033522605896}"

A little bit of my situation,I originally quit drinking to quit smoking. While I stopped drinking to curb nicotine cravings, I realized my relationship with alcohol through the years hasn’t been the healthiest. I’m the type that can’t have one. My ex and I would normally have wine every night during dinner and I would usually finish the bottle and maybe a bit more. Alcohol we bought to have at home wouldn’t last long. There would be days where I wouldn’t drink but the days that I would could get out of hand. 

Anyways, my original goal was to stop drinking for 3 months. Along the way, it changed to 100 days. With a little more then 10 days to reach my goal, I’m really at a crossroads. My mind and heart are giving me mixed singles. On one hand, I want to see if this break changed my relationship with alcohol. I kind of want to see if I can actually have one and only drink socially. I really don’t want to have a hangover ever again. 

But on the other hand, I have felt really good without alcohol and booze(and smokes!). I have more time,feel great and have started working out. It’s just crazy to think that I may not drink ever again. Which is a good thing! 

I’ve been really excited to hit my goals and I’m really proud of myself. But also, there is a bit of doubt to what will happen next and what the next step should be.

What a long strange trip it has been! I feel incredibly fortunate to say that as of 8:00 am on 3/30/2020, I have gone a full year without alcohol!

A little about me, I am a 26(M) and I used to drink hard. Like 10-12 shots a night sometimes more, and it was as always pedal to the metal when I drank. I didn’t really drink in HS, but senior year and into college it started to ramp up. My grades suffered in my freshman year, but I didn’t do anything at the time.

I spent years spinning my wheels, in a constant cycle of drinking, drunk, hungover, and add a couple of arguments and fights every few weeks and you had my life. My friends didn’t want anything to do with me, my family didn’t either and I was hanging on at work by a thread.

I ended up kicked out of my place and was couch surfing for a week around this time last year. I was drinking 24/7 and feeling really sorry for myself. If I didn’t wake up one day, at the time I would have been okay with that. But one day I woke up while at my buddies house and had a revelation: **this shit sucks**

I waited until my friend woke up, and I asked her to drive me to the nearest detox facility and not to turn around even if I begged her to. I was locked in, and even when we pulled in the parking lot I had the feeling of “holy shit I’m doing this.” I checked in and spoke with a doctor who told me if I tried to detox on my own cold turkey, there’s a possibility I could die.

They took my drawstrings and shoelaces, I had an old Harry Potter book (Prisoner of Azkaban IIRC) and I was in their care for about a week. 

When I got out, I went to AA meeting but it never really clicked for me, if it works for you I wish nothing but the best but for me this subreddit has been a godsend. I try and reach out to people I went to rehab with to help each other stay on the straight and narrow.

But I am so so so fortunate to be sober right now during all of this craziness. I’m trying to count my blessings, and fortunately I still have a job as a work in a “essential industry”, but more importantly I have my family back, my friends, and I am saving so much money not buying booze. I’ve lost weight, my blood pressure is lower and I feel that I am in a much better place physically than I was next year. 

My creativity is better and I have been reading a lot more and composing more music! I have to say that not being hungover rules, and it’s such a gift to be sober in these crazy times. Whether your young, old, tried to get sober once or this is your first time, stay on target! Don’t let the news get to you, I have found shutting that off and unsubscribing from the subreddits have been great for my mental health.

Stay safe, stay sober everyone!

It's gotten to where I kind of have to hide it, because I'm just bursting at the seams.  I know I'm lucky and others are struggling and have some really tough shit laid out in front of them.  My sibling are both dealing with some major medical concerns, so I'm trying not to be abrasive in my good fortune...  But it is intensely gratifying to be reaping the benefits of my good choices and hard work. 

1000 days ago, I was a mess.  Not on the outside (unless you count the additional weight I was carrying and the frequent hangovers), but on the inside.  I was frustrated, angry, sad, lazy, incredibly guarded, and defensive.  I constantly felt on the verge of a panic attack and used alcohol liberally to try and ""solve"" or at least deaden all my problems.  A few drinks and who cares about that stuff anyway, right?

Well, I do.  I care a lot now!  But what started me off was not trying to care about EVERYTHING at once.  There was a post on here a day or two ago where people were discussing ""one day at a time.""  I realize that it doesn't resonate with everyone (which is fine!  find what works for you!), but for me it allowed me to reset the clock and start making good choices.  In addition to not worrying too much about the choices I'll have to make tomorrow, it allowed me to move past my prior actions as well.  Yes, older decisions and actions have repercussions, but the only way to build a new story and prove what I can do is to go forward and make it better, one day at a time.  For the first 500 days or so, my one and only focus was not drinking.  Candy, cookies, pizza, root beer... whatever.  And let me tell you what, a snickers bar or two absolutely saved me from some of the stronger cravings.  I let myself have anything as long as it wasn't booze.  After that first year and a half, it didn't seem so hard anymore, so I added better diet choices and cut out most of the sugars I was eating.  About 850 days in, this year, I added exercise.  I now ""run"" (perhaps, slow jog would be a more appropriate term) a few miles a week.

1000 days ago, I don't believe it would have been sustainable for me to stop drinking, start eating right, and exercising all at once.  Physically possible, maybe, but I was not mentally prepared.  By taking an incremental approach, one day at a time... it's working.  I now apply that mantra to most things I commit to for self-improvement.  I can't promise that I will ALWAYS and FOREVER be trying this hard.  I can't promise that I won't screw up.  But I absolutely can say that I won't drink today, I ran this morning, and I'm happy to be here.

Now, instead of all the negative emotions swirling constantly in my head, I feel a deep sense of gratitude.  I'm thankful that my husband and son are still around for me to be better for.  Thankful to all my friends and family who were patient and genuine, even when I was a mess.  Grateful for a community like this one that constantly encourages those endeavoring for self-improvement  whether it's on day 1 or day 10,000.

I can’t even begin to believe that what happened to me and what I put my family through was real. The 18th last Wednesday was the last day I drank and it’s almost surreal thinking about everything that has happened in just twelve days. 
18th- I’ve already found out that my work hours are cut to part time due to covid19. I’m off work around noon and did my usual. Stopped at the grocery store and got absolutely hammered in the parking lot. I still can’t look at my call log from that day. It’s so embarrassing. I must have driven to a totally different parking lot and blacked out at some point. I later am told I was drunkenly calling my partner begging for help and being really messy/ destructive. I started getting shitty and something in me made me call a drunk driving service. (I think I was being defiant because I didn’t want my partner to pick me up) They drive me and my car home (I guess- memory still escapes me on these 3-4ish hours) and come home I did. Just absolutely trashed my apartment screaming and crying apparently, on the phone with my sister trash talking my other family members- my partner in the background screaming at me and me just yelling the most derogatory and unfair shit my fucked up mind could think of. I was screaming calling her pathetic (mind you this is an apartment complex- hello neighbors) and I in this mess I spewed a long suicidal speech and my mom was called who then called the cops. I remember in my drunken haze throwing a folding chair for no reason across the room and watching a hole form in the wall and finally thinking “oh no something is wrong”. I remember my partner with a carryon bag leaving crying telling my neighbors I put a hole in the wall and that I’m a crazy bitch (embarrassing but valid), I remember seeing my mother walk up and I just absolutely lost it sobbing, I remember the cops trying to calm me down and being patient while I sobbed in the middle of the mess I had made. I remember being taken to sober up in the local hospital. 
By this time it’s the early hours of the 19th. I’m dehydrated and my head hurts and I’m just wanting to go back to sleep but they’re moving me from one hospital to another with a psychiatric ward and it’s barely 3am and I finally have my phone and I quickly text and let my manager know I’m so sorry I’m sick and I’m in the hospital- I won’t be back to work until Monday. Proceed to my intake- stripped down and exposed to check for contraband, the most shocking and exposing feeling was seeing how much weight I’ve gained since my drinking took control; seventy lbs in one year. 
7am and the lights are on - blaring and painful and my blood being drawn reminded where I was. I have never been so desperate to go home and be in control in my entire life. I just wanted to drink but I felt so fucking ashamed. 
By some shard of luck my partner took my calls- she understood and just wants me to get better. I had her visit me and I heard the dirty details. I needed to hear them and know what I was apologizing for. I hate that the most about alcohol- having no idea what I said and how I acted but knowing myself well enough to believe the horrible shit I’m told I’ve said. 
The 20th came and things got worse globally pandemic wise and no visitors were allowed but I was on a 72 hours hold and they said the morning of the 21st I would be home so I didn’t worry. I was antsy but the Librium helped and I was finally on my medication consistently and I felt like I finally got a chance to get my shit together. 
21st comes and I’m discharged. I’m in the car and we’re getting pet food/ last minute necessities before the quarantine and my phone is finally charging- so many texts and calls coming through from those few days. My manager- texts saying call me, voicemails, missed calls. He’s my first call and within two minutes I find out that my corporation has halted operations at all California branches and everyone had been let go as of the 20th. 
I joked afterwards that luckily I went through the worst experience of my life right before I lost my job so I have nowhere to go but up now. 
I’m home and I haven’t had any alcohol in almost two weeks and I can’t imagine going through this quarantine as the person before I was hospitalized. Unemployment has been filed, apartment still hasn’t been cleaned fully but I’m keeping up with the dishes and the cooking and my medication and right now that’s enough. I am anxiously awaiting my therapy and psychiatric appointments (via telehealth) and to be honest I’ve been having horrible dreams about relapsing and about literally sneaking out to my car to get fucked up and trying to hide it. It’s been exceptionally hard, especially because spending money/ eating out was my other huge crutch so I’ve been trying to fall in love with cooking and reading again. Trying to have patience with myself while my attention span tries to lengthen a little bit. Getting strength from y’all to truly finally stop drinking.

A lot in my life has changed for the better. Sleepless, anxiety and weight gain have vastly diminished. I am performing better professionally and physically than I have in the last decade. And I owe it to the choice to stop.  I tried a number of times and failed. I wasn't fully committed.  But I saw the writing on the wall, the way that lifestyle ends. It's not pretty. My friend OD'd in October.  Sure, different drug of choice, but similar end results.

I know  this time must be very difficult for you. It is difficult even for the 'normal' folks. Maybe you can't make it to your meeting. Maybe you are less accountable now that you lost your job or dont need to show up in person. Maybe you're making justifications.

Now is not the time to drink: Due to drinking, and the poor diet and lack of sleep that accompanies it I was sick far more frequently. Constant colds, chest infections, etc. Now I get a solid 8 or 9 hours of sleep and eat healthy homemade food and exercise. I have the mental clarity to be careful about washing my hands, or put on a mask properly if I go to a market.  Check in with my parents.  Drinking makes you sloppy and unhealthy, and in times like this you cannot afford it.

Since the UK closed the pubs i've not touched a drink. My poo this morning was FANTASTIC.

I still feel sore and my stomach still isn't great but i'm hoping this is a sign of things to come.

So after that I was living the sober life for 7 months which was AMAZING, all my close friends are drug/ alcoholics and talked me into just having a couple beers. due to my kindled brain I had to cut them off completely after that relapse. my gf drank every day but i lived with her so I had to stay strong mentally to continue my sobriety. I dealt with daily anxiety/depression and she always left to go party with them EVERY weekend, I tried so hard to make that relationship work but i kept relapsing due to my addiction. I had to see it filled in the fridge, cabinets..  when she drinks we always fight, if she’s sober we are a perfect couple. 
       we were crazy in love but as time went by it kept falling apart due to different lifestyles. I lost my job due to depression from drinking, and when I told her we got in a huge fight “she wanted a break” then one night she left to go party with the “friends” and didn’t come home. she did cocaine with my “best” friend of 20 years n slept with him. I was devastated.. that type of betrayal is THE worst emotion I’ve ever witnessed. I moved out the day after, she expected me to live with her and sleep in the same bed while she dates him.

I thought I would pass on some advice that still helps me on a daily basis. We are all currently in circumstances (due to quarantine) that may be putting ourselves at risk for relapse. A very simple lesson I was taught by my sponsor at the beginning of my sobriety was to ""play the tape forward"".  
 
So, what does that mean? Well, if you're considering drinking, think about your future. It's both that simple and that complex. Imagine what the next few hours look like after you took that drink. Are you drunk now? Are you unable to keep promises you made, do the things you needed to etc? Take a look at next morning. Boy, I bet that hangover is going to be great isn't it? Those feelings of regret and shame because you let yourself down? It won't stop there. Think a couple weeks in the future, by then you might have had a full blown relapse. What is your life like now. Think of all those things before you take that first drink.  
 
Remember, alcohol is a temporary solution to a permanent problem. Drinking is not going to fix your issues, your problems, it will only make them worse. So, when you're about to take that first drink, just remember to play the tape forward.",63,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8765599131584167}"

I love this line, because it reminds me that if we let them, pain and negative emotions *will* subside and leave us with a feeling of acceptance. It is a natural progression, a sort of incremental healing, that allows us to make peace with ourselves and with others who may have caused us pain.

What do these 90-days mean to me? They mean discipline. They mean willpower. They mean an active choice in repeatedly electing to not engage in a specific activity. It means maturity. It means knowing—or growing to know—what’s good for me and what isn’t.

It means listening to myself more closely—listening to the thoughts that make me uncomfortable and addressing them face on. It means catching the behaviors I turned into habits and undoing them—like a ball of tangled yarn. It means realizing that I am lucky to do this again for another 90-days, and another 90 after that. It means being lucky to have my husband support me, to have him by my side,through another 90 and another 90 after that...

It means knowing that I’m going to want to drink sometimes and knowing that I’ll just need to sit there with that feeling of want...and actively electing—again—to not engage with that feeling.

Also asking for stories/advice from people that started their sobriety journey young (or from anyone),"I think I am scared of living the rest of my life without alcohol to escape. There's a decent probability that I still have a lot of life left to live and that is a scary thought with so many unanswerable questions about how it will go.  I know that I have my own actions for how to live my life, but sometimes I just get confused and overwhelmed by living.

I have had many failures related to alcohol. I feel old and pretty tired of it already. I'm at a point now where I can drink once and am naturally deterred from it for a few days to weeks, and can moderate my feelings to suit sobriety. But then the intense desire to drink comes when the stress, self-loathing, loneliness, pain, or anxiety comes hard. When the strong urge to drink comes, it's usually in the evening and I am afraid of laying in bed at night sober and unable to fall asleep. Last night I drank a bottle of wine, then went out on my bike to the gas station for more alcohol.

I am afraid that other young people I'd like to know (friends, lovers) will think I am boring, mentally unstable, or a burden since having to manage sobriety for me requires either releasing/surrendering or overcoming the urge to drink. I know the ""release"" doesn't have to be so solemn, but it kinda is for me right now. And the ""overcoming"" can make me irritable. Neither are feelings I want the people I love to have to go through with me and both make me want to isolate myself from them, which is probably worse than just letting them be a part of my life.

Plus, yesterday, we stayed really busy working on our yard, and talking about what we're doing.  Also got a 4 mile run in.  Feels like we have some momentum, if only in the very early stages.  Today, we're taking the bikes to a trail and will ride and enjoy being outdoors.

Another thing we did was talk to our daughters about what we're doing.  As a father, I don't want to forego this opportunity to teach our daughters.  They're 17 and 14, and both are not really down with booze. They've seen what it can do.  Stupid bickering, grumpiness, and the shame we feel when they ask us ""why are you going to the store.""  Tired of that shit.  No more.

Im still not exactly saving heaps of money by not smoking and drinking but i have a boat and useful things. I have always wanted a boat but never had money for it cos i spent it all on booze n drugs.

I have failed to go a single day of not drinking so many days in a row.,"I’m not a drunk. I’m a moderate drinker. It doesn’t effect my life, relationships, or work. This makes it hard to stop. I don’t have a good reason to stop drinking. And I don’t want to stop drinking. But I do want to get it under control. I don’t want to end up becoming an alcoholic. A true alcoholic that is. I do in fact drink every day, and have for the last 10 years.  I guess I’m an alcoholic but not a drunkaholic. There is a difference. My dad has had a beer after work every day for the last 20 years probably. But that’s it. He’s never gotten worse. That’s something I can live with. That said, I would like to have days every week where I don’t drink at all. With stress being a killer, it’s actually healthy I think to have a single drink every day. 

But only if you have just the one. I have two or three. Not good. 

All that said, I’m open to stopping completely for a while. Or stopping completely on weekdays. 

I’m not at a place with drinking where this should be so hard. I don’t need to go to AA. I won’t have withdrawal symptoms. I wouldn’t be craving it like mad. I did go one day without drinking last month. It wasn’t hard. 

Yet every day I go for a walk, and I pass the liquor store and grab my usual 2 beers. Sometimes 3. And more on the weekends. 

While I’m not a problem drinker, and will never hit rock bottom, I also don’t fall into the “have one drink a day because it’s healthy” category. I’m somewhere in the middle. I have a couple of drinks to deal with work / life stress. I don’t like that I rely on it for that. I need to learn to cope with stress without substances. 

I used to smoke pot every night. Stopped that years ago. I had a dependency on pain killers. Took care of that. I stopped smoking a few months ago. 

I’m heading in the right direction. Cutting down on drinking is the final thing on my list to live a healthy life. 

But I’m finding it hard to let go of this last thing.

One of my deepest fears was any scenario where I might not be able to get access to alcohol - and as such, getting ill was high on my list. That's how messed up the wiring in my brain became - I wasn't worried about being ill (and goodness knows heavy daily drinking put me at greater risk) I was worried about not being able to get access to alcohol if I became hospitalised.

I know that the lockdowns rolling out as a result of the current covid-19 pandemic would have terrified me just as strongly: if I was still actively drinking, my life would have kicked into stockpiling alcohol. Supermarkets are limiting items to two per person here. Goodness knows how many places I would have ended up visiting daily, and quite needlessly.

So today I am grateful to be free, to have my priorities wired correctly, to not be a slave to my addiction. I am in good health and can just focus on taking the best care of myself and being available to help others if needed.

As of late I havnt been utilizing the tool of this page as much as I should. Which is somthing I really need to start doing again. I'm not going to lie I've been struggling. In the first month I was here almost everyday talking to you lot, yet as time goes on I use it less and less. That is in part because my life has gotten better. Since leaving alcohol behind I actually have cognitive memory of the last four months which I didnt know was possible. Who knew one could actually remember so much. I've picked up hobbies, work is going well, I've got a kid on the way. Life is good. I've said it before, quitting alcohol wasnt a cure all to my problems, but not actively poisoning myself everyday truley helped me work on the real issues in my life as well as help prevent myself from making anymore. 

Part of my problem I feel as of late is because alcohol isnt a constant tick in my brain anymore. Let me explain. When I drank everyday I accumulated this weight that carried heavy in me. I dragged the metaphorical weight everywhere with me I drank and got use to it being there. I almost forgot it I was draggin it around all the time. Then I got sober and and slowly unpacked that weight and felt light and free. I'd been chained and now I could fly. I've slowly forgotten about the weight and go weeks without thinking about it. I also stopped being use to carrying it. So now when I do remember it I feel like it dropped on me from a great height it grips me, strangles me, and chains me all over again. Sure it releases its hold on me once again but each time it does I forgot what that weight is like a little bit more and I feel it crushes me that little bit more everytime. I'll keep fighting and if I have to I'll keep fighting this battle forever, but damn if it isnt hard somedays.

I've wondered as of late if this is what they consider a dry drunk to be. I'd heard the term when I use to go to meeting, but never understood it much. Personally  the meeting weren't for me, but they where a great tool in there time. I personally know I've got a lot of baggage ,both from alcohol and my past, to digest through. Once the worlds currunt situation calms down a little I think I'm going to sit down and try and find some professionals in their fields to help me unpack some of it.

I hope you are all doing well and I wish you the best in your journeys.

Till next time my sober friends.

Curious if you'd want to lend me your opinion. I just got laid off thursday so that means I will be home much more. I have two roommates but one who is moving out in a week. Anyway, I just get home from bringing my dogs to the woods and I see my housemate and his girlfriend getting stuff out of is car, stuff that looks like she is going to camp out out our house. Now the social distance thing does matter to me and he just told me she wasn't feeling well the other day. So that's like the first wtf but really I just got SUPER anxious that I was going to trapped in our house while they get wasted. He came home plastered last night off vodka from her place and there was now way I trust that wouldn't happen again today. So I actually cut it off at the pass before she even came inside and spouted social distancing stuff and if he could come inside and talk real quick. 

I am reading "" The Body keeps Score"" which is basically about trauma. I grow up in a alcoholic home and I still provide emotional support via phone to my still alcohol addicted mother. It was like it all just cascaded and I just couldn't bear that process. Anyway, I feel like dick and a hypocrite because its not like I wasn't just drinking 4 months ago. But in some ways I don't care and just need my house to be and stay a safe place.

And then I got complacent.","I allowed the thought of how good that one IPA sounded just this once and how I’ll only have this one today. Yeah. Sure. Three days later and it’s just one more craft beer just this one time again... you know, cause I handled my one beer bargaining so well previously. And then that weekend we go out to celebrate a good work week with some friends (and of course since I’m with friends I can let loose and have some fun too). I like to drink to forget the bullshit from earlier in the week also. I like to cheers the group for Amy’s 30th birthday. I like to kick back and unwind...

And then I wake up after a meaningless night of spending copious amounts of money (I don’t have) trying to have fun with and impress people I don’t care about only to wake up and remember next to nothing the following morning. Full of regret and shame. Depressed and hungover. But oh wait!... Then I remember the cure to a hangover is more alcohol and oh what do you know I didn’t finish the entire bottle last night. There’s a perfect amount to take the edge off before work this morning. Those pulls from the now warm bottle as I stumble through the mess in the kitchen while looking for my phone are the reason I love alcohol. Alcohol makes everything okay.  It makes me feel better... at first. And then I blink and next thing I know I’m 3 weeks deep on a fifth-a-day bender hiding and sneaking my drinks in whenever I can. I’m sick. I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired everyday. I made it almost 60 days sober a month ago. On my own strength and free will. Because I wanted it.  I want it again. It just hurts so bad. It hurts so bad the thought of pouring out the rest of the bottle before I pass out tonight and wake up dry in the morning makes me sick already. And I’m blitzed. Numb to the world. But that thought of being without again is like nails on a chalk board. This first couple days are always the hardest. Wish me luck.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**


I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next.  I know I do! Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
________________________________________
This pledge is a statement of intent. **Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink.**

 It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset! What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.


**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.


**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This is Day 6 in my adventure with my first take on sobriety. 

I am in the USA. I have drank craft beer habitually since 2012.  I’m 5’6”. 175# with the 20+ pounds of lazy beer bloat from maintaining this habit. 

Started self isolating after work on 3/13 and my self-comfort from this pandemic was the IPAs in my fridge from the local brewery. One week into my isolation and I was upholding my norm - drinking daily but swiftly increasing the 16oz can consumption daily, consuming 2-3 has been my norm but last week It got bingey - easily up to 4+ toward the end of the week. 64oz of extreme inebriation daily. Swerving and slurring my way to bed every night. 

I’ve wanted to stop for a year or more. I’ve pushed away my longtime boyfriend for beer. He sleeps on the couch as much as in the bed. My work has suffered too many “sick” days related to alcohol. Yet my mind trudged on in my addiction despite the harm.  Well, Last Sunday I was hungover from 5-6 beers (again) and scared to be sick at a time like this. I decided to stop.

Tonight at midnight will be one week with no beer. I feel strong. Not craving a drink. My body is still wrecked from the abuse but recovering. Dehydration and Hot sweats and anxiety. Upset tummy. Not much appetite. But I feel strong and hope to be here supporting other first week-ers like me and the whole community for a very long time. 

I see many on day 1 and hope to cheer you on in your strength and perseverance. 
I see many like me at 6 and 7 days and am happy to be here with you. 
I see many That I aspire to be. With weeks, months and years.  
Thank you all.

It has escalated and escalated. I feel like I have lost control during this quarantine. Im ashamed to admit how many days in a row I have been drinking. I’m ashamed what my kids have seen. I’m ashamed and embarrassed. It’s hard to describe how ashamed and embarrassed I am about myself. I know that alcohol has caused the feelings but in a screwed up way I still have strong feelings to drink. I’m scared to not drink. Something that makes me feel this way should be avoided and I should run from it. I feel horrible and want to drink more. It’s a scary realization. I know I need to stop drinking and I have decided that it needs to end. I am unhealthy. My insides hurt. I don’t understand why but the idea of not drinking gives me so much anxiety. I know I need to do it, but I’m nervous and scared. I don’t really understand my emotions. Actually that is probably the thing I am most anxious about is the emotional and mental recovery. Sometimes I feel like a crazy person and I feel like alcohol will bring out a better me. Make me a better father and have more patience. Make me in a better mood and not angry and irritable. I don’t really know how I can be the best version of myself and not drink. I know I have to stop drinking because I think alcohol is killing myself. 

I don’t talk about my drinking with other people. My family is extremely religious and my parents don’t drink. Maybe I need a sponsor. I don’t know how that even works. I think I’m going to try be an active member of this sub. I need a community and a club. This life is so fucking hard. Being in a group helps. I think I can learn from people who have gone through it before. Or at least I can hear stories of success so I know it’s possible. Everyday I see success stories of people celebrating 1 year, 1 month, 100 days of sobriety. It seems impossible. I wonder if people lie for attention. It’s hard to see so many people accomplish something I haven’t been able to do. I have tried so many times before and I’m ashamed to say how quickly I have given up. I’m ashamed that I haven’t been able to overcome this. I have done some amazing things but I’m a total failure at sobriety. 

I’m starting over. I’m not proud of what I have done. I’m in low spirits and I’m sorry to be such a downer. I just want things to change. I want so much more than what I have been doing. Im very scared of change. I hesitate and procrastinate and really stress out over change. It’s hard for me to change small aspects of my life. I don’t know but for whatever reason it freaks me out and is hard for me. 

Can anyone tell me how to put the day ticket next to the username?

Anyways, I’m throwing this out to universe. I’m making a change and I know its going to be hard but I know it needs to happen and should be worth it. I have debated about whether I should talk to my kids about my drinking. They are 10 and 6. I know, they know. I’m scared to think about what memories they have. The most terrifying thing is thinking about impact this is having on them. It brings me to tears. I don’t want to be a failure of a father. I don’t know how I can protect them or teach them. I don’t know if I should talk to them? What if I fail and they see me drinking again? What if they think this drinking is normal? I have talked about addiction in general with them and they don’t fully understand it. I have always wanted to sober up first and then have a heart to heart talk to them.

You don’t feel massively ‘better’ but not having hangovers is delightful.

My whole perspective has changed and I am so grateful for every sober, waking moment ...even the boring days and the shitty times I can handle more effectively. 

I have rediscovered old hobbies like cooking and music..and spending quality time with my family instead of being a drunken zombie.

I'm finally going to quit drinking. I'm terrified. And angry.,"I'm 28 and have been drinking heavily since I was 18. I think I always knew I drank too much, but I kept moving the goal posts of ""having a problem"". I would tell myself, if drinking interferes with my job then I have to stop. I discarded that notion a while ago, after the first time I called off work from getting shitfaced the night before. I saw my uncle drink himself to death and still had several glasses of wine at the luncheon after his funeral. I said to myself, it's not like I'm SUPER drunk and it's not MY fault they're serving wine at an alcoholic's funeral. Recently it's been getting worse and worse. I've been nearly blacked out almost every night, going in to work hungover as shit and depressed and just half-assing my way through 8 hours until I can come home and drink again. I kept telling my therapist, I'm gonna go to AA. But I kept putting it off because hey, I can figure out a way to drink in moderation, I just need to try harder. I don't need to quit. I think this week was really the last straw. 


I had a virtual happy hour with my family on Tuesday, I had started drinking at 3 since I'm working from home during the quarantine, and I didn't have anything for lunch because I couldn't be bothered to make food, so by 5 I was already very drunk. I was yelling, picked a fight with my dad for absolutely no reason, and was just overall a complete asshole. I then went on to pick a fight with my boyfriend, again for NO reason, and went to bed thinking about killing myself. To be honest, I've been suicidal for weeks now. I managed to not drink Wednesday, mostly out of shame, but went right back to it Thursday and Friday. I actually managed to drink moderately (for me) those days, just a couple fingers of whiskey and 3 or 4 beers with plenty of water in between. I even thought to myself, see! You can drink like a normal person, you don't have to quit! But last night I couldn't sleep so I stayed up and read through all the posts on this sub, almost sobbing, and I knew that yes, I do have to quit.


I'm fucking terrified. Drinking is such a huge part of my life. My family are all heavy drinkers and we always drink when we get together. I don't know what I'm going to tell them. I keep thinking, how am I supposed to do XYZ without drinking? How am I supposed to go to brunch without drinking? How am I supposed to see concerts without drinking? How am I supposed to get through summer without drinking? And I'm also angry. I'm angry that I have to quit entirely, that I can't just have 1 or 2 and be done like a normal person. I'm angry that I can't have more self control. But mostly I'm just angry at myself for letting alcohol steal so much of my time. The past 10 years are so hazy, and there are so many times that I ruined what should have been a fun event by being a drunk asshole. I can't live like this anymore, constantly in a haze between bouts of binge drinking, filled with self hatred and slowly alienating myself from those I love. So this is my Day One. I'm not hideously hungover for the first Saturday in God knows how long, and it feels really good. I'm awake at a reasonable hour and eating breakfast rather than laying in bed until 4pm and ordering Taco Bell. Maybe I can chase this feeling instead of the feeling of ""just one more drink"".

but this mental obsession is hanging on. And I don’t know how to break the spell.

And once I did, it bled into other parts of my life that were supporting my use. Unhealthy behaviors I’ve worked on is not being present, being uncomfortable with myself, not facing challenges, not being tidy... gifts I’ve gotten have been focus, a new “ownership” of my space, an interest in things (anything! A new flute! A potted plant! A new hobby everyday!). 

My partner still drinks. I’ve tried to quit so many times before, that I have this wall in my head that I can’t quit if it’s for someone else.

I have a camera in my apartment to keep an eye on the place while I am gone. It is set to record when I am not home and at night between midnight and 6 AM. Well, I had real bender the other night (like I was doing every night!) and my camera recorded me while I was blackout drunk. Needless to say it was quite shocking to see myself in that condition. I decided right then and there that this had gone too far and I needed to fix my problem.

My drinking habits started like many people, as a social activity. Only having a couple beers with friends, or a glass of wine with dinner, maybe 1-2 times a week. I didnt like being drunk, just a little buzz to loosen up socially. I lied to myself and said I actually enjoyed the taste of beer and wine. I studied it. I home brewed my own beer. I had a keg system. I was in a home brew club. I liked to go wine tasting....  But about 3 years ago for reasons I still dont know, I started drinking by myself. Out of boredom maybe? That started off lightly, but gradually I started drinking more and more. Drinking to get drunk. Every night. Not just because I considered myself a ""connoisseur"" (what a joke that is!!). And then I moved on from beer to liquor. Beer was making me fat. Vodka actually because I could easily mix it with anything and its cheap.  I could easily put away an entire fifth of liquor (750ml) in one night. sometines I would just buy a pint so I wouldn't drink an entire bottle. It was getting to the point where I would skip working out, I would call in sick to work for hangovers, I would avoid social activities that would interfere with my nightly binges... It was very unhealthy.

Here's my story.,"More than 6 months ago I had my last drink and it's been so easy. I had tried many times before to quit, but always failed. It always seemed impossible, but also terrifying. Living life without whiskey seemed awful. Every day would be a struggle against my addiction. I would go crazy and miss it always. 
I have some health problems and was seeing a naturopathic doctor, a psychiatrist, and a counselor. They were all telling me to quit drinking but I couldn't give it up. Then my mental health crashed hard and I was involuntarily hospitalized for 11 days. Being held against my will was a big enough blow to make me want to quit drinking. When I got out and saw my counselor she told me that if I wanted to have a relationship with my son I would need to quit drinking. Now. Forever. He hated me for being drunk around the house. I had stupidly told myself that he didn't know. I love my son and he deserves a sober mom. It's embarrassing to write this but that was the slap in the face that I needed. So that was that. However, there are other factors helping me stay sober. Hopefully you can take something from my list and quit for good.
1. Solid commitment to quit forever. None of this ""one day at a time"" or, ""I'll cut back for a while"" for me. It's over. 
2. Hobbies at home to fill the time void left by not drinking. You don't want a craving to even have a chance to get a word in edgewise. 
3. Medication. I get an injection every month of Vivitrol, which curbs cravings. It also makes alcohol behave differently in your body. My niece gets the same medicine for heroin addiction and she's doing amazing. I seriously haven't had one craving. 
4. Counseling. I really believe that we drink to run or hide. We need help. 
5. TED talks on addiction helped me feel less guilty about what I had done. Dr. Gabor Maté and Johann Hari have excellent talks. I've listened so many times. 
6. Friends. I still go out with my drinking buddies occasionally (not now, thanks covid), I just don't drink. Now I'm always the DD! With Vivitrol, I'm not even scared I'll be tempted.

Im married and have a little girl at home.  Everything was going so well in life and at work but I was drinking all the time.  Just shrugged it off as oh well Im a drinker this is who I am.  Ive had problems with the law in the past and I would sober up and clean up my mess.  Once everything was back on track I would start drinking again.  Slowly and carefully at first but wouldnt take long to start having some blackout nights again.  My wife would drink with me but not to the same extent.  I never understood why she wouldnt have blackouts.  Every once in awhile I would wake up and she would be mad at me for something I said or did but couldnt remember.  Over and over again she would tell me this was the last straw and I would assure her I would reign it in.  

So when I was arrested this last time I figured it was all over.  Thought my marriage would be over with, thought I would loose my house and job.  So my plan was to get a motel room and just drink and drink and drink until it was alll gone.  I slept on a friends couch that night, and in the morning went home to get the paperwork to get my car from the impound.  My wife was hesitant but said she would help me get the car.  Just seeing her and my little girl made me realize how badly I needed to be there for them.  I couldnt continue on like this and finally admitted to myself that I was an alcoholic and could no longer drink, ever.  She told me we were soul mates and she would back me up if I wanted to get help.  So we got the car and I got a hotel room to give her some space and time to dry out.  She said while I was gone she would clear the house out of any alcohol and she would stop drinking with me.
  It meant the world to me that she still hasnt given up on me despite everything Ive done.  They both mean the world to me and I finally realized I need to do this for myself so I could be there for them.
  I am very anxious about the hurddles I have coming up but am trying to just focus on today.  So mad at myself for making this huge mess, but if it hadnt happened I never would have woke up to the fact that I truly can not drink even the tiniest bit ever again! Been reading posts on here and doing AA via zoom these past 2days while stuck in a hotel room.  It has been tough though I could easily go get some liqour and no one would know but me.  But I know that wouldnt fix anything and I finally truly want my sobriety.

I knew I needed to either moderate or stop, but there wasn't anything that pushing me towards any action.  There were the really shitty hangovers, the freaked out, anxiety ridden early mornings, but again, nothing pushing me to take action.  I've listened to podcast, have read Annie Grace's book, openly spoke to my wife about it, but there was no feeling from within pushing me to really do it.

Then all the sudden, three days ago, I woke up with this heightened sense of impending doom and non-ceasing anxiety, worse than normal, and the tip of my right index finger became numb, then again the day after, same time of day.  And I just felt like total shit, physically and mentally.  Very much not me.  And all the sudden, it really hit me as never before, I have to quit alcohol!  

I'm motivated. But today I'm really overwhelmed and down about everything.  I'm really mad at myself for letting this get here.  It's really shitty to be painted into a corner, either quit, or this shit gets real, as in real, long term consequential damage (more than the present amount).  

i'm not in too deep volume wise, but I'd say that my wife and i have probably consumed 2-3 glasses of wine or 2-4 beers most evenings/nights over the past year.  Given this, I'm tapering.  Certainly right now I'm not going to do anything that could land me in an ER.  My plan is to knock the amount down over the course of the next week or two, down to less than a beer, and then just quit.  Having tapered off of other stuff before, I've learned that patience, will power, and a longer taper is more successful.  There's lasting empowerment being able to take/drink less than you did the day before.  I've found that it builds a momentum.

Last night I fucked up and drank, it was my own fault, though I was offered drinks by my boyfriend, who was drinking heavily with our buddies and seriously going for it. But of course after our friends left things went super downhill because he was done drinking and I still felt compelled to drink, seeing as I was still conscious. We got in super fucking pointless arguments over shit like me painting my nails, and essentially boiled down to me hating the feeling of being “controlled” by him when I’m drunk; I just want to do my own thing. Be left to my own vice without having to entertain the idea of anyone else’s feelings. I know, I’m a fucking asshole. 

I get super mean when I drink, and to me that is more validation to NOT drink, so I don’t act like that. I’m committed to not drinking today, but he feels hurt by last night and wants some kind of instant resolution which I can’t provide. He’s been in a shitty mood all damn day, slamming doors and punching walls and generally being fucking childish and annoying. He just got in his car and drove away, and I’m honestly thankful he’s gone for the moment. He just doesn’t understand at all that I can’t drink “normally” like he and I guess everyone else he’s ever known can, and get personally offended like I’m somehow doing this on purpose to hurt him, and don’t have an actual, real disorder when it comes to alcohol. 

I can’t seem to make him understand. It’s incredibly frustrating. I just wanted to come on here and air this out, as I feel a little guilty for his pissy mood and yet also peeved at his childish behavior. I don’t have the “answers” he’s looking for, and I can’t be responsible for uplifting his mood more so than any average day. I know this post makes me sound super bad, but I kind of am the worst.

I just ask for support, but not preaching (also why I’m afraid of a sponsor - I can handle tough love, but I’m afraid of “holier-than-thou” approach I’ve seen a few times on the AA sub)

I’m afraid because all my friends and family drink, as does my boyfriend.  I’m afraid because of weddings.  I’m afraid because I could screw up my life - and I make excuses for myself so easily.  I’m afraid I’ll have to go to AA meetings every day.  I’m afraid that AA could isolate me from my loved ones because I’ve heard people say that can happen in such an intensive experience.  I’m afraid because I like the taste of alcohol.  I’m afraid because I don’t want anyone to tell me I don’t have a problem.  I’m afraid of the extra attention from family and friends and them whispering about me not drinking at weddings and the like.

Out of that list, though, I’m mostly afraid of screwing up my life and the lives of others.  I’m mostly afraid of hitting what I’ve always pictured as “rock bottom.”  I’m mostly afraid of not being able to do it and screwing it up.  Despite all my fears, all I can say is IWNDWYT.

Most oftenly, those fuckups made me feel regret, guilt, shame, pity and disgust towards me and my behaviour, but this time I think I crossed the line completely.
Recently, I've been chatting with a girl from work and I must honestly say that she had tons of qualities that I admire, on top of that she is incredibly beautiful. I got over my fear of rejection, over the thought that I might be out of her league and we started talking at some point and she got interested really quickly.
Little note about me: I am in a higher position in the workplace, I conduct classes for German language and I'm also responsible for evaluating the skill level of the employees, including her. I'm not unattractive, I  got a shitton of hobbies and lead a good life, minus my insecurities and my being prone to suvstance abuse.

Yesterday we were supposed to talk on the phone, as she asked me to teach her German, and I was really looking forward to it. To me,it was my chance to shine. Prior to that, I got myself two beers from the gas station and poured them down, but felt the strong need to continue drinking after that. I went to my neighbor to see if he had some booze, and I got myself 2 liters of plum moonshine,or rakija/rachiu (for all you Balkan people out there) We kept on drinking beer and moonshine together, and by the time I got home, I was already drunk to the level where my speech was notably impeded. I struggled with social anxiety at some point in my life and am still a little bit insecure in this aspect.
So I still messaged her and we started talking on the phone shortly after. We talked for around 50 minutes and trust me, I barely remember what I said, but I surely remember that I was incapable of explaining anything to her and the teaching thing turned out to be impossible. I grabbed my guitar thinking I could impress her this way and fiddled around a little, but I was barely capable of connecting two chords. I have no idea what else happened or what we talked about, but she surely didn't answer her phone today, which is enough for me to know that it went totally wrong.

Now I'm left with this feeling of disappointment and disgust. I know I fucked up and I know that it happened because of my drinking problem. I wish I could just go back to the terms in which we were before this mishap - moreover, I'd go back in time to tell my yesterday's self not to go to the petrol station and to keep my fingers away from the poison.
I wish I could explain myself to her somehow but the pessimistic me tells me that it probably won't happen.
Let my story serve you as a reminder that we're all better off sober and that abstinence from the devil's drink is our only chance to stay in line with acomplishing our goals.

I heard a rumor that they are going to call out the National Guard.  It seems legit too.  

If you're reading this, I'm assuming that you're probably under some sort of lock down.  Mine is called Shelter In Place.  It sounds so harmless and almost cozy even.  

Almost...

Ironic.  I really feel as though I haven't been able to process everything.  It all changes so quickly.  I can't keep up.  I mean I could try but there are other things that I can do that will make a positive impact on my life and those in my sphere of influence.  

I've learned, through conditioning to ignore, suppress, or even hate fear.  I'm starting to wonder if that's really the right way.  We have evolved, or been created, with the instinct of fear.  Fear is a type of knowledge.  

Wisdom though is different.  Wisdom is being able to sit with the fear, to not let it control us and to be able to go on without it clouding everything else.  To not let the fear make the decisions for us.

There are other types of knowing.  There's gratitude, joy, equanimity, many other major and minor concepts like these.  They are like students in a class room.  Sometimes it's best to let that one kid that's always ruining it for everyone, to just let them have the spotlight for a moment.  They'll quiet down eventually, probably not pay attention, but at least they'll stop being disruptive for a period of time and give the other kids a chance to learn or talk.

Sometimes we need to listen to fear.  What does it have to teach us?

I started in my teens and from the start I loved how it made me feel.  It progressed slowly until I moved in with my boyfriend at 22. This became our daily past time, our hobby. We drank beer every single night together at home, sometimes with friends, but most often just the two of us.  At 30, after gaining 60 pounds in my 20s, he is now my husband & we decided it was best to switch to hard liquor to eliminate the fat, bloated beer drinking look. Insane, I know. I started drinking vodka & he drank gin. A few years of having children came after that which gave us a break for a while but once the kids were born and no longer nursing we were back at it; vodka and gin every night. I had decent control for many years having to get up with the kids at night or early in the morning, but once they got older it got worse. 

Fast forward to now….I was drinking 2 to 2-1/2 handles of vodka per week in the evenings…my husband drinking his gin too, but a lot less because he has to go to work in the a.m. My hands are shaking every day to the point that even my kids have asked “Mom, why are you so shakey?” and I would use the too much coffee excuse. My weight is now up 90 pounds from when I started drinking years ago. I get up each day to see my kids off to school but then instantly climb back into bed until 11 or noon to sleep off my hangover. Most mornings I don’t remember going to bed the night before. My liver hurts, my stomach feels nauseous many days, my kidneys some days hurt too and I have been avoiding going to the Dr for years because I don’t want to be found out. I’ve literally laid in bed in my miserable mornings thinking that I likely will not see 50 (just over a year from now) and there’s nothing I can do about it because I can’t crawl out of this abyss.  I have other smaller health concerns going on too that I don’t know if they are or are not related to drinking, but I wouldn’t be surprised if they are. Everyday I wake up hating myself for continuing this bullshit, but 5pm rolls around and we are still pouring another drink. I think about my poor children not having a mother in the future & that I’m doing it to them. 

On Sunday I decided I can’t feel like complete crap every day of my life anymore and so here I am now on Day 5. I feel much better already, not shaking, down 2.4lbs, feel great every morning….but then the thought comes to my head that it’s the weekend and I can “maybe” just have a few drinks. WTF! No I can’t! I had to write this today to remind myself why I’m doing this and that it is not an option to keep going on the way I was.

I want to tell my story, so this will probably be pretty long. Read it or don't LOL I pretty much just feel like talking about it...

I didn't start drinking until I was 21 (30 now). While I was in college, I would say alcohol was a problem for me and I drank most nights. My grades started going down because I would be too hungover to bother going to class. Once I graduated, I slowed down a bit. I worked the night shift and helped take care of my dying Mother. I would occasionally have some social drinks, but I wasn't dependent on it. After my Mom passed away in 2012, I started drinking more regularly again, although I was in denial about it at the time. It wasn't until about 2018 that I really started to drink. Heavily. I would go through a 12 pack of beer a night. And steadily I got worse. I'd hide beer cans and lie about how much I had to drink. I would drink to the point of blacking out almost every single night and then be embarrassed the next day when I was told some of the ridiculous stuff that I had done. Or I would just be so riddled with anxiety over what I may have done the night before but have no recollection of. I would go to work super hungover every day or call in sick quite a bit. When I did go to work, I would be super lazy and do JUST enough to get me by without getting fired. Then I would go home and repeat the cycle. Sometimes I was with friends. But being alone didn't stop me. I'd drink and play video games or drink and watch movies. I lied to a lot of people. I HURT a lot of people. I was disgusted with myself and my actions but the only way I felt I could get over it was to drink some more. My anxiety and depression shot through the roof. I craved attention from pretty much anyone. This led me to some pretty shitty situations and some things happened to me that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemies.  

October 26th was the last day I had alcohol. The first part of the night was a lot of fun. Then I blacked out. I'm not going to talk about what exactly happened... but that next morning, I decided that as much as I LOVED (or thought I did) drinking, I could absolutely not live my life like this anymore. It finally hit me that I would end up dead or possibly in prison for hurting someone else. I decided to not drink anymore. And I haven't since.  

I know relapses happen. I am praying that it doesn't happen to me. So far, I have been pretty strong-willed. I can be around my friends that are drinking and not have any urges or cravings. They don't give me any shit for not drinking anymore, either. I have noticed that my brain is a lot clearer than it has been in YEARS. I feel like I am funnier, wittier, and quicker on my feet LOL. :) I remember things so much more easily. I am in bad moods wayyyyy less often. I am more patient. I have started writing a blog. I have started being a lot more productive at work and have even implemented some new practices to streamline the way things are being done which have received praise from my superiors.

Things have been going really well for me. I have a few people to thank for that. Some people really pushed me in the right direction (even before I decided to get sober). I know that I hurt them and others in the process and I am whole-heartedly sorry for any damage I have caused. I am truly appreciative of these people and I am extremely grateful to have such a great support system in my life. 5 months down. I don't plan on going back.  


tl;dr: I was a giant mess and a piece of shit; a genuinely terrible person in denial. I finally had a reality check and got sober and now here I am 5 months alcohol-free and kicking ass! ;) THANK YOU EVERYONE ON SD FOR BEING SO AWESOME!

While I know 90 days is still early, for me it is an eternity.  I functioned career wise, but I was  heavy drinker.  And I’ve done a lot of things in my life I’m not proud of.  That first week sober was hell and I don’t really remember it.  I was really doing one day at a time and up to day 45 it was pretty tough.  I slept an awful lot during that time and my thinking was quite paranoid.  I thought the tiredness and anxiety would never go away.  But after that things did start to improve.  It was ups and down of good periods and bad periods - it is still that way.    But overall, day 30 was a lot better than day one.  And I feel like that bares repeating - Day 30 is better than day 1.  Day day 60 was better than day 30 and day 90 is better than day 60.  I am hoping it continues this way.  For my mental health, there is simply no comparison.  It is like night and day.  And after ‘only’ 90 days that has surprised me the most, as I was quite anxious and depressed a lot of the time.  I don’t wake up feeling amazing every day.   But there have been days, here and there, where for no reason whatsoever I just feel good.  Good about myself and good about life. I wasn't sure that was ever possible again.  In the past the only thing that made me feel good was a drink, until it didn’t.  Ive lost a bit of weight, without exercise.  About 9lbs.  Look after yourselves and each other.  Take care.

My Granny, the family member I am closest to, died in January. Had to see my estranged, abusive father who is still trying to get back in contact with me. A coworker of mine died unexpectedly in February. Now March with the coronavirus. 

My habit is: buy a fifth, start drinking as soon as I get home, cook dinner (sometimes while blacked out), and then pass out after drinking half of it. For some reason I felt that any more than that was too much. I just wanted the day to be over with and I didn’t want to be present for anything. Checking out was a better option that actually being in the world feeling pain. I struggle with PTSD and depression - alcohol was my escape strategy. 

Last week was the tipping point for my husband. And two days ago was the tipping point for me. I need to stop to save my marriage, get healthy, and actually enjoy life.

The full story is that I first tried to get sober in December 2018. After some slip ups and a lot of reflection, I cobbled together 50 days. Then, one night at dinner, I had a couple glasses of wine. Then another drink the next night. Then I went to a concert a few days later and drank what felt like 85 beers. Then I committed to getting back on the wagon, until a couple weeks would pass and I'd fall off again. Rinse and repeat.

As the weeks turned to months things became easier as my daily life normalised to no longer revolved around alcohol and I accepted that 'bored in the evenings' is actually a good thing as it is my brain telling me that it wants to be engaged in something, not washed away to oblivion

I have been looking towards reaching the 1 year mark with excited anticipation - it feels like a real landmark in my life, where I have turned myself into a better version of who I was, maybe not perfect (ok, definitely not perfect) but more comfortable with who I am and my weaknesses, accepting of my failures and excited to be able to improve every day.

But this COVID has been testing me - dealing with new stresses and even more alone time to think and worry, but it has been a challenge I have been preparing all year for. 

I know without becoming sober I would not be as positive and energised - to make the most of learning new things and trying to enjoy an change in lifestyle for what it is, it is an experience and I want to remember every moment of it.

I've been on day 3 plenty of times before, but this time it feels different.

I have pretty much 0 responsibilities right now. I need to walk the dog, cook some food, do some general household stuff, do 8 hours of online tutoring a week... and that's it really. 90% of the time I have right now is my time to do, within reason, what I want with.

I also have about £5.50 to my name, and will have no more until April 20th. I'm not exactly thrilled about this as I have to rely on whatever food my parents buy, but it's not that big of a deal. I literally cannot afford alcohol, and I'm not desperate enough to steal it. 

The last big thing is that there's no meeting up with friends! This will be the case for at least two more weeks, and probably many more to come. I love my friends to bits, but they are drinking friends. On the rare occasions where i'd managed not to drink until the weekend... Friday would come along, I would cave straight away and I'd be getting wasted within the blink of an eye. Don't have to worry about that pressure for a while now.

I still have things to worry about. I'm not going to be able to make my monthly repayment to the debt consolidation charity, and they're not responding to any of my emails but... there isn't anything more I can do. I've tried, and what will be, will be. Nothing I can do until they decide to get back to me.

I also have university work to attend to, but given the situation I have massive extensions to most of my assignments and can definitely put off caring about them for the next two weeks.

So yeah, sorry for the long winded post, but I'm actually not feeling too bad for once. I'm eating okay, the sun is out, I can still go for a nice hour long stroll if I want and, for the first time in a long time, I'm not worrying about every little aspect of my life. I feel.. almost peaceful?

I’m in my fourth day at medical detox and honestly feel so good. 

Back on Monday, after I quit a week-long binge, something was “off.” I couldn’t think clearly, had barely any short-term memory and couldn’t even remember what I had just done the five minutes prior to doing it. Then, I began seeing things I had never seen before—those black shadows, those eerie noises, etc. 

I freaked out and had my mother take me to the ER. Surprisingly, the ER was pretty empty, so I for a room in there. The doctor evaluated me and also did an ultrasound of my pancreas, gallbladder, and liver. Everything came out fine, except for the fact that my liver was a tad fatty given the alcohol use.

The doctor gave me a dose of Valium in the ER but gave me the choice of just leaving or being admitted for alcohol withdrawal treatment. I figured once the Valium he gave me wore off, I’d be back at square one. I told him to admit me.

The room was HORRIFYING. I was strapped to a bed with thousands of monitoring cords and had a catheter put in. I kept seeing things and couldn’t really sleep. 

Second day was a little better but still with hallucinations and overall paranoia. I also had seizure. Second night was better. Still had awful hallucinations and some night sweats.

Day three was great. Got to move out CCU and into regular unit. Slept well with no nightmares. 

This morning I feel great and hope for a quick return to my normal life.

Withdrawal is a thing, folks. Get medical help if necessary. I always scoffed at it, but it saved me.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Finally Friday! And, time for my favorite pro tip: HALT.

I struggled bad with cravings. I found tremendous help in HALT; whenever I wanted a drink, I would stop and check if maybe I was really Hungry, Angry, Lonely or Tired (some add Stressed to the list). I usually was. The best solution for me was to stay one step ahead, by always being hydrated and keeping a piece of fruit or a light snack handy. Whenever I would foresee or feel a craving coming, I would drink water or juice or eat something and that would take the edge off the craving.

How will you kick ass this weekend? I will not drink with you today!

Unlimited margaritas on a work trip, or deciding to just have one and it devolving into a huge bender. I never minded them that much; sure I’d wake up feeling ashamed and upset, but I’d realize it was a dream and then I’d just be happy it wasn’t real. Sobriety’s on my mind, my dreams are working through the cognitive dissonance, and it seemed like a healthy way for my unconscious mind to work through a lot of issues.

I’ve had a couple “drinking dreams” in the last week though, and I’m starting to notice a new pattern:

One, I was on a date, and specifically threw down the law that I don’t drink anymore. I felt weird saying it, but I was holding myself to it with others. I didn’t drink.

The other was a bit more lengthy. I was at a hotel bar/restaurant in the morning, only person in the place, and when the waitress offered me water or coffee I asked if the bar was open. She laughed and said I looked much too young to drink even if they were, so I fished out my ID to prove I was in my 30s (admittedly I have a young face and the acne of a boy in puberty sometimes, so this falls pretty well in line with my actual bar experiences.)

After accusing me of it being a fake and much pleading on my part, dream waitress gave in and gave me a drink menu. I didn’t need it; I already knew I was getting a double vodka soda with lime...

But I didn’t. I felt guilty and sad that I was even thinking about it. I apologized to the waitress, said I really just wanted a plain water with lime and for her to acknowledge I wasn’t lying about my ID. I resolved not to drink, and dream me even whipped out my phone to come post here and celebrate my little victory with you all.

There was something about another waitress wandering around menacingly with a kitchen knife, but outside of whatever the hell metaphor that was, I woke up.

I like the idea of thinking that my subconscious is starting to line up with my conscious mind. Might be overdue for another read through of This Naked Mind to seal the deal on it, but I think after 90 days my realities are starting to mesh.

I'd been bullshitting myself: although I had successfully quit drinking for stretches of many months at a time, all the while, I'd been taking a benzodiazepene to manage panic attacks, and it wasn't quite a healthy relationship. A year and a half ago, I spoke to my GP about quitting and, because some GPs don't care to spend longer than fifteen minutes listening to their patients, I was told (basically) to man up and take care of it myself. Anyone who has struggled with benzos knows that this amounts to a death sentence.

And I very nearly died. Several ER visits. A trip to the ICU for three days. A trip to the PCU for three days. The nurses were absolutely lovely there, and took outstanding care of me. The physician there, however, took about five minutes to speak with me, prescribed the absolute wrong thing (Xanax) for an aspiring benzo survivor, and I wound up having to white-knuckle it for fifteen insane hours prior to my appointment with an addiction specialist. 

I showed up at the place in an exceptionally grave state, and it is a wonder that I was able to survive the ride to the facility. But I popped in, told the counselor *exactly* what had been going on, and to my absolute astonishment, she said: yes, of course we can help you; that's what we do here. 

Bada bing, bada boom. An hour later, I was fixed up with a medication to help me taper, and another to help me sleep -- something one loses the ability to do in the throes of withdrawal. One day later, and the anxiety is gone. The panic is gone. And for the first time in perhaps three years, I am starting to feel like myself again. 

I suppose the broader message here is: keep asking for help. If you can't find it -- if it takes you years on end -- keep seeking it out. Be honest with people. Explain the whole predicament. It may take some time, especially if you live in America, but if you are persistent, you can find help. Now, as I work my way forward on this new path that (one day ago) I was unaware even existed, I feel hopeful: again, not something I have felt in years. 

And a more practical bit of advice: never detox from benzodiazepenes (or alcohol, for that matter) on your own. I put myself in more danger than I ever should have, but I suppose that part of the problem was that I kept meeting medical dead ends. And yet, the will to live was stronger than anything else, and at long last: I found the help that I needed. 

To quote Robert Pirsig:  ""Trials never end, of course. Unhappiness and misfortune are bound to occur as long as people live, but there is a feeling now, that was  not here before, and is not just on the surface of things, but penetrates all the way through: We've won it. It’s going to get better now.  You can sort of tell these things.""

Much love, fellow passengers. I will not drink with you today, and I will not numb myself to the world any longer.

It sucks, but that's life for you. 

Over the last four years, I developed what I now recognize as an unsustainable, unhealthy drinking habit. It started off with binge drinking on Fridays and Saturdays as a freshman and, by the time this semester rolled around, I was going through a personal handle every three days or so, and that didn't even include drinks I had out at bars and clubs. I would start drinking as soon as I could each day and wouldn't stop until I passed out.

Around two weeks ago, when most of my friends were leaving for Spring Break, I decided to just stick around back in my college town and hang out with random locals. Cheaper drinks that way, I figured. And people I barely knew blurred in and out of my life for a couple weeks - I couldn't even tell you most of their names. But, noticeably, as the quarantine started, fewer and fewer people came around. A week ago, I woke up in bed next to some girl I'd never met before, and since she left I've been totally alone, save for my fish and the occasional delivery driver.

Now that the quarantine's around, it's given way to a lot of private reflection. I realize just how lonely my life has become. I think back on all the various, meaningful relationships and friendships I've ruined due to drinking, and it fills me with so much self-hatred and loathing. Hell, even my own parents and I are barely on speaking terms right now due to some issues we had last Summer. 

I recognize now that I have to change. I haven't drank for the last three days, my longest streak in ~2 years, and I want to see just how far I can push that on my first try. The withdrawals have been awful so far: I've had a constant headache, I wake up sweaty each day, I'm constantly getting the chills. I threw up in the mornings for three straight days before I stopped drinking due to just being hungover; by the third day, I was throwing up blood, too. But I'm doing my best to take care of myself and keep pushing on.

I know that I have to get out of this college town before I fall back into the same old habits I had before. It's not currently realistic for me to move back in with my parents due to our aforementioned issues, so I talked to my grandparents today and I'm going to move in with them and dry out for a while. I've already told them about my desire to stay sober and they've promised to stay by my side and hold me accountable.

I just read an article on nytimes which included a video of a doctor from a hospital in Elmhurst, NYC, where they've got barely got any fibrilators, no beds, set up tents outside and just pulled up a freezer truck. The very epicenter of this thing. The very same hospital I passed by regularly growing up, the one I got taken to when I broke my forehead, the very same that my sister, who I don't have the best relationship with, but obvs something still cares, works at. 

I'm scared about her well being, my niece's wellbeing and even the fuck face who attacked me for being queer when I was 15, and whom she decided to marry couple of years after.

I'm scared about the well being of the woman I want to marry who is now self isolating only a few miles away from that hospital, and the man I had the closest thing to a marriage in the states back then when I was there , a domestic partnership.

I'm scared about his mom, who is the only woman I'll call 'mommie', and I'm scared for countless others I have come to know in that wonderful place I was privilaged to grow up in. 

I feel helpless. I know that is the feeling that most of us must be feeling. This is everywhere. But my sobriety helps me deal with this anxiety pandemic. Earlier in the day I said to someone: why worry about something you can't control? I can't even take my own advice. 

I will not drink today, but I am not okay. I will not add fuel to this crisis. I will not damage my physical and mental health in this time when we have got a virus that can affect us physically and the most sensible thing each individual can do is, isolate, the mental health enemy number one for any addict.

In fact in the past three years (where my drinking has steadily increased) I’ve read Annie Grace, Bex Weller, Jason Vale, Martha Grimes, Augusten Burroughs, the woman who wrote “Drunk Mom” and a host of other quit-lit.  Often, reading while drinking and putting off not drinking.   Similar to how I would, as a chubby kid, linger over the “before and after” weight loss stories in my mother’s Women’s Day magazines (she was not a reader but was a perpetually failing dieter) while snacking on peanut butter and cheese sandwiches — ungodly but true — snacking because it felt so good, understanding but deliberately not thinking right then about consequences, hoping I could get thinner by osmosis.

2020-03-26 16:28:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fpizip/one_year_today/,One Year Today!,"For a second, I thought I missed it, but Leap Year gave me an extra day.  

That year went by FAST!  At first, the days were ticking by so slow.  For around 20 years, I drank regularly - missing at best 1-2 nights a week only if I was too tired to even drink, or if I chose some edibles instead - for at least the last 10 years.  Since I was in my early 20's, I only went more than a week without drinking once, and that was because it was court ordered.  I'm a functioning drunk though - I only ever drink hard once the wife and kids are in bed.  Wife and I sleep in different rooms so it's easy.  The only thing I might do earlier is a few beers, but that's it - and never at inappropriate times.  At night, I'd have the same amount most nights, and most days I could function just fine.  I've actually done rather well in my professional life, despite.  

With enough time, it took its toll.  One year ago today, I was in bad shape - feeling really sick each day - super depressed, and though I don't believe in outright taking my life, I think a part of me was hoping the drinking would do it for me - then my kids wouldn't think of it as throwing in the towel as much as succumbing to a sickness.  I'm pretty sure if I hadn't stopped, I might not have made it through this year.

Finally, a part of me though wanted more for my young kids - and figured I needed to start doing better... I was starting to be healthier in my eating and exercising.  I was losing weight through Keto while still drinking.  However, that was messing with how I metabolized it - so one night, I drank a bit much; it was hitting me more slowly, so I consumed more before passing out.  Woke up still kinda drunk - later in the day, I started drinking during the work day which is really out of character (probably important to note that I work from home!).  That's about all I remember.  Next day, wife didn't talk to me for like 4 days then left town for another week - we went a good 2 weeks without talking, and to this day haven't talked about whatever the hell happened that week.  I'm not sure I want to know - but I was super frustrated with her, hating my marriage, and just wanting some sort of escape.

Well, I quit that next day... actually lost a bunch of weight and was doing great, but the rapid weight loss landed me in the hospital with gallstones which caused pancreatitis.  Ironic - I've read that if I'd kept drinking, that wouldn't have happened; had I not lost weight quickly, that wouldn't have happened.

Ever since then, I haven't been able to lose weight - I'm putting it on quickly the way I do when I drink heavily.  I think it's because I never used to eat sugar or drink soda; ever since I quit, those cravings have been out of control.  Also weird - probably going to turn me into a Type 2 diabetic if I don't fix it soon!

I could go on about what I've felt and what it's like - but for now I'll stick with the 1 year accomplishment.  I've wanted to drink very often since... and going through this pandemic has pushed me harder than anything before.   I haven't convinced myself this is permanent yet - I may end up trying some light drinking and ultimately learning it has to be permanent.

I had a drink to piss her off but in the end I hurt myself in the process.

I do have kind of flu feelings but that could be down to the bad sleep and a full tummy (and not having any fresh air).

I was up to one and a half bottles of red wine a day when I decided it was ridiculous and definitely not normal drinking.  I'm not sure yet if I'm going to give up forever but I'll see how it goes.

I did mention to a counsellor about the amount I was drinking and she said it could be situational, having left a decades long abusive relationship - I used it as an escape from the endless insiduous abuse and resulting zero self respect and self doubt.  It was my anaesthetic - when I was numb the names and insults and the endless endless silent treatments didn't hurt as much.

So, I'm giving it a miss for a while and I'll see how it goes.  I think that yesterday's decision was difficult is enough reason to have a think about everything.

Once, I made it 90 days but I convinced myself that actually quitting is weak so I convinced myself to start drinking again. My goal has always been moderation but last night something clicked as I was hiding the second empty bottle of wine I drank... alcohol is my mask. 

I continue thinking I could eventually be one of those guys who has just one drink and hangs out but I can't. Alcohol is my mask. The thought of being around people (even the ones I love the most) without my mask is terrifying. I don't think people will like me. I don't think I deserve my wife, my friends, or my family. I think the longer I'm around them without my mask the more they'll start to realize that I'm not worthy of their time. I'm just not enough.

Luckily there's a liquor store down the street and any time I need it I can go get my mask. I'm funnier with the mask, I'm happier with my mask, I'm THE REAL ME with my mask... then I wake up in bed not knowing how I got there or how late I stayed up. I don't remember sitting on the couch for 20 minutes just staring at the wall because I realize it's the alcohol making me feel like shit but it also makes me feel better and if I could just figure this formula out and drink the perfect amount I could be the perfect version of myself without going overboard.

The problem is I can't. I go overboard everytime and I'm starting over again trying to just not drink long enough that I can be the real, sober me again.

As of today, I have lost 12 pounds by not drinking. My face is less round and bloated. 

I did the math this morning and I have saved $243 so far from sobriety. That’s enough to pay for my electric, gas, water, and garbage bills with some to spare! 

I’ve got more time in the evening to do things now that I’m not immediately getting inebriated after work. I’ve even picked up my dusty guitar again! 

I have an interstate commercial drivers license for work and the state I live in holds CDL holders to a higher standard of sobriety. Even if I’m driving a car and not in a semi, my legal BAC is 0.04, or HALF of the normal legal limit. I’m no longer afraid to get a DUI after having a beer while out at dinner.

(Article I wrote for Medium),"Hey guys, I wanted to share my article as a new, fledgling blogger. Please feel free to comment within that link, or here, because I will reproduce below. Enjoy!

[https://medium.com/@soberjake/alcohol-a-bizarre-story-918afb4afc55](https://medium.com/@bradstout1/alcohol-a-bizarre-story-918afb4afc55)

\------------------------------------

The concept of alcohol is an amazing one, when you decompose it. The booze that we drink is called **ethanol**. Two carbons, six hydrogens, one oxygen. Seems harmless enough — rearrange some of those atoms and you have simple table sugar! At least, if my recollection from college Chemistry proves reliable.

I found that on Wikipedia, and out of sheer curiosity, I read on. Uses: antiseptic. It causes cell dehydration and ultimately cell death. Fair enough. Recreational. We’ll come back to that. *Engine fuel.* Apparently in varying quantities, cars can drive on it. It’s the largest single use of ethanol.

Now, before you start dumping Everclear into your gas tank, let’s meditate on ethanol’s ubiquity in society. Given the preceding knowledge, it’s fascinating that the human consumption of part-time cell executioner, part-time engine fuel (forget its deleterious effects on society for a moment) is a normalized aspect of modern society.

Living in a major city, I can close my eyes, spin in a circle, start walking, and hey presto I’ll run into a purveyor of ethanol. It’s in grocery stores, a few aisles down from carrots, bananas, and other significantly less cytotoxic staples. Then there’s the neighborhood dive bar, where people pay a premium on these beverages for the privilege of sitting near each other. Wine tastings, where snooty people pretend to taste notes of chocolate and cherries over the 10% ethanol (which, notably, is the ethanol content of most gasolines).

And by golly, these are entire industries, and profitable ones at that. What’s going on, here?

**Oh right! It’s a psychoactive recreational drug, and has been for over ten thousand years.**

Beverage ethanol (have to use ‘beverage’ so you think of fruity concoctions with an umbrella, and not your local filling station) has an interesting bi-phasal effect. In small doses, the jump-start of dopamine and GABA facilitate heightened mood, sociability, and inhibition. This combined with an opioid response manipulate the reward and learning pathways in the brain. (Can you see where I’m headed already?)

In larger doses, the central nervous system becomes impaired. The executive functioning of the brain worsens, leading to uncharacteristic behavior. Motor skills deteriorate, memory formation shuts down (the ol’ blackout), and eventually breathing becomes shallow. Finally, the result can be coma or death, nevermind accidents such as asphyxiation on vomit. Hangovers are the reeling aftermath of a body struggling to purge itself of the self-induced onslaught of toxins.

Okay, so who’s ready for a wine tasting?

Really though, it’s fascinating to think about. We dress up and glamorize the measured self-intoxication and self-impairment by means of a Class 1 carcinogen that, when over-consumed, shatters concern for your well-being, the welfare of others, and eventually will cease your life-dependent autonomic processes.

It’s a social rite, and for some the necessary backdrop of meeting strangers or even functioning in society. Mommy time, am I right? For a select minority, like me, it has even more deeply insidious effects.

**The solution to, and cause of, life’s biggest problems.**

In 2010, *The Economist* ranked the societal damage of each drug, illicit or otherwise, and guess who was crowned Miss America? Nearly half of all murder, violence against police, and over half of all domestic violence involve a happy hour gone too far. Not only does it cause the most overall damage, but it by far causes the most damage to others.

For a lucky ten percent or so of people (including me!), varying based on ethnic background, we have an even more exciting byproduct to explore: alcoholism. Science doesn’t fully understand why, but certain people have the predisposition of taking too much when most people would slow down or stop.

Now, it’s awfully Freudian to blame one’s parents for everything, but my dad is or was a raging, abusive alcoholic. I don’t know him and have not seen him since being a toddler. In and out of jail, skipping out on child support, unable to hold a job — society has no sympathy for such bedeviled souls.

As much destruction as he caused, part of me is sympathetic, for I too show glimmers of such a predisposition. Now, my story is far more tame, but I’ve known for a long time that one drink sets off a Rube Goldberg machine leading to the next and to the next.

In upcoming articles I will explore this discovery and the mysterious connection and entanglement with self-awareness, self-discovery, spirituality and finding oneself. This treatise on alcohol was necessary, however, because a common theme will be the sheer objective collective delusional insanity that becomes obvious when you really, truly, examine alcohol.",22,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8927513957023621}"

I had already decided this last week, but I didn't know when the moment would come. Well, it did, yesterday morning. In a haze I dumped out almost everything I had (and I'm lucky I did so because it would have been much harder today), and 5 minutes ago I threw out the rest I didn't get rid of yesterday. Then I went to bed and fell asleep.. until now.

But now, I feel... weird? I slept for 24hrs almost nonstop, so I'm over a day clean without any effort it seems. I feel rested, I had some crazy sweaty dreams which also signal some form of recovery process I'm going through. And now the day is just like any other day, only I will not pick up. I guess it will get harder the later in the day it gets. 

Anyway, just wanted to share my story I guess. I'm here. I'm anxious. I'm scared. I know it's all in my hands and with the quarantine going on, it's easier than ever to motivate myself to stay home. Everything just feels.. weird. As if I'm living on a frequency just below or above where everyone else is. I don't know what to make of it. I'll start with a shower, I guess.

Previously, I had an extremely extensive, successful sales career that I managed to flush down the toilet when I started drinking heavily throughout my moms terminal illness and subsequent passing.
After my mom passed, my Dad passed in a similar fashion a year later. 

Fast forward to the night before Thanksgiving of 2019, when I picked up two guys at a hotel downtown. I immediately asked one of them if the drink he brought into my car contained alcohol? He said no, we’re both in recovery bro. 

Turns out they were in town from Canada for the Bills- Cowboys game the next day that I had been contemplating going to since I’m also a huge Bills fan.  In a 3 mile trip to a comedy club where I dropped them off, I briefly told them my story, and desire to go to the game and eventually quit drinking again. desire to quit again.
We agreed to talk in the am to see if I was gonna drink, not go to the game , or meet up. 

Upon waking up, I decided that I was done drinking and that I’d met these two for a reason (some higher power shit) Both Bills fans, relatable to me, with 7 and 5 years of sobriety respectively, and one was the others sponsor, and I was driving Uber.

We went to the game, had dinner afterwards,  and hit up a high school football game the following day and topped that off with some BBQ that evening. (Up until this point, I hadn’t been out of the house for pleasure since my parents passings)

Meeting these two was truly a miracle. The entire time we spent together was like a very informal meeting, and our stories were so similar, it was definitely a god thing.
guys . 

Since their departure we’ve kept in touch, I’ve been going to meetings, got a temporary sponsor, and then a real one the day before this virus hit the fan .

During these 120 days , things have been improving and my desire to drink is gone . However the last 3 weeks have been nothing but a series of small mind fields, that I would typically use as an excuse to drink over but didn’t .

Then two days ago my Roomate / landlord and I were casually talking, and she’s all about this virus being a hoax. I went outside to my car to retrieve something to continue our conversation, and my remotes not unlocking my car or trunk?

So I returned inside to continue our conversation, and tell her about my car. Out of nowhere, she says maybe this is a “sign”?, I’m like a sign of what? And she says a sign you shouldn’t be driving Uber anymore until this blues over. and you don’t infect both of us .

Now I’m seriously lost, first it’s a “hoax” and now it’s gone to a fear of me infecting her? Now the conversation goes completely sideways and I do my best to stay calm, but she goes completely (almost drug induced) crazy.

Sparing the remaining details, yesterday she gives me a notice to vacate, with a 30 day notice, (I’m on a month to month lease)

Now, the uncertainty in my life is about as high as it can get, (another major trigger for me) I’ve got to find a new place to live in the middle of a State of Emergency and Uber and Lyft’s business has gone down the drain.

If I were ever going to pick up a drink it’d be right now. The greatest thing is, that isn’t even the smallest thought. I’m so grateful for having met my two new friends, who were here on vacation and whom took time to hang out with me this past Thanksgiving to show me the way .

Anyway my point is, this program is a true blessing and on any given day you’ll never know who you’ll meet, so be kind, especially during these tough times. 

Now the tough part, finding a suitable place to live given the pandemic craze and Stay in shelter lockdown. It’s a blessing that I’m not broke. I’m confident that this has happened for a reason, and that it is a necessary piece of my recovery process that will be revealed in due time .

Thanks for listening, and for anyone behind me, remember there’s Never a “good” reason to drink! This too shall pass. And most importantly, be safe out there and take it a minute at a time if you have to.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

2020-03-26 03:05:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fp726o/dreams_nightmares/,Dreams & Nightmares,"So today was my first day not drinking in a long time and I just finally woke up out of a horrible nightmare. Has anyone experienced an increase in dreams/nightmares after quitting alcohol? I assume this would be fairly common because (if I remember correctly) alcohol use causes you to sleep less restfully and dreams occur during the most restful type of sleep. 

If you have a  “newbie sober dreamer” dream you want to share drop it here! Mine:

Mine was pretty much all my fears & anxieties but alcohol wrapped into one. In the dream: So basically, I woke up, in the same pjs I’m wearing tonight, with my child (that normally doesn’t sleep with me) next to me, cat at my feet. Feels normal. Except for some reason I have my husband’s (we’re separated) phone. I start attempting to go through in and the cat starts screeching and running super circles across the room. I put the phone down and can hear someone trying to break in. Of course I’m scared at this point, so I wake my son up, shove him in my closet and start to quietly & quickly gather the other kids to hide them. Then I attempt to dial the police, but of course the phone call won’t go through. 

At this point I actually wake up. And then immediately fall back asleep and restart the dream. Wake up, notice husband’s phone, but this time time the dog is on the bed with me, which isn’t allowed, but I didn’t think anything of it. He starts snarling and snapping at me, while kid has awoken and is losing his mind, so I kind of push dog off and put him in some sort of chokehold. This time I notice a “tell”, the light I left on in the living room -and noticed every time I woke up - is now off. I’m in a dream! I’m sure, but I’m also kind of worried that although I’m dreaming I could be acting it out in real life. So I let go of the dog and immediately start trying to wake myself up. I do and then right back to sleep. 

The next dream restart just felt wrong. Like the air was charged or something. It’s pitch black and something is slinking around in my room that I can’t identify. I try to ignore it and actually cover my head up but I can feel it brush past me, like it’s a semi solid that’s floating over me. So, I internally freak out & wake kid up quietly. We are attempting to sneak past this demon-like thing without it noticing us (think A Quiet Place movie). I get to the door it notices us. I look at it. It’s as tall as the ceiling, fangs, inky looking, evil eyes, and it starts coming towards us. I try the lights. They don’t work. I try another set of switches and nothing. We’re running around, bumping into everything, and just barely escaping, and I wake up. 

This cycle repeated itself about 15 more times. Sometimes the situations were absurd, sometimes they were terrifying. Finally, in the last one I wake, go to the kitchen for water and husband is standing there with an umbrella. It starts pouring outside. He motions me to follow him and leads me to the backdoor, which we go out. 

I wake up again and this time can stay awake long enough to walk around, which in my experience, helps to keep the dream from restarting again. But I’m still a little nervous about going back to sleep, so I’m here instead, typing you all up a natural sleep aid.",14,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9988783001899719}"

Love it. And the subs mission statement's exclusion of the term ""alcoholic"" first caught my eye a few years ago when I first joined, so I wanted to ask around for some opinions here too.

Some quick background, I have been a member of AA in the past, and was in a 3 month residential treatment program which was 12-step, to which I truly appreciated. I have the utmost respect for the program, and miss so many elements of it, including some great people, but I am no longer a member, because of this term I don't wish to live my life by. I no longer identify as an alcoholic. I find the term to be self-defeating. My current mentality is that I am no longer an alcoholic, because I do not drink. I am a sober person, who had a drinking problem. If I was a type II diabetic who managed to lose 50 lbs through healthy choices, I would no longer be a diabetic. I know that if I started those same habits, I would risk it all and likely become one again. 

I know that these thoughts aren't original, but wanted to see if they are in a healthy thought process, or is it my brain trying to justify something. With all that said, my current sobriety is very peaceful. I don't count days like I used to, and I don't crave it. It rarely crosses my mind. Nothing like before, and far less than when I was in the program. I always appreciate the feedback of this group over the last 4 or 5 years, so thank you in advance.

7 years ago the shrink said Ben you have mild depression 

I was 2 years out of High School

I remember walking out of the psych's office with my tail between my legs 

I had a lot of negative thoughts circulating my mind there was a lot emotional tension in the air that day

I was going through some of the darkest moments of my life back then

I had my pro goalkeeper dream taken away from me from snapping my ankle

I had quit my sales job cold calling people, to deal with my mental health

I wasn't completely miserable, but I knew there was some untapped potential there... but wasn't clear to me yet...

2 months after my visit, I got a phone call from the shrink

""Ben, we've heard you aren't doing well when can you come in for another visit, your mum concerned about you. We have some medication that might be able to help you""

SSRI's I vowed that I'd never take medication of any sort, and felt it in myself I could manage and handle it on my own

From this point in my life was one of the greatest breakthroughs and high pressure moments

I felt that is was on all me, stress was making stronger and grow quicker.

Clammy hands, tightness in my chest, disorientated vision for the future, reactive emotions...

Yep I felt it

My sleeping was unbearable, nightmares, restlessness,  I got down to 66kg/145lbs

Life was on a downward spiral every invitation to forget about my problems I agreed.

Do you know the feeling?

Partying drinking loads of Jagerbombs having large I thought I was living my best life.

I had some wild nights, I'd come home stare at the ceiling my ears still ringing

But when the social comfort dissipated it was me with my thoughts.

I had everyone saying just go and study Ben, just go back to your sales job, just do this blah blah blah

I know most of them meant well with their unsolicited advice, but my internal drive was much the opposite 

I thought back to year 12, when I was doing history revolutions class, and my history teacher Mr Selleck said the definition of mad is ""Mutually Assured Destruction"" and if you keep doing the same thing over and over & expect a different result you define ""madness""

It was clear I was unhappy, and I wanted to make a change and didn't want to be mad at myself & others anymore 

I kept thinking & overthinking what is my focus? What is my vision? 

Then something hit me harder than when I punched my wall in out of frustration one night

I still remember being on the ground, scrunched up face, gripping my hair, bowing down in an absolute fit of rage

""That's it, I over feeling sorry for myself""

A gym opened up right near the train station, I popped in and met an optimistic bloke called Chris he offered me a trial

This was a sign from the universe, what you choose to believe in god, infinite intelligence...

I remember feeling like it all made sense, but the self loathing kicked in and I declined the offer...

""Well if you change your mind, our offer ends in 1 week from now""

I walked home that day, thinking like Golum and Smeagol ""Stupid BJ, why does he always ruins it""

Like some guy with schizophrenia 

My brain & my heart where in opposition with each other, my brain would say

""BJ you aren't smart enough, good looking enough, talented enough, gifted enough, you don't deserve to be comfortable in your skin""

Then my heart would say

""BJ you have always been an athlete, you have always wanted to make a difference in people's lives, you should get out of your comfort zone and do it!""

I had to confront my deepest insecurities and grasp that pain of ""I am enough""

Letting go of an old identity of how I used to be

Embracing a new identity that was my new story

Was the hardest moment of my life 

Forgetting about the chronic drinker, cigarette smoker, the disorganized, drug user, insomniac

Fast forward a couple of months, my sleep improved, my skin cleared up and felt a glimmer of confidence

My glow was dim, but lighting up

I noticed changes in my weight, after 12 weeks of bulking (the dirty way) I hit 80kg looked like shit, but a big win for me

My diet improved I started waking up earlier without the need for an alarm

I got accepted into my Osteopathic degree and majored in Anatomy & Physiology with Health Science

I spent more quality time with the people I loved, and started to enjoy socializing again 

The biggest growth I got from training in the gym, eating healthy and bulletproof mindset

People started commenting, hating or liking

It didn't matter people started to see the transformation in me

It was overwhelming, more interest from girls, more interest from guys (lol) the people wanted to know

""What are you doing differently?""

It was January 2013 a hot summers day in Melbourne Australia, I remember walking down the street girls started to notice me

It was unreal, like a tracker beam towards me

I never felt this level of recognition before

Coming from a skinny 66kg/145lbs kid with low crippling low self esteem, to attractive women

It blew my mind

My 2 years of development was paying dividends, but I didn't do it for others I did it for me

That shift of this was a growth period in my life, and there would be plenty more like this changed the game for me

Life was never about the destination, but the journey there

16/08/2015 BJF was born, the goal to impact 1000's of busy working professionals to lose 20lbs & gain 10lbs of muscle 

This moment I knew Body Transformations was my life's purpose 

It’s been painful. Very, very painful both mentally and emotionally. 

I wouldn't have found this without that pain in my life

We spoke this morning, it was an odd conversation where she would barely say anything but was still on the line. It was getting the silent treatment over the phone which is strange. The only thing she  would do was ask me why I was able to get sober this time and none of the other times, to call her again when I am 1 year sober and that I am free to date someone else, and that she may do the same.

I still have a session with my therapist on Friday... I am going to try and stick with this but I am starting to think there are other issues going on in my marriage besides my drinking. I mean the drinking didn't help but... I guess I had initial clarity and now I am less sure about why I am doing this other than for my health and getting my career back on track.

It's all over movies, TV, it's totally normalized.

2020-03-25 20:14:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fp1gpk/coronavirus_blues_a_secret/,Coronavirus blues & a secret,"I worry a lot. Obsessively, ridiculously a lot. I’m a perfectionist & people pleaser who recently enforced the idea of boundaries in my life. I hear people with healthy self esteems have those so I acquired them. Feeling pretty good about things too. Anyway, I let myself get all worked up worrying, over nothing usually... I guess is just the general state of things with the coronavirus adding to my every day er, now nothingness. I don’t go out a lot. Have a few good friends I see from time to time but most of my social interaction is at work. By the time I leave, I’m ready to go be alone at home with my dogs-good & away from the needy people I adore for today thx, bye! And so it normally goes... 

Now. My work is not closed, but I have leave. I’ve been working from home some, going there once a week or so-probably not this week. I’m high risk (asthma, COPD) so been staying away & it’s not *been found* in my county yet but I did get a “you may have been exposed to the person who works next door” email & am awaiting said persons test results. Don’t know if I touched something after them nor remember riding an elevator with them but I guess it’s in my building. I’m not really worried about it although I am hypochondriac-ish anyway & don’t usually use water fountains (or walk over grates, see where I’m going with this? It’s nothing anyone would usually notice but yeah it’s how I am). Sorry, I digress.. I hope I’m fine bc I haven’t been there much & am careful there. Glad I haven’t gone but I miss going to work. I miss being in charge, saving people’s day & just doing my thing. I guess everyone does but ugh. I wish they’d just close already. Where I work? I feel it has GOT to be there bc the people are from all over the globe. 

Back to my worry. I worry that my bosses will be mad, that I will run out of leave, that they may not have enough work for me to do at home, etc. None of these things will likely happen but.. I’m a well known worrier to my close friends. It kinda sucks. Right now, there are a lot of things I can’t control & it’s just damn irritating. Since I quit drinking I’ve handled what I thought was some of the worst crap ever, acquired boundaries, have been feeling strong about things, life is going so well & ... cue a lung killing pandemic. WHAT? 

I’m just reminding myself how things could have been worse. Wow, If I hadn’t already done this or that & was doing that now, that would’ve been bad. Whew. I’m fortunate that I have great health insurance & perks in a salaried non-corporate job & a reasonably flexible schedule. I have 2 bosses. One that I can easily work at home for & one who is thinking of something I can do. The attitude of gratitude. I’m trying to hold onto that. There are many who are not as fortunate as I am & I feel like a bad person for worrying but I do. Yes, I even worry about worrying. 

Now for why I’m posting all this. Intellectually, I don’t want a drink but for the first time in almost a year (quit last May 28), I’ve looked at the drinks in my friends hands a little too long. I half wanted a sip. I’ve noticed the beer or wine in people’s overfilled shopping carts. I half wanted to buy just one bottle. I dismiss the half thought but I can’t really deny that its there. I’d like to & have been denying those thoughts are there but I’m thinking that may not be helpful. So there, I’ve said it. I see you alcohol. You may tempt me but I know that you lie. You will not make me feel a damn bit better & certainly will not be helpful in any way. Especially now. Lots of people probably feel like I do do & there is no need in my even considering having a dang drink. I must remember that you will destroy me if I do. You have already come close. Rant over but I still don’t like admitting this bc I KNOW better!

I feel like I've made progress with my addiction to alcohol but the rest of my life problems are now front and center. I began my sobriety when my ex broke up with me, more or less due to my drinking and inability to get back to work. The sad part is that we were actually in love, but my failure to find steady employment or show her any sense of financial security made our future seem bleak and uncertain, rightfully so. After reaching 100 days I tried begging for a second chance, but then it became clear to me that even though I can promise her I'll remain sober, my shitty life circumstances and situation with my career still remain.

I guess I just forgot that getting sober is just the beginning of my journey. The only way I feel that I can fix these problems in my life is if I approach every day with a sober mind and a positive attitude. If I was still drinking, my problems wouldn't disappear, they would only get worse. I need to do this to get back to work and get my life back on track.

I just wanted to share a small daily moment that’s become special to me since I stopped drinking. My oldest son is 2, and since he was born I’ve sang “You’ve Got a Friend in Me” to him at bedtime while we snuggle. There’s a part that goes:

*You’ve got troubles*

*I’ve got ‘em too*

*There isn’t anything I wouldn’t do for you*

There was always this nagging guilt when I sang that last line, because I knew it wasn’t true as long as I was still drinking. Since I stopped, what a relief it is knowing I’m fundamentally changing the course of my kids’ lives by being a sober, present mom. It’s heartbreaking reading so many of your stories about growing up with an alcoholic parent. Everyone deserves a childhood where they feel loved and protected, not worried about what version of Mom they’ll get after 5PM. As long as I stay sober, I’m not just telling my kids there isn’t anything I wouldn’t do for them - I’m showing them.

I’ve teared up a few times looking through recent posts and just cried reading some stories on my sobriety counter app. I’m 19 and most of my friends are still in the stage of drinking all the time because their bodies can support it but I found myself not being able to control my drinking, going out for a bottle of whiskey every night and falling into a frenzy if I didn’t leave before the one store that doesn’t card me was already closed. I can’t count how many times I’ve broken down 10 minutes before they close and flew to the store to panic buy a bottle and drink it alone in my room.

I realized I’m a completely different person when I drink and I hate that guy and I can’t let anyone see him anymore. He has to starve to death inside of me. That night was the tipping point , and as of this morning I’m a month and 27 days sober , and 6.5 months free of marijuana! Not a lot but I’m getting there.

I’m pretty sure I’m gonna end up drinking once I get there , I’m just afraid it’ll slip way out of control like it often does. I make a habit out of everything , nicotine, weed, porn , sugar , I’m just hoping I can exert the self-discipline to stay dry while I’m there.

I really, really want to be better. I want this to be my last day one. I'm so sick of this. Spent all day at work feeling miserable with my head just pounding, but it's never enough to get me to stop. I hate this...

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

When I stopped drinking, I felt I was given a new lease on life. Funny thing is, I didn’t even know I needed it! I knew I was doing pretty bad and kept missing out on stuff - but I thought that was just how it had to be. When I quit I desperately wanted to get my headspace back, but I got so much more that I hadn’t even noticed that I’d lost on the way. Sleep and digestion improved, I got to rediscover joys and passions, know my own thoughts and emotions, heal and mature. If someone told me, I wouldn´t have believed them. Oh wait - the oldies here *did* tell me! Turns out they were right all along! Sobriety isn´t painless, but it´s so much better.

Newbies - what do you want? Oldies - what did you get?

Those with elderly parents fear for their lives, those with children fear for their future, and then the selfish fear for not being able to play sports, go out to the bar or take a walk. Food stores here can sell alcohol, beer, wine and even liquor. I buy a type of mixed rye-wheat bread from a very popular shop in my neighbourhood where the owner confesses to me that she has sold in one week all the alcohol she usually sold in a month. After 21 months without drinking I discovered that I was a social drinker, to integrate and that stopping drinking gave me back a part of me that I don't like very much ( I have become more serious and anodyne ) but it is real. We've been in quarantine for ten days now and the effects of people not being able to go out drinking are being felt, and they're going to be felt more with every day that passes and the news gets deadlier. In the end this has been experienced more times. Whatever you do, if you do not drink in isolation, if you drink again, if you are nervous or if you find it difficult, remember that we are human, that no one knows what to do when things are difficult, but also think that this difficult time would be much worse if we had not stopped drinking.

I can’t imagine the abyss I would’ve ended up in, if I was drinking through this Corona virus. 

I would have feared running out, so I would  have stock piled a ton of booze. It would’ve been amazing to see 2  weeks worth of liquor be gone in a few days. 

I would have found some of the pain; anxiety and depression would go away for an hour or two every night, only to come back three fold; plus a hangover. 

Isolating was a way of life for me, back in the day, this would have just been a green light, to not even care a little bit; it would’ve been a greenlight to get loaded 24/7… Yikes

I drive past the bottle shops and see people coming out with box’s of grog, knowing their pain is real. Those with boxs of Vodka are really feeling the pain I am sure; they are in deep. 

I just thank my lucky stars, I was able to quit almost 31/2 years ago, I would not have come out of this in very good shape. 

I hope everyone is well and getting through this OK. It’s hard I know, but not as hard as it is if you are drinking. Just get through today, then tomorrow, then the next day. Keep moving forward, keep reading, keep posting and keep commenting; it helps. 

Keep “clean” and safe people.

Looks like it's time to go cold turkey. How should I prep?,"I've gotten wasted every night for about 3 years. I've been preparing to quit for a few months ever since a scary liver enzyme test result, and have significantly reduced my intake in preparation, but am still drinking a pint of gin each night. I have excellent insurance (MassHealth) and planned to finish off my detox at a nearby inpatient center that specializes in this, but that's no longer an option given the virus. I also feel like the ER is off limits due to the virus.

My doctor just emailed me and basically said, ""Detox immediately or I'll stop writing your prescriptions."" She and I had initially planned a tapering-down schedule, but she seems to have gotten quite concerned about my health and needs me to stop drinking immediately. As in tomorrow.

So, people who've been there before, how should I prepare? I live alone and no family members or friends can come by to take care of me, although we can speak on the phone or video chat. I'm well stocked on food, toilet paper, meds, and other essentials, and Mom is willing to drop groceries and meds by my door if detox lasts for weeks or months. Two of my prescriptions--Valium, which should help deter potential seizures, and Suboxone, which should help with pain--will come in handy.

What should I expect in terms of symptoms? What will be the worst aspects, and how can I ameliorate them? Are there any foods, supplements, or anything else that might help with the suffering? I'm really scared. Please chime in with anything that you think might be helpful. I really don't need any ""You can do it!"" type replies or anything like ""Stay strong, brother. I won't drink with you today."" What I need is straight-up advice, warnings, resources, and so on.

I hope this can hit someone so they do not follow my same fate.,"I'm here to start over. I had been sober 3months - 10weeks - 2 months at times during the last 2 and a half years. 2 weeks sober here and there. We all been there. I been heavy drinking vodka for years. Recently id consume a litre and upto a handle of vodka within 24hours. No sleep, no eating. On more serious benders.. psssft idk how i'm alive.
 Going to the liquor room at my work drinking a whole handle of vodka and then some more! within a day and aslo doing coke. 

The last 6 weeks. I went from a job making 75k a year as a Manager of a steakhouse, to jobless. 200+k in stocks to 194$ today. My wife has left me, attempted suicide. Slept on trains, under random apartment building stairwells till im kicked out. Balloooned!! in weight to 250+ and i hardly even eat, im sure its my liver and organs swollen. I'm in a fair amount of pain. I'm distraught, crying, alone and just at a loss. I have a handful of very good friends..most far away that cant help me as of right now. It's selfish and annoying for me to ask because of my mistakes. I was doing well this last 2 years till my wife came back from vegas from a trip i paid for with hickys and then lied to my face..until she told me. Anyway long story short. 

I'm a blackout every day drunk. I would'nt stop until i was blackout and then would somehow id wake up next to a freshly opened bottle or a stack of beers all opened and half full maybe sweet nnsour chicken all over my bed. I was given multiple chances but i just couldnt resist. I was powerless. My friends, my ex who i was staying with and the owner of the restaurant kept giving me chance after chance. I now cannot leave the house without being flusterd, aggrivated and angry. I have to drink, i would walk the opposite way of the liquor stores to only be in a constant war with myself until i inevitable drank or started crying and would go home. i started not going to work because i knew id find anyway to drink. I have no idea why i couldnt stop, i kind of didnt want to. I just lost all care.. i cant explain it. I dont know what to do anymore. I'm 72hours exactly this hour since my last drink where my ex found me passed out in the streets with a 750ml of vodka near a store i had been hanging out by for the last few days because i could sit in there and drink and forget about my problems. 

I've been a drunk for well over 16years and i'm 32 in June. The longest i been sober was of july 2019-october2019 the last 16years. I was about to just to delete this giant text of rambling..but i really hope someone out there doesnt make the mistake and somehow understands this last bit of text. The way alcohol can make you think your thoughts are your own are absolutly devistating. I ignore my own inner voice in favour of being someone im not when im drunk where im bubbly, sarcastic, an asshole, and everyone else i pretend to be. The alcohol stays with you for days after aswell. They don't called liquor, Spirits in certain societys for no reason. This stuff brings the evil spirits with it, sleep paralysis and the evil visions and dreams. I really wish the best for everyone. I will have to be stronger than ever to get through this now.

Regardless, everything else is on hold because of the stay in place order here so while I invited her to talk tonight, I know she has work too. My mood is much better and I slept through the night last night, all things considered, I feel a lot better about the future and about the potential we could reconcile.

And wow, speaking of work. The place I work is very busy but short handed. We are still having new hires and trying to cross-train them to keep things moving.

Racked up 10 years in my 30's, was active in AA/NA and had a wife, family, doggies, picket fence and a great government career, even 13th stepped the wife. When the kid got older we got complacent, slowly stopped going to meetings and slipped back into the life, slowly, at first, took around 7 years to completely go off the rails. When we separated I lost all faculties and went into a hole that I've been in ever since.

Last year, my mom (the only family I had left) died after a prolonged, awful illness that I was there, every day, to witness. On the floor of her hospital room I was 'the puking guy.' I constantly had to leave her room to go  in the hallway to dry heave and occasionally shit my pants. I was the worst mess ever at that time (or so I thought).

Mom left me some money and a beautiful waterfront condo. I tried, but, couldn't do it. I quit my job last August and have been holed up in this condo ever since. I haven't eaten an actual meal in years and basically live off IPAs, bourbon, Gatorade and Ensure. My pattern has been: I can drink for 5 days, then I'm sick as hell for three, dry heaving, unable to drink anything, unable to sleep and in constant pain due to an 'accident' I had a few months ago where I fell backwards onto a thick, glass coffee table and broke 3 ribs, punctured a lung and lacerated my spleen. Had emergency surgery to save my lung and spent 11 days in the hospital, 5 of them in the ICU. They detoxed me w/Librium, and when I got out I was feeling good about things (the Diladid helped). Got home and managed to put together 10 days before falling right back into the same hole,but, I digress . . . 

I've been sick for the last three days (as is tradition) and, I'll be able to drink starting tomorrow morning (as is tradition) and begin the 8-day cycle anew. I can't continue this. My body can't take it anymore. I spend a lot if time plotting various ways to kill myself, though, I know I don't have the courage to pull it off. I'm not afraid of death. I'm terrified of **actually dying.** I'm especially terrified of dying an alcoholic's death. Ironically, these last few years I've been doing street outreach and case management for our homeless community and have been privy to a dozen or more 'alcoholic deaths' and they're not pretty.

I'm setting a badge for today, taking a Seroquel tonight and, hopefully, get something close to a decent night's sleep. 

Over the months, I have turned the inside of this upscale condo into a goddamn stinky landfill. My plan is to spend tomorrow cleaning it up and not drink. Problem is, I've had this exact same plan 5 times in the last few months, and, when I get some sleep and wake up knowing my body will accept alcohol again, I cave.

I have no friends. I have clinical depression. It's too easy to just sit on this couch, drinking into oblivion every day. I despise myself so much that I'm convinced I'm not worth getting sober and having a little bit of happiness. But, I'm going to die if I don't. If I knew a surefire, painless, quick method of suicide, I might actually entertain doing it. Again, I'm not afraid of *being dead,* I'm afraid of the **act of dying.** 

Yes, I do have a very good therapist as well as a shrink and have been working w/ both of them for years. They are my sole outside contacts. They are both very concerned at where I am at now compared to even just a year ago, which was pretty bad. If I can make it through tomorrow, just tomorrow, I have a phone session on the morning of the 26th. I want to be able to tell her something positive then. 

I lurked this sub regularly because I think it's probably the best support available **anywhere** online or in person. I want to be able to say IWNDTD and follow through. But again, I'm really scared of what I'll do when I get up tomorrow. Sorry for the novella. I had to get all this out right now. I'm trying to get some fluids to stay down and prepare myself to eat something tomorrow as well as keep up the fluid intake. Christ my body has taken so much abuse I'm surprised I'm able function at all, but, I think it's still capable of healing at the moment. That won't last much longer.

I have casually browsed this sub over the past several years that I've been struggling with this.

For some backstory, I was a very heavy drinker through college, and didn't really slow down afterwards. I ended up getting married to the wrong person, isolated myself, had an intervention, got fired, ended up in detox and rehab more than once, nearly killed myself several times, and finally sorted myself out about 5 years ago. I met the girl of my dreams, got married and have three beautiful kids, a great job, and then picked up drinking again. At first casually, but it's gotten out of control. Thankfully not as badly as it had previously, but I still remember how awful that was.

Having said all that, my wife was away and when she came home she found a beer that I'd forgotten to drink. She is understandably not happy and we are back on very rocky ground. After a difficult discussion I thought I'd start writing out some of the questions that come to mind when she asks me why.

Why do I believe that I can have a healthy relationship with alcohol?

Why don't I choose the 'easier' route of not drinking?

* Easier for my marriage, which is on the rocks largely because of this, with an amazing woman who is love by my friends and family.
* Easier for parenting

Why do I keep coming back to this place in my life, getting caught drinking by someone who knows that I can't or shouldn't be.

I don't have any good answers. Intellectually, I know what the consequences are, are going to be, and yet I still choose to take these risks.

Not necessarily looking for anything in particular back, but I thought I'd throw this out there because I know I'm not the first person to ask those questions.",9,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9980226755142212}"

I was quite aware that this was an unhealthy habit and had been relatively successful (thanks to this sub) at cutting back and having two or three dry nights in the week since last October.  I used to be quite a keen cyclist but had struggled to find the time to get out much last year due to work pressures and projects at home but had started to cycle again with a local group around Christmas time.  Each time I went out I felt a coldness and stinging in the centre of my chest and initially brushed it off as just not being used to breathing in cold winter air. It was getting worse on each outing until I went on a ride on my own and within 1 mile the stinging sensation came on hard and quick to the point where I had to stop until passed.  I finally admitted that something wasn’t right and I needed to talk to a doctor.  Saw a doctor that day, had an ECG which was fine and was referred to the emergency chest pain clinic.  Three days later and another ECG whilst on a treadmill and I was diagnosed with angina and given a whole load of tablets to take and given an appointment for an angiogram where they put a dye into the blood around your heart and monitor its flow through through the arteries. 5 days later I’m in surgery, consultant has checked all my stats and went through my history and seems to think he won’t find much and the procedure starts.  It turns out the main artery supplying my heart is severely compromised and a stent was fitted.  The artery wall ruptured during this procedure and there was a degree of panic as they fitted another stent to stabilise the artery wall.  Fortunately it settled down and I was released later that day.  The many years of drinking had caught up with me and almost killed me... I was told that I was very lucky and it was caught just in time.
I read through all the information leaflets for tablets I was taking and a number of them emphasised that alcohol should be avoided.  So here I am, 30 days since my last drink and honestly, if there was a beer in the house I would be drinking it right now.....

I've known I have an unhealthy relationship to alcohol for years now, but this is the first time that it feels like I might actually make a more permanent lifestyle change. 

It started my first year of graduate school. I was dating a guy who drank more than I was comfortable with - a few beers a day, most days. Nothing crazy, but at the time this was a red flag. My last serious boyfriend had been an alcoholic, so I was sensitive about it. But my new boyfriend and I would fight about it, and he'd convince me that I was unreasonable. I believed him, so to quell my anxieties I just started drinking with him. If I felt uncomfortable about how many beers he had, I'd knock a couple back. Then it just became my habit, too. We got married, we got divorced. Drank almost every day through the whole thing. Then I was newly divorced, and that was a great reason to drink. But now it's been almost two years since we split, I'm in a different relationship, and I was still drinking a couple IPAs a night, twice that on weekends. Also smoking weed, so it compounds. I'm a slender, short woman. It's not like it was raging out or anything, but it was enough that I spent most nights more or less drunk, and I knew it wasn't good.

I want to quit because I feel like my use of alcohol is feeding into my anxiety and depression, and influencing me to waste my evenings buzzed and watching TV instead of having hobbies or skills, working on my fitness or health, or pursuing a career. But is it meaningful to quit alcohol if I keep watching Netflix, avoiding people and exercise, and putting the required effort into professional development? What if that's just who I am as a person: basically unmotivated, uninteresting, and avoidant? You know what I mean? Then I would have to just \_be\_ with this boring ass self all of the time.

I have almost no one to celebrate this milestone with, because almost everyone in my life had no idea I was knocking back absurd amounts of vodka every night for years. I'm one year sober today. I'm not a very good writer, and certainly have a lot of thoughts about this that are still a jumble in my brain, but here we are regardless.

I was a very functional drunk, as much as one could be for as much as I was drinking. I was careful to measure out my alcohol consumption vs. time, so that I would always have what I calculated to be a 0% BAC by the time I needed to leave for work the next morning. Functionally, what that meant was that I was slamming about 8-10 shots every night between 5:30 PM and 8 PM (which was my drinking cut-off). I was usually blacked out by nine, and up at 2 AM, where I would mess around on my computer in bed until I had to drag myself into the shower at 7 AM. Every day, this was routine. Of course, being technically sober does not make up for the 3 hours of sleep a night, or the epic hangovers. To this day, I have no idea how I made it through alive. When I spoke to a few people I entrusted with my secret, they all said they had no idea I was a drunk. They thought I was just fat and sloppy, I guess.

I had a terrible flu on a Tuesday. I went into urgent care to get a doctor's note for work, and my blood pressure was so high they wanted to send me to the hospital. I knew I was still badly hungover from the previous nights' binge and effectively sleepless night, so I told them it was just nerves from being at the doctor, and it'll pass. They had me sit in a dark corner and think happy thoughts for an hour, and when they re-tested, it was down to a level that wouldn't give my family a case against them if I dropped dead in the parking lot on my way out.

When the doctor came in to see me, he looked at my chart and told me, and this is verbatim, ""Well, it can't be a surprise to you that you haven't been taking care of yourself. One way or another, those days are coming to an end."" I made a promise to myself there and then, I would stop drinking.

19 days, forty thousand excuses, and about 3 handles later, I actually did. I decided, without fanfare, without promising myself anything, without scheduling, without allowing for any excuses, that I would not drink that night. Then the next day, I did the same thing again. I told my best friend, who is an ICU nurse for a population that has a lot of substance abuse problems, and he was able to guide me medically through it.

It was rough at first. Lots of bad dreams, headaches, lots of cravings, and a constant, brutal exhaustion that left me pretty much useless for large parts of the day. I was very lucky, considering how much I had been drinking, that I didn't get any of the really bad withdrawal symptoms.

I started walking every day, started eating healthier, and spent as much time as possible outside. There's obviously more to my success than that, but that's truly the essence of it.

Within about 6 months, I was climbing literal mountains and feeling a ton better. I've lost about 80 pounds, I live in a clean house, I drive a clean car, I don't ever call in to work in the morning because I woke up from a blackout and realized I drank twice as much as I intended to. My problems aren't all solved, but I have the energy now to tackle them with more energy and wisdom.

I suppose I could ramble on about this for a whole book, but I'll save you all the tl;dr. If anybody is just starting out, and they need someone to talk to, especially those of you who may be stuck at home and thinking you have nothing better to do than drink the quarantine away, I'm available to chat or answer any questions.

EDIT: I wanted to add a little something, for those who are just starting out. I've found it to be true that, after enough time, it will get to the point where, when watching other drunk people, instead of thinking ""damn I wish I could have a drink and join them"", you will think to yourself ""I am so glad I quit that shit."" Nothing, NOTHING, is worse for me than hanging out with drunk people sober - not because it's too much of a temptation, but rather because I'm over the whole thing, and don't want to waste another minute on the rotten stuff. That's been my experience, at least. ",246,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9983505010604858}"

Instead of drinking on Fridays and Saturday I might drink ~ once a/2 month. In the beginning it was very hard not to drink/ not being able to go to a market and just buy it( I dreamed about it). In the last 7 month I realized that being sober has a lot of advantages. I can see parts of my sixpack and my brain works a lot better. I wish that somebody would have told me more about the health factor. Not saying that I was not aware of them. During my year here I befriended an ex-druggie, heroin&meth, that defenetly not benifited from that. I also know that my friends back in my home country want to drink with me again(because they still see me as the alcohol-vacuum that I was once) . I try not to smoke anything, even if it's kinda hard here. I'm kinda scared about the time around senior year and college, because normal people start drinking during that time. I also don't want to be the guy that never goes partying & gets p***y. I don't want to loose my friends and the way people see me. Also everytime I got drunk here, I black out or do dumb stuff. I wonder how much money I already threw up during those years.Sadly being cool is connected with consuming drugs in my age.

For the long story - I had planned to take my toddler with me to my parents' house for couple days so I could get some help with the kid and actually get some work done during this Coronavirus ordeal.  Drove an hour and a half to their place to find my mom passed out drunk.  She was expecting us.  When she pieced together that she had been found out, she kept trying to get in her car and drive.  We took her keys, but she kept getting back into her car, forgetting they were gone.  Then she cried about not wanting to be alive - something she's drunkenly done for like 13 years.  I'm so tired of that shit.  


She's checking into inpatient rehab today.   


Hopefully when she dries out for a few days, she'll realize that she wants to live....just not as she has been living.  She only talks about death when she's drinking.  Anyway, that's hers to figure out.  I only control my decision making, not hers, and today I'm really grateful for my sobriety.  I'm going to hold onto it and cherish it with all of my being today.    


As the child of an alcoholic, I'm extra glad to be raising my child sober.  I won't allow myself to hope for my Mother's sobriety, but I wish her all the best.  Been hurt too many times to open that door, but I'd love to see it work out for her.   


I'm spending today taking care of what I can control.  My job.  My family.  My own sobriety.  In 420 days of sobriety, I have yet to encounter a single thing that sobriety made worse.  I'VE NEVER ONCE wished that I waited longer to quit.  I just wish I'd done it sooner.

Wonderful body of flavour, heady aroma, tongue curling bitter; it all has started making a sip of alcohol feel akin to a hug to me. lt's characteristic warmth feels like a cozy muffler wrapped around my throat.

Drinking in secret as usual (close to a bottle of wine a day for several years, and in recent months my consumption has ramped up to between 1 and 2.5 bottles a day).  More precisely, drinking in secret in the bathroom ... because you know, mood lighting, romance ... and forgot to lock the door. My 12 year old walked in on me while I was swigging straight from a bottle of sauvignon blanc.  Classy.  I tried to hide it behind a closet door, and wasn’t totally sure he’d seen it; he didn’t say anything besides “I’m sorry, I knocked, didn’t you hear me?”   I felt ashamed, but apparently not sufficiently so.  Because, fast forward: two days later, I was holed up in the spare bedroom, light off, netflix on, stressed out and angry about being sole breadwinner, primary caregiver, primary holder-together-of-my-family, etc etc, and again, forgot to lock the door.  As if by magic, my 12 year old, who was up past his bedtime, came in to retrieve something. He opened the door, flipped on the light, and there I was, lying in bed, mid-swig, bottle upraised. I tried to pull it back and hide it under the bed, just like he does when I catch him with his phone after lights out.  I spilled on the pillow, on the mattress, trying to put the cap on.  Screw-top sauvignon blanc, so even classier this time.  At first,  he just said “Sorry I disturbed you, Mom, I didn’t know you were in here.” 

And then, as if by magic, he said, “Mom, are you ok?  It’s been twice now that I’ve walked in on you sneaking a drink.”

As if by magic.  (Ok, some people would say as if by not locking the door, genius).   Luckily I had not reached blackout stage yet and could pull back, listen to him, talk to him, and put him to bed.   Had this happened another night, I might not even have remembered this happened.   But this was my wakeup call, my unwelcome, unbidden gift.   I was sober enough to admit to myself that I was not only betraying and shortchanging myself by carrying on this sad affair with alcohol — which I’ve known for some time but which still hasn’t stopped me from making out with it in parking lots, in hotel bathrooms, in the dressing room at Macy’s — but I was also betraying this son of mine, who trusts me and depends on me for so much in his life.  And much worse than that, he now *knows* I’m betraying him.  And he, at 12, offered me a hand to lift me out nonetheless.  

He and his big brother deserve better.  I deserve better.  The world at large might not give a rat fuck about me, but it deserves better too.

Disclaimer: I feel like a complete piece of shit for even posting this. This situation I find myself in is a result of my inability to control my drinking and the moral erosion it causes for me. I’m well aware of it. I’m writing this all down this time so I can remember what an awful spot this is to be in and get some perspective from the group. 

Need some advice. I’m newly sober again, but this time my closet drinking got pretty bad. In addition to buying and sneaking it in the house, etc, we have a stock of liquor in the basement and I did some damage to a few of the bottles. 

I should also mention that this isn’t my first time trying to get clean, my wife knows I’ve been sneaky in the past as well so the trust is already eroded a bit. She doesn’t know I was closet drinking at all this time (I was probably having 4-6 drinks for every 1 she thought i was having) so the realization that I punished our liquor cabinet in secret like I did would be pretty devastating. We’re finally on a good path and I don’t want to screw it up right now. If she found out I was hiding again now it would throw her in a complete loop that would take ages for us to dig out of. Not for the drinking, but the lost trust. I know that’s ultimately what I deserve, but she certainly doesn’t. We have twins on the way (a big part of the reason I stopped drinking) and this petty bullshit is the last thing she needs in the back of her mind with everything else that’s on her plate. 

Inevitably one day she’ll see the liquor supply and she might notice the difference in quantities from what she remembers... or she might not. She never goes in the basement and most likely 6 mos or more would have passed by the time she does. My fear is if she does notice, then is she’ll think that I’ve been sneaking drinks again after (hopefully) months of sobriety at that point. She might believe me when I tell her what really happened, or she might not.

I also know what bottles I hit hardest, I could also just replenish them. There’s no more than a pint missing from any one bottle, I could easily go to the liquor store, buy a pint of each of the bottles I know is missing and just replenish the stock without her noticing. I know this is an awful and deceptive thing to do... It’s the alcoholic equivalent of burying the body. The value of this option would avoid these other awful scenarios and save my wife the mental anguish of finding out her husband has been lying to her for months. Risk of getting caught is low, damage to my psyche would be high.

Regardless, I’m clean now and I want to keep it that way, but I need to maintain harmony in my home as well.

So here are my options:

1.	Come clean with how bad it got before I stopped and shatter my wife’s world
2.	Do nothing for now... maybe she notices one day maybe she doesn’t 
3.	Replenish the supplies and nothing ever happened

My UK group was huge, 50+ members, but I really miss the ones I attended in Spain where there were only 8 of us, so it was a lot more personal and intimate. One of the things I particularly liked about that group was their tradition of going around the table with everyone saying what they were grateful for that day. I (and I think a lot of people) don't count my blessings often enough, particularly in these scary times. 

So, I'll start with mine, would love it if anyone else wants to share what good they can find at the moment! 

I'm grateful that I stopped drinking before the current panic began, I probably wouldn't have had the strength to quit under the combination of stress and forced isolation. 

I'm grateful that I managed to organise a home shopping delivery that will last me a couple of months, given that now it's impossible to get a delivery slot within 6 weeks in my area. 

I'm grateful that I am not drinking so I can afford the shopping delivery! 

I'm grateful that my elderly parents live in a country which took Coronavirus far more seriously than the UK did and quicker, so they are safer than me.

I'm grateful that I have a wonderful GP who has prescribed me medicine that I used to be able to get in shops but no longer can because of panic buyers.

I'm grateful that I managed to get my disability benefits finalised last year so I have a guaranteed income that covers my rent and bills. 

Im grateful that my biggest health concern at the moment is getting vitamin supplements, not fighting a virus or an alcohol related illness.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Do you see yourself with sober goggles? We all know that beer goggles and all the other goggles blur and twist our vision. But how do we see ourselves sober? One thing I just recently realized was that I used to interpreted things pretty badly, like I was always at fault, that I was never good enough etc. My sober goggles - or, my true vision, without goggles - allows me to see true perspectives, true colors, and I must say, I like it.

I wouldn't want to get hangover again. I hate headaches, feeling nauseous and everything that hangover brings. I'm just this comfortable with knowing I can just wake up and go on with my day without any special care needed.

And I wouldn't want to miss a thing. I prefer to speak with people while sober now. Otherwise it's no point in my opinion. Trying to talk to some of my friends while they're drunk and have this ""ooh we've got such a connection"" moment made me realize that this ""connection"" is a lie. It's fabricated. It's easy to think your drinking buddies are your friends when you never speak sober with them to experience themselves for who they are.

7 days is hardly an achievement compared to my previous sober stints, which were 35 or even 40 days. 

But the last week has been a week I never thought I’d make it through sober. I like my job, I don’t want to lose it, and every day last week I woke up wondering if I’d still be paid. 

Yesterday I found out that the company can’t afford to pay our salaries anymore so they’ll be applying for a government scheme where 80% of my salary is paid. But I can’t work during that time and I don’t know how long that will be for. 

I know I’m so fortunate to be in this situation when so many people are losing their jobs. I hate uncertainty though. I’m terrible at being bored. And now the country I live in is on full lock down, which should have happened weeks ago tbh. 

I tried to order weed last night with money that I definitely could be using for better things. The dealer showed up 3 hours late when I was asleep and I’d already decided I didn’t want it anymore. Sorry Mr Dealer. But much better for me.

So in a time when Instagram is full of “10th bottle of wine during quarantine” memes, I want to use my time in a different way. If I’m sad I’ll be sad, and if I’m bored I’ll be bored, 1 day at a time. But I can’t drink, or smoke weed even, because I’ll spiral. I’ll spend the money, if I have it, on some nice bath bombs or a case of kombucha or Lacroix or something.

Normally I’m able to predict the way that things will happen simply because I follow patterns. But with this virus going around I’ve been wrong every goddamned step of the way. And I’m terrified. 

I don’t think I’ve been exposed because I work in a very clean environment where everyone is religious about washing and cleaning. But my ex, whom I live with, works in the airport. And god knows where his partner is at any given time. 

My anxiety is through the roof, and I ended up asking a coworker to close for me tonight because I was having physical pains from my anxiety.

I’ve dealt with some health anxiety in the past two years. Always surrounding my drinking and smoking. First it was fear of pancreatitis, then heart disease and stroke, later neuropathy.

I’m 27. I exercise often. I eat very healthy. And haven’t smoked since I last drank. 

I guess I just feel vulnerable to disease because of how hard I abused my body. The anxiety manifests as actual physical discomfort which furthers the worry. 

Since I quit drinking my anxiety has gone from 9/10 to 1/10. Barely any. Until this past week...

I thought nothing of this virus and thought people were overreacting. I work in a pharmacy and I think the stress/ panic of everyone got to me. Plus I’d had a sore throat for 16 days. 

The anxiety built up and I’ve been sliding into panic attack territory. I haven’t had one full on but I’m experiencing the most discomfort since not drinking. I’ve had to tell work that I’m too uncomfortable to go in for the time being. This makes me feel weak and guilty to my co workers.

These fears are irrational but I’m struggling to detach myself from them. I definitely know drinking will not help. That I’m thankful for. There have been thoughts but no real urges.

My appetite came back today and yet there is still something wanting. And it hit me, the fear of what is the point of all this made me think about having a drink. 

Thankfully I was at work, we just got news of a stay in place order in my state essentially shuttering most non-essential businesses. My company meanwhile is exempted specifically to the point everyone was given letters to show to police in case we are stopped.

But it got be thinking even more; home is where my family is - not a specific place, but where we are together. I am helping my brother get back on his feet but I am finally able to set boundaries with him and let him know that when the lease is up he will be on his own.

I mention this because this was a major source of stress between my wife and I. Besides my drinking, my inability to set boundaries with him led to him playing us off each other along with him saying awful things about her to me that I tried to hold inside to keep the peace. My counselor said the drinking certainly did not help but...

I realize now that home is with my chosen family - my wife and our dog. I made myself weak with alcohol and allowed myself to be manipulated to the detriment of my family. 

My wife always pushed me to go outside of my comfort zone, to be the best I could be. Yet I was caught up in the fact I did not make the same kind of money I used to, that my mother on her deathbed made us promise my brother wouldn't become homeless, all things which my wife said did not matter, but I didn't believe her. I chose fear. Fear of losing things. Fear of losing family. Fear of losing my booze.

I have for sure been more focused on getting things done, my mind set on ambitions, goals and that can make me feel a bit uptight sometimes. I am still moving from place to place. I don't have the home that I once had because I let it go in a period where I was destructive. Finishing this book project took years. And I feel a bit, what now? Can't I just go back to being drunk and carefree, who cares? I guess you can't have everything, at once.

If I gave you 100 bottles of wine and told you 12-24 of them would make you an alcoholic, would you still drink one? We all know the answer.

Sad.

I think this underlines the challenges we as sober people face on a daily basis. Not one single person's life has ever gotten worse from giving up drink, and yet it is the only addiction/habit that people have to justify stopping. People all over the world are going to be lonely and depressed over the next 3-4 months, and alcohol is depressant, go figure.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Some of us are going through quite a reorientation these days. We get to feel what´s important in life and what´s not - for some, a welcome chance to make inventory, for others, not so much.

I see some similarities to when I quit drinking: It wasn´t until I stopped that I realized how it impacted my daily life. I like to compare it to a receding sea; I was struggling to stay afloat, and as the waters withdrew, all kinds of surprises surfaced, good and bad, along with wading stones I didn´t even know existed. Above all, it taught me one thing: Both the good days and the bad days are better when I´m mentally and emotionally present.

""Uh oh"". Drove over to her place, was told that she wasn't ready for a relationship yet after all, and within 5 minutes, I was outside again, completely sideswiped. Things had been going great between us (or so I thought), and I definitely could have seen things work well for the future.

Alcohol is obviously already normalized, but it seems like drinking has become the go-to thing to pass the boredom of being stuck indoors all day; the pressure is getting to me. I almost feel like it wouldn’t even “count” to relapse, but I know it’s just my brain trying to piece together an excuse to drink.

How are you guys handling the influx of posts about drinking? Do you have any tips for staying sober in a time like this? I take Kratom for anxiety, but man, lately I just want to have a nice bottle of wine to take the edge off, considering of the state of the world.

I've spent most of the well crying and trying to come to terms with it all. I apologized to my husband yesterday and thanks him for being very supportive all week and he told me ""it's ok, you've lost a lot and you are grieving"". That instantly made sense, everything I have been feeling has been grief. The mix of sadness and anger and denial. And knowing it was ok to grieve helped tremendously. It helped me to be gentler to myself and it helped me to know that I have grieved before and come out on the otherside okay. 

So I want to pay it forward. For whoever needs to hear it right now, it's okay to grieve. A lot of people are losing a lot right now and it's ok to be sad and angry and upset. Others are feeling it too.

Anxiety is through the roof.

However, I was significantly more anxious EVERY morning while I was drinking than I am now. Something about drinking 20 oz of bottom shelf vodka a day for years will cause you to wake up with uncontrollable fear. 

This doesn’t feel real, but I feel 10x less anxious during a worldwide pandemic that I did on any given morning for years. Its wild. 

My schedule is destroyed. I’ve gone to AA every day since I got sober (this time). I also work as a delivery driver and I’m not currently working. There’s too big a risk considering the virus is spreading rapidly in my city and we’re under lockdown as of Tuesday. 

The base I have built in sobriety has made me feel very secure in my ability to make it through this. I (hopefully) am not going to relapse. I was forgetting what I felt like every day until shit started hitting the fan here. That little taste of the anxiety really reinforced the fact that if I drank, things will get worse. 

Don’t relapse. Drinking won’t make this better. However scared you feel right now will only be amplified the next morning. 

Good luck everyone. Thanks for listening to my rant.",20,"{'rona': 1, 'virus': 3, 'pandemic': 1, 'lockdown': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9947736859321594}"

if you go through my post history, you'll see i was still using pot thru my journey - and had an encounter with someone at an AA meeting that rocked my perspective toward my usage. when i made the post i was defensive and angry, sad and conflicted - a whole range of emotions. after some time reflecting i realized my reaction was a response to a truth i didn't want to face. my pot usage wasn't recreational at all - it was abusive.

while i haven't been back to an aa meeting sense, i can proudly say im 200 days off the weed tomorrow.

sobriety isn't a magic solution to fixing all your problems - and even now i still find myself yearning for a six pack from time to time (this lockdown certainly doesn't help in San Francisco) - i still haven't cracked the code for a social life or dating - but i'm in control. control of my finances. control of my health. control of my relationships.

control is empowering

I woke up in a frenzy. It was way to real and it left me emotionally and physically a mess. I grabbed my wife and cried and wouldnt let her go to the point that she got mad at me.

Today I've hit 40 days, I can't remember the last time I've gone this long. I started drinking when I was 16... I stopped one lent in college but other than that there isn't a 10 day stretch in memory where I wasn't having a few drinks here and there. 

I guess my point is, when I started 40 days seemed like an eternity, now that I am here it feels like I'm just getting started.

I gave in, quit the program and went back to my old routine.  

Wife and I had been fighting a lot recently, and I’ve had a lot of anxiety over the coronavirus thing.  Took off yesterday afternoon bound for nature and with my vodka and beer in the car.  Got pulled over and couldn’t even pretend to be sober.  They knew immediately, and hauled me off.  It was the darkest moment riding in the back of that cop car and then getting booked into a disgusting county jail.  Fortunately, I was in a more remote area, so didn’t have too much contact with others.  But the feeling of being in there was horrible, I couldn’t even call my wife for the first 5 hours.  She thought I was MIA.

She had to come with our 4 year old at 3am, and drive over an hour to come pick my sorry ass up.  Terrible feeling, but this HAS TO BE my rock bottom.  I’m really hoping to hold on that terrible lonely feeling and use it to pick myself up and get back on the wagon and stay there.

I got some sleep when we returned home, then immediately made two phone calls, one to my aunt who has been in AA sober for over 2 years.  She also just lost her boyfriend’s dad last night, who succumbed to COVID-19.  The other call was to my old sponsor.

“times are crazy - look outside! you deserve a break”
“You’re exposing yourself and your family every time you go to work, that’s heavy, you deserve to relax”
“You’re all stresses out right now and your husband won’t want to hang out with you so you should have a couple glasses of wine and relax”

I’m not sure if this has to do with alcohol.. but I’m scared that I might really hurt myself (physically) when black out and I’m scared I might say some shit to my boyfriend and eventually break us up.. I’m so confused and hurt and devastated.. I do not want to put my boyfriend through anything like that every again, he does not deserve that. I am so ashamed.

- I committed to live as well as possible that day before starting drinking at a later than usual set time, safely in the afternoon (I'd decided to defer facing my triggers until then)
- I had received a positive message from a friend featuring the quote by Rumi, ""Let yourself be silently drawn by the strange pull of what you really love. It will not lead you astray."" This has been working on me subconsciously since, and I sought it this morning through written meditation to find clarity.
-Written meditation. Just writing a stream of consciousness rooted in here and now feelings and impulses and I acknowledged the desire to find something inspirational. Some unusual positive activity came to me outside of my usual routine
- I managed to find a positive source of mood lifting stimulation through following this unearthed impulse. (I watched a short documentary on why humans find things beautiful)
- this cascaded into more good feelings, watching more short documentaries and interacting positively with those around me which was a great feedback loop
- repeat on a loop, look for little things to inspire you, written meditation is great for getting rid of distracting surface thoughts and delving more connectedly into yourself

About 1.5 years ago was the last time I smoked weed, I didn't quit for any particular reason at that time, I kind of just stopped. I've smoked on and off and never had a hard time giving up weed. 

The end of my smoking wasn't directly correlated with any increase in drinking, but I thought that if I got some weed, it would help me get over alcohol. And it's working.

I haven't drank in about a week, I've been enjoying a bit of weed each night and a bit during the day. I don't want to go out and get alcohol. I feel much better not having a hangover and upset, bloated stomach every day when I wake up. 

I don't plan to smoke weed for long because smoking isn't exactly conducive to my physical fitness/exercise goals. 

I feel confident though that this is actually going to be the switch I needed to get over alcohol.

The one that even though she stayed up way to late she didn't drink and doesn't have a hangover. I am present and hanging out with my children instead.

I love my father and have nothing but wonderful loving memories of him. I am glad that his alcoholism never took away my admiration and gratitude for him. He may have been an ""every other weekend dad"" but he and I were lucky enough to have the support of family to ensure he was always there and spent time with me.

I may be my father's daughter in many ways, from his widowspeek and easy-going nature to his love of video games and music. But I will try and be stronger than him when it comes to my addictions, I will learn from him, I will remember him, and I will honor him through my journey.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I don't argue with nobody, don't get into fights, don't harm myself or others, I just more expressively talk to my friend, or if I'm alone - turn on music and draw. What I hate is the next morning.

I cannot control myself when I start drinking. It is never 1-2 bottles of beer. It's always until I undersatnd that I just phisically cannot drink more (usually 3-4 litres) and then all the ""fun"" is over and I go home. All my friends, who have been drinking the same amount as I was in my early 20s have somehow developed self control. A few of them drink maybe more than a lot of other people, but still not as much as I do. Others drink absolutely moderately  and live a normal life although we have been to our ""crazy 20s"" together. I have found myself in a position when I drink more than absolutely anybody I know. It's just not okay. Alhough part of me thinks that it would be better not to dicover this issue (what bullshit), most of myself is happy with it and with this inner conflict as well.

I drank a bottle of wine (likely trying to find/sneak more from somewhere afterwards), and woke the next day with the intention of never drinking again. Didn't stick. Story for another day.

Like most if not all of you, I've got triggers. Holidays, special events, social gatherings, etc. And with today being my birthday, I knew there would be some emotional struggles. And every time I struggle, it's like I go through all five stages of grief all day long in no particular order over and over again. 

It's tiring and and especially with a birthday, where I am an living in an all about me bubble, I had upsetting moments, shed tears, pouted, and eventually tried to process everything. Long story (somewhat) short. I didn't drink today.

When I FINALLY reach a point of calming down from the emotions of my struggles, I know I've made the right decision. I NEVER regret not drinking. So instead I indulged in candy (like sooooo much candy) and drank Martinelli's from a fancy glass.

I've tried to convince myself that the insane happenings of the world right now provide perfect excuses to just take a break with the not drinking thing.

Today we’d like to introduce you to David Sinclair.

**David, can you briefly walk us through your story – how you started and how you got to where you are today.**  
Short Version: Clarity Car Washing was started so I could free myself from a dead-end retail job to be able to pay for my tuition and find out what I was truly capable of. I started with a bucket going door to door to get my first customer and three years later, I now service all of San Diego county and have hundreds of clients. I’ve met many inspiring people who have helped me along the way.

Longer version: Growing up, I moved around a lot and experienced many unfortunate events, however, in the end, by conquering my fears, I have been able to go from a homeless drug addict to successfully build a car washing business and beginning a company focused on scaling mental health solutions. Okay, so I know that doesn’t sound all that glamorous, but to come from such a low point where you are psychologically doubting yourself every day, I have learned some truly valuable lessons.

My family moved to San Diego from Oceanside, CA to escape unruly gang violence. My mother told me the final straw was when a crossbow arrow shattered one of her windows in the restaurant she was running…for the second time. Upon moving to San Diego, life was a series of moving around from apartment to apartment trying to survive in a very expensive city. Being raised in a single-mother household with a sister didn’t allow the socioeconomic success a traditional nuclear family would have. With this, we had lived in garages, tiny apartments, and even spending Christmas at a Motel 6 from being kicked out of the place we were staying in. By the time I made it to high school, I had moved over 15 times. Chaos and instability were second nature to me.

These events, while not that traumatic at the moment, being just a kid, left a very real and lasting wound that self-actualized in the coming years. Growing up with such little opportunity, just barely surviving, put me into a mental rut that was insisting that I did not deserve better, that I was worthy of no love or success, and neither should I expect it. Growing up with my mom working two full-time jobs and going to school left me and my sister to our own accord many days of the week. Not that she was a bad mom, she is a great mom, but she was doing her thing to make sure we would survive. While I never got into trouble as an early teen, I soon began to live in a state of constant anxiety. Since I was a little kid, I was afraid of seemingly everything. I would cry easily; I would be shy and not talk to many people. I was even scared to answer the phone because it was ‘the scary unknown’.

I experienced many scary unknowns in high school, including encounters with death and its effects. One week in class, one of my friends was gone for a few days, presumably sick. However, after that 3rd day, we learned that she wasn’t just sick, she was dead. Her mother had shot her and her husband in the head. Senior year I experienced the death of another friend who got into a terrible car accident right in front of my high school and was only 40 feet away when it happened. I was the school’s host of our little news show and had to talk about my friend’s death to thousands of my peers. The loss was earthshattering in that Ryan wasn’t a bad kid. He was a straight-A student, long-distance runner, and his dad was a pastor. He was good. These things are unexpected but can happen. Shortly after high school, I learned of another friend who overdosed on drugs when she was hanging out with her boyfriend at the time. It was strange because in the volunteering club I ran my senior year, she and I would go out and collect bottles and cans from the classrooms during lunchtime and everything was so innocent and pure then, but bad things can happen to good people.

With these scars showing themselves, I began to do worse in school. Growing up I had amerced myself in books and learning, in an attempt to have some stability and identity. However, this identity was brutally challenged in high school as studying required more emotional control to stay focused. Every year I would get progress reports stating that I was very bright, but was very lazy and should apply myself more. Somehow, I managed to keep my grades up just enough to be the dumbest smart kid in my classes. However, since early on, my writing and drawing was something that I always excelled at when I really got into the zone. Timed writings in class I would write beautifully, but in papers that were written over the course of weeks, failed to meet the standard. This education identity I had built myself was now beginning to fade, though as I always thought myself to be a math-oriented person, and math took the biggest emotional toll on me. Somehow I managed to keep my grades up high enough to be accepted to San Diego State University. This, while exciting news, was the beginning of the most difficult part of my life thus far.

Going to university is when I realized just how different I was from everyone else, and it forced some very uncomfortable truths right into my face. See growing up, I was naturally inclined to be more introverted. Doing so allowed me to keep my cool, and doing my own thing was all I could do when I was changing living arrangements so much. I realized that I had a real fear of talking to new people. Although I had come a long way from being afraid to answer the phone, I now realized just how hard it was for me to maintain a friendship when there wasn’t the structure of the same class schedule and the same groups always there. Now I had to face the truth of friendships, that they take a lot of work. So, I didn’t make many friends in the first few years of university, which was strange because in high school I had so many friends.

This new matrix of the university was beginning to become even more terrifying as I learned studying was exponentially more mentally taxing in higher education, especially in electrical engineering. I would find myself frustrated to the point of tears when I couldn’t figure out math problems everyone else was getting. Many exams I had received were failing grades and I was having to retake many classes. In sophomore year of college, I had the idea to check and see if I had ADHD. I was told in a 30-minute consultation appointment with a psychiatrist that I did, in fact, have ADHD, and I was prescribed the highest dose of Adderall a patient could receive.

I remember that feeling of taking it the first time. It was truly beautiful. I know that sounds weird to say about a drug, as if I’m trying to romanticize it, but it wasn’t about the drug. It was this newfound confidence and optimism it gave me. It felt like for the first time in my life I could read and work without beating myself up mentally. I could finally love who I was, which was transformational when compared to the bottled-up trauma I had inside me. 

I started taking this medication daily, and when it wasn’t enough anymore, I started taking more to get the same feeling I had that first time taking it. I hated not being on it, it was like living life in Jell-O, everything moving so depressingly slow. This was the danger of the new identity I was forming. See it brought me back to when I was the smartest kid in the class and all the appraisal and validation that came with those accolades. I finally felt smart again, and couple that with the increased social ability it gave me, I became an entirely different person. This new identity was taking hold, and every time the drug wore off, I went back to plain old dumb, socially awkward, me. See it gave me the confidence to start my business, to spend hours editing my website, and to do a better job detailing. The drug became my better half, me that wasn’t afraid of everything, and was taking on any challenge no matter how difficult. It was exhilarating until it wasn’t any longer.

At the peak of my drug addiction, it wasn’t about studying anymore, it was about trying to maintain some semblance of sanity and emotional control. I began finishing the entire month supply bottle of pills in a matter of a week or two, going on study binges where I wouldn’t stop for hours and I felt great. But the side effects started to rear their ugly head. See with every up there is a down, and you can’t escape the consequences of trauma forever. I would crash after hours of working, and I would not socialize. I began developing a contingency to progress. I still enjoyed people, but the meaningless work I was doing felt so much more important while on the medication. 

Not only that but I would get horrible crashes involving anxiety and depression that I could feel slowly creep into my head as the drug wore off. It got to the point where I decided to ask my doctor for Xanax. Being the doctor he was, he promptly agreed to write me a prescription upon my request. During this time, I had experienced significant changes in life and began drinking more and abusing more pills. It got to the point where I ran out of money and had no new customers. I moved into a temporary shelter and for three days, I was laying in bed shaking from Xanax withdrawals. I realized something was wrong and I stopped taking everything all at once.

One day soon after, I was just finishing a customer’s car, when everything went dark and I woke up on the ground to AKG stickers all over my torso and paramedics trying to talk to me. I am told I had a seizure and could have very easily died. It was since then that I realized I needed to make a change. I started ditching the medication and got a different psychiatrist and left Adderall and Xanax in the past. I started focusing on me and learning how to rebuild my life socially, psychologically, and financially. I soon found this was all very difficult due to not have a father figure to show me how a boy is to become a man. Even so, I kept failing and getting back in the fight.

This is what has ultimately led to my success from my grim past. Keep getting up and remembering all the dark times and realizing how I need to keep going. I can’t let all my hard work be for nothing. So if that means I have to work 12 or 16 hour days washing cars then so be it. I would much rather be physically tired than tired of life itself. I’ve been almost two years sober from Adderall and Xanax. Since then, I’ve really learned more about psychology from self-study and therapy. I’m even switching majors to psychology because of the drastic amount of changes in perspective my past has had on me. I learned of the four fundamental fears in life: 1. Fear of the unknown, 2. Fear of being judged, 3. Fear of losing control, 4. Fear of taking the first step.

I started looking at everything that had gone wrong in my life as a result of fear. Fear of answering the phone from judgment and the unknown. Fear of studying for judging myself and further losing control of my identity. Fear of taking the first step in quitting Adderall and Xanax because maybe life would be worse. By acknowledging when I’m simply just being afraid and facing the fears head-on, I’ve been able to create a stable mobile car washing business and stand up on my own two feet for the first time in life and It feels amazing.

Since these major changes, I have started my 2nd business, “World Powered Designs,” as a solution to the mental health crisis. See, when I walk around in society today, I can feel the fear everyone has. You look into peoples’ eyes and you can see that they are unsure of themselves. I know the look because I’ve been there many times. Even in an era of mass abundance and prosperity, people are becoming more depressed and suicidal than in the past. With my experiences, I know I can help others. Through my trial by fire upbringing, I had to learn the importance of discipline, emotional control, and how to rebuild your purpose and identity when you’re given very little to work with.

I think that people are just missing a purpose and identity. I think that people can be so much more than they currently are. I think individuality is important and acceptance of one’s circumstances and why they are the way they are is vitally important to a functioning society. We can choose to either live free or live succumbing to every fear. One of my favorite quotes from a song is “I’d rather die up on my feet than to live down on my knees”.

Freedom is both a right and a responsibility that has many hardships attached to it. However, even a slave can be mentally free, and the ones who seek freedom know they deserve it, and thus they are not mentally caged. In life, we can put ourselves in mental boxes of how we think everything is and what everything will be for us. However, we don’t truly have control of our lives, whether it be what family we’re born into or who lives and dies on any given day. We must realize that we live in a limitless life.

Most people don’t care if you do something as long as it doesn’t negatively impact them, so live free. In the end, the thing that keeps me going is that I want to inspire others to believe that even in times where you are nothing and have nothing, you can begin to fight back and earn your right to live on this earth. I liken getting out of the ghetto and poverty as my personal Shawshank Redemption. Every move you make to escape poverty is like trying to break out of jail. No one wants you to succeed and you will gain many enemies or haters in the process, while you can’t put a price on freedom, you can tell your story of attaining it. In the end, I want to be able to tell the best story and while on my deathbed thinking of all the scary things I had to conquer, I hope another kid like me can see that you are so much more than you think you are, as long as you’re willing to fight and continue to think differently.",14,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.7355278730392456}"

I don't remember driving.
I was at home, hours before not even planning on going out.  I was just watching youtube, drinking whisky planning on passing out on the bed.  The entire night I had no intention of driving later that night SOBER let alone in any other state.  But apparently in my blacked out mind, as I went downstairs to go outside to smoke a cigarette, I decided hey, why not just drive??????  I don't understand.  Next thing I know I'm 30 min away from home and I'm hoping someone picks up so I don't have to go to jail.  My knees are scuffed.  I can't answer the cops questions because I have no idea how I got there.  Luckily no one got hurt.

This is my second DUI in 2 years, I'm completely fucked.  Now I have to admit that I've been abusing alcohol to self-medicate my depression that's been a raging beast wreaking havoc on my soul for the past couple years.  Even though I thought I had it under control and that I wouldn't let my mistake define me.  All I had to do was stay home.  That was my intention until I got too drunk and then decided to get behind the wheel.  I could have killed someone or myself.
My court date is ""TBD"" because of the corona stuff so I'm not sure when it'll happen, but I know it's nothing good.  I can't believe I did this but I also know that I need to face the facts: I'm abusing alcohol.  I need to get my addiction and my depression under control.  I need to face my consequences and stop leaning on a crutch to numb myself.  
I'm still in shock.  If there was ever a huge OTHER wake up call, it's this one.

And she gave drunk me exactly what he said he wanted. Left alone, with all of the stuff and things he wanted. But I realize how wrong I was, because with the current crisis I don't want the stuff and things, I want to hold her in my arms and know she is safe.

In my first couple of posts though, I wanted to get sober to try and get her back. I have been at home and thinking over and over what is the point to get sober if we can't get back together.

I’ve been struggling with alcohol use for the past few years. You can read my past post history if you wish. I was sober for about six months last June to December because of an (unplanned) pregnancy. My baby is 4 months and my son is 9. I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression my whole life. I thought I had a handle on my addiction, but now I realize I was just a dry drunk. When I was pregnant I thought about drinking everyday. I just didn’t do it. Well obviously now I’m not pregnant anymore and I’m back to it. 

A little backstory.  I’m 36 years old. I have cerebral palsy. So I walk with crutches. Which means I can’t lift or carry my baby the way that I want to. I’m married, my husband is a decent guy but he’s kind of lazy, if I’m being honest. He hasn’t had a consistent income for more than a few months at a time since we’ve been together (5 years). I’ve always been a high achiever. 

But obviously we are struggling financially. After our baby was born I begged him to consider adoption. I felt my baby had a right to live, but I was concerned about my physical abilities to care for another small child. (We have zero physical support). He refused. Adamantly refuses. 

So now I’m in this constant anxiety spiral. And now with COVID-19, the little bit of work he had is non existent. There is no peace without something to quiet the voices constantly screaming in my head. 

I know drinking solves absolutely nothing. I’ve read “This Naked Mind” cover to cover several times. Everyone keeps telling me to talk to a psychologist. The thing is, talking to someone won’t give my full use of my limbs! It won’t get my husband a job. It won’t bring me someone to help carry my baby. 

I love my children. They deserve so much better. But I truly do not want to live anymore. If I was dead, both of them could live with their fathers. And one way or another my husband would have to support himself.

That's the entire 4th quarter gone.  Not knowing how my teens will make that up is causing me anxiety, even though there is nothing I can do to influence it. Making them do online courses or summer school doesn't sound fun.

I can't drive (my fault, stupid DUI), so I can't take care of household business on my own. My husband has been very understanding but not being able to just DO it is driving me nuts.

Speaking of the stupid DUI, at least one thing I'm required by law to do can't happen because the State has mandated no gatherings of 10 or more people. Gotta figure that one out.  Fortunately one of the other mandatory things I was able to do as a correspondence course. My mandatory jail time is next month, that will be interesting. I was okay with all these things, but the uncertainty due to Covid-19 is causing anxiety.

Things that aren't causing me anxiety:  Work. I work online from home and my husband works in solitude anyway. So, money's okay, no anxiety there.

Kids: My teens are actually being pretty civil.  Minor cabin fever symptoms, solved by dog-walking and snow shoveling. Their cooperation really reduces my anxiety.

Food: I stock up on stuff anyway, and the addition of a 33# bucket of flour to my stash has made me feel very food secure.  We might get down to bread and water but we're okay.

Meanwhile, my stupid addictive voice keeps reminding me that even though I legally cannot drink for a year, it would be ridiculously simple to acquire alcohol.  STFU, Voice.

I remember the night before I had gone out with my brother for ""one or two"" that had turned into ""eight or nine"". I remember waking up the next morning feeling wretched. I remember feeling like I must be such a disappointment to my fiancee.

Well since then I have woken up every morning feeling great. My skin and eyes seem clearer, my gym workouts are more consistent, and my fiancee seems more affectionate with me,  especially due to not stinking like a sour combination of beer, whisky, and stomach acids.

Now I can't lie and pretend it's been a walk in the park. There's been many days where the desire for a drink has been doing the mental equivalent of banging pots and pans and stomping up and down the hallway however I've grit my teeth and forced myself to focus on other things. I've even gone back to learning music theory and proper piano technique.

On top of all this I'm extremely grateful that I made this decision before being moved to working 100% from home. I could only imagine how bad it would have become if I were still drinking. 

Finally I would like to thank all of you here. I would never have gotten this far if not for your endless support and personal stories of not just triumph but also the bravery required to pick yourself up again should you falter. You are all my rock and all the inspiration I could ever need.

Some background, I was a heavy drinker since high school and a daily drinker for the past two or three years. After a point, even if I wasn’t getting drunk I was genuinely afraid to go a full day without at least a couple drinks. At my worst, I would have in the neighborhood of fifteen or twenty drinks in a night; though I never faced any serious consequences for getting that drunk, it was a major strain on me mentally and financially, and would lead to some embarrassing situations, if nothing else. The most recent handful of times I got drunk, I felt aggressively sad and had some very dark thoughts about myself. I decided the morning after one of these nights that I had to stop before I lost the ability to make that choice on my own. 

I made it nineteen consecutive days, which is the longest I’ve gone sober since high school. I felt way better overall; more energy, clearer head, generally less anxiety, better sleep, the usual stuff you hear. This virus situation definitely made it tempting to drink, but knowing that I was keeping my immune system up was a big motivator, and I didn’t really feel much desire to drink, anyway. I even spent a few nights with my heavier-drinking friends where I found it very easy to turn down drinks, and they didn’t pressure me beyond the initial offers.

Over the past couple days in isolation, the cravings finally kicked back in. I had dreams about drinking beer, and I started to specifically miss beer, a lot. My job closed its doors (temporarily, I hope) on Monday and I’ve been out of work since then, and for the foreseeable future, as well. I struggled all week to get through to my state’s unemployment department without much luck, but was finally able to file yesterday, which was a tremendous relief; I’ll have a little bit of money coming in soon, enough to live, at least. I decided that I deserved to celebrate a little bit, and went out and got a couple slices of pizza and a single tall boy of beer. I was hesitant about the second part, but decided it wouldn’t be a big deal.

Ultimately, it wasn’t a big deal. I drank the tall boy over the course of about an hour and a half and didn’t feel any desire to get more to drink afterwards. However, that was the part that frustrated me the most: I didn’t really enjoy drinking the beer at all. I had no desire to drink any more beer, and regretted having gotten the one I did drink in the first place. I felt fuzzy in the head, a little bit wobbly walking, and was over-analyzing texts I was sending while I drank  (“does this sound stupid? Would I say this if I wasn’t drinking?” etc). So, I didn’t get drunk, but I still just felt...weird. And not good weird, either.

So while I’m disappointed that I broke my streak, I’m still chalking this one up as a victory. I gave myself a tangible reminder that I not only don’t want to drink anymore, but that I genuinely don’t enjoy the way I feel when I’ve been drinking. The beer didn’t taste or feel as good as I was expecting it to in my imagination.

I saw my face in my dream and it was red with tears rolling down my face, I had lost everything this time.  Then I woke up.

After a few minutes I began to realize I had drank nothing, fought no one, and ruined nothing.  Realizing that was a bit emotional for me all morning, the feelings were real and I was so close to the edge.  The alcohol knows I'm serious and is doubling down.  Perhaps because I've let my mind wander to perhaps having a cold beer or 2 this summer if I go camping with an old friend, or if I meet someone and actually go on a date again.  In my heart I know that will be the wrong thing to do and I know where it will lead.  It's easy to forget that now that I'm 76 days in, but that dream brought me back full-fold into that hell.

On good days it seems like no big deal, but on the worst days, it's worse than anything I could have imagined.  I had no idea what I was getting into.
2. That said, **I can do it**.  I may have gotten knocked around a bit (or a lot), but nothing has been able to keep me down yet.  I firmly believe that with trust in life / myself / my HP (choose whichever you like!), I can get through **anything**.  Even if it means one day at a time.  One moment at a time.  One breath at a time.  I can do it!  I don't have to drink, and I don't have to self-destruct.
3. And if I can just hold on, **the miracle always comes**.  I can't explain it, but it's like they say... the night is always darkest just before the dawn.  And each time the night comes, it's a bit less scary.  And each time the dawn comes, it's a bit brighter than before.  I had no idea this was going to be so difficult, but I also had no idea **it was going to be so worthwhile.**

Life has taken on new meaning, new significance.  There's a new peace and a new joy, even in the tough times.  I can't explain it.  It can't be explained.  It can be celebrated, it can be danced, it can be sung, it can be loved.  But it can't be explained.

And I'm so very happy for that.

I have gone through 30 day after 30 day ceremony, even hitting 60 twice and 90 once. My story is nothing new to this sub, my story is nothing new to the rooms. But something hit me, tonight, while watching the episode of South Park about AA that they just totally got wrong. They made the higher power a god. They made anyone’s higher power any god. They reduced the message of quitting drinking to a trivial and utterly disrespectful taunt. I don’t know if it was maybe the specific groups I’ve had the pleasure of being a part of, but they got the message of the rooms wrong. It’s not about finding your god, it’s not about conversion or religion, it’s about the pure act of trying to better thineself with the full knowledge that our inebriated selves are not our best. I am not at my best, no matter how in control I feel when I have a drink. It has taken me years to figure that out. I am not the smartest man in the room, nor the most interesting, but by god when I drink I sure feel like it. But my idea of that fun good time, utterly dominating conversations and destroying every friendship and relationship I’ve known has met it’s end. My best friends are sick of my antics, the love of my life kicked me out of the only home-space I’ve known since my childhood. My story is not of utter ruin, however, but of hope. I look at the tatters and shorn pieces of the fabric of a life that could have been and have nothing but hope. Why? Because I won’t drink tomorrow. I didn’t drink today. And I won’t drink 5 minutes or even 30 seconds from now. The moment lives true, the moment provides opportunity.  We need just grasp it and take what we deem necessary from each moment.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It's a reality shit show about desperate people trying to find true love through a wall.

Anyways while watching, Jessica really stood out to me and reminded me of why I chose to quit drinking all together.

Most of her time behind the screen involved a glass of wine on her hand as well as flushed skin and heavy eye lids. She was only able to share intimate and pressing topics when she was basically shit faced. She made a fool out of herself when she was drunk and got super emotional. >!At one point she let her dog sip wine from her glass (which she got major backlash for it)!<

Though I've never done anything as stupid as the latter, I was definitely mentally dependent on alcohol to ""thrive"" in social interactions which then led me to over share and become overly emotional at times. The next morning would result in anxiety and a total cringe-guilt thinking of what I could have possibly said to someone or what they have thought of me even though most of the time I remembered everything, I just knew that wasn't the organic version of me just an intoxicated hyped up social version of myself. Other emotional outbursts involved pointless crying and dramatic angry fights with no recollection of how and why they even started

Watching Jessica put herself through these gringey moments where alcohol would show this very emotionally immature and angry person really hit home for me. I hope maybe by watching this in third person, she would realize that this liquid courage is only a self-sabotaging mechanism

I was tired of relying on this poison to become more ""social"", after all, it was not helping me come out of my shell but created an ugly side of me I never ever want to see again

If you've gotten this far, thanks! Hope everyone is hanging on strong even during these crazy times

Can't work (I run a small business by myself). All my birth plans are out the window and I should be shaking with fear and lunging for relief but I'm just...not. That option isn't on the table now and I'm really grateful for that. 

I got a little overwhelmed yesterday and I remembered the Serenity Prayer. I said it to myself once and damned if it didn't ground me again. My mom and MIL will miss the birth of our second son. That's fine. They won't be here to watch our toddler. That's okay. We are making arrangements. Kinda hard since we don't know if the person we are relying on will be healthy when the times comes! My hospital has banned sibling visits and I doubt restrictions will be lessening in 6 weeks. Husband has to limit his time in and out of the ward as they have it on lockdown. Nothing is going the way I planned but that's fine. There's a lot of things I can't control and being at an epicenter of a pandemic while being a month or so away from giving birth is one of those things.

I went bouts of 15, 30, 90 days and would relapse. At one point, I realized moderation really wasn't for me, and saw that alcohol wasn't serving me anymore.

And I couldn’t pick up my chip thanks to coronavirus...,"Well, thanks to the coronavirus I stayed home tonight instead of picking up my 2 year chip at my regular AA meeting. Anyway, I’m alone and I’ve never shared my full story before, so here goes. Warning, this will probably be long :)

My actual anniversary was March 15. My last drink came at the end of a two day bender/blackout. My husband was out of town and my mom was staying at my house watching my two kids. I drank on Thursday night and woke up with a hangover on Friday. I stopped on the way to work and picked up a bottle of 100 proof peppermint schnapps to put in my coffee...just to get over my hangover. Well after a day of subtlety taking nips during lunch and breaks I was feeling pretty good when it was time to go home.  

Now for a little background...at this point in my life I didn’t drink very often (I was actually on my third consecutive 6 month stretch of not drinking before binging the night before) but when I did drink, I drank a lot.  Just for reference, the year that Amy winehouse died, I ended up in the hospital with alcohol poisoning and my BAC was the exact same as hers when she passed away - .4%. I was on a ventilator in icu for 24 hours and was hospitalized for 4 days. This was not enough to stop me. I’ve been trying to stop drinking for 10 years, since my first baby was born.  

All that is to say, that while I didn’t FEEL drunk, I should not have been driving home. I’m sure I was at least two times over the legal limit.  But I did drive home, and I stopped at a church in the front of my neighborhood. I didn’t want to go home yet.  I often have to work late and I wanted to let my mom put my kids to bed so I could sneak in and not have them see me drunk.  It also gave me an excuse to stay in my car drinking by myself. Well, after a couple of hours, apparently someone called the cops.  I was in a parking lot, but my car was running and I was sitting in the drivers seat. Plus I had driven home from work, so I accept full responsibility for being behind the wheel while intoxicated. At this point, I was blacked out. I’ve tried for two years to remember any part of this, but it’s gone.  The next thing I remember was waking up in the hospital handcuffed to a bed. I still don’t know how or why, but at some point I hit my head and the police were required to take me in for a CT scan since it happened while I was in custody. After that I was taken to jail.  I slept on the cold filthy floor. I had no idea what was happening.  After I was sober enough I found out I was being charged with dui and two felony obstruction of justice charges. Oh, and possession of an open container. I had a nasty black eye and no memory of anything.

That was the last time I ever drank. I’m so ashamed of driving drunk, and endangering people’s lives, and using public resources (police, emergency room, etc) over my stupid actions. I’ve avoided sharing my story out of shame and fear of the harsh judgment, but I’m trying to take responsibility for all the mistakes and bad decisions I’ve made. Over the next few months I took classes, I had counseling, intensive outpatient rehab, hours of community service, a full year of required AA meetings and counseling, and paid lots and lots of money. The whole time I wasn’t sure if I would end up going to jail for the felonies, or if I would ha e two felonies on my record forever. The company I worked at at the time did an annual background check because industry regulations wouldn’t allow the company to employ felons, so my career was at risk. For about two months afterwards, I wasn’t sure if my husband was going to leave me and possibly get custody of my kids. It was a tough time for a few months. Eventually the felonies were reduced to misdemeanors...the police said I was unruly and violent when we got to the jail, but my lawyer used the body cam video to show that I didn’t threaten or directly try to harm the officers (thank god). I pled guilty to the dui. No one at my work ever knew anything. I’ve made amends to who I could, I’m in a really good place mentally. I stopped working to stay home with my brand new baby (she’ll be one on may 1st) and to spend more time with my two older kids. My husband has been by my side through everything after his initial anger. He went with me to my first AA meeting because I was terrified and he hasn’t had a drink since I quit drinking.  His support means everything to me.  I started knitting and crocheting, I lost 40 pounds and gained 20 back (baby weight, lol). I started seeing a great doctor who put me on Zoloft for anxiety and a thyroid medication which helped what I thought was depression, but I now think was the result of hypothyroidism. 

I feel so grateful to be alive.  Every night when I’m going to sleep I can’t believe how lucky I am to be on the other side of this.  I never want to go back. To anyone who keeps relapsing, even after long stretches of sobriety...don’t give up.  NEVER GIVE UP. I hated the feeling of resetting the clock.  But looking back, I learned something every time I quit and then relapsed. Understand that it’s part of the journey, hope that it doesn’t happen, but if it does, try to take away a lesson and then keep going. Things are scary right now.  We’re all on edge, many of us are in forced isolation.  Many of us are worried for elderly loved ones, or worried for ourselves. But drinking won’t help any of that. It will only make it worse. It’s okay to be scared, it’s okay to not know what’s happening or the best thing to do. It’s hard to have those feelings, but it’s important to feel them and deal with them instead of trying to numb them with alcohol.  

Stay safe everyone, thanks so much if anyone actually read all of this. I just wanted to share my story since I’ve never shared it and celebrate my two years a little bit, all by myself but with thousands of r/stopdrinking friends.

Work went well, surprisingly busy considering we're take out only. The community is really helping local restaurants out! 

I called every place I could to get community service time: Humane Society, SPCA, 5 different thrift stores, 3 churches -- none of them will be accepting community service volunteers (is that the right word for someone in my boat?) for 2 weeks or so. The food bank 30+ minutes outside of town has an open community service shift for me. They only have slots of work that are two hours long, so I'm going there from 9:00 to 11:00 with an at least hour round trip. I'm wondering if it's worth it... But I decided that I just want to get the ball rolling on all of this, so even if I end up doing the rest of my community service time somewhere else, I can start with two hours tomorrow.  

I figure it's worth mentioning I'm worried about my car making a 'big' trip like that on the regular.. it leaks coolant consistently, not a lot (normally) but I add about 1 quart of the 50% coolant to water mixture once a month and a half. It will be okay tomorrow, I'll check my fluids before I go.

Well, I got a little less than 24 hours before the ""shelter in place"" becomes more than a suggestion.  I'm not sure if it's the right or wrong decision but it's not my call to make.

Fortunately/Unfortunately I'm ""considered a required health care worker"" so I'll be reporting for duty in about four hours from now.

Ah yes, I'll be doing my part to ""flatten the curve"" by taking care of people, and keeping them out of the hospital, and hopefully helping them and my self remain virus free.  I still haven't gotten fired or quit yet but I'm soooo dang close.  I got a Final Written Warning on my last shift, not sure where my other written warnings are... but whatevs.  

I'm considering putting my two weeks notice in tonight, rationally I know it's a bad call, but my gut tells me it's the right one.  Maybe tomorrow, the power of procrastination.  

If I do quit, it'll go with the new practice of ""social distancing.""  Yeah, but in a sense, I've kind of been practicing that for fifteen hundred days now.

All of this, this noise, and static, my job, the constant worsening of the news, while people like Tom Hanks and Kevin Durant reach an even more God Like position in society, yeah... it's all a distraction for me, and the important thing for me is to weed out all of this noise and fear coming at me.

Tonight, I will do yoga, let the dog out, do some dishes, eat, and make my lunch, then head into work.  My main objective is to get through the evening, then the morning, then the afternoon, without taking a drink.  And, I also have to make sure my daughter is good, and then make sure her dog is good.

That's it!  Just don't fucking drink.  And keep breathing.  This too shall pass, I don't know when, after the first week of April at the soonest.

That and my spouse, in a loving and supportive move, knew my old account and would read what I posted (at first I told him that it was fine, and it was but I found myself posting less and self-censoring...anyway. I'm rambling). Quickly about my journey, I've over a series of months severely curtailed my intake. I went from nightly bottles (multiple) of wine to drinking a couple beers on occasion. So, a substantial decrease, but not zero either. 

So, my state has now ordered non essential folks to work from home. I've been doing that for a week voluntarily to avoid any chance of exposing my one older coworker who just refused to work from home (my partner and housemate work retail and God only knows what they would bring home)... But now it's a mandate. Any choice to return to my office is gone. 

My routine is entirely farked. And the tech to work from home is a trial by fire learning experience. This all happened as we were leisurely migrating to all new programs. So it has become a real Charlie Foxtrot. 

This past week has easily been the most stressful workwise I've ever dealt with. At this job, anyway. 

And I'm isolating, like my parents (smartly) are. Now normally, my life was work from 8 to 5, trips to my parents house pretty much every other day for a hang out for an hour or two, then home. 

I am going stark raving mad. My anxiety is through the roof. And between the telework dumpster fire to now the mandate to stay home, I am starting to feel like I am losing all agency. Which has made me want to drink in the worst way. Almost just to prove I can still make that decision, any decision, about the trajectory of my day. Notwithstanding that that would be a bad idea on its own merits, my partner and my spouse would be pissed off at me, and there'd be fall out. ""Sounds like self medication"", spouse says when I discussed wanting to grab an IPA six and just chill. Well, no shit, dude. If I thought apple juice would help me unclench right now, I'd reach for that.

And for that bit where it was uncertain whether liquor stores would close with other non-essential businesses was its own source of anxiety, stupid as that sounds. Like, even if I chose never to go to one, that the choice was still there made such a difference. That must sound absurd. 

So, I'm about eight capsules of kava kava into the day, and sitting here staring at the tv because my brain is too mile-a-minute to do anything useful.

Hi all

This is a challenging time for every body. I thought it could be helpful to have a forum for health care providers to discuss how the present crisis is affecting their recovery. We do have a local Caduceus group that is starting to meet virtually but I thought a larger online presence may be helpful, especially for those who don't have access to a local group.

Please note that this group is for nurses, physcians, dentists, vets, hospital based health care providers, etc. These individuals do have to work for their daily reprieve while simultanously caring for the health of others.

Strictly speaking this is not an AA meeting, but I suspect most of us follow a 12 step program.

I hope there is sufficient interest in this meeting. Please DM me if you have any quesitons.

2020-03-20 15:20:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fm0xia/counting_my_blessings_today/,counting my blessings today,"Between coronavirus, PAWS, cancelled AA meetings, and being quarantined home alone, I've been feeling lonely and resentful, which is a dangerous thing for an alcoholic. A few of my recovery buddies have unfortunately relapsed since the epidemic started. I wanted to focus on the positives; hope some of them resonate with you as well.

1. I detoxed before coronavirus, so I don't have to worry about hoarding booze, trying to taper, not going to the hospital for withdrawals to avoid taxing the medical system, etc.
2. There is no alcohol in my house and I'm fortunate to not currently be getting the crazy intense cravings I had in earlier sobriety.
3. My immune system has hopefully recovered from my alcoholism, and I don't have underlying medical conditions, which means I shouldn't be hit too hard if I do get coronavirus. I'm locked in my apartment at home so I feel good I'm keeping my at-risk neighbors safe if I am a carrier.
4. I was lucky to not lose my job from drinking. I am currently getting paid to work from home, while others have lost jobs or are working on the front lines of the pandemic.
5. I am fortunate enough to have enough food and house supplies to get me through quarantine.
6. My friends and family still care about me despite the hell I put them through. I'm able to Skype them to continue rebuilding our relationships.
7. With more free time now I'm not commuting 2+ hours daily for work, I have no excuses left to not pursue my self-care goals - push-ups in my apartment, meditation, reading books on recovery.
8. I have spare money to put my money where my mouth is and donate to the community causes I care about that are getting hit by coronavirus. I have spare time to volunteer at the local urban garden growing food for food banks (very few volunteers, so social distancing here is easy).
9. We live in a digital age and I can use Reddit and other online resources to stay working on my recovery.
10. My suicidal ideation got much more manageable after a few months of sobriety.

These are things many people, alcoholic or not, don't have, and I don't want to lose sight of that. I'm not going to shit in the face of all my blessings by picking up the bottle again.

Hope you all find things to be glad for today!",26,"{'rona': 4, 'virus': 4, 'quarantine': 2, 'epidemic': 1, 'immun': 1, 'pandemic': 1, 'distancing': 1}","{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9851863980293274}"

I haven't had them really in the second half.  I've had a couple stressful days, where it crossed my mind, but i didn't.

In a way, some of the stress factors in life haven't left.  But, I am amazed at the clarity I have now.  Alcohol, takes the emotional baseline and raises it...and you don't even really realize it most of the time.  Everything is more grandiose and involved...which is obviously bad.  I don't want that feeling again.  I kind of feel bad because there are a few people in my life who didn't really know me before alcohol, so they would be surprised at even now with me.  Obviously you burn bridges, and who knows how people will want to be involved with the rebuilding.  I can only explain and try and show...it's up to them...I can't stress unreasonably over it.  

I have lost about 8 pounds.  I had some initial water retention weight, and it seems to be slowly working towards the fat part.  I would like to lose about 25 or so more over time.  I sleep better...pretty hard actually.  Before I would wake up a hundred times and have to pee twice and all that.  I feel better physically as well overall.  I don't have a baseline while I was drinking, but I'm guessing my lab numbers would be a lot better now.  I've also been watching some educational videos related to some of my issues in life in my mind and personality and psyche.  It's really helped to improve my mindset and understanding.  

It would have been a lot better to have been able to quit earlier, but I guess everything is for a reason.  I'm glad I don't have to deal with it all anymore.",79,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.8116516470909119}"

Time to start all over again.,"I've been having blood panels done since January to monitor a new medication that I've been slowly increasing on.  During this time, I relapsed.

The liver has these two levels (I dont really understand them) called AST and ALT. The normal range is between 0-30 unit/L, and the lower number the better. The measure damage to the liver.

In January, my panel's came back 33 and 31, respectively. I chose to ignore the problem. My March results came back yesterday and my levels are now 41 and 40. The doctor called me and told me that my liver is damaged. I'm 33 years old.

I'm getting sober again before it kills me. It's easy to choose to pretend the consequences of poor decisions will never catch up to you, but once they do, reality hits. I'm scared and angry at myself. I'm also happy that I got the wakeup call that I needed yesterday. I was hoping and praying for a breakthrough and I received it.

Edit: Test levels and their severity are obviously different depending on health provider, but this isnt about semantics.

I’ve been working at home this past week. My town has closed all non-essential business. Even if they hadn’t, I would likely be at home practicing social distancing anyway. 

My boyfriend lost his job because his work had to close (we live in a ski town and all nearby resorts were closed until the rest of the season, in addition to other businesses) so he’s been hanging out with me at home all day too. 

6 months ago I’d be drinking heavily every night. I can already hear the excuses I would’ve used—“what ELSE could I possibly be doing?” “They didn’t close the liquor stores, so clearly everyone’s at home drinking.” I’d probably be too drunk or sick to make any decent food for myself.  I’d spend most of my money stocking up on booze, instead of food or putting most to savings. It would be WAY too easy to drink while working. BF and I would likely be fighting every night. 

Instead, we’ve been: doing jigsaw puzzles, trying new recipes, binging new tv shows, teaching each other our hobbies (he’s learning to knit, I’m learning Red Dead Redemption II), teaching our dog tricks, taking virtual online museum tours, tuning in to zoo/aquarium live streams, and learning how to invest in the stock market. 

This could be an absolutely miserable time for us if I was drinking. Obviously we get sick of each other and have snapped a little, but nothing like the huge, multiple-day blowout arguments I used to instigate when wasted. No one wants to be locked up with a drunk all day.

I began to drink in the car on my way home from work. When my pregnant wife would take a bath I would time it so I would run down to the store two doors down from our apartment, buy two tall boys and pound them before she’d get out of her bath. It was a continuous slow roll downward. 
          What I found out after abstaining from alcohol is that I never properly grieved for my mom after she died. I got hit with a whole fuckton of other life shit that I had to jump right in to. I self medicated with alcohol as a means to cope with everything that had been happening in my life. I suppressed my emotions until after four years of bottling up everything. I let out a cry for help. I wanted to die. I was so depressed and had suicidal thoughts. The scariest thought I remember having while being drunk, and drinking alone was “I just want to go home” but I was in my own house. I had tried abstaining before, but it was for only two weeks. People hadn’t realized yet how much I was hurting, and they didn’t accept that I had a drinking problem.      I didn’t know who was looking back in the mirror at me. 
        So on that fateful Sunday I made the decision that I was done with alcohol. And with the help of r/stopdrinking, and with the support of my wife, and friends and family I am happily alcohol free. In these six months I have grieved properly, I have healed, I have worked thru my triggers, and I have grown. There is much work to be done but I am ready for whatever the future brings!

At the self checkout, I was told to wait to present my ID to a clerk, and when I opened my wallet to pull out my ID card, I read my green little 3-month Alcoholics Anonymous chip which I keep in front of my ID.

Thank you all!,"The biggest most important thing I learnt from sobriety was compassion. I always thought I was a compassionate person, but sobriety showed me the truth of what compassion is. 

Drinking turned me into a person I really hated, and for me there were barrels of shame attached to that. It made me act and do things that would cause me such white hot shame, that I could barely cope.

On here and in other people’s writings I found a space that allowed me to sit with that shame. I found thousands of other people, who just needed to sit with each other and say: I did these bad things. And they would say: we know, we did them too.

It taught me how to stop being so judgemental of others, how each story has so many sides. How our flash of anger towards an act we deem bad may on the surface seem righteous, but actually underneath there is someone who is in pain and is very very scared.

In times of crisis, I see lots of people throwing around shame as a weapon. Instead of sitting together and saying: I’m scared. We create barriers between ourselves. This all comes from fear, everything does. For me, sobriety has taught me that sometimes we all need to just sit together and admit we don’t know what we are doing. 

Outside of that, I learnt how to live each day at a time. I learnt how to just sit with my feelings, instead of building a huge dam to keep them in, to have them flood out on mass. Right now, it is ok that we are not ok. 

It is ok if we are scared or sad or angry or even happy. We’re also allowed to be happy in times of crisis. Humans are complicated creatures. There is no rule book to how we should feel.

Wherever you are on your journey, I applaud you. You are doing the hard things and in this time, this is even harder. I just wanted to say I feel that this community and sobriety has done so much to give me resilience.

My wife’s father swears that Day 90 is a turning point because, in his words, “the real recovery process begins at Day 90. You have finally squeezed every last bit of alcohol out of every nook and cranny in your body and your brain. You’ve finally dried out.” While I know that this probably isn’t scientifically correct, he does have a pretty unique perspective. He is many years sober and has been a substance abuse counselor for over 30 years. For those wondering, yes, he did spend many years with a drinking problem while counseling others about their drinking/drug problems.

This was surely the most important and beneficial part of my recovery and is my only 'advice' I give. If you can, get a professional psychological help.

I've lost track of days and will be surprised when I see my badge I'm sure and I have still yet to drink. This sub really helped spur me along and back into a life I wanted to build but was consistently self sabotaging. The reason I am writing here is that I know things seem bleak and I know things are completely uncertain and if you are like me that was when I was at my worst. It was a situation of do what it takes to pretend it's all okay. I'm just hear to say, it's okay if not everything is okay. It will always get better. During the 07/08 crisis I worked in the banking industry and was constantly watching my commissions getting lower and having constant meetings about the bank testing and how we were borderline failing.. 

Today, I have a job I always wanted and am in a secure position to weather the storm this time. I just want to say be careful in this time of increasing boredom of sitting in your house. Go for a run, learn a new skill, paint the house, read a few books, and take care of yourself! I don't know who needs to read this but I feel it's necessary to say, this is not going to be a pretty situation but this is not the time to retreat from your advancements but a time to take advantage of time itself. Time we never get in these increasingly busy lives of ours. You're being given a chance to take the time to work on you, don't waste it on taking 2, 3 or 10 steps backwards.

You all got this! Keep going and screw this situation, like everything it shall pass and tomorrow will come quicker than ever, and you can either be in front of the curve with a new mindset or you could decide you can't handle this (hint: you can, it's just your lizard brain telling you otherwise) and turn to drinking to kill off anxiety and depression. Just remember as soon as this is over, that anxiety and depression will still be there unless you work on it and continuing work on it.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Sure there’s a small blip of fun, but afterwards is like a weight of guilt and cringe from:

1.) Wasting so much money! 
What a waste of money honestly! $10 for a drink out, barely getting a buzz off a drink, so a few for a night out could buy a nice outfit instead. Using Mint to calculate my monthly expenses, and using a specific credit card to track how much I spend just for going out- it’s hundreds a month, adding up to be thousands a year! I could go on a nice trip or invest in that new gadget that I’ve wanted to further my hobby/side hustle instead!

2.) Embarrassing myself!
All the stupid uninhibited things said or done, feelings of exposing oneself possibly physically, emotionally, or socially. Like the other day, a new acquaintance/friend asked a lot of personal somewhat inappropriate questions that sober me would not even entertain. But drunk me felt uninhibited and shared a little too much. So I had to sit with the cringe the next few days, and the residual embarrassment also has turned me off from wanting to hang with this person any more.

3.) Damaging my body! 
Waste of calories! And just alcohol being bad for the body in general, the liver, it’ll dehydrate the skin, it’s toxins and it’s probably making me look more aged than necessary. And nursing a hangover is not fun, plus it’s such a waste of a whole day! 

4.) Going against my inner values
Bottom line is, they say your feelings has to do with aligning actions with inner values. Drinking goes directly against my inner values, and so I feel so disappointed in myself afterwards. I’m just at the point where I’d rather save money for better life experiences like trips, hobbies, investments, etc. And I’d rather socialize sober because I notice how much better and in control I feel, like my conversations can go deeper and my mind can stay better on track. And then, I’d rather look and feel young for as long as possible by taking care of my body now. Besides, all these years I’ve had it as a goal to get in impressive shape, and yet it still hasn’t happened.

So there. I’d rather feel proud and stronger each time I say no to drinking, than to feel so guilty and weak afterwards for drinking.

I enjoyed it. The company with my friend more than the drink. Came home. The end. 

Yesterday I had a beer at the End of a long day working from home, cooking, helping the kids learn remotely etc.   I didn’t enjoy it. I immediately felt bloated , ugly and gross.  Woke up this morning and could just taste it strong as anything.  I thought of how many calories I drank before bed and said no wonder you couldn’t lose a pound for 2 years. I didn’t feel guilty.  I just feel like I drank something I just don’t like at all. 

So , I feel the transformation- and I see why I just don’t enjoy it anymore. Or at least not right now. Right after I quit I wound up being quarantined for 2 weeks , then as soon as I was about to be free , everything else closed down.  I’d really rather do this whole thing with a clear head and self esteem.

I'm 24 days clean and sober, and feeling great. For a long time my problem drinking led me to even more problematic drug use and overall terrible time, and at the beginning of the year I decided I wanted to make a proactive step towards making my life better (for good... I have had a few brief flirtations with sobriety, but this time I was determined to make it stick). After the better part of a decade of blackout partying, stupid decisions, anxiety and embarrassment, I finally feel back in control of my life. I feel so happy to finally be doing stuff instead of sitting around in my house, miserable and hungover, on a come down and feeling like dirt, and I feel like I'm a better and more reliable friend and person for it. I no longer feel connected to or committed to the ''party girl'' identity I used to justify my behaviour, and feel calm and happy for the first time in a very long time. 

However, I've been stuck in the house for a few days now and I'm starting to feel kind of antsy. Usually, when I think about my drinking and my drug use (\*which I hope is okay for me to talk about here) it makes me feel bad, because I remember the final 8am at the end of the bender, and the 'being in my overdraft because I'm unemployed but still going out', and the 'getting kicked out of work for still being fucked up' Bad Times, but since being sat around all day with nothing to do, I've found myself reminiscing about all the good times - the times that kept me crawling back for more. I know they aren't \*really\* good times, and that the bad times far, far outweigh them, but its got me feeling anxious. Just thinking about alcohol has me feeling like I'm being suffocated, and suddenly my 24 days of sobriety kind of pale into nothing compared to the thousands I have left to come. I suddenly feel very very small in the face of forever. 

I know that I can't just have one drink - I've not interacted with drink or drugs in moderation for years, and in all honesty, I *really* enjoy being totally sober, but it's all getting a bit much right now. 

Just wanted to share with the thread, as I was intending on going to a drug and alcohol group in my hometown, but it has since been cancelled due to coronavirus. I just wanted to get it off my chest! I don't have any friends who I can share my sober journey with. They love me and support me, but none of my friends are sober right now, and I just feel like I need to talk to other people who are (plus, I feel kind of anxious sharing this with people anyway, and the anonymity I am afforded here really helps alleviate that). I just feel.... tbh I feel kind of crazy! There's this part of my brain saying, you could just have a drink. Its okay to just have one drink. you've already done almost a month of total sobriety, why not celebrate with a drink? Just... One... Drink... BUT.... !!! I already feel better for getting this out of my head, and off my chest, and I'm not going to give into temptation.

A coworker of mine went into great detail about his experience there, especially the booze part.  And my cravings went through the roof.  To the point that if he pulled out a bottle, I would have drank right there on the spot. 

My commute takes me right by a grocery store with a liquor store inside of it.  Driving home that day I couldn't even look at it because I was afraid I'd pull in and grab a bottle.  I was gripping the steering wheel so tight, my knuckles were white.  

Even though I didn't drink, I felt so defeated.  Like my sobriety was only due to the technicality of alcohol not being available during my moment of total surrender.  And that's why today feels so sweet! It was such an easy and instantaneous reaction.  My consciousness and subconsciousness finally on the same page together.

The topic of this video was “the five stages of alcoholism”. 

I found it very interesting because this fellow believes that people that we consider “normal drinkers” (and we wish that we could be like), are actually in stage one or even stage two of alcoholism. 

In the city that I am living in, restaurant dining rooms are closed, bars are closed and people are being given time off from work, myself included. Other unfortunates are actually losing their jobs and businesses. 

We knew that this was eventually coming, and began stocking up on a few items without panic buying. I am 140 days in to my sobriety… and I have to say that while the thought of purchasing alcohol did not even cross my radar, I was amazed at how many people that I considered to be “normal drinkers“ or even much less than that, were stocking up on alcohol to get them through. 

I think that maybe the fellow from the YouTube channel is right… Anyone who has any sort of relationship with alcohol… has a problem on some level. 

When I think back about things, I guess that was true for me. 15 years ago I didn’t drink hardly at all. I drank so little that if we went for dinner and I ordered a glass of red wine… I was giddy and tipsy by the time I had even drank half of the glass. Fast forward to a woman that could drink a 4 L box of wine in a day and still be functioning. Every day.

If I was still drinking, I would surely be at a bar right now. I would definitely be spending a shit ton of money with delivery after the stores close. I would be walking around in the streets, drunk, talking to random people up close. And then I would come home and pass out, most likely I wouldn’t take a shower or even wash my hands. I would be putting both my 60yo parents at high risk of contracting this disease and I probably wouldn’t care, if I cared I would start to drink or drink more to forget about it.

This quarantine is giving me time to reflect on my changes and see how my past reality was so hurtful for me and others. For us that are sober, this is the time that we have no other choice than to learn how to live with ourselves, so let’s make the best out of it! 

For those that are trying, you can do it too, one day at a time, you can forgive yourselves for your past choices, you can change at any time, so why not now that we’re stuck at home anyway?

I’ve looked up meeting dates and never gone. I’ve woken up every morning saying “today’s the day I stop drinking”, but by the time night falls I have zero self-control. I’ve been drinking every single day for about 7 years. Held down a job for all of that except for a year where I broke down mentally, quit my job, and used all my savings to stay home and get drunk every day until I moved in to my dad’s house some 500 miles away. Didn’t know at the time he was a severe alcoholic (he wasn’t in the picture much, Navy then divorce). To keep a long story short, I feel like every day is deja vu and I’m beginning to feel my will to live slipping away.

But I don’t want to feel like this. I’m tired of it. I’m tired of feeling apathetic. I’m sick of having no motivation to do anything. I’m definitely depressed and self-medicating.

Hi, I'm an alcoholic. I've tried to quit god knows how many times and was successful for 6 mos once... but the rest of the attempts rarely more then 30 days. But during this isolation I'm making another run at it. It takes the brain 21 days to change a bad habit... might as well give it another go.

I'm not a blackout drunk, I don't like getting out of control. In the rare instance it does happen (It's happened once in the past 5 years) it's always an accident and I have a kill switch that puts my brain on autopilot to get an uber back home. The fun for me is riding that ragged edge and holding on, it's a game to see how much I can drink without anybody even noticing I've had more than 1 or 2. I like to think I know better than anyone else how much I SHOULD be drinking, because the only REAL problem drinkers are the ones that end up passed out on the bathroom floor in a puddle of their own vomit, right? 

This has always my problem with AA, every person who I met was in their 50s or 60s and had some story about how they got wasted and burned down their house or smashed their car into a convenience store or punched a cop... something outrageous. I definitely have a few funny stories from college and a few others dotting my storied drinking career, but nothing ever remotely close to what these people have been through. Not taking away anything from AA, I know it helps alot of people and I have a few friends who swear by it, but I could just never really get into it. 

I never wanted to quit for good, but I think that's my only option at this point. Even after 6 mos of sobriety, a glass of wine once a week turns into 2 per week turns into beers which turns into more beers and then into whiskey... Then after awhile it ends up putting me back in the situation I'm in now... publicly drinking 1 or 2 per night, but privately having 5 or 6 drinks a night on a good day, 10-12 on a bad one. Hiding booze as a grown man... definitely something to be proud of there.

The problem is (or lack thereof), other than a bit of brain fog in the morning I go on functioning normally. Job is great, home life is good, etc. My wife is worried yet again, so I poured everything out in the house. She's not an addict like I am so she has trouble understanding what my brain is doing.

This is the first time that I have ever done anything like this, but it's time. I am a 39 year old single mother of three. My whole life I never was a drinker. Maybe a glass of wine at Thanksgiving or at a birthday party. About 7 years ago I began drinking. I can't peg one thing in particular that lead me in that direction, it just kind of happened one day. It started out slow and wasn't a problem. 7 years later it is out of control. Last night I drank a liter of vodka all by myself. Didn't get sick. Didn't remember about half the night. If someone told me a couple of years that I couldn't drink, you might as well have put me in a padded room, because I would have lost it. Now, I am ready. I am tired of constantly being tired. I never get restorative sleep due to always going to be drunk. I never go out and do anything after 5pm because that's drinking time. I don't spend quality time in the evenings with my daughter (my older two are grown) because I am too addicted to this routine of drinking. I have hurt friends, family, and other loved ones because of my drinking. I have let my children down on more than one occasion and it has taken years to mend those wounds. I am ready to be free. I do not want to be a slave to alcohol any longer. The only problem is that I am just not sure how to quit. I find it very curious that I want to quit so badly, but I don't. I don't make sense to myself. All of my siblings are alcoholics. My brother is just over a year sober. He had 4 seizures in one evening as a result of scaling back on his alcohol consumption. It scared him badly and he immediately went into detox and has been sober ever since. Considering the amount of alcohol that I consume on a daily basis, and the amount of time that I have been doing so, I am afraid that the same thing will happen to me. Furthermore, I know that alcohol detox can be fatal. I can not afford to take time off work for an inpatient detox, nor could I afford it.

Spend the day alternating between elation (in a few short days, I will feel better!) and  shame (were those relapse days worth it? No)
Tired by 8pm, and actually am able to sleep. Not uninterrupted but each one lasted a good hour or more, and felt like good sleep.


Day 2: Forced down some muesli and yoghurt for breakfast. A few hours later, I feel kind of hungry physically, but no desire to eat.
Bored, but can’t bring myself to focus on much. 

Get a badge in here! That feels like a BIG DEAL.

What comes next: I will eventually eat something tonight. It will taste okay and I’ll go to bed. I’ll still feel pretty damn guilty that I wasted yet another day just lying around, but I’ll try to be kind to myself.


Tomorrow: I’ll begin feeling normal. Or rather, I’ll feel like the version of normal that I really enjoy (sober, clear-headed, able to do and enjoy doing things! Able to concentrate on reading a book or working, or anything!).

It’s so utterly predictable. 

Hopefully writing all this down will make it the last time I go through this dumb cycle.

It's a very small group at the moment: just three men, one other woman, and me - plus the clinician/facilitator, of course. (Mmaybe people aren't signing up for treatment programs right now out of fear of COVID-19 exposure?). At last night's session, the courage, insight, and honesty of the other woman in my group--I'll call her J--probably saved me from a slip (and as many of us know, it is all too easy for a slip to turn into a full relapse!). 

During our usual check-ins at the beginning of the IOP session last night, it was obvious that J had a painful story to relate. She started by apologizing ahead of time because she knew she would end up crying. But she said that it was important for her to be honest with herself and with the group; she needed the accountability, and she hoped that maybe something she said would help one of us in some way. She had been clean and sober for 35 days, and despite a very exhausting, frustrating, and painful day yesterday, she did not feel tempted to use. Even when a friend dropped by her house later in the day and offered J and her partner some cocaine, she stuck by her commitment to sobriety and said no. Her partner, also in recovery, did not pass up the offer. He believes that as long as he abstains from his drug of choice, he is still solid in his recovery. J does not share this view; she believes that it is critical for her to abstain from all mind-altering substances. Despite her resolve, by the time the friend left and J had gone upstairs, she was in the grip of impulse; before she knew it, she had snorted a line. She immediately felt a diminishment of the light that had grown within her during her period of sobriety, and she wished more than anything that she could undo the last 30 seconds. As J shared her story, she was obviously torn between shame over her mistake and a desperate need for hope. She was incredibly disappointed in herself, but the rest of us were proud of her for holding herself accountable and taking steps to nip a relapse in the bud, rather than skipping IOP and setting herself up for a full-blown run. 

Of course it would be preferable if no alcoholic or addict had to suffer any setbacks in recovery, but I am infinitely grateful to J for sharing her story with us, and I think that her recovery--and mine--will ultimately be stronger because of the way she responded to this slip. For the last few months, my husband has been holding all of my credit cards, money, etc., in an effort to prevent me from acquiring alcohol. Yesterday, I came across some cash that I didn't know I had stashed in my car. As I was on my way to my IOP, I had been thinking, ""I'll probably have to give a UA (urinalysis) at IOP tonight. But if I buy some alcohol *after* the session and drink later tonight, the metabolites will probably be out of my system before my next UA."" (As if that means that the drinking never happened, right? Stupid lizard brain!) To some degree, I was still romancing that idea when the session started and I volunteered to go first for our check-ins (but I did not admit my thoughts to the group). But as J shared her story, I realized how much *I really did not want to throw away my sobriety,* as short-lived as it is (so far!).",8,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9404667615890503}"

Just after Christmas my wife contracted a very nasty lung infection. Actually the symptons seem identical to Covid-19 and it might even have been that, but it was a little early and neither I nor my daugter caught it so that would suggest it was something else. Nevertheless, she has really suffered from it including a muscular injury from coughing and is still not better. She drinks, much more moderately than I used to, but every day. Note that I am not judging her here - I did a lot worse when I was drinking - but it has been really noticable how alcohol has affected her recovery. When she was really suffering in January, I strongly suggested that she took a few days off drinking. She agreed, and did so, and there was an immediate improvement. Then she went back to drinking and it was really obvious to me that she went backwards again.

I know this isn't scientific, but it matches my own experience. I had a flu infection a few years ago and tried to power through with alcohol and was ill for weeks.

So I know it is really tempting to drink at the moment. I won't say I haven't been tempted, but if you want to give yourself the best possible chance of staying healthy, I really wouldn't. And of course, while you might escape for a couple of hours, the whole thing will still be there when you sober up, and you will feel like shit too!

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I started drinking when I was 16. Not heavily, only on weekends but when it was available, a lot, all through high school. Especially during the summers at the lake where I would drink all day most days. 

But during this time I had an eating disorder and would use it as an excuse to throw up when I was “better” or as an excuse to be social and calm my anxiety.

Fast forward when I moved away. I moved in temporarily with my uncle who was an alcoholic. I mean for real. He would come home and pass out on the living room floor and I would tuck him into bed. He is a very kind and has stopped drinking entirely since. I didn’t drink when I lived with him really, maybe once a month. Then I got my own place and didn’t drink at all. 

Got a second job as a server and met someone who also had mental health issues, and also drank quite a bit. Over the course of a few years we got engaged after living together for awhile, in which splitting a 30 pack every night between the two of us became entirely normal. 

Moving on I got a job with a real estate agent who was very shallow and emotionally abusive. She also made me very insecure, constantly saying she wanted to “fix me” She drank heavily and wanted me around most of the time, and would me buy me one drink after another. At least 3 days a week. (7-15 drinks at a time)

I left that job and went back to serving, towards the end of that job (and one of the reasons I probably got fired) I stopped hanging out with her outside of work. And wouldn’t go out and drink with her anymore because it started to affect not only my work (not that she cared about that) but also my mental health.

I'm not new to reddit, nor to following this group.  I created a new username to start fresh and focus on communities such as this. I'm a mother of two that has been drinking heavily since high school. I also have a slew of serious mental illnesses that tend to fuel my desire to drink, or if all else fails, find something to use. I've known deep inside that I have a problem for a very long time, but continued to drink as a crutch, or self medication, perhaps both at times. The last year was one wake up call after another, and yet I continued on. Now I'm in a situation where I will literally lose everything I love if I cannot learn to control the impulses and desire to numb my mind. I have until the quarantine is over to prove to those around me that I can do it, and that I can do it without a 24/7 rehab. I am had my fair share of stays in psych wards and it always feels like a prison, so the idea of a full blown rehab in the midst of multiple life changing situations I have very hesitant to go back into type of situation willingly unless it is absolutely necessary. I am hoping joining and actually PARTICIPATING in r/stopdrinking will give me an outlet that is healthy. I have attended a handful of SMART meetings in the past and I enjoyed the atmosphere far more than AA. When the quarantine lifts I plan to go to several a week as time allows, while continuing to check in here for the day to day.  Can't say I'm happy to be here, but I know in time this community will enrich my life and that I NEED to be here. I hope I am able to add something to this lovely community, I have been following for quite a while.

>When everything around you seems f\*\*\*ed up, it’s easy to think nothing good exists—or even if it did, it wouldn’t matter. However, if you only pay attention to what’s painful in your life, you will inevitably end up exhausted and overwhelmed. Since we tend to keep bad stuff in our minds more than good stuff, we need to actively seek out what’s beautiful in life to overcome this natural negativity bias.--[Tim Desmond](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_to_avoid_feeling_defeated_in_todays_crazy_world)

So, the world is pretty fucked up right now. For me, it’s radically different than it was a week ago when I posted the previous TT. They are not changes I can control. I am far from “acknowledging and accepting” them, in the DBT sense. I’m far from the only one--it’s huge changes for my immediate family, and we’re all reacting to the uncertainty and fear in different ways. That’s just within my house, and our reaction is no different than my neighborhood, town, state, and the world. It’s painful. I’m exhausted, and it is easy to feel overwhelmed.

So what’s beautiful? The weather has been, and I live in an area with open space. It’s been busy, but we can space out. My recovery communities are--we’re reaching out and supporting each other as we can. That’s true of the folks I know in person, and folks I know on SD. If you want to actively seek out the good in life, browse through the posts and replies here. Then look around your community, and see the good out there--folks helping out, folks connecting, folks working together (at a distance). We are in this, but we are in this together.

I remember the first day. It was a Monday. The day after st Patrick’s day. I was quitting for the weekdays only to be able to better track my calories and lose some weight. Quickly I realized that not drinking during the week was going to be the hardest thing I’d ever done. Then it hit me that even quitting for that day was nearly impossible. I decided on my hung over drive into work that I needed to try something if I was serious. So I found a podcast. Recovery elevator. After listening that morning then on the way home I was encouraged. So I didn’t drink that night. Then I listened to the podcast the next morning and for the rest of the week. I then decided I was going to attempt to not drink for the weekend. My husband went on with our original plan which was to drink that weekend. He drank wine in front of me that weekend (he didn’t all week) Well my plans had changed. Then I made it another weekend and now here I am. 2 years later. I drank for over half of my life up to that point. I still dream of drinking and wake up feeling like I drank. I still think about drinking a whole lot but I think about how disappointed I would be if I did and it won’t make anything I’m going through any better. Since I quit I had my second child, a little baby girl and we just opened our own auto repair shop. I believe I would not have either of those if I kept drinking. I have to write down reasons I don’t drink to remind myself why. My kids, my health, my family, my husband, and because drinking just fucking sucks. It’s pure shit. I’m hopeful I never drink again in my life but I can’t guarantee anything. I’m laying in bed to go to sleep now and I will be so happy when I don’t wake up hung over.

It seems the more I look at the problems that have manifested in the past few years, the more ubiquitously I see alcohol finding its way to their center, connecting everything together like a web.

I have been a pretty regular drinker since about the time I was 17, and I’m 30 now.  My journey has been a gradual downward slope, making it easier to deny my consistent history of heavy drinking, with its fair share of blackouts and extreme binging as simply normal, foolish as it may seem. I am sure that the embarrassment and shame I feel towards these episodes are something many of you have experienced as well. 

However, I never really felt like I hit some definitive ‘rock bottom’, which is why for so long I denied that I had any issue with my drinking. But introspection has led me to the conclusion that I was looking at this problem from the wrong end, that I was not addressing the root cause, the circumstances that first bound me in this relationship with drinking- a traumatic experience that happened not long before I began drinking, when I was 16. It was something that I thought I had gotten over, but really, I had just shoved it down very far, instead of actually addressing it, and I believe it has been through my toxic drinking habits that this pain has manifested, as well as through mental health issues, which drinking itself has also exacerbated. It has also caused some ongoing medical issues that need to be addressed promptly at this point in my life as well. 

I am ready to break this vicious cycle once and for all. I see clearly now that my relationship to alcohol is toxic; there’s really no more room to deny it. I would like to make some serious changes to my lifestyle, and lead a happier, more honest and fulfilling life with which I can be happy to be engaged. I hope that I can find some support on this thread, and that I can help support others in turn.

Six years today.,"I thought a bit about if I wanted to post today, and what to say or what not to say.  Maybe because I'm a bit more the shy anxious type.  And maybe it's because I know that many of you may be struggling, maybe really hard or near the beginning of your journey, and, posting up a celebratory anniversary isn't always the best mix there.

What I would say is that even though I've been without any alcohol in my body for six years now, I still have to take it day by day.  I still reflect back on so many nights crashing into bed with the room spinning and spinning.  And then only to wake up feeling like complete trash, day after day.  I remember this feeling of terror of not having any beer at home that would magically disappear the moment I cashed out at the liquor store.  And I remember that it could all start over again and so I still live it out day to day, just like you are.

Coming into this anniversary, I was dealing with temptations.  The unrelenting rationalizations.  ""You've gone this long haven't you done your time?""  ""You can't keep abstaining forever.""  ""You'd fit in so much better if you just drank like everybody else.""  Always a fight!  It has gotten easier, the cravings become less frequent, less intense - but still there.

Haven’t been on here in a while. 
I’ve missed you. 
Today is a good day. 
So. 

I was running this morning. And since March hit, Ive been getting even more excited for my one year soberversary coming up TOMORROWWWW (March 19,2019)!! But then I remembered that we had a February 29TH this year!! Oh shit. 
So I came back to this beautiful space to check my badge count. The counter that started this journey when I did. 

And whatdoyaknow?! TODAY is 365!!!!! I’m cheesing from ear to ear. I’ve been like a giddy child that’s waiting for their birthday to *finally* get here on the nineteenth for soooo long!! And all along it’s actually been the 18th 👏🏽😂🙏🏽 

Either way, I am so joyfulL. 
I did it. 
I succeeded. 
And I’ve found so much of me that went missing along the way! 
I found strength. 
I found determination. 
I found willpower. 
And now I’ve made it to this major milestone that I’m extremely fortunate to be celebrating today!! 

Its probably what I consider to be my biggest sense of accomplishment I’ve experienced in life thus far. Eliminating something that was once so detrimental to my overall health, something that was not serving me in the slightest way, something that I had unhealthy habits and tendencies with, something I was struggling to balance and moderate. 
So.
I said no more. 
I decided no more. 
I wanted no more. 

And now here I am on the other side of it. I have no desire to drink. I’ve been submerged in social situations filled with nothing but drinking. And places where everyone in attendance is there just to get drunk. And in environments encouraging nothing but consumption. Weddings, bachelorette parties, birthdays, holidays, music shows, social outings- I did it all. 

But-
I. Stayed. Sober. 

I observed. I witnessed interactions. I learned how to resist temptation. I cringed and then remembered my past self who was so bad off. I grew. I released. I got healthier. I felt different. I saw changes in my self.

My mom says she wishes I would stop “saying it like I was an alcoholic or something” when I would talk about my day coming up. But it doesn’t bother me. Her response doesn’t phase me. In the past, it would have certainly pissed me off. But now I’m fine. No one else’s input means anything to my journey. 
Her reaction doesn’t bother me because I know she doesn’t know anything that existed below the surface- the activity of physically drinking. She didn’t know the mental and/ or emotional side of it all. The feelings I was feeling (and trying not to feel) when I was drinking. The sadness that lingered that I thought I could outrun. The desires and strong urges to fit into social situations, and meet everyone’s expectations, and find acceptance, etc. 

It was ugly. 
Non desirable. 
But I’m so grateful for the dark that shows me this new light. The new path I created for myself. On my own. Without anyone’s help. Independently. I created a new future I wanted to be a part of. Completely cold turkey. And started fresh. 

*On my own for the most part but with a HUGE contribution and outpouring of support from THIS VERY community. This special group and special space that exists as one tiny lil sub/branch of a vast online platform. I’m so happy I found it. It helped me so much on some of the inevitable down days that come along on the path of ‘sober sally’. It also gave me a chance to return some of that support on the days when I had some to give back. It’s a beautifully implemented system. 

People come here on days when they’re struggling, when they relapse/ restart their count, are feeling the pressures of social or environmental situations, etc. And here they can find encouragement, kind words,support, advice, suggestions, people who understand, people who are empathetic- ALL OF IT!! 
They can be seen. They can be heard. They can be held. By people who know and understand their path- to a certain extent. THATS SO RARE IN THIS ONLINE CYBERSPACE. I’m not even talking about just on Reddit. Im referencing the whole *forking* Internet. 

Off the top of your head: 
Where can you go and be completely yourself, extremely vulnerable, and reach out to people you’ve never met in person? Where people are easily accessible, available, and willing to help you? To love you? To support you? 
ON the INTERNET! 

Some people will read that and think- church. Yes. It’s kinda like what church is supposed to be. Practicing: Understanding. Forgiveness. Compassion.Hope. Faith.  No judgement. 
All of that exists here in our little bubble/online community here.

Thank you for allowing me to share my past struggles. And successes.

Anxiety, loneliness, cravings, and few distractions, not to mention detox, which can be dangerous.  Many of us are struggling really bad right now. 

Upfront, rehab isn't for everyone. When I was there, there were people who had been in, out and back in half a dozen times. For the ones who come back, some really want to try again, and that's amazing. One foot in front of the other, one more time. Others are back because they got another DUI and if you ask them, they are not alcoholics and life is unfair.

I tried to stop on my own over and over for a couple of years. I couldn't get past 30 days. When my life got unbearable, I checked in. In my case, there was no doing it on my own.

Thank God I did. I needed a medical detox. My blood pressure shot up to stroke level over and over. I had hallucinations. Not fun.

Neither was the rehab part. Class after class, speaker after speaker, hospital food and at one point, a shady roommate. But there was also volleyball, and I made a few friends.

With an alcoholic family, I thought I understood addiction. The classes showed me otherwise. Now my life made sense to me, and I understood what was happening in my brain and body, and what to do about it.

After 30 days I was discharged I and went into intensive outpatient. It was 6 hours a day, 5 days a week for a month. I didn't want to go. I had bills. But again, after I got there it made sense. I needed this too. So I stayed and graduated the program.

I tried AA afterwards, but it's not for me. Seven months out, the cravings are gone, but occasionally pop up. I count to 10, and they pass. If I feel a relapse coming, you better believe I will be back in AA. We are all trying together and they do help.

Rehab may not be for you. But I will say that it was absolutely what I needed when I needed it. My bills got paid eventually. Everything always works itself out. I'm not trying to sell anyone on this, just saying there's no shame in trying, or trying again as the case may be.

Couldn't have done it without /r/stopdrinking,"Hello beautiful people of /r/stopdrinking.  Today is my one year anniversary of sobriety.  For me, the first 4 months was a monumental struggle. So many things could have gone wrong for me, and I had to avoid taking the path of least resistance. Unfortunately for me, my career was alcohol as I worked in a bar. After losing my job, I actually had numerous very convenient, well-paying offers that could've gotten me out of the financial hole I was in, but they also involved me being in alcohol-centric environments with alcohol-centric coworkers, and that was a non-starter. Having to basically jettison my career since I couldn't find any comparable income with my qualifications and job history was the first very major hurdle.

Then came my mental health.  Even 4 months after quitting I was dead inside and it got to a very,  very bad point where I probably should've been at a psych ward.  Luckily though, this is no longer the case. Everyone is different, but for me, the moment I took lexapro I knew it was going to work. My suicidal thoughts dissolved as my mind and body acclimated to the medication over the course of months.  My consciousness was no longer an inferno that needed to be escaped. It took me having to leave the city I was in  at 32 years old to live with my mom in order to have the space I needed to recover mentally and financially, and also to remove myself from the endlessly abundant alcohol on every corner, and walkable bars so close to my apartment which I thought it would be better to avoid so early in sobriety.

Despite the crazy state of the world right now, I'm much calmer, more serene, and more at ease with myself and my surroundings. I just want to say to anyone just starting out, that it is worth it.  I still struggle with not drinking sometimes, but not in an itchy, reflexive, or urgent way. I know that it is better if I just don't drink for now.

I just want to thank the people here on /r/stopdrinking for getting me through the first few months and occasional questioning moments further down the road.  I am certain I would've failed if it weren't for this community (which btw was my only support outside of therapy and close family).  The world sucks right now, but I promise that drinking will not make it better for you. Thanks, IWNDWYT",229,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9946330785751343}"

It has helped me stop various times, the first time was just under two months and the second time was a month. I'm trying my best right now during the imposed curfew my state has. Luckily we have strict alcohol laws, like no alcohol between 10pm-9am and alcohol is only sold in liquor stores (even beer). I just turned 21 a few months ago and drinking has lost its previous novelty, yet for some reason I can't control myself when I *do drink.* I'm not your stereotypical alcoholic, throwing dollar bottles of vodka into my coffee or sneaking drinks in at work -- but I *am* an alcoholic. I've lied to my lover's face, meanwhile he could smell liquor on my breath (said I had two beers the other day, causing a huge fight where he told me he's had enough of my drunk ass over the years doing him wrong).   


He stopped drinking for two and a half years when he recently relapsed. He has an iron will though, and seeing him motivates me, but still. I don't understand how I can continue to do this. My internship does random drug tests, so I can't lean on weed, which used to be my go-to crutch with virtually zero side effects other than getting hungry and sleepy. I just got insurance and intended on going to an outpatient program for drug/alcohol abuse (prior history -- abuse of cocaine/xanax years ago plus PTSD, depression/anxiety)  but with covid-19, it's pretty impossible.  


I recently opened up to my counselor in the internship program and really told someone for the first time, a professional, that I have a drinking problem. A 5'3 woman shouldn't be pounding IPAs, Jameson and evan williams like it's juice, then pretending it's okay to be in debt with loved ones or forgetting horrible things/shameful things I've done while intoxicated. It's never an excuse or even a way to rationalize anything. I just put up such a big ass wall that everyone thinks I'm okay or enables me because if I say I'm okay, I MUST be okay.  


The biggest thing that's helping me right now is just simply taking it one day at a time versus taking an approach of ""if i can get through the week i can get through the year""  


Any help?

I was doing better, I thought I had my moment of clarity.  The desire was gone, I felt good for the first time in awhile.  

Last night I had a very tough shift at work, the stress started getting to me.  And that’s when the cravings crept back in.  I tried to fight it, stared at the beer cooler at the gas station for 10-15 minutes before finally giving in.  

Dealing with work was how my drinking went from casual to habitual.  I thought I was past it but that’s clearly not the case.  Now here I am, hungover yet again.  

I can’t keep doing this.  I hate that I keep doing this to myself.  Feeling like shit seems to not be enough of a deterrent.  I’m mostly healthy now (30m) but I know it won’t last forever if I don’t quit.  On top of that, I’m scared of being caught.  I need this job, if I get caught chugging beers in the parking lot I would surely be terminated.  

I’m at a loss now, I feel blindsided.  Sometimes it feels like the decision has already been made and I have no control.  In my head and heart I didn’t want it, but I still drove to store, still went to the beer cooler, screaming internally that I didn’t want or need it as I walked to the register.  And once it’s purchased, my brain convinced me that it’d be a waste of money to just throw it out, missing the irony of the fact the money was already wasted.

My AA meetings got cancelled and I can only talk to my therapist via videocall. It's not the same, to say the least.

I feel the immense feeling of being misunderstood and unwanted is growing within me, and it's growing rapidly. I can't help but remember, over and over, that I was an unwanted child. That I'm in love with someone currently engaged to someone else, so whatever love I'm capable of right now, it's all garbage. That I cannot, for the love of God, regain the connection I used to have with my friend.

I just feel so very lonely. I tried meeting new people, I tried dating (before the lockdown of course), but I feel it's all for nothing, because it's not what I need right now. I don't need another shallow interactions and synchronized social moves. I need something meaningful, for once. The people I meet are not what I need, I cannot form connection, I cannot speak their language.

I also learned on Tuesday the 10th that my estranged dad was put in the ICU after being found unresponsive in his home. I am thankful that he and I reconnected and reconciled some stuff this past holiday season after not speaking for decades. I came out to him and he accepted me, when my mother and older sister previously had not, and I cut them out of my life. my dad had several compounded health issues from being a lifelong alcoholic. I had to contact my sister (now estranged) and dump all the bad news on her. we had to collectively decide last Friday to remove life support after the doctor came back with several test results showing severe brain damage from multiple massive strokes and my dad still was not breathing on his own. he passed away on Sunday evening.

I was alone in my apartment for five days, but had the online support of friends to help me get through it. and I'm very glad that despite a few moments of temptation to slide back down a bottle of vodka, I remembered how past-me dealt with coming out to my mom and sister. drinking only made the difficult feeling worse and lengthened my period of grieving and trying to heal. it kept reopening the wound. this past weekend I was able to think clearly, process my emotions in a healthy manner, and lean in to my support network. this is reinforcing how important it was/is for me to get/stay sober after a decade and change of drinking every single night. I already physically feel better and am able to handle this challenging time in ways I did not expect. I want to thank this subreddit for posting their own stories and giving me hope and validation. for those staying sober, keep it up, and for those still not there yet.

tl;dr My job is to assist in resolving issues for our customers.  100% virtual, always has been. When the front line staff can't handle it, I get it to audit, work, and escalate to resolution.

Pre-Sobriety I got my work done effectively and have always had good reviews and awards.  Since returning from my Disney vacation, where I got sober (and since stumbled once or twice, bu the number above is accurate), I have been more focused and as my boss put it this morning, using a ""sharper blade to dissect issues"".

How did this come up? Well I've been sending my boss questions on things I am seeing.  I've been finding some pretty large ... irregularities. To be very clear:  Nothing illegal, nothing whistle blower, it's all internal within my company.  Basically managers covering for their employees when they shouldn't.  Coaching not being given.  Presentations to executives being altered.

My boss, who has always been supportive, brought them to her boss.  And now I'm in trouble.

Apparently, I pissed off the wrong person.  I called a few teams out on lax policies and not following internal procedures.  I went from pre-vacation reviewing 4-5 issues a day and sending out 1 or 2 coachings, to post vacation reviewing 15-20 issues a day and sending out 7-12 coachings.   The other managers are complaining about my work ethic.  and I got officially warned for being ""too productive"".  

I asked what changed, was I being rude (a known issue for me that I actively work on).  The answer was no.  It was that I was too productive now.  I was uncovering too many faults.  And that it may be better if I started drinking again, for the sake of my job.

The inquiry was made as to whether she was suggesting my job was on the line if I remained productive, i was given the ""I can't predict the future..."" line.  Then it was brought up that our executive was ""dissapointed"" that I didn't join them the other day for drinks.  I told her that was a low blow, and it sounded like she was advocating a return to the hooch.  

""I can't tell you what to do, all I can say is that you were doing well before. Now you are not.  We want the old you back.""

I'm destroyed.  I'm already ... more depressed than I should be (I don't think I've admitted that to anyone yet...).   STBXW pushing for visitation, even though she has no legal right (she stalled divorce for over a year while refusing to see her son, now that she realizes she went over the 12 months in my state for abandonment all of a sudden this is a priority).  Constantly telling me I can't be sober without ""a higher power"" and AA.  My kiddo, while I love him to death, has been constantly around due to this virus.  We are running out of toilet paper and even going to the store at open at 6am, nothing (I wish this was a joke).  I have a negative amount in my checking for the first time in years because of this goddamn virus (took cash out and stocked up, subscription services didn't decline like I thought they would, I'm the jerk).  I don't get paid until Friday. 

And now I'm told effectively my sobriety is hurting my job performance.

**Wow**……   it’s easy for me to get sucked in and *Consumed* with the headlines, the news, the screen feeds, the rumors…..    What can I do?  What can “we” do?  


We can pull together.  There’s > 200,000 members here!

Kindness to Others helps them and helps me.

For some reason, I am reminded of the book by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, but I keep hearing the title in my head as “*Love in  The Time of Corona*”.


First priority is I must remember what the airlines tell me:  “*Put on your mask before helping others*”…..    

So, first for me, is to remember that Alcohol WANTS me isolated….  Consumed with my thinking of My-Self and all the things that are going on for me, especially the negative thoughts that create Worry, Stress and Anxiety…..   the Uncertainties!  The Fears!  The “What Will Happen!?”  If there was ever a perfect storm for a drink or a relapse, this certainly has all the ingredients of the recipe.  If I stew in that mix and in isolation, the voice will tell me that “a drink can make that better”.  That’s A LIE

So, how do I “put my mask on first”?

First:  Wash my hands.  Social distance.  Avoid “crowds”.  Second:  I need to be “Active”.  I can’t just hibernate and sit on the couch.  I’m doing a lot of “outdoor” things….  Walking, hiking, biking……   The gym is closed so we’re doing Yoga and calisthenics.  Contact some “gym regulars” and talk to them.

Then, start helping others.  What can you think of?  If I’m in  a condo or apartment building, it’s likely to have seniors.  They are already fearful of going out.  I can check on them and ask if I can go to the store for them?  Can I walk their dog?  Can I take the trash out for them? If I'm in a residential neighborhood, I have some seniors.  Same thing.

If there is a college/university near me, likely some students have no where to go if they’ve been told to ‘depart their dorms’.  Have a spare bedroom?  Know someone?  If nothing else, reach out and tell them you’re thinking about them.

Businesses that are closed are giving away toilet paper in their stock rooms.  What else can they do?

Bars and restaurants are closed or closing.  Those people who work there need support, connection and that someone cares for them.  I’ve got a  few favorite neighborhood restaurants, I will check on them.   Amazon needs 100,000 people NOW!  If we share here in our community we can harness our Kindness, Compassion and Creativity to help our fellow SoberNauts.

But most importantly for me, is I realize that a LOT of people have worry, stress, anxiety.  I will HEAR them.  I will first say “Hello”.  Then, I will look them in the eye and say “I’m a little worried about all this.  A lot of uncertainty.  I’m afraid of what is happening and will happen.  What about you?”   Then I will listen Kindly.  I will repeat back some of the things they tell me.  I will tell them that I care about them.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Also: I posted a version this in someone else’s thread, but now 
I just read the community guidelines (should have done that before posting!) realise I have inadvertently tried to hijack someone else’s thread for my own purposes. I’m sorry. I do want to say that I am not intoxicated right now.


I drank all day everyday from Friday until yesterday. After 31 days sober and feeling great.

I excused it with all kinds of excuses (starting to work from home, feeling anxious and scared about those people who can’t work from home, or can’t work at all, “just one drink before everybody goes and starts  social distancing”).

It wasn’t “just one drink”. Of course it wasn’t. It started with a glass of wine at the pub, and ended with me hiding and taking tiny sips of freaking COOKING SAKE all throughout yesterday.

And now, several hours after my last sips emptied the bottle,  I am staring at the ceiling at 4:07 in the morning, feeling guilty and making myself paranoid that I am going to have withdrawals but won’t be able to go to hospital - because who is stupid enough to drink during a pandemic? Dumb-dumb me, that’s who. 

And feeling that my housemate / best friend will realise j am going through withdrawals, find out that I caved, and that I have been lying to him for 4 days. He’s seen me relapse again and again. I’m scared he won’t support me anymore - And I am scared to be social-isolating for the next who-knows-how-many months living with someone that I’ve disappointed.

A feat I didn’t think I would ever reach. And now, sober life feels so “normal” to me. It doesn’t control my life like alcohol did, it’s just...life. 

Still dealing with some anxiety and on and off depression (I used alcohol to numb these both for 17 years), but I’m working on those in a healthy and productive way.

I finally have a strong relationship with my wife and two daughters. I can feel optimistic about my future because I am a functioning member of society, instead of drinking myself to sleep every night on the couch and waking up with a beer in my hand at 6am. 

I can’t believe how calm I can be sometimes now. I used to rage out of control, sometimes blindly and without remorse. Now, I can step back from situations and look at them with a clear head.

I’ve been able to enjoy my hobbies. Woodworking, painting and general outdoorsy stuff. I can freely go wherever I want, where prior I had to make sure they had booze before I would go. 

I’ll say this. Life can be really great. It really can. Booze and drugs put up a barrier that didn’t allow me to see that. I thought life was miserable and everything was a joke. But now I see how beautiful life can really be. I know that sounds cliche or whatever, but hey it’s true to me. It’s not all roses and shit either, but now I can confidently handle tough situations where before I would crumble.

I guess it’s hard for me to stay calm when there’s a sudden shift in reality, everywhere I go. I get angry, fearful. My company still isn’t addressing the problem and that compounds my anxiety. I got off of work, went to the store where I had massive problems parking because I had a bad day and decided in that moment I wanted to be selfish and I let others’ actions get into my head. Anger. Fear. I walked in and front and center is the giant wine selection. Wow. What a day. Obviously walked right past laughing and joking how that would be great because my angry mind is not a rational one. It’s not me. Thanks for reading.

* Get back into photography, have at least 300 processed images.

* Create a scene in Houdini that involves a detailed landscape, cloth simulation, particle simulation.

* Finish the AA Big Book

* Finish AA 12 and 12, work on the steps.

* Start my day by doing 3 x 15 push ups, and 60 crunches.

* End my day by doing 3 x 15 push ups, and 60 crunches.

* Clean and organize my apartment. Make it inviting to have friends over.

* Run around my block 10 times, 3 times a week. (if there's no lockdown).

* Start and finish Witcher game.

* Learn to meditate.

Feel free to post your lists here too, we should all check in on each other.

I'm almost mad at myself for losing my ability to moderate.

-I’m a better human to my partner, myself, my family, my friends, strangers, and society as a whole when I’m not drunk

I keep my diet pretty healthy and despite all this I still had issues urging me to drink or self medicate if you will. I get myself so worked up. I am on day 2 of staying in bed and I realized I need extra help. I went to research what would help with anxiety and depression with the goal of setting up a doctors appointment and finally fessing up to how I really feel. At this point I was willing to fork up the outrageous co payment I would have to not only see the doctor but for any meds they would prescribe as well. And that is when I came across “K Health” online. At first I was skeptical but felt so hopeless I was willing to give it a shot. It appeared to be extremely affordable and I didn’t have to get out of bed.(lol) I signed up downloaded the app went through the entire process and they connected me with a doctor who I was able to share everything with through the app. She gave me good feedback, with reference links for therapy and prescribed me anti anxiety/ depression meds that should be here in 5-7days. All for $30 a month. For me compared to my current insurance rates this is a steal. She prescribed Lexapro and will be checking in with me every two weeks via the app. (No extra fee) I feel good about this knowing I am taking the steps necessary for my mental health.

And though I am so mad at myself right now I know that I must continue, get up, dust off and carry on. I made the fatal mistake of getting away from myself and my sobriety. I was watching YouTube videos last night about getting back on track and I came across something that said you have to treat your sobriety like remission, no matter how many days you have under your belt you are never “cured”. The thoughts were creeping back into my head for a couple of weeks and rather then address them I let them be, I let them fester. My original goal was to stop drinking for 365 days and I was telling myself this weekend I can’t wait to have a drink on day 366. (That should of been my clue I was in danger) I started to negotiate and reason with the idea of having a drink. Just one drink won’t hurt right? Besides life is too hard and there is no way I will never have a drink again. I fell for the trap. I started out by measuring my drinks to stay in my calorie range. So stupid lol, sure enough that all went out the window as I finished the bottle of wine called an Uber and went to the local bar. That is always how it goes with me, it’s never just one, I am a true alcoholic. It’s hard not to feel hopeless, it’s hard to love myself right now. It’s hard to make any promises so I’m not going to.

Sore throat, stuffy nose, bit of a cough. First thing I thought was..well FOR FUCK SAKES! I JUST got over a nasty head cold that lasted a good 3 weeks. Yes it was just a head cold. It was ALL up in my sinuses. On top of that I am trying to remain sober with oh god...so many slip ups. I have been on this sub so many times. I am a long time repeat offender but a constant...I am trying at least. I have some long periods of sobriety and then not so good periods of drinking.   


Lately though when I drink my kidneys and now liver are starting to hurt. Like unfreakingBEARABLE pain. Brings me to my knees and breathing through the pain, type of pain. I know I need to go to the doctors for THAT issue but right now...with all this COVID stuff I am trying to detox my body and let the hospitals deal with this situation first. When the health system isn't so overloaded I will go and get the bloodwork done. I already have kidney stone issues but the liver hurting..that one is what really got me going oh fuck...  


So a little back story, and some of you may already know this from my posts, but my husband also struggles with alcohol. Together when we drink we get really toxic. And when I try to quit I never asked him to quit since I know its a decision he has to make on his own. Things in our marriage got..really rough. To a point where I was planning on taking the kids and leaving. But I was scared and hadn't done that yet. I commented on a post how I was getting to that point and he found it. And he was understandably upset. But instead of screaming and yelling it was a complete and emotional breakdown from him. And seeing him breakdown made me feel like shit. I love him and I honestly didn't want to cause him such pain. But I was in pain too. So we finally did what we should have done a while ago and REALLY talked about it. I finally said all the things I was to afraid to say to him because as soon as he would get home he would drink. Or there would be vodka around and I had been drinking and it wasn't the right time to have that convo. It was a conversation we both needed to be 100% completely sober for.   


At one point he went into another room to collect himself, and I did the same. A LOT of emotions are going right now. None of which was anger though, which I was always afraid of. I was worried that because we are both hot headed that we wouldn't listen to each other and not process what we are really saying to one another. Eventually we came back together and started talking and he apologized. But it wasn't the usual I'm sorry, It's ok lets move on and just bury our feelings apology. It was the most heartfelt, genuine apology he has ever given me in the almost 8 years of marriage. It felt like he really and truly meant it. He held me and looked in my eyes and said I need you, I will try.   


Those 3 words, I will try. I lost it. I broke down. The feelings I had been having, the emotional struggle I have been in for months, it all came out. I was broken down into someone I promised I would never get back too. Years and years ago I was in an emotionally abusive relationship that brought me to suicide attempts and broke me as a person. I had gotten to that place again and this time it was worse because our children are involved. I hate the person that I have become again. But after laying all this out to him, explaining just how broken I am because of this and him recognizing it and apologizing and meaning it. I was done. I literally couldn't even hold myself up anymore. My legs started to give out and thankfully my husband was there to literally catch me and hold me up. I let all this pent up emotion out finally. He has never seen me break down like this before either. I started hyperventalating, sobbing uncontrollably and he just held me and rubbed my back and cried with me.   


This all happened Thursday last week. Since then things have been different so far. We are taking it day by day. He is trying. And I know how hard this is going to be because I am also trying. And not just to quit drinking. I am resolved to be a better wife and mother. This isn't just about him finally being ready to try and quit. I also need to change a lot in order for me to get back to being the person I want to be. We have been more attentive with each other. We are talking more and not just sitting there and doing our own things and not talking. I went for a nap on Sunday and woke up to see him playing Lego's with our son. He was playing Roblox with our daughter. Instead of staying up all night drinking and coming to bed at 1 or 2 in the morning he is coming to bed by 11 which is amazing. I have to go to bed early because I wake up at 4am for work. So im usually in bed no later then 9:30. Actually for a while there he wouldn't come to bed at all, he would pass out at his computer chair and just sleep there. I felt very lonely. But he's been coming to bed and we have been cuddling and its been amazing.   


Its still early, but its been amazing. I am feeling hopeful. It will be easier for me to quit if alcohol isn't always present in the house. And it will be good for him to have someone going through the same thing as him, to know the emotions and struggle getting sober is, to go through it together. This will be better for our kids. And now with this pandemic, its almost the perfect time to get sober. I am self isolating as of today. There is absolutely 0 alcohol in the house so no temptation. Our kids are with my parents for spring break and doing a self isolation of their own. My dad lives on a farm in a different province (Canada) and they were planning on going out to his farm for spring break already. So he made sure he has enough supplies to take the kids and isolate out there. Until today I was still going to work (retail) so I was around the public a lot and didn't want to risk getting my kids sick. Its a very tough situation and a very difficult decision that my husband and I made to send them away during this time. I feel more relaxed knowing my parents have them and are completely covered in regards to supplies. I am in a city where panic buying is very much rampant and I worried about being able to just feed my children.   


This will also be a good time for the kids to be away for the next little bit while my husband and I start sobriety. I'm already a week in and I have been through this many times so I know what to expect out of the early days. I don't know if my husband really knows though. We are getting ourselves better. In the long run, I think this is the right decision. And thankfully my family is extremely supportive in all of this. Nothing but absolute love and support from them. So like the title of this long winded post says..I am trying to stay positive. In a time when personally I am unsure of what the future holds, and when the world has no idea what the future holds as well. I am positive. IWNDWYT

Things he only used to say during a drunken argument. I woke up with a headache (not sure why, lack of food maybe) and no desire to go to work. Feels almost like a hangover and that sucks. But I have to because my office is definitely going to expect folks to show up for the foreseeable future. The tense atmosphere around there is not helping at all. I have therapy today, but we found out yesterday that my husband's appointments are cancelled for the next month bc his Dr is diabetic and is taking every precaution. I totally understand that, just sad there wasn't an alternative option over the phone or video chat. I fear my therapist will stop appointments if the hospital we go to starts to limit people in and out. I've dealt with the fear and uncertainty ok for the past couple of weeks, but I'm terrified now. My husband is a baker and my mom (we all live together) is a server. I don't have a normal positive way to wrap this up, just needed to vent and cry some more before I got my day started.

Tonight I was responding to a post and thought of something kind of sad that rings true for me. Long story short, my mom drank from when I was born until she passed away when I was 24. I saw her sober twice. I got to know her mostly through journals from many rehab clinics. I don’t remember much of my childhood.


Tonight I thought about the kinds of interactions I had with her when we were alone. I remember sitting with her quietly while she sobbed in bed in the afternoon. I remember her crying out asking why was this happening to her. Even when I was too young to understand anything that was going on, I know I wanted to help her. I always wanted to help her against a cruel world, and she always promised she would figure things out and find a way to spend time with me. It never worked.


Tonight for the first time as an adult I’m able to see that my life follows a pattern of seeking people to fix and being sorely disappointed in them. I usually hold them to an impossible standard or an agreement that we never made together but is instead similar to the unfulfilled promises of my mother. This pattern began before I understood I was making decisions that would affect the rest of my life. I don’t need to be ashamed of it, but if I understand it then I can start to change it. 


Maintaining healthier relationships is a goal I’ve set for my newly sober self. It’s rocky at first being fully responsible for all my actions, but with steady aim I’m bound to get there.",12,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9807018637657166}"

I have been trying to stop on and off for a couple of years now. I go through the same cycle of racking up sober days, feeling really good, then for some reason I break before I get to day 30. I haven’t been 30 days without a drink in over 10 years. I know I can’t “just have one or two” without having 20. 

I have a young child who I need to support and be a better parent for. And a loving wife who has stuck around for probably longer than she should have at this point. 

Drinking has been a way for me to socialise (I have had huge anxiety around people) and has been a way for me to deal with depression and feelings. But it’s gotten to a point where I’m in my thirties now and I can’t keep doing it to myself or my loved ones. 

I work in a bottle shop, literally handling hundreds of bottles of alcohol each day. It’s always there. And I get it for free if I want it. I haven’t paid for a drink in over a year. I realise I need to find somewhere else to work.

You’d think for an introvert like me, this distancing thing would be awesome, but in fact I don’t love it. For one thing, in my job, I still have to go to work (so far anyway) as I am support staff and our owners are telling us that basically they’re not letting the support staff wfh unless the government does some sort of mandate. But beyond that, I do not like having to stay in and away from people totally. I am very into small doses of fellow humans. The interaction required to buy a coffee or some takeout is just about perfect for me. A smile, a quick observation about the weather, thanks bye, then back home to my dogs and SO who is also an introvert and likes to hang out in his office a lot and my books. This distancing means we shouldn’t even go out for coffee-- what a bummer. 

And don’t even get me started about the gym. 

But here we are, alone together, with lots of homebound time on our hands (except for our amazing service industry and health care industry people, for whom we are even more grateful than usual these days).

We won’t judge you! 

I watched Kenneth Branagh’s 1996 adaptation of *Hamlet* the other day with some of the extra free time I had. It is 4 hours long, after all, so not something one returns to again and again for a quick re-watch. To be honest I was on my laptop and phone also throughout the 4 hours reading headlines and laughing at memes and whatnot, but it was great to look up and catch some superb acting going on on my big screen between memes.

Also read Carrie Fisher’s *Wishful Drinking* last week, which is actually really funny and delightful for a book about addiction, mental illness, and electroshock treatments. It’s also quick. It probably took me all totaled less time to read it then to watch Kenneth Branaugh’s *Hamlet*.  I liked her part about first being diagnosed as an alcoholic when in rehab:

“ . . . to soften the blow of this arguably awkward new way of looking at yourself-- they enumerate a number of other famous and accomplished folks who have also struggled with (and enjoyed) alcoholism.” She tosses off a list of historical or celebrity alcoholics then says “Now I don’t think they’re implying that you could be great, but those people weren’t exactly losers . . . so relax and join the ranks of great ex-drunks who staggered the earth before you.” It’s full of gems like that.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It’s my birthday and officially I have now passed the age for which I promised myself 11 years ago I would stop drinking for good. 

Wow. 11 years has passed since I realized I had a problem with alcohol and I kept on for a decade despite the realization. I’ve had not just 1 but 3 hardcore rock bottoms incl. passing out in my own vomit at a Burger King toilet this summer. I could have died and not even that was “enough” for me to stop drinking. I’ve had over 400 relapses. I’ve been in fights with people, I have no friends left from university because they all remember me as this drunken lying maniac, I’ve nearly lost my job over and over, I haven’t managed to stay faithful in any of my relationships because I’ve numbed myself completely - and to tell you the truth: alcohol deteriorates your emphaty and your sense of the world around you. I know now that drinking heavily since I was 15 has destroyed me mentally, physically and spiritually. 
I find myself literally hating half of my life. It’s like starring into a complete darkness. 

I was so desperate that I started praying. I started praying that something serious would happen that would make me stop drinking. 16
Books on sobriety, recovery, countless AA meetings, 4 years of intensive therapy,
All medicine available from naltrexone to Antabuse (which I drank in anyway) to being on antidepressants for 13 years, NOTHING has worked and made me stay sober for more than a month. So for months I have been lying at night praying that I would get cancer or some serious disease since my fucked-up addict broken brain can’t understand and accept no drinking. I know it’s horrible, I am writing this in tears, but I was so desperate that I knew only two things could save me. 1) spiritual awakening (very unlikely since I’m an atheist and live in a serious atheist society, I don’t even know any religious people) 2) A serious disease that physically would sober me up. 
I was infected with corona a week ago and I think it is the best thing that has happened to me. I honestly mean it. I know when I get healthy again that the real work starts. But I couldn’t manage on my own to stay sober for a week. Now I’m in week 1 and have no cravings. The thought of drinking is so repulsive to me right now. Besides, I’ve lost my ability to smell and taste so there goes the whole bullshit “I’m drinking for the taste of the wine” argumentation. 

I will not drink with you today.

(Long but from the heart),"Struggling to sleep tonight because of a crappy bed mostly I think. But as my brain always does, it rolls on as I try to fall back asleep. So you can chalk this thought up to being tired I guess but I’m putting it out there anyway.

Sobriety has given me that clarity that many of us experience and wanting to heal and be a better person has brought me to a place of deep reflection. I have been fighting with the reasons why I can’t let go of my wife. Was it the comfort and companionship I had come to rely on for almost 20 years.... partly sure. How about the fact that she is the mother of my amazing daughter and someone I greatly admire in her strength, grace, intelligence and kindness.... fine sold. But there seemed to be something deeper that I couldn’t put my finger on that I just may have stumbled across that I can’t overlook or not explore.

Every person of importance in my life, close friends, family members, family members-in-law.... everyone really, has over the last 18 or so years, said to me in one way or another “how did you get her” or “ man she is too good for you” or “don’t screw that up”. Now I do have to say that she is the most incredible person that I have ever known and she deserves 10 fold all the admiration that she receives. That being said she does have her faults like everyone, she is human after all and by that I mean she can be an insufferable know it all at times among other things. All I’m saying is that she is not perfect... for the record.

Somewhere in the back of my head maybe I felt like I didn’t deserve her or was not worthy of her in some way. Not being worthy of the sacrifices she made to be with me and start a family. Forgoing her master’s degree and what was sure to be a life and a career of greatness. I put her in an ivory tower. I’ve learned that if you hear an idea enough times that it benches into your subconscious and affects your thoughts and beliefs on an emotional level without your knowledge or control. Logically I know that she made these choices out of love and commitment to our relationship freely. We went though some very hard times together over the years that made us stronger but my spiral of addiction drove a wedge between us and my broken promises and deception so many times was too much. Was part of the reason i got so low my feelings of inadequacy? Not being worthy? In the end the hope I would get better on my own or finally reach out for real help had gone. Lines we crossed emotionally that couldn’t be uncrossed.

I guess what I’m saying is that perhaps the reason I can’t let go and accept that I will never be with her again, (even when she says that emotions are a funny thing or that who knows how she will feel in the future and especially the fact that she allows me live in the home we build together because I literally have no other place to go even though we are not together anymore), is that now that I have beaten back my demon and I am living sober, growing and healing one day at a time, I realize that I’m becoming the man I should have been for all those years. I’m slowly seeing that I’m someone I CAN respect and admire because there are good qualities in me. Someone who believes he is worthy of her and is her equal. A person who could love and fully support her as a partner not just a lucky drunk trying not to fuck it up. 

That, In part at least is why I haven’t been able to accept my loss I think. At first it was the guilt and grief that tried to bargain for another chance or a way back but as the days march on it grew to something else.... desire for something new. Even if I didn’t understand why. The realization doesn’t change the situation between us but it has given me something more to think about and consider. I’m learning that my addiction is complex and multi layered and as I work through this every day I look for new angles and perspectives on what brought me to this point and how I can move forward. And since most of my support system is unavailable because of this stupid virus, you my friends get to be the frontline of my emotional diarrhea lol. 

Again it could just be the lack of sleep talking but if you made it this far I thank you and if you want to give your thoughts or impressions I will always accept them good or bad because I need the outside opinions like a councillor or therapist would give. And what are they but a person you pay to listen and give advice based on their own experience.

I have been lurking here for the past two weeks while I try to stop drinking...again. 

Even just reading the encouragement to other posts here has been more helpful than anything I have tried before.

I am (*was*..please let it be *was* this time) one of those low quantity, high frequency drinkers who will drink 3-4 beers every week night and a six pack each night on the weekend to ward off my crippling anxiety about having to intact with the world the next day. 

I tell myself that drinking has never caused me any 'real' problems, but I am literally pissing away a couple of hundred dollars a month on alcohol and waking up hungover, anxiety ridden and with no motivation.

So after finishing of my last slab two weeks ago, I told myself I wouldn't buy anymore more...and so far I haven't.

But I also told myself I'd be fine just having one or two drinks if friends or family offered them - after all, I'm really only worried about the financial consequences, right?

...I'm pretty sure I'm lying to myself here.

I don't think I would stop at one or two free beers - I'm pretty sure I'd remember how good it feels to not care so much and just go buy more for myself.

But I don't want to be that person anymore.

I don't want to be controlled by the urge to go out just to buy alcohol.

I don't want to hesitate to spend $50 on a video game that looks interesting, only to turn around and blow twice the amount on alcohol without a second thought. 

Thankfully, no one has offered me anything, and I haven't had a drink for almost 15 days, but I'm terrified the second someone offers me anything, I'm going to fail.

I thought I just wanted to save money, but I have come to the conclusion I just don't want to drink anymore.

The last 15 days have been hard, but they have also been wonderful.

So, thank you SD.

Thank you for letting  me get out these feels so I can spend another day without alcohol.

It got worse over the years due to heavy drinking. Dec. 2018, I spent the holidays in Ft. Lauderdale, loaded everyday, some nights much heavier than others. A few days in, after a night of saki, bourbon, and beer, I woke up in bed fully dressed, but wearing someone else’s dress coat. I apparently took it from a bar stool the night before. Anyway, I stood up, walked maybe two steps in my hotel room, and the constant, deep, gnawing pain just under my right rib cage that I’ve been dealing with for so many years turned into a few blasts of sharp, stabbing pain. It scared the hell out of me. The room started to spin and I thought I’d have a panic attack worrying that I’d just done some major organ damage. Gradually, my breathing stabilized and I got it together. Of course, as we do, I was drinking the same amount within a few hours. After that trip I swore I would take a break and I have. After all this time, the pain is still there, so I finally decided to be straight with my doc to see what damage I’d done.

I’ve had a physical, endoscopy, and an ultra sound of my major organs and digestive tract. Amazingly, I just learned today that the pain is from gastritis in my duodenum - everything else is 100% normal. I’ve spent years obsessing over this, even, on more than one occasion, thinking I was on my way out and preparing for death, so it will take time for this to actually sink in. I guess the lesson is be open with your doc if you have any health concerns you think could be due to your drinking. They won’t judge you as they see this all the time. When I first told my doc he mentioned he has patients who can’t go an hour without a drink - not me at all, but, the point is, they’ve seen it all.",9,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9969942569732666}"

I told myself back then I'd just try one year, and see how it went. I figured a one-year commitment would be a serious one that I could evaluate reasonably fairly.

I've saved buckets of money, I'm sure, or at least spent them on more productive things. I've started a real workout regime and put on a little muscle. I've managed to deal with a frankly shitty job with some reasonable grace. I have interviews on the horizon.

I still struggle pretty hard with persistent depressive disorder. I still really don't like my home situation. None of my problems has really just gone away.

But my partner says I blow up less. That's a good thing. I guess I shouldn't expect a huge turnaround, since frankly, my ""rock bottom"" was not very low.

So do I now decide to start drinking again? I'm kind of leaning towards not. I certainly remember liking the feeling, and being a whiskey snob is fun too, and people think I'm a fun drunk. But they don't have to deal with my rages and depression.

That's it. I don't feel a big inspiration, but if you need to know it's possible, here's one more person saying yes, you can do it.

I never thought I would have made it this far. And I definitely wouldn't have without the support of this community, AA meetings, and talking with other recovering addicts and alcoholics. Here are the lessons I've learned over the past 100 days without alcohol:

1. **Everyone's recovery is unique.** What works for you might not work for someone else. Some people need to go to AA meetings every single day to stay sober, some can get away going once a year to pick up a chip. Some can chat on this subreddit and that's enough for them. It's all okay -- everyone has different ways of dealing with problem drinking. Find what works for you, and be honest with yourself.

2. **Not drinking isn't a magic fix to life.** I thought when I quit drinking my life would be propelled into the next dimension. Things I found difficult would become easy, success would be around the corner, that promotion would happen just a month after a quit. Guess what? Not a whole lot has changed honestly. I still find it difficult to make friends like I did before. It still sucks to force myself to go exercise. I still am single and am afraid of dating. I still struggle with anxiety and depression. Those problems remain and it will undoubtedly take a tremendous effort to change them -- but at least now I have a fighting chance.

3. **You don't have to listen to the fleeting thoughts.** The little voice that still comes into my head once in a while prodding me to 'Just go have a beer', 'Have that glass of wine with dinner', 'Take a shot, it's New Years for God's sake!' isn't going anywhere any time soon. It's probably something I'll have to live with for a long time. But now I see that voice for what it is: just a voice. Before, it was a command from on high that I absolutely had to obey. But now, I can just let him whisper in my ear and let it go right out the other. 

4. **It's so, so easy to forget where you came from.** It's remarkable to me how just a few months sober has made me forget how miserably I was living FOR YEARS. The waking up to vomit in the middle of the night. The neighbors checking in with me because they heard drunken shouting coming from my apartment. The embarassing conversations with friends during a night out. The fearful one-eye open checking of my bank account to witness the damage. The inability to deal with a bad day without sending myself into oblivion. I forget all that stuff so quickly that just a few months later I can find myself saying 'You can handle it'. I can't handle it. I've proven that 1,001 times over. And it's important to remember that.

5. **This is just the beginning of a lifelong journey.** This one scares me, but it also gives me hope. I've spent a decade of my life focused on drugs and alcohol. It was central to my functioning and overnight that crutch disappeared. I've had to fill my time with activities that take me out of my comfort zone. Every day sober is now the longest I've *ever* been sober consecutively -- and that can be terrifying. But it is also a constant reminder that I'm just a little bit stronger in my recovery today than I was yesterday. And that gives me hope that I can keep going.

Thanks if you took the time to read this, it means a lot to me and I wish the best for everyone on this journey with me.

Just wanted to check-in with you all and share that I just completed a sober spring break. My wife had the week off from school and I took the week off from my job to join her. Spent most of the time cleaning up the garage to prepare for my new hobby, kayak fishing. 

It was nice to get out on the water and enjoy the weather. It was mostly a positive experience, but I admit, I had a difficult time seeing all the spring breakers partying on their pontoon boats. At one point I had to leave and remove myself from the situation because the temptation and the refusal to give in was just too much. When I got home my wife said I was acting dodgey and she was worried that I can drank and was trying to hide it. In reality, I was just having a hard time and I felt defeated by my cravings and didn't get want to talk.

I know cravings are feelings that will pass and I'm glad that I didn't drink. I'm hopeful that I can break the association between alcohol and fun. I want to be a non-drinker, someone who doesn't drink, not because they choose not to, but because they don't even think about it. I don't want to be a dry drunk, someone fighting for sobriety every day.

Who knows? My day counter is still pretty low, so we'll see how I progress over time. I truly want this time to be recovery rather than hiatus.

Those are two major life changes on top of each other, and the end of two loves. Toxic loves, but loves nonetheless. And it's only March. 

I was doing pretty well and feeling good about making these choices. But it hasn't been easy. I can't lie, I miss them both sometimes so much. I had really hoped that he and I would get sober together, and that our bond was strong enough to carry us together to a better place, but that was never going to happen, so I had to go it alone. I live in Europe far, far away from my family and friends, so I've been dealing with these things more or less alone. I have great family and friends who support me, and I'm so grateful for that, but they aren't here. I can't have them over for dinner, or meet up with them for a coffee. Or even just get a fucking hug. And I've needed a hug in the worst way.

On Thursday the US travel ban on people from europe was announced and so the visit my sister had planned for early April was also cancelled. That was a big blow. I was looking forward to it so much, but I didn't realise just how much I needed it until it was taken away.

I failed my last attempt and I know it was definitely because my thoughts and motivation weren’t on the right track - something mostly resulting from drinking and smoking weed. As a result, I’ve decided to cut them out, and I would go as far as a couple weeks then either: a) achieve something academically, like a good grade or a productive week, b) get bored or c) opposite of A, when I don’t do well ........ which prompt me to drink. 

I don’t know. I’m pretty young and I’ve had a few setbacks with alcohol and weed and I know my life would flourish without either, but there’s something that just brings me back... 

I don’t like thinking like this because it makes me  believe in a natural tendency towards booze - which is partly true, but a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

Any advice guys? I think my first goal is to achieve 90 days but honestly I just wanna quit this shit forever. I just lose focus sometimes and say “oh just one night isn’t gonna harm me... I’ll probably stop after today anyway, I got exams that will stress me enough to avert me from drinking.”

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Not drinking has gotten easy, but does the brain fog ever get better?","I don't really know what I'm trying to say or supposed to say, but I quit drinking about a month ago.  I'm a male in my young 30s with a wife and one young child.  Obviously drinking has always been a problem, but this year it kind of turned into a now or never situation.  I wasn't drinking every day, but I was drinking to the point of black out anywhere from 2 to 5 times a week.  Usually the higher end.  This has been pretty much the last 10 years, but I drank quite a bit before I was 21 too. It's probably more realistic to say I've been a heavy drinker for 15 years, although I don't think I was necessarily dependent for that long.

Anyways, a big reason I quit was that I was started to feel dumb.  I'm having difficulty remembering things and thinking clearly.  I feel like there's a weight on my brain and I don't really want to participate in doing anything.  It's like I can still think and still access memories, but my brain really doesn't want to and makes me pay for it.  I've tried to quit many, many times but this problem has actually made it incredibly easy to quit (so far).  What I'm worried about is that it's permanent.  I've obviously read a lot about the brain and alcohol since, WKS, etc.  I quit pretty optimistic about improving, but unfortunately I'm almost at the 30 day mark and despite reading about how my brain should be exploding with new brain cells, it hasn't really happened.  I've been taking a lot of vitamins, B-complex, everything.  Running, reading, TRYING to make my brain expand.  It just hasn't really changed.  I'm getting pretty depressed about it because it makes life extremely frustrating.  I don't even really know when it started.

I have a a cognitive/memory test scheduled via a neurologist.  I'm trying to eliminate any other possibility than alcohol I guess.  Or get a professional opinion. But I'd also like the opinion of other long time drinkers who quit.  I didn't really go through withdraw other than nausea.

Two months ago this would mean a few things: I would absolutely be some sort of drunk for two weeks straight, getting let go from my job for obvious poor quality/absence, or dead. Now, I have finally established a healthy weekly routine, diet, exercise, multiple meetings a day, working outside of those meetings with my sponsor, and staying on top of bills and properly getting my dog exercise and plenty of loving attention.

I had all of the risk factors: genetics, depression, abusive parents, and on and on, including some they didn't even mention.  I guess instead of feeling ashamed that I had a problem with alcohol, I should have understood how stacked the cards were against me and sought help sooner, as in years ago.

As it is, I got to punch out before so much of the damage Bette wrought upon herself.  I'm free of liver damage (recently checked), have great coordination, am not depressed, and so on.  I think my mind mostly works but it's pretty hard to tell from in here (sad chuckle).  In short, I seem to be perfectly healthy.  It could have been so much worse.  

I saw a potential (and horrible) future for me in the description of Diogenes syndrome.  I'm almost a recluse as it is, even healthy and full of energy I tend to hide out.  Of course, as a vegan I'd never order meat online and leave it on the porch to rot, but still, I could do something stupid like eat some bad mushrooms from the yard or something.  I could see all that happening.  I'd rather die than end up like that, of course!  But as I've seen in others, life has a way of luring you along, so instead of being presented with sharp transitions (i.e., from healthy and happy to full-on garbage-strewn Diogenes syndrome), one is presented with a seemingly limitless series of tiny compromises, a gradual descent into utter gloom.

If you're a lady or you care about one and you haven't seen this flick, it's worth it, it's not long, and it's on Amazon, free with Prime.

One last observation: I noticed the surge of empathy and compassion I felt for Bette, struggling with the difficult hand she'd been dealt.  And then I realized, I need to feel the same level of empathy and compassion and even love for myself, for my struggles.  I've had a hard life, too, and not much help - a lot of the opposite.  I need to take care of myself the way Bette's daughters would like to have seen her take care of herself.  I'm not a mom, but I have nephews, nieces, friends, and colleagues.  No one is invisible.

I'm writing this post for me.  I need to hold myself accountable and for the first time in my life, I need to be honest with myself and finally admit I have a problem.

I have a drinking problem.

I've been lurking just for a few hours but can already see myself in almost every story.  I never thought I had a serious problem, or at least I would never admit it to myself.  I don't get blacked out all the time, I never call in to work because I drank too much the night before.  I don't destroy friendships because of my drinking, I can still exercise.  I don't often make a fool of myself when I drink.  All parents drink, right

But what I wouldn't admit to myself is that none of that means that I don't drink to much.  I don't have to be drinking every day to the point of a black out to have a problem.  I don't have to destroy everything and hit rock bottom to have a problem.

I tell myself I don't have a problem when I wake up anxious.  When I feel the need to hide my drinking because it's been three days in a row.  When I lie and say I feel great to my significant other when we wake up together.  When I furiously scrub my mouth before my significant other gets home for the night so maybe they won't know I had a drink (even though they never judge whatsoever, so why feel the need to hide it?  because I knew I had a problem and lied to myself for years, that's why).

But today, I'm telling myself I have a problem and I'm going to finally do something about it.  Admitting it is the first step, right?

Even typing this out I feel anxiety, shame, embarrassment.  I even created a separate account so my significant other doesn't find out how serious I think my issue is.  (For now, I know for the best long term success, being open and honest with those who love you is important.  That time will come, just not right now.)  I know my significant other will be nothing but supportive and understanding but one step at a time.

Now to get into what led me to write this incoherent, unnecessarily long post:

I've had periods where I didn't drink at all for a long time.  And then I have periods more often than not where I can't remember the last time I *didn't* have a drink, whether it was a few drinks or several.  This was all throughout my 20s.  Even the humans I'm responsible for were aware of how much I drank, they even made jokes about it.  Nothing makes me more ashamed than that.

Currently, I get home from work and go straight to the bottle.

Just a few to take the edge off.

It's been a long week.

I deserve it.

I haven't had a drink all week, just a few won't hurt.

I can already hear my inner dialogue.  How toxic.  And how easily just a few drinks become several and before I know it, my head is swimming, my stomach is burning (in a sick way, I love the feeling), I feel something I equate to happiness, the headache creeps in, I refuse to admit I have a headache, they can't know how much I've had, I can handle my liquor.  I go to bed, I pass out but we all know that drunk sleep is not good sleep.  I wake up, I can feel my anxiety, my depression, my body shutting down, my paranoia that I've caused irreversible damage.  From heart issues, to moodiness, to swelling in my legs.

But none of that is enough to make me not grab that bottle the next night.  And the next.

And then I'll have a few days of sobriety, but was it ever enough for a full reset, or was it just enough for me to convince myself that I'm fine?  That I don't have a problem.

Sure, a few years ago it was way worse.  I would black out.  I would do shameful things.  But just because it isn't as bad now as it was then doesn't mean it isn't a problem and that's the lie I've been telling myself over and over and over.

So it all ends today.  This post is for me to remind myself that I made a commitment.  Somewhere to go if I think about backing out.  Physical evidence that I know for a fact that I have a problem and that I'm doing something about it.

I'm doing it for my health.  I'm doing it for my relationship.  Just because it isn't causing issues now, doesn't mean it won't.  I would like to avoid that.  I would like to have nothing but healthy years ahead of me.  I would love to wake up feeling rested and excited for the day.  I would love to not think about my next drink all the time.

Here we go.

I can't think of a SINGLE night in the past however many years where I've had a sip of the nono juice the night before work, and had a fine workday the next day, or even a slightly unhellish day. I can think of many, many, many nights where the opposite holds true.

I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that my thinking this afternoon has been maybe a little less than rational (until I plopped down on my keyboard to dump this all out).

Anyway, no real insights here, just some unilluminating, garbling stream-of-consciousness on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. The knuckles are a little white today, but I feel as though I can power through. Tomorrow morning, as I walk to work, will be a good opportunity for me to reflect on my decision and see if I regret not drinking (although I like to think some part of me knows the answer to that).",4,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.7262281179428101}"

I heard several variations of ""It worked for me, therefore it's the ONLY way for EVERYONE and if you don't do it the way we say you'll NEVER be recovering, regardless of how long you stay sober or anything else you do to improve yourself"".

Fuck that. Nothing works for everyone, because we're all built differently. Also, plenty of people relapse after swallowing the 12-step program hook, line, and sinker. I got a lot out of AA meetings when I was in acute withdrawal, but at this point I feel I need conversation with deeper thought than the meetings I've found offer. So many people in the meetings seem to be completely devoid of any sort of critical thought and just regurgitate the same shit over and over. I'm happy it works so well for them, but I don't think I'm the only one left behind by their rigid interpretation of ""recovery"". AA's ""Tradition Three"" states “The only requirement for AA membership is *a desire to stop drinking*”, but that's not how many members seem to feel; to them I'll never be anything more than a ""dry drunk"" because I'm not 100% hooked on the AA program. I understand the desire to share what worked for oneself with others, but I just can't get past the inflexible thinking so many long-time members exhibit. I've read that the way AA works is by it's members becoming addicted to the program, simply replacing one addiction with another instead of actually reducing addiction; and it seems to me like that's exactly the case for many AA members. There is no ""getting better"", it's just being ""in recovery"" (addicted to the program) forever. That's likely the best way for some, but is it really the *only* way for everybody? I think most of the people I've met in meetings want to help, but their enthusiasm quickly runs dry if you're not willing to be an AA hardliner like they are.

Thanks for letting me vent, I've found this group to be far more open and accepting than any AA meeting I've attended. I'll likely keep attending occasional meetings, but I doubt I'll ever consider myself a ""real"" AA member.

Even all this time later it seems to continue to clear up.

I wasn't looking very healthy before I quit drinking. My face was really swollen, puffy around my eyes and colourless, pale and washed out with dark eye circles. That took 5 weeks for me to really notice a big difference, for my face to go back to a more normal looking size and healthy looking colour to return.

But after that my skin keeps getting better. I had so many miscellaneous LESIONS on my face at various stages of inflammation and sad attempts at healing and all of those are really starting to disappear now. I still have a few spots but they keep looking better all the time. I'm losing spots that I had just taken to be permanent now, they're going away, it feels kind of magical for me.

I would say that the difference is so great that I suspect I am allergic to something in beer or wine but that seems like a meaningless statement considering alcohol is poisonous. But because I do have a few other allergies I am curious whether others experience this big difference in their skin.

Getting sober is difficult, it's like starting a new life, learning how to live again, filling the empty spaces that alcohol took up. But in this part of my life, I didn't have to do anything except quit for it to improve. There's a big part of my life when pictures of me don't exist but I feel great that I'm not afraid of being in photos anymore. This skin issue annoyed me for so long and now it's going away. I just feel good about going to work or walking around in the world, I feel confident that I'm presenting a good image of myself, I don't feel like I want to hide, I don't feel ashamed about how I look.

I didn't feel tempted by alcohol at all and only the tiniest pang for substances which passed. After a short amount of time i just felt carried away by the crowd, so blissed out and just dancing away with no ego or thoughts of anything but what I was doing and the beat. I had no idea I'd enjoy dancing so much and drum & bass/house music has never really been my thing. But it was! 
The reason I'm telling this story apart from to say it's absolutely possible to enjoy this sober is to say the main reason the whole festival was so fun is that there was so little drinking. There were bars everywhere and some people drinking but everyone was either sober or tripping and just so loved up, so blissed out. 
Alcohol changes the vibes, makes people angry, fighty, unpredictable, and messy. There were no fights, no puke on the ground, no assaults i'm aware of. 3000 people over three days- that's amazing. So, we are contributing to peace and happiness of the world by not drinking

Now I don't think I'll ever like myself, but being sober I am starting to find some sense of acceptance. Not liking myself is a motivation to improve, because I especially don't like the part of me that wants to get hammered and fuck up everything.

(18 this year but definitely underage drinking) and I've been drinking rather regularly the past few months. I was often so oblivious of how alcohol has been destroying my life. I have some friends who act as a form of peer pressure but it doesn't matter, I myself willingly take part in drinking with or without them. Today was the day i realised my alcohol was far less important than the relationships in my life. 

I currently have a boyfriend who used to smoke, and I still vividly remember the time i confronted him breaking his promise multiple times, although he promised me he wouldn't smoke. For me, breaking a promise was a huge thing because my trust wss so hard to come by. I remember how hurt I felt, and how disappointed and unsure I was. 

Fastforward to now, when he came to send me home, even though he was feeling under the weather.  He couldn't even say much to me, no matter how much I said, how many tears I shed in front of him. The tables had turned and now he was staring at me, saying the exact same words i said to him a few months ago. ""This isn't the first time."" He's not the type to cry, but he doesn't have to say a shit ton of words for me to get it.

That was when I was done. I had experienced the two extremes (being super obedient and being super rebellious) and i decided enough was enough. I was sick and tired of myself not being able to control my own actions, and my own self-destruction just because I want to chug and look cool. If my boyfriend could go cold turkey for 3 months, why was it so difficult for me? I was sick and tired of lying to my family as well, it isn't exactly the most pleasant feeling. I have decided that starting from today, I will no longer take even a sip. Starting from today, I will learn to control myself and be sober.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9901294112205505}"

I tried one beer my friend made. I love seeing that number go up everyday. BUT. Last night, I was at a wedding in Nashville and remained sober. I remember being ‘that’ guy who was an absolute mess at all events. Here are some of the things I saw throughout the day I don’t miss:

1) Guy at the AirBnB I was in got so morning drunk he shattered his mimosa glass in the shower, opened a beer, and proceeded to accidentally drop that bottle as well. He then passed out and almost missed the wedding 

2) Folks on the grooms party drinking too much during that they gave slurred speeches and couldn’t do any of the ‘games’ the bride / groom put together. 

3) this one hit home the most. Another guy im staying with got into those hurtful arguments you can only have with your SO when your drunk. I remember being that guy saying mean things to my wife because I’d have no emotional control after an onslaught of beers. We spent a lot of the night looking for her as she had walked back without telling anyone and wouldn’t answer his calls. 

4) I drove everyone home sober. I used to drive when I shouldn’t have all the time. The peace that comes from not having to hold the wheel tight and focus super hard was so freeing. They all wanted Del Taco and binged on multiple burritos and quesadillas while I had a smoothie. 

5) I’m the only one up right now enjoying a cup of coffee and may use the local gym. I’ll be the only one hangover free one today it looks like. I’m flying home today and don’t have to stress about those vomit inducing hungover flights. If you’ve been there - you know. 

This may be long, but those of you that make it this far and are afraid of events not being fun without alcohol - you’re wrong. The more events I go to sober, 
the more I realize I was fun all along. I danced, made friends at all the tables, and did all the things I felt like I could only do with alcohol. Plus  no hangover and upset stomach from garbage food the day after. I’m proud of who I am today.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

2020-03-14 23:29:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fiv3k9/this_time_last_year_i_had_a_withdrawal_seizure/,This time last year I had a withdrawal seizure and ketoacidosis,"It's the one year 'anniversary' of my withdrawal seizure. I've never talked to anyone in full detail about this but I wanted to share my story to help me process it, and to serve as a warning for other people.

I was a daily drinker for about five years, and had been coping poorly with anxiety and depression for longer than that. In December 2018 I slowed my drinking down before the Christmas holidays with my family and by the end passed a few easy AF days. I resumed drinking daily (~8ish beers) in the new year. In early February 2019 I visited my grandmother with Parkinson's, who asked for help with assisted suicide. I was already sensitive to suicide, having lost my best friend to it a few years ago, and I dropped into a depressive bender.

I lost my appetite completely and started getting insomnia and daily panic attacks. My drinking escalated to a fifth of liquor every day, on an empty stomach. I started every morning with liquor and went to bed still drunk. I was vomiting and had diarrhea. After 3 weeks of this, I had lost 25 pounds and was very physically and mentally unwell. I was having thoughts of suicide and decided I needed to make a change to break the cycle. ""Just two months ago you were sober for a few days over Christmas,"" I told myself. That day I drank a pint of whiskey instead of a full fifth. That night I had the sweats and shakes, horrible anxiety, auditory hallucinations of screaming, and couldn't sleep. I had never experienced alcohol withdrawal before and was worried but didn't know how serious withdrawal could get. I told myself to suck it up. I took 6 Benadryl over the course of 6 hours, trying to get to sleep (I have since read that Benadryl may lower the seizure threshold). I slept for a few hours. The next morning I felt like the worst had passed. I finally was able to keep down a bowl of Ramen. I drank about a half liter of wine to help with the withdrawals. By the evening I was feeling relatively normal and thought I was in the clear. Then, sitting on the couch, I suddenly felt really weird and started seeing a carousel of colorful lights spinning in front of me. I stood up and told my roommate I needed to go to the bathroom. Then I don't remember anything. I woke up lying on the ground next to my couch with paramedics and my roommate standing over me. I was super confused but was told I had had a seizure and that I needed to go to the ER, where I found out I also had ketoacidosis, dehydration, and severe vitamin deficiencies. At the time I was a 28 year old man, usually around 175 pounds (dropped to 150 in the weeks leading to my hospitalization). I was on 20 mg of Prozac and wasn't taking any other medication or drugs. Despite my drinking, I was in decent physical shape, having run a few half-marathons and done a ton of hiking and backpacking. I had yearly checkups and all my vitals were healthy.

I don't intend this to be just a drinking war story. I'm sharing this because I hope my story illustrates some takeaways:
1. seizures can happen, even if you're young and relatively healthy, even if you drink less than some of the super hardcore drinkers you hear about -- please take alcohol withdrawal seriously, don't try to medicate it yourself, and consider medical help
2. get help for your mental health if you think you need it -- it can contribute to drinking, and drinking makes it worse; a really shitty cycle.

I sobered up for a month after the seizure, but unfortunately I thought the bender was a one-time thing, and I relapsed and yo-yoed for a while before I really committed to sobriety. I went to inpatient last year for a month, and am now working the 12 steps, attending group therapy, exercising and meditating regularly again, and on antidepressants that suit me better. Today I'm only 152 days sober, but feeling strong and cautiously optimistic about the future. I don't ever want to have a withdrawal seizure again, and as my sponsor has told me, ""the good news is, you don't have to"".

I've gone through a lot of recent changes and am having a hard time adjusting to my new life.  I lost my 30 year old brother unexpectedly last year [a week before my birthday], moved to a new state less than a month ago, and am going through a recent breakup [4 years together].
For the past week, my drinking habit has picked back up to at least a bottle of wine a night.  Binge drinking by myself has been my go-to coping mechanism for over 8 years [I'm 27].  

Yesterday was especially tough and involved a full bottle of wine, some whiskey, and a call to the suicide hotline.  I was feeling extremely low and overwhelmed by the trauma and dramatic changes in my life.  My brother was always my go-to person when I needed a helping hand or just someone to vent to.  After he passed, I lost my safe lifeline.  I let my depression/anxiety push friends away because I didn't want to burden people with the emotions and pain I was feeling.  My relationship suffered because I didn't feel like I was in a safe spot to express my confusing feelings.  My ex took my feelings of overwhelming anger/sadness/grief personally and wanted to ""fix it"".  He meant well, but I felt like I was broken. I just wanted to be heard.  When I felt like I couldn't open up, I'd open up a bottle of wine to numb myself.  

Today, I did make it a point to reach out and be honest with a good friend about the pain and confusion I am feeling. She listened with no judgement and reassured me that what I am feeling is normal.  I cannot thank her enough for taking the time to just listen.  I would love more people in my life who I can be emotionally open with instead of drinking alone to temporarily numb myself.  

I want to feel again.  Today is Day 1.

>  [Numerous studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4590612/)  have found a link between excessive alcohol consumption and immune  function. Research shows people who drink in excess are more susceptible  to respiratory illness and pneumonia and recover from infection and  wounds more slowly. Alcohol alters the number of microbes in the gut  microbiome, a community of microorganisms that affect the immune system.  Excessive alcohol can damage the lungs, and impair the mucosal immune  system, which is essential in helping the body recognize pathogens and  fight infection. And it’s not just chronic drinking that does damage.  Binge drinking can also impair the immune system.

Folks, if any of you drink to take the edge off your anxiety, please know that all it’s doing is making you worse. I was basically house bound for the last two years drinking myself to death to deal with daily multiple panic attacks. I had ambulances to my house multiple times because I was convinced I was dying, all because of that fucking poison. 14 days sober and I’ve never felt better and I will never go back to the way I was.

I gave in and BOUGHT actually booze. But when I wanted to pay, a homeless man with mental issues went in 

and bought wine. He was in front of me in the line. (lol rhymes too.)

I couldn‘t buy the alcohol, because he kept shouting at the cashier and arguing with him how he owes him 2$. It went for about 2-3 mins and everybody in line watched in shock. Me behind him holding my booze, looking like I belonged with him.

I bought it anyway, ashamed that I‘m almost like him, buying this stuff in the morning. I wanted to drink at that course, in between pauses.

But the course was closed because of the corona, and I went home.

The alcohol is still in my bag now and I have zero desire to drink it. I will just hide it away or throw it later away, but at the moment, too many people could see it.

This really seems easy a lot of the time now.  Having a room mate who never has alcohol at home is a huge help.  I occasionally crave a glass of wine but I think of the consequences and the feeling goes after a while. 

My anxiety has reduced enormously - I don't have to wake up, with no idea what happened to me, horrified at what I might have said or done.  

My concentration has improved dramatically, in the last few weeks I've started to feel more mentally sharp than I've felt in about twenty years. 


I got a new, demanding, highly-paid job, which will pay me enough money to be able to start saving to buy an apartment.  

I have so much more faith in myself to be able to do things, to be a productive human being, to not feel like I'm a piece of shit all the time.  

Thanks to everybody in the forum for posting, it helps a lot. Stay safe everyone.

So something happened to me a little while ago that has left me utterly rattled and had I had liquor in the house I would've necked the bottle. 

I was having lunch, oddly enough reading this sub, and I had a massive hit of Deja Vu - of the worst things happening in my personal circumstance. I even txt'd my counselor, as it was as if someone from the future downloaded memories into my mind. I could feel, see, hear EVERYTHING. It was that brutally intense the physical response was nuts, a deep wave of depression, fear, anxiety, felt like a shot gun blast - worse than I've felt recently honestly. It's passed now but I'm still majorly rattled, my counselor says early day AD's can cause ESP type feelings, but I used to get these as a child as well, but more so dreams.

A very very disturbing event. I suppose logically given my brain chemistry is being altered that's just it, but my god I hope it doesn't happen again.

I've had a seizure trying to stop cold Turkey. But this time, this time like many days before I woke up with my heart about to beat out of my chest. But it was worse, I went to throw up as I did every morning but this time it wasn't bile with a little bit of blood. It was solid blood. I couldn't believe that much could even come out of ones body. I knew this was it, I keep being wrapped up in the punk party culture and die an early death or I take my life more seriously. I'm Bi-Polar and have anxiety so i was lucky enough to have a trick up my sleeve. I dont take my meds when I drink so as you can imagine, I have a stock pile. I started taking my xanax like I was supposed to for my anxiety and the general treatment of withdrawl symptoms. It's still been hell, but with the occasional joint (it's legal here and has never made me want to drink, I usually lose desire to drink while stoned) I've managed to stay away. I went to an old favorite restaurant of mine I used to go to every night the bar as it was down the street and they sell 16oz PBR cans for a buck a piece. I was paying for my food when my lady friend had to use the restroom and let me tell you I eyeball fucked that damn beer cooler like it was the most extraordinary creature you've ever seen. But I got a lemonade instead, and went to a meeting immediately afterwards. I dont know how many people in this sub use AA, I was deterred for years after being forced to go in a couple rehab stints where all they did was preach about god.

Walking through those doors especially the first few times made me nervous as all hell, and to be honest; it still does. But when I leave, i feel like a new person.

Just a post/update for myself to document this journey but also for those who have given me such compassion here. I haven’t had a drink in 11 days (I think? It’ll be on my flair). Anyway it feels like way longer than that, but it feels so good! I’m starting naltrexone tonight but I’ve had such a drop in cravings already. I’m doing it just to stay on top and keep bases covered. I’ve replaced my nightly sitting on the balcony unwind with a beer (actually too many beers) with tonic water. I still feel content and rewarded and everyday I wake up looking and feeling more amazing than the day before. I’m also so grateful that I got help right before starting my new job as a research assistant. I’ve been in this role for a week. It’s challenging, I love it, and I shudder to think how I would have handled it and performed if I was still in the swing of nightly binge drinking. Honestly I wouldn’t be able to. I’d let myself down and those relying on me for their livelihood too. And I’m so grateful to this community here. I couldn’t imagine this journey alone.

It started as just a fast and I do it about once a year for a month. I don't drink every day, but when I do, a lot of times, it's easily 2 bottles of wine or like 15-20 oz of scotch or something like that. My tolerance is so high that I just walk home, go to bed, and go to work. A couple times I got stupid but yeah. 

This time, a couple days in, I started to feel really tired, but no tremors or anything, because I don't drink every day. At least, not until recently, where my usual is 3-5 drinks to relax with an occasional binge throughout the month. Then I got a UTI and when that happens in the past, as this time, I feel it mostly in my kidneys. I'm on an antibiotic for something else, but it's helping (a few days in to a 7 day regimen). 

I've never seen my pee this color and I am drink mostly only water with an occasional green juice. My pee is dark amber in color (like concentrated ice tea). I assume it's my liver detoxing but I'm surprised it's taking this long. I don't have any other symptoms of anything. Is this normal? Is it related to quitting drinking?

I need to say that I never considered myself an alcoholic because I haven't had an issue with a one month absence of drinking if I'm really determined, but I realized it's not based on that. I immediately think of drinking if I had a hard day, PTSD triggered, or in a depressive downswing. It's 100% a numbing agent for me. 

I'm a 5'4, 38 year old female, but sit at the bar by myself like an old man, but with scotch after scotch (with a little ginger ale, my favorite cocktail ever), not really talking to anyone unless a political rant invites me; it's probably a lot on my organs. I'm not in a program or anything and am just now considering quitting forever if I need to, if my body is telling me to.

So, is this a good sign and related to detoxing or something else? I have a doctor and do take paroxetine for the depression, but just looking for experiences of others.

I saw an older Reddit post about a guy with green pee but it was archived. Thanks!

Now my whole life had been turned upside down. I'm a college student and while I'm an adult student it's been heartbreaking to see my spring semester ruined. I started this degree in 2004 and will finally finish it this spring and every day it seems less and less likely that I'm going to have a graduation ceremony this year. They've cancelled all other school events and kicked everyone off campus. While I'll still graduate and have good things ahead it's hard to lose all the fun parts. I've been pulling 80-90 hour weeks between work school and research for 2 years to make it through this program and finally felt I was getting to the part where I could relax and celebrate my accomplishments. In many times of weakness I've used the image of myself at that graduation to pull through and it's been really hard to process the idea of losing that.

My husband and I went to the beach for awhile to look for cool animals in the tide pools (marine biology major) and we stopped at a restaurant along the canal for an appetizer on the deck since it was unseasonably warm. Did some grocery shopping on the way home whole my anxiety/depression/stress was low and got a few things done at home while I was feeling strong. 

It was nice to feel like myself again for a few hours. Thanks to everyone here for being supportive this week.

You don't have to look any farther than my last couple posts to know I've been having a rough time of it, particularly lately, but I'd say this has absolutely been much tougher than my last major experience 3 years ago. Much of that has to do with circumstances outside of just my issues with alcohol (had access to psychiatric help then, now I don't, for example).  When I last posted here, I believe I was very *very* close to relapsing. 

Not sure why, but something has been keeping me going anyway. I'm afraid, for one thing, that if I just go back to my old ways it'll be years more before I'm able to claw my way back out again. There's a kind of anger I've been experiencing lately over the fact that I have to go through this, that I actually have to worry that if I have a beer I could just end up trapped in a cycle of drinking and depression. I would really enjoy being able to go out and have a drink with a friend and have it be no big deal, but it would be. Even if I didn't immediately go crazy with it and start drinking every night, that part of me that clings on to this *one thing* I'm doing for myself to find hope would give way to a constant sinking feeling that I'm now right back where I started. I've completed my FAFSA so I can finally go back to school and get on a better path, and in other areas as well I've begun to pick up the pieces and put my life back together. I feel like if I drank at all, within a few months I would've either dropped out of school, or never finished registration in the first place. Hopefully there'll be a day where I look back on these posts and think about how this was all worth it, and I'll be able to tell people here that It gets better over time.  

I haven't had a drink in nearly 2 1/2 months, but in other areas I'm slipping a bit. I've been eating terribly, unfortunately a habit that I'm getting worse about over time, and I haven't been getting nearly enough sleep for at least a month. As hard as things have been, I *know* there is more I could be/should be doing to make it easier. I'm going to try something this week. For the next 7 days I'm going to commit to at LEAST 8 hours of sleep a night, no excuses. I'll report back how I'm feeling afterwards.

My relationship with alcohol is definitely an example of this — I had to deeply examine that relationship and decide whether maintaining the status quo was in my best interest. Clearly, it was not. Alcohol tried to negotiate me back to our previous relationship (I.e. via relapse) but I didn’t allow it to. Over time, with discipline and practice, that relationship (and who controlled it) changed. 

I find this to be true with sober relationships, too, both friends and lovers. I had developed certain patterns of behavior, related both to being a child of an alcoholic and having an alcohol use disorder myself. As I decide to raise the level of quality in those relationships, when it’s hard I want to run away, to not feel, to not be vulnerable. But that defeats the purpose of “leveling up,” which calls for diving into the discomfort so that I can ride a higher wave. It means changing the way I relate, react, and respond to people in my life. It means taking the time to integrate my experience so that I don’t disintegrate my experience or my relationships.

<edit> I should mention as I keep forgetting to, I'm Australian. I understand this group is predominantly from the US so sometimes I'll mention things or things in ways that seem odd </edit>

Had a bit of an enlightenment type situation last night, told the wife we needed some milk etc and asked what money we have etc. We go to the local shops, get what we need (I grabbed some non-alco beer, tastes pretty good actually, as I'm sick of tea/coffee/water). I say to her we must be getting low on funds (I wanted to get some no sugar soft drink, for again tea/coffee/water reason. I thought we had maybe $50-80 left. She said since I stopped drinking it's more like $180 left, and that's not including our usual food/fuel budget money.

I wonder, for those members here far more along the sober path than I am (I'm still a baby in comparison) when did it dawn on you the financial impact of your drinking? (Fines, courts etc etc aside if it happened to you) and how has it affected you?

Anyway I hope everyone is good today, I'm very grateful for this group and the support we all seem to give, like a massive online AA meeting.

On Day 16 right now, and had a few cravings today.  I've had success with thinking about what drinking now would really mean for the day and next: chain smoking, hang over, regret, etc.  But something else happened today: I gave up on the dream of moderation.  So I thought to myself- there is no middle ground.  So when I think about drinking, I am only and always thinking about problem drinking, I are thinking about starting to drink too much, too often.  That's what it will be.  If I choose that, well, fine.  But no more pretending it will be any different than other times.  

This felt like a different stage of honesty with myself. 

And I relate it to recovering from codependent  and/or emotionally unavailable  relationships.  I know codependency emerged out of study of people in relationships with alcoholics.  That was never quite the case for me, but I learned the lessons of detachment by overcoming relationships with people.  The 12 steps for codependents are adapted from those for AA.  They made a lot of sense for me with people, especially letting go, not controlling. Because you really cannot control another person.  Its an illusion and a distraction.  I also realized in destructive relationships that the pattern is to keep returning, not learning the lesson, not believing your own experience, hoping and dreaming that IT WILL BE DIFFERENT.  The way to break the chain is to hold onto ALL THAT YOU KNOW in the midst of the temptation to get back into the dance one more time, and say NO.  Its like faith in your own knowledge and evidence.  With people, its ""this is who this person is and how they behave, again and again and again.""  Know it.  Accept it.  Act on it.

I am trying to apply this thinking to alcohol.  I know how it goes.  Not just in the short term, but in the long term.  That's what it is and what it will be.  No more fooling myself.

The coronavirus starts to have effects in my city. Today was the first confirmed covid-19 related death in my country and, life would have it, it happened in the city I live.

People are like a Bond's Martini done wrong - both shaken and stirred. Yesterday there was a general ordinance throughout the whole country to close schools, preschools and nurseries, so 3/4 of our office workers either went home office or simply took days off. I seem to be in the low-risk category (young, no kids, no elders around, no long-term sickness that would be destroying me throughout the years, I travel mostly by bike and generally avoid public transportation etc.), so for now I continue to show up in work and do my job the best I can.

It's nothing important. I work in advertising agency. But the supplies are running short and I can't help but wonder what's in store for us.

But the general  coronavirus is not what I wanted to talk about. For those who may be remembering me by now, yes, I tend to ramble a bit every now and then. The reason why I talk about it is because this whole situation reminds me of the words I heard last year. I was listening to Ted Talks about the nature of addiction:

""The opposite of addiction is not sobriety, it's connection"".

And then the person (my apologies, I can't for the love of god remember who was it, but I can look it up if someone's interested) then proceeded to explain how it is important to ground the addicted person back into reality, into society, instead of making them feel even more excluded. For some reasons - generally - it's crucial for a person to see a reason to go over to the other side and stay sober.

Of course it's best if the person we're doing it for is ourselves, but in my experience, the first impulse is rarely myself. It's the people around, people who count on me, people whom I care about. People who care about me.

Ironically, it was my boss who asked me to take care of myself and be careful. And while he is, technically, my boss, so it's logical he doesn't want me (last of the few still-standing in the morning in the office) to fall ill, I know he genuinely cares. He's just this type of person.

For some reason this simple ""Please take care of yourself"" made me feel my journey is more worthwhile.

Also, people are starting to notice. Today my colleague, a precious oddball I might add :), asked me if I changed anything about myself. I told him that no, everything's pretty the same as last week. In terms of haircut, clothes etc. it's true. He went ""Really? Because you really look different. In a good way.""

Well I'll be damned.

I've completed my third round around the sun sober. What a great year it was. I'm very grateful for all the gifts sobriety has given me. It's nice to see how these gifts have evolved during the years.

The first year: 

I chose for sobriety in a very turbulent time in my life. Existential problems due to finishing my higher education and not knowing what the hell I was supposed to do next. There's the classic quarter-life crisis. I loved going to university and a lot of my identity was built upon my academic pursuits. Suddenly that all fell away and left a big void. I used to drink to not interact with those strong and complex emotions. I had difficulties in the relationship I was in then. My underdeveloped emotional side couldn't handle talking about feelings and getting into conflicts.

If I look back even further, I could say I abused alcohol to supress emotions for the first time when I was still at the young age of 15. This was three weeks after I had my first beer. So it actually all went downhill quickly. Most of my peers and the adults around me didn't think this was bad, just a part of being a developing teenager in Low Countries.

I've been using this strategy to avoid complex and difficult emotions, to avoid facing my (social) fears, to avoid being vulnerable, to avoid conflict until I chose sobriety at 24. A switch turned in my mind after my best friend had to put me into my bed, because I was to drunk to get there safely. Somehow this time sobriety sticked. Before this time I had periods of sobriety of weeks or months after a harsh hangover or relationship fallout from drinking. Losing friends, losing memory, losing health.

During the first  year I was mostly clearing debris from the past in therapy, changing social circles,  finding my first job as a consultant. There were difficult conversations with my parents about deep feelings that I was never able to express. There was a lot of internal growth in this period. Just learning how to talk about emotions, and learning that emotions are an important part of life. I was a 'stoic' person in the past, who thought expressing emotions was weak. That's some bad masculinity right there.

In the end of the first year, I wasn't great yet, but it was getting better. Around this time I started taking SSRI's. These made me feel grey all the time and killed my sexdrive while I was taking them.

The second  year:

During the second year, eventually my relationship with my ex ended. It didn't end on good terms at the time. Now, we can be active friends. I feel this is a more natural way of interacting for us. 

I got fired from my first job, as it was a bad fit. This was a good thing, as I was looking for another thing myself already. I've found a new career path in education during this time. This felt so much better than my job as a consultant. I was even eager to go to work most of the time, getting fulfillement from seing my students progress through mathematics. I've found a new house, which I corented with a friend. All was going better this second year. During this year I also stopped taking SSRI-medication, as I was tired of feeling nothing all the time. After slowly reducing the dose, I was able to continue without the medication. 

If the first year was clearing debris, this second year was mostly building a stable base for future life and consolidating the lessons from the first year. I've found new friends that support me in sobriety if I tell them about it. I've lost a lot of drinking-buddies, which was inevitable after chosing the sober path. I've even reconnected with a friend from the past who chose sobriety after heavy drinking and drug abuse. Now we support eachother to stay on the right path. During the year I felt that my social network got stronger and that my self-esteem got better.

The third year:

If the second year was building a secure base, then the third year was expanding my life and my comfort zone. As I kept at therapy during all this time, I've found my personality was changing for the better. I became more empathetic, suportive, was a better listener for my friends when they needed me. My social skills had already improved. I've found my inner beliefs were improving. 

I became more humble, less governed by a fragile ego. What a freeing experience this is. I've returned to improv theate, which I was doing in the past. I started dancing oldschool jazz solo. After three failed auditions for the final level of lindy hop dancing, I followed the advice of the jury instead of being to prideful to do this. I allow myself to be bad at something more easily now, which allows faster growth. This still doesn't come easy, but it gets easier.

Last week, I stepped outside my comfort zone by DJ'ing at a party. ""DJ'ing? That's exposing your personal music taste to so many people. That's showing your vulnerable side to 50+ people"" my anxious side was telling me. In the end people were dancing on my music. It gets even better, when one of the dancers asked me to put on a funk song to do a 'soul train' to, I was suddenly so happy. I love 'soul train', and they want to do it to my music? A dream that I didn't even knew I had came true then and there.

In this year I probably had the most entertaining summer in the last decade. 30 days spent at festivals of the 60 days vacation, wow! As a sober person on Youtube once said: ""life is not over when you're sober, life is just beginning and it's a beautiful life.""

Future plans:

\- I want to keep expanding the comfort zone, by trying new, scary things. When expanding the comfort zone, I feel very alive.

\- I want to be more active in my dancing communities by volunteering at the bar or DJ'ing. 

\- I want to be vulnerable in front of an audience more often, to show my inner self that it's ok to be vulnerable, that people won't leave you suddenly. I'll join an improv jam in some weeks.

\- Keep going to therapy to improve my emotional side. I'm already so much better than before, but there's still room for improvement. Usually, when I share my deep wants and needs, some good plans come up: like the solo dancing, going back to improv.",152,{'rona': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9147326350212097}"

Just because I quit drinking, my life was not suddenly transformed into a tabula rasa- if I have wronged someone, drunk or not, then the responsibility for this lies squarely on me. And I must do my best to set things square with that person. Sometimes that means never contacting that person again. Some people just don’t ever need to hear from me again. I do not blame them. I was an asshole sometimes, there’s no two ways around it
And just because I am sober now doesn’t mean anyone should care. I do not deserve a cookie for finally trying to act like a decent human being. I have been very lucky that most people I have talked to have just said, “We are just happy you are okay now, man. Just don’t drink, okay?” I have been told by these people that even in the midst of my craziness, they could see a good person hiding inside me, being beaten down by the booze monster, but struggling to stay alive. I don’t know if that’s the case or if I just pick very kind and forgiving people as friends. Regardless I must accept responsibility for my actions. All my actions, past and present. If I hide from this responsibility, then I am being dishonest with myself. And if I can convince myself that I am not to be held accountable for my actions, then it’s just a hop, skip and a jump to convincing myself that I can take maybe just one drink.
Then, from there, after doing as much damage as possible to everything and everyone around me, I will die.”

2020-03-12 10:32:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fhh7y2/my_commitment/,-My commitment-,"Hello all!
                I believe it is finally time to post this community I’ve been subscribed to for quite a while now. I have wavered and renegotiated with myself on what role alcohol will have in my life. However, due to poor planning and inattentive decision making my relationship with alcohol has been determined for the foreseeable future. It will be one of abstaination and self-control in the name of self-respect. Though I’ve lurked here on Reddit for 8+ years this will be my first post.
         Growing up my parents did not drink. My first exposure to alcohol was drinking a few beers and getting drunk around the age of 13 when my brother threw a party while he was in high school. After that my first exposures continued in this manner: a group of teenagers binge drinking and having as much fun in one night as they possibly could. Being the class clown made being the drunkest one in the room a very familiar space to fill. I was comfortable with the attention because it was coupled with laughter and at this age almost no one knows how to handle their alcohol. My “silly” behavior was un-alarming when compared to the people around me who were throwing up and fighting. Fast forward 15 years, and it is no longer cute, it is no longer silly, it is no longer entertaining – it is sad.
        My experience with alcohol in college was similar. For the first few years of college I actually smoked a lot more weed than I did drink. I kind of didn’t see the “benefits” of alcohol for a long time. It made you hung over, it made you do embarrassing things, it put you close to dangerous and unlawful situations, and it simply was just not as relaxing as marijuana. This mentality with regards to alcohol continued until around halfway through my junior year of university. I went through a very bad break up. It was one of those break ups that makes you question everything about yourself and basically turns you into a basket case. I really had no one to turn to since I had always been the “stable” one and people didn’t know how to react to me being a basket case. The worst casualty of this circumstance is that my roommate moved out. She was a girl I really admired and who knew me well. Perhaps if I allowed myself to be more vulnerable and ask for her help a bit more things would’ve been different. Nevertheless, she moved out and two people moved in in her place. These are wonderful people and good friends, I definitely don’t regret meeting them or the time we shared as roommates. What I do regret is letting my house become a party house, ignoring all my emotions, and throwing myself headfirst into alcohol.
          I did this for the remaining year and a half of college. I ended up not graduating- though I only lacked one semester‘s worth of classes. I just no longer had the motivation or more importantly the financial aid to continue school. So I went headfirst into the workforce. I worked a lot, I was definitely disappointed I’d ending up in some close to minimum-wage mediocre job after spending so much time at school. But as long as I kept working everything will be OK right? So if I work hard I can drink as much as I want, right? As long as I pay my bills and keep the government off my back everything is OK. Or at least so I thought, I had no perception of the dissolution of the human spirit and of what true self respect means. 
      A few years after college I got into a band. This band became mildly successful playing anywhere from 2 to 5 shows a week for the next 5 1/2 to 6 years. A lot of the shows came with free alcohol and most of them occurred in environments that encourage binge drinking. Bars, parties, weddings etc. so I would play music half the night and party the other half. I was good at playing music and performing but alcohol definitely held me back and made me slip up several times. In this environment that goes unaddressed really. When I finally left the band of my own volition, I left to further commit myself to a restaurant job. I had started as a dishwasher and worked my way all the way up to manager and it was apparent that committing myself to this would bring more money, and therefore I thought more fulfillment, to my life. 
      I didn’t realize what role the passion of playing music played in my life. The happiness that it brought me staved off feelings of self loathing and brought me fulfillment. Once that was gone and I was purely a working class man, things got much darker in my mind and soul. I thought using alcohol would let some light in and give me “a little vacation in a bottle“. However about a year ago I went through another very bad break up. A big part of that break up is that she wanted me to quit drinking but I did not see her side of the argument since I was so functional and bringing in so much money. Also, she was not perfect herself and I used these imperfections as excuses to safeguard my own flaw of alcohol addiction. I didn’t really understand the weight of not being there mentally every night because I was drinking a case of beer.
        Since that break up my life has become very lonely and I know it’s because of alcohol. I have one day off a week and I can’t shake the feeling that people avoid me on that day because they know I will be absolutely hammered. To spend time with me on my day off seems similar to spending time with a grandparent that has Alzheimer’s. Sitting in room with someone that you love so much and them not being the person you used to know- and not being able to do anything about it. However, I have chosen to let this disease make me not who I want to be, A sad shadow of my former self. I have unknowingly tried to surround myself with people who do not care and will let me destroy myself. I’m not comfortable with this. I see myself going down a very bad path and I want to make a change. This is probably the 10th time I’ve quit drinking in the past year, and I’m only on day five. But I want to move forward and I want to leave the sadness and shame behind. Making this post is a way to let myself know just how aware I am of the problem and how much I want it to change. My life may not be perfect but I know it will be better without alcohol. I want to finish school, I want to experience life outside of getting drunk, And I want to be able to respect myself and the way that I handle my life. Mostly, I want to unlearn these bad habits and handle my life like a real adult. I’m 30 years old and it’s time.

I was house-sitting in an apartment with a full box (4 bottles) of white wine in the fridge + a half full bottle of vodka in the freezer (vodka was my drink of choice - I'd gotten up to a fifth almost every night before I quit). 

The thoughts kept running through my brain, ""Just have one drink - see how it feels,"" or, ""half a glass of wine could really take the edge off - just try it."" But instead I sat and reflected for a long while about everything that has changed over the past few months: I've been promoted at work, my relationship with my family is better than ever, I've gotten back into fitness and *finally* lost the 10+ alcohol pounds I'd been struggling with for a year, plus I just started seeing someone and don't want to potentially fuck it all up by back-sliding and becoming the person I know I will be if I drink.  Even just one. (Because it is never just one.)

I'm a chronic relapser, so my reasons for this particular relapse shouldn't matter. I suffer from anxiety (social and general) and depression and am in therapy.

Recent lurker and decided to jump on the sober train Sunday. I am on day 4 and feeling great, besides the interrupted sleep the last couple of days, but at least my anxiety is better and feel well rested. 

Yesterday was the worst day so far for many reasons. Wednesdays is my day off from my parenting time from my son. I am recently separated and finally divorced. So I have used my Wednesdays after work, along with the Fridays and Saturdays without him with me, as my “screw it lets drink beer rather than do other productive things I should be doing days”. I had promised myself I do not want to drink around my son when he is with me. However, since the holidays I have broken this self-imposed rule, because I was feeling lonely around the holidays and drinking beers was easier than being present with my emotions, thoughts and feelings. Also, with all the news from yesterday, I felt overwhelmed and anxious, which was allowing me to have the ultimate urge last night to consume my normal amount of beers (6-12 pints). In the end, I decided to say “screw it”. I did not do anything, besides eat dinner, play some video games, read this sub-reddit, go for a drive and then went to bed. It was tough battle, but fought the good mental fight and I did not drink yesterday and will continue to not drink today!

For context: I went on an approximate 5 month sober run last year, due to my ex-wife asking for a divorce. I decided the day that she told me about wanting to get divorced I needed to be sober and see a therapist for my anxiety, etc., just to get my head on straight for enduring the divorce process and find myself. I had not been sober longer than 3 months in the last 20 years previous to this dry spell. I have gone dry a couple of weeks at a time here and there, but not much more than a couple of weeks. However, last summer I decided to see if I could moderate my drinking, which was about at the 5 month mark. Mainly because I thought I could. In the end, this “experiment” resulted in me drinking just to pass the time. Before I knew it, I went from just drinking on Friday or Saturdays to binge drinking 3-5 days per week since about October/November. I started to notice this trend about the first of the year and rebelled against trying a sober effort again. Then again about two weeks ago I began to notice my drinking was affecting my anxiety meds. So I began to revisit what was triggering my desires to drink. I was not sleeping well and not being a productive parent or employee as I was 7-12 months ago during my dry spell. I am tired of felling like crap every other day and want to be more present and productive, personally and professionally. So this past Sunday, after a binge session, I decided it’s time to jump on the sober train again!

Your recovery is your personal journey.  Each person must find the path that works for them.

There are many paths that lead to success.  Recovery is personal and emotional.  I offer this summary for any of my fellow StopDrinking SoberNauts who don’t have access to the article.  I celebrate your courage to heal and to help others heal.

Today, March 12, the New York Times (NYT) featured important findings from research regarding peer-led and professionally delivered treatments that facilitate AA involvement (Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF) interventions), compared to psychological clinical interventions (CBT, MET) and other 12-step variants. Findings included that AA/TSF produced higher rates of abstinence and remission, but did so at lower costs, exhibiting a range of success as much as 40% over other approaches.   You can google the article/study by either NYT or the authors:  Austin Frakt, Aaron Carroll.

This is the first rigorous evaluation of methods, that in the past have been constrained by ‘anonymity’, reliance on self-reporting, and lack of research structure .  
 
The research team included 27 studies containing 10,565 participants, that included 21 Randomized Control Trials (RCT), quasi RCTs, 5 non-randomized, and 1 purely economic study.  The analyses included standard mean difference (SMD) for continuous variables (e.g. percent days abstinent (PDA)) or the relative risk (risk ratios (RRs)) for dichotomous variable.  RCTs comparing AA/TSF to other clinical interventions showed AA/TSF improvement rates of continuous abstinence at 12 months, with a consistent effect at both 24 moths and 36 months.

I had been hallucinating a few days. Can’t really remember when reality stopped and my friends started showing up(they didn’t really). Then the ninjas then my dead friends started showing up. The person that took me was yelling how I was crazy and needed to go to the hospital and that I was drunk. I swore I hadn’t been drinking. And I hadn’t been for a few days. I finally smoked one last cigarette and gave in. I remember getting to the ER and they didn’t even check me in. I don’t know what they saw that was so bad but they took me to a room and I woke up 5 days later to sword being pulled out of my throat. So the ninjas were real. No just pulling out the breathing tube that had kept me alive. What I don’t remember was having a seizure and not breathing and then my heart stopping for 5 minutes until they shocked me back to life. I think that 5 minutes of coding and those 5 days of unconscious was when all my dead friends were around. A few weeks later feeling pretty good I went home.  It started before high school. Not the drinking. I could never sleep. The docs would give me meds that would give me nightmares or make me sleepwalk or put dishes in the oven or wake up outside instead of my bed where I fell asleep. depending on the brand of meds. Those were the good days. Anyways things would get worse. Feel something crawling on my skin. See shadows move and things out the corner of my eye. Here a loud scream just as I’m about to fall asleep like someone is standing right beside me, no  more sleeping that night. It didn’t happen all the time but it was bad. Again docs weren’t helping, send me to another specialist 6 months before they could schedule me in. That wouldn’t work so go to a psychologist get a brain scan, get lab work, nothing was getting better. Then the drinking. I slept amazing and woke up refreshed and it was amazing. It got to be too much and was told it was affecting my liver. I drank a lot but no more than some of my friends so it went on a little longer. I’ll spare the other details but it went on and got worse and then I quit. And then I end up with what they called delirium tremors in the hospital as I mentioned earlier. Years have gone by. Still have nightmares and the feeling of something crawling on me and still wanting that good night sleep that drink does.

The quote comes from an article discussing the downsides and pitfalls of gratitude. Its not a panacea, not a universal solution. But it is a skill we can develop, and a skill linked to being happier and healthier. Context for the quote is seeing gratitude develop in populations struggling with serious issues. Meaningful encounters are the foundation for their gratitude to grow. Being seen, heard, acknowledged validates a person. Validated, a person can begin to grow and change.

For about 6 months prior to that I was drinking about a half bottle of vodka every night. So it's gone up. I've been drinking pretty heavily for a few years now.

Was divorced and fired a couple years ago and haven't worked since. I have little motivation to get out of bed or do anything. When I did work I was showing up hungover occasionally. Recently I signed up for medical assistance and got free health insurance, so I went to a psychiatrist. He set me up for an alcohol eval. The evaluator pretty much told me drinking isn't for me and I should never drink again and I should check myself into a residential treatment program. I told him I wasn't doing that (and I'm not in legal trouble so I don't have to) so he set me up for group therapy a few days a week.

Friday night I was on a date, I was black out drunk, and she got pulled over while driving me. She blew a 0.06. Whew, close call! It makes you think. I have a wet reckless but otherwise no criminal history. Last night I overdid it with the drinking again. I really try not to do that in public but failed last night. Tummy is sore again. Worried about liver failure and legal trouble. Was supposed to do my first therapy session yesterday but was drunk. I'm really starting to think twice about inpatient rehab. 

But everything I've read says how strict rehab is. No cell phones, rarely get visitors, you can't even be around patients of the opposite sex. I'm not stable enough to be in a healthy relation now anyway, but no sex life? C'mon! So I don't think that route is for me either. The county and insurance would pay for most, if not all, of it but I'm sure it won't be a nice place. Almost as bad as jail.

Did anyone else get to a super weird drunk space while PMSing? Not even black out but like... I’d be very conscious of it, but suddenly go from 0 to feeling like the room was about to fly off the planet. It was more than just vertigo though, it was like alcohol hit me in a different way than normal. I’d be confused, wondering how it happened only a few drinks in, and have to leave if I was out at a party or go lay down if I was at home. Then a few days later when the red tide came on, it’d spark *OH* well that explains it!

Of course drinking me would chalk it up as a normal reaction to alcohol and laugh it off as some weird pseudo-science, body-chemistry, depleted-something-or-other and wait for it to turn up again next month. And the next month, and so on.

This month I’m thankful for only cramps and some extra haunts from my face demons! Well, maybe thankful still isn’t quite the right word... :)",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9970958232879639}"

By 12 pm I'm as good as new and productive as always.

But now that it's been 4 days since my last drink (and the last one was a banger, let me tell you that, I still have my blue eye from the time I tried to go to the bathroom while utterly drunk), I seriously start to worry. My digestion system still has its downs and I know it's alcohol-related, because well, I'm sort of an expert on this at this point. My sleeping schedule went from total insomnia on day 1 & 2 to barely making it alive on day 3, then sleeping for almost 10 h and still waking up utterly exhausted on day 4. I have headaches similar to those on hungover, so I guess my body is still fighting off the alcohol out of the system.

I get irritated easily, which is a weird combination with my newly-found patience. It's not like I give zero ducks, it's just now my ducks are given on special occasions. Most of the time - it's not the time. And I'm fine with that. I thought I'd be more worried of what might people say, or maybe get too much of workload on myself, maybe not be as assertive as I should be, but as it turns out... everything's working fine for me so far.

I've reconciled with my friend, I've got back in touch with the one I love (the one who got engaged to another girl last week, what wrecked me pretty badly), and I finally find some more selfless part of being a friend in me. I'm no longer the damsel in distress, always depressed, always the one with the most problems on her head, always the one who needs help, not the one to give anything to anybody.

I've came to a theory that alcohol helps to maintain self-taught (learned?) helplessness. It's a state where one is always in trouble and always miserable. It's almost impossible to cheer this person up and completely pointless to try and give them any advice. They'll brush it off and blame everything else around (including them being born in the wrong family, despite it being like 30 years ago or so), and generally will tend to see problems in things that are out of their control. Because then it's just fate, right?

Writing on this subreddit helped me realize that what triggers my drinking the most are my memories. My life was far from perfect even before I started drinking. Then I made some valid efforts, most of them while still being drunk most of the evenings, but the memories and nightmares kept coming, as if they were calling me back to ""my place"".

And it's like ""hello darkness my old friend"" again - my default and weirdly comfortable state is when I'm overworked, underslept, depressed, in love with someone who's either abusive or emotionally unavailable, in an ongoing fight with at least 3 people at once, lonely, and finally - sitting with a glass of wine, completely content in all this mess around me, trying to ""accept my fate"".

Like bull##t, this is not my ""fate"". There's no divine higher power that takes pleasure in torturing me. There's never been a more abusive partner in my life than myself. It is I who keeps on telling myself how bad life is and how I will never make it.

I remember my mother used to be like this. BPD, narcissistic - not sure which one fits her better, but she's like the master of puppets. And it is very dangerous for a kid to have a mother like that. She used to tell me to never go anywhere, never try anything, never make friends with anyone (""You'll only bother them"" as if I had nothing to offer as a friend), and generally to just stay close to her and listen to her for the rest of my days. Because ""Momma knows best"". Because ""World is dangerous out there and I simply don't have what it takes"". I remember I had to put up a fricking FIGHT to even go to college. I live in Europe, there's no college fee in public education, but you still need money to live (rent, food, general life etc), so it's not like I could just hop on the college train and go off to another city. Before I got my scholarships in order and was able to make some money on weekends to support myself, they'd keep on blackmailing me hoping to drag me back to hometown.

I guess I got some ""fate"" virus installed in my mind. It's easy to think that one's been written off by some god upstairs, who's got a sick sense of humour. It's easy to think that because living in abusive family trains you to be fit with abusive people for the rest of your life- unless you do something about it and heal yourself. It's not definitive. It's up to you.

I like to look at good things that come with bad experiences. Usually those are soft skills like so-called intuition, empathy, maybe forgiveness. Some more profound understanding of importance of things. Once you go through that threshold and let yourself enter the real, sober world, you'll discover you literally have superpowers. There will be things that will come to you easier than to others. You may be struggling with everyday life, but people will still love you, because you have lived a thousand lives. And others are usually as lost as you are, so let's help each other figure this all out.

I believe it was Milan Kundera that wrote ""To live once is like to never live at all"" (by the way I highly recommend ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" - just the title alone speaks volumes to me). But we've lived multiple times, the more we relapsed and died inside, the more we destroyed ourselves and then got back in the saddle, we literally lived, died, and came back.

Does that make sense to anybody?

Bear in mind that I was ready to cave-in, but assigning a number to the craving forced me to 1) think about it, which moved the craving to the logical part of my brain, and 2) realize it wasn't that bad, even though I had hard wired myself to react without any thought whatsoever. 

Incidentally, I gave it a 3. Today was a 4 for a little while, but this process (plus taking a very deep, mindful breath) untied the knot. Ten minutes later it was history.

You do this to provide greater personal insight to your clinicians and to probe your own warped thought patterns and unhealthy decision making. Plus, once you complete this brief paper and it is approved by your attending physician you are afforded additional privileges. Namely, instead of one staff-supervised walk around campus per day, you are allowed four unsupervised walks. Basically, you get to smoke. And even many non-smokers find the confinement and stultifying boredom to be good reasons to pick up the habit. Level 1 is total restriction to the cramped, overcrowded unit itself. Level 2 gets you that one walk per day. Level 3 is the four unsupervised walks. I made a decision early in my stay that I was mentally, emotionally and physically exhausted. I had already explored my history of substance use ad nauseum in other forums. I didn’t need extra walks. I needed to rest and to heal. Besides, whatever I scribbled would never be up to my rigorous standards.

And then a night nurse, a sweet, well-meaning woman who had taken a shine to me, badgered me into submission. When I was at the window waiting for my meds, she shoved a pad of paper and a pen in my hands. This was technically two days before my scheduled discharge. But this day was over and the day after next I would only be there in the morning, packing and filling out paperwork. This left one day. I pleaded with her. I didn’t want or need this pressure. I was almost done. My work was almost done.

“Hey,” she said. “You told me you liked to write. You have to write this. Come on, come on, come on. Do it for me, okay? I’m sure it’ll be great.”

“But I have to see the doctor tomorrow and I have a bunch of groups to attend and-”

“Nonsense. You have all day. I’m sure you’ll find the time. You need to do this.”

I did need to write. Without writing to solidify me I effectively have no identity. But I was hoping to hold on till I got back home where my writing had the chance of reaching a modest audience immediately. Who was I writing this recycled garbage for? It didn’t fully sink in till I forced myself to touch pen to paper the next morning. Then it became crystal clear. I was in the zone. The unit was full to bursting with miserable addicts going through agonizing withdrawals. There was no peace and quiet to be had. And I had a roommate who was constantly coming and going and striking up random conversations. I was not deterred. I was covering old ground, sure, but new insights were constantly presenting themselves to me even as I traversed well-worn paths. I was excited. I was enthralled with the work of creative self-discovery.

The results may not be mind-blowing. I had just finished my Librium taper, I was cranky and foggy-headed and I was just desperate to get it done by deadline. The average length of these papers is one-and-a-half to two pages. By the time I was done I had written eight. If I had the stamina, or if my roommate hadn’t constantly been saying things like, “Hey, Hemmingway, wrap it up already”, I probably could have continued for another eight.

If I still have your attention, dear reader, I present to you my semi-coherent ramblings from the depths of my detox:

I’m not going to recount in full my sordid history of drug and alcohol abuse. Too redundant. I’ve done it before at greater length and with greater clarity than anything I could reproduce here. But I will spare a few words before I move on to the circumstances of my latest relapse.

I started in my mid to late teens. It was sadly ironic. Up until my first use I had absolutely no intention of ever using. I treasured my brain. I protected it fiercely. It was the seat of my intellect that I prized above all things. Skewed priorities, I know. I was young. My brain and my mind enabled me to foster meaningful relationships and actively engage with the wider world. I was determined I would never do anything to damage my brain, my gift from a loving God, my precious possession. It was my sacred duty to guard it from the abusive acts of myself and others.

This all changed in high school when my mental illness fully manifested. I felt empty, agitated, alone and suicidal. I was desperate for relief from this intolerable suffering. Therapy was ineffective. So were the psych meds I was prescribed in abundance. Then suddenly generous offers started pouring in from all sides. Here, take my bottle of Gatorade mixed with vodka. Here, pop these pills. What are they? Don’t worry about it. They’ll make you feel better.

The alcohol and the sedatives and amphetamines and the opioids changed the fundamental fabric of my reality. I was no longer living a waking nightmare. Things were actually okay. The world and the people in it were okay. I was okay. It honestly felt like a spiritual awakening. Cheap, shallow and brief, but soothing and ecstatic. I wanted to feel this way always. I knew I was destroying my brain cells and hijacking my reward system. I was doing serious damage to the thing I loved the most. But this was a fight for survival. Without the chemical boost to make life bearable, palatable, I very well may have taken my life. And my brain had betrayed me. It had turned on me. I was determined to strike back. Mutually assured destruction. How do you irradiate a tumor when your brain *is* the tumor?

This back-and-forth continued for years. I got kicked out of college and derailed my future. I lost multiple jobs, relationships and ridiculous sums of money. But my basic needs, food and shelter and the like, were provided by my supportive but unwitting family. I worked only to get enough money to fuel my drug habit. I was a binge user. I could go weeks sober, as long as I knew that my sweet drugs lay at the end of the rainbow. And I went through soul-sapping opioid and amphetamine withdrawals on a regular basis. Not alcohol. That would come much later. But I became acclimatized to suffering. I simply didn’t care, not about myself and not about anyone or anything else. I had shattered all my dreams, goals and ambitions. Self-respect and healthy self-esteem were replaced by pride in my addict cunning and my ability to manipulate others. I thought this was power, but I was utterly powerless. I was a stranger to my better, sober self.

I came to enjoy the relentless back-and-forth. My brain became comfortable only in the euphoric peaks and the dismal, hopeless caves. I despised the tranquil valleys. I craved only the extremes, positive or negative. Through extreme suffering I validated my existence. Serenity was a living death.

Slight tangent, but certainly related and we don’t talk about it enough, I started to find I could get a fix through self-harm. This was close to the ultimate negation of self-regard. I brutalized my body. My whole body. And like any addiction it only increased in frequency and severity. Cuts, burns, concussions, broken hands, sprained ankles. I literally tortured myself. If someone else did to me what I’ve done to myself they’d be spending life in prison. And I did it for relief from that same psychic pain. And out of shame and self hatred. Self-punishment. I would hold a hot lighter down on my skin for many agonizing seconds while screaming, “Take this, motherfucker!”

I was a cowardly, lazy, lying, selfish, self-pitying addict. That was my identity. I lacked any identifiable positive traits to tether me to a healthier conception of myself. My family loves me? Intellectually I understood and appreciated this. But my heart was broken and I couldn’t feel their love. I wasn’t worthy of it. I’m a vampire and your love shines like the sun. It burns me. It hurts me. I have to run away.

I remained in treatment for seventeen years, up until this stay, both inpatient, partial hospital, day treatment and regular outpatient. Better than nothing and I am grateful for all the help and support afforded to me by kind, knowledgeable, well-meaning individuals, but I was virtually untreatable. I went through treatment like a ghost, especially in later years after I lost all hope and interest and was merely going through the motions to appease friends, family and the powers that be. Among my other diagnoses, Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Acute Stress Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder (confirmed during this latest inpatient stay), I have to take the liberty of adding one of my own, ‘terminal uniqueness’. Basically I think I’m super special. My case is, in plain truth, unique and complicated, sure, but I’m not special. I’m curious about other people. I ask a lot of questions. Maybe too many. Sometimes I hear things that do resonate. And then I get envious. How did you *get* *it*? How are you actually feeling better? You must be a bronze medal sufferer. I’m gold medal. For me it’s a competition. If I don’t have it the worst then I get survivor’s guilt. And I need to find meaning and purpose in my suffering. So I’ve come to view the entirety of my life as a piece of perverse performance art. Pain is my masterpiece. Angels, demons gather round and witness. Isn’t this story compelling? Are you not entertained?

But maybe that’s the real roadblock on my road to recovery. I’ve mistaken my sickness for my actual self and I don’t know how to reclaim my identity. I’ve had moments where I felt okay. Just okay. I instantly panicked. If I feel okay, and rock bottom is my baseline, then something is seriously wrong. The universe and I were sworn enemies. It always had some ugly trick up its sleeve. Some would call them tough life lessons, a message to get my shit together or die. My soul needed to grow and heal and it was being sabotaged and stymied at every turn. Cool. I get it. But tough love is not what I need right now. I need soft, kind, honest love. I consider this crap cosmic bullying of the weak, sick and vulnerable.

Because I’m the victim here, aren’t I?

I could not relinquish my self-defeating victim mentality, my learned-helplessness, my powerlessness. It absolved me of blame and responsibility. It validated my pain and my trauma. I have been victimized, but I’m not a victim. If only I could believe that I could reassume my agency, my control over my life. I feel like the puppet of a vindictive demon. I need to start cutting those strings.

Time to cut to the chase. My latest relapse. I had had a month of sobriety. I have a blog and I was writing furiously, every day, from dawn till dusk. Writing has always been my passion, but when I wasn’t actually hammering away on the keys I felt the void sucking at soul, that excruciating aching emptiness. I checked my statistics. I tend not to pander. I write about some challenging topics. And still a few people were reading and providing thoughtful and heartfelt feedback. I was grateful and humbled. But it did nothing to satisfy that ache. If finding modest success through my greatest passion couldn’t fulfill me, what hope did I have?

My brain was a black hole. It sucked in light itself, constantly ravenous. I smoked, I drank boatloads of coffee, I ate of ton of sugar and I punched the occasional wall. None of this did the least to satisfy the hunger of the black hole, but it provided me with enough relief to keep a knife from my throat.

I was in bad shape. This was an unsustainable mode of living and being. I wrote a piece for the exceptional publication [Beautiful Hangover](https://medium.com/beautiful-hangover) entitled [All I Want for Christmas is to Sober](https://medium.com/beautiful-hangover/all-i-want-for-christmas-is-to-be-sober-f9c6f307157e?source=friends_link&sk=1796b520ad3a431985adbe068b428820). This was an especially important message to myself and the wider world because the Christmas prior I had gotten so drunk I required hospitalization. My family was devastated. My little niece and nephew were scared and confused. “Is Uncle sick?” Yes, he is. I swore up and down it would be different this year. I would be sober, present and engaged for my loved ones. I wouldn’t let my anxiety or my selfish refusal to endure a little temporary discomfort chase me away into the shadows. But I do suffer from extreme social anxiety as well as PTSD from events surrounding holidays past. I felt hollow, afraid, overwhelmed and borderline suicidal.

I needed to be there. I needed to escape. The tug-of-war between my dark demons and my better angels was renewed in earnest. The angels lost one cold day in mid December. I lost. I had to drink. I wanted to drink. Sobriety would literally be the death of me. I would escape one way or another. Warped, backwards logic, I know, but I wasn’t in my right mind. I was bored and in pain. I saw no future for myself. Under the influence everything goes pleasantly quiet and dark. Your consciousness converges on the dreamy present. The future is just a fiction. A fairy tale we tell ourselves to give additional dimension and significance to our timeless but meaningless lives.

So I drank through the holidays and I hid, either in my room or in the basement, under the guise of physical illness. My writing declined in output and quality. It became angrier, darker more self-serving, less focused and more bombastic. And maybe a touch more honest? I don’t know. That being said, drunk or not, I’m still a decent writer and there are a couple gems hidden amidst the coal. But when you’re a regular contributor to a publication and they suddenly reject six pieces in a row, you might have lost your way. Suffice to say, this is my first sober piece of writing in a few weeks. I’m sober, but I’m still physically and psychologically a wreck. It might stay in my pocket.

Anyway, my family was kind and understanding during my ‘sickness’. Then I got brash and reckless. I drank around the clock, absurd amounts of vodka, while trying to give my best sober performance and feeling like a king. They were all fooled. Except they weren’t. I was unsteady on my feet. My eyes didn’t look right. I was slurring my words and became overly chatty or overly teary, depending on the time of day.

My mother made me give her my wallet and car keys. I was still rational enough to concede. Maybe this could be a helpful roadblock. And it was. For all of two days. Then I went scavenging, found the wallet, took out the cash I needed and put the wallet back. I told my mother I really needed some fresh air. I was going for a walk. She happily encouraged me. Exercise could only do me good. I agreed and sprinted out the door. I walked a mile and a half to the nearest liquor store, bought three pints of their cheapest vodka, squeezed the pints behind my belt and powerwalked home. I promptly proceeded to get hammered.

We all know this is. If you’re an addict and you want your fix bad enough you will get it. The sheer desperation, that trumps even the primal instinct to survive, can produce amazing acts of cunning, ingenuity and willpower. And sometimes the hunt is just as thrilling as the kill.

My drinking progressed over the next couple weeks. I began to experience my first real alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Nausea, increased anxiety, insomnia, muscle stiffness, fast heart rate and mild tremors in the morning. All new to me as a lifelong binge drinker. But I did know you could die withdrawing from alcohol, and though part of me is always looking to exit stage left, this was not the way out. So I knew the physical danger I was in. And my family knew I was struggling, but they had no idea how dire the situation was.

I hate the loss of control, the surrendering one must experience on an inpatient admission. But I had already lost control. I was committing passive suicide. So I wrote a piece on my blog, [It May Be Time To Go Inpatient](https://medium.com/invisible-illness/it-may-be-time-to-go-inpatient-748c70b6c66?source=friends_link&sk=032da5b0c878df146abdb554c7685e9b). It got a fair number of reads and seemed to resonate with people, for which I’m truly grateful. It was another declaration to me and to the world. Well it was really meant for strangers’ eyes only. I was seriously considering it, but not fully committed. Then I realized my sister is on this platform as well. Damn. She read it and passed it along to my mother. Now it was real. They both viewed it as me making a wise choice for my health and safety. My mother had been living with my drinking for a month now and she was terrified and sick of living in fear. I didn’t get it. Do people truly care about me? Selflessly care? It’s hard for me to fathom.

After a few more days of heavy drinking I finally did the right thing. The only thing. I told my psychiatrist I had relapsed. He asked me what I wanted to do. I told him I wanted to detox inpatient. He thought this made a lot of sense. I suspect he was humoring me. I expect if I had given any other answer he would have had me forcibly committed. But I was surrendering. I was asking for help. I wasn’t quite ready to lose my life to booze. But it was extremely hard. I don’t actually trust anyone. No one knows me. Not really. I try to be honest. Sometimes I’m too honest. Other times I live in a fantasy reality constructed upon a foundation of a thousand well-crafted lies. And then I still can’t quite articulate what lies at the center of my soul, what makes me tick. This is very frustrating and isolating. I’m wandering through a perpetual dream. Nothing is ever quite solid or real. I don’t speak to people. I speak to spirits in a haunted wasteland. Alcohol helps me to care a little less, to flow with the dark currents of this existential nightmare.

Regardless, inpatient I went. After the usual bureaucratic rigmarole at the local ER I landed here, at McLean. When I was first admitted it was surreal. I had wanted to die a free man on my own terms. Or, at least, part me did. I couldn’t believe I was back in detox, pleading for the help of other humans I didn’t know or trust. I was a beaten man. Physically, mentally, spiritually. I was utterly exhausted. I was going off base instinct, in simple survival mode. What resources did I have to commit to wellness?

It’s been a few days and I’m still pretty messed up, but I’ve noticed improvements. When I arrived I was a shell, willing to be cracked and flushed down the drain of eternity. They dosed me up on Librium, anxiety and sleep meds. I slept virtually all day. I was so sedated at one point I actually pissed myself. It’s detox. Stuff happens. But now I’ve completed my Librium taper. The withdrawal symptoms have subsided. I make it to groups. I’ve had several engaging and illuminating conversations with my fellow patients. Groups of people make me nervous but I adore 1–1 interactions. That’s my sweet spot.

And now I’m going to be transferred to a two week residential program. I’m very anxious. I just want to go home and pat my dog and get back to doing some real, heavy, sober writing. But that wouldn’t work for me or my family. I seriously screwed up and I must atone. I must heal. They say you can only succeed if you are doing it for yourself. What if you don’t give a shit about yourself and go to bed each night hoping you won’t wake up in the morning?

I have a lot of serious self-work to do.

Do I want to heal, really? The best I can do is to say I’m really not ready to shuffle off this mortal coil. I’ve been mentally ill and using substances so long I’ve been paralyzed in my own personal hell. I can honestly say I’ve never really lived.

I would like to live.

I was ultimately glad for this nurse’s encouragement. My chest hurt typing this up, but it felt good to scribble it down initially. The nurse read it in front me. She had tears in her eyes and she said:

Everything I quit before, I have high ups the first few weeks, where waking  up without a hang over is so amazing that I feel great and hopefully and alive. Over course, it doesn’t last, I’d get depressed and then the drinking starts again. I’m sure this is familiar to everyone here.
But this time, I didn’t even have those first few weeks of rose-tinted glasses. I’ve been miserable, lonely and hopeless for the past hundred days. It seems to just be getting worse, and with the weather getting warmer, I’m craving alcohol more than I have this whole time. The only reason I’ve been sober this long, and haven’t given to temptation, is because I’m on medication that would cause side effects if I drink on it (not antibuse) I guess I always told myself that when I quit, I’d be happy, I’d be OK.

I hate having to sit with myself, I hate how I can’t connect with anyone any more, and I hate how I haven’t been happy most of my life.

The next day I'll say ok that's enough then mid day I'm thinking about what booze I want.

He was really sick from it yesterday but he had some beers in the evening. Last night was the worst I've ever seen him. I was up with him most of the night because he needed support. He was anxious, hyper ventilating, talking about all sorts of topics, overthinking, he said he felt pressure in his head and his eyes were killing him, etc. This morning I found him a facility that accepts our insurance and got him all setup. He's been in bed all day and is really hurting. He asked the counselor if he could go on Friday.

Here's my current dilemma: The rehab called back and said they can't take him until Sunday morning. Our options are to have him go to a detox center on Friday, stay there for a week, and then get transferred or to just wait until Sunday. I haven't mentioned this to him yet since he is resting. Does anyone have any suggestions based on their own withdrawal experience? I've seen him sick before but never like this and I am fearful of what could happen in the next 2-4 days.

I had enough of feeling apathetic. Just wanted some relaxion already. A quick fix if you will. 

I‘ll just go and pour some wine or smirnoff down my throat, after so much stress in life, I ,,DeSeRVe iT“. 

,,Oh, I miss the fun times!”, my primitive addiction brain whispers. But WHY WE NEVER REMEMBER THE BAD TIMES WITH ALCOHOL?! Because addiction is so tricky. It only shows you the good to make you drink.

After work, I was going on my way home near the alcohol shop, who also is on my way home. 

But my legs- they just kept going. My mind was kind of apathetic. I wanted to grab a drink but my legs didn‘t even think of getting in the shop.

,,The floor is lava“ but with alcohol shops.

My legs went slower but never stopped walking away.

It just felt WRONG to go in, it felt WRONG to just CONSIDER it. It felt like I‘m a new person now and going in wasn‘t for me anymore. 
The act of giving money for exchange of mild poison seemed like an bad deal for me. Even though I craved the relaxation that came with the poisonous drink.

I looked for a second inside while walking- and I thought automatically to myself: Oh boy, there are sure some lost souls in this alcohol shop, early evening on a Wednesday, and they have no other joy after work, just colourful and habitual alcohol.
Formerly I always thought about them: oh boy they are lucky they are in there.

I saw a very young man, seemed shy, gripping the beer with one hand as if it‘s the sweet release after labor.

I felt like the shop was a legal drug shop.

I felt so weird today, with every fibre of my body, like it was a lesson.
Like I live in a parallell universe.
Like I was just here to watch everything happening and not do the same mistake again.
On a mission to find peace already.
But not with booze- the false peace.

At home, I fell instantly in my bed. For a second, I felt empty. 

But followed by the most cozy feeling ever. 

I couldn‘t have forgiven myself if I would have drank today. I would feel absolutely at the edge now. But now, thanks to the strange behaviour of my legs, here I am, sober and cozy, thankful.

YOU WON’T REGRET NOT DRINKING!

How it comes, that brain makes a decision to drink today, trash all your good intentions, but your body won‘t let it?

My mind is already wandering to the shop again- but hopefully my legs- even without any brain- will decide wiser again. 

Two scenarios went trough my mind: 1. being drunk and at risk for many things, or being sober  and secure in my home. 

Home sweet home.

The body demands the endorphine- but the body unconsciously knows it will kill it so the FIGHT begins- N O W.

There is nothing cozier than arriving safely and sober to your beloved home, trust me.

The relaxation you seek is not in alcohol.💖

Yeah, right. Out of his life for 16 months, in and out of rehab 3 years prior to that.  Since then he's been happier and healthier all around.   Not to mention the fact that his therapist has told her absolutely no unsupervised visits (self-harm risk).  

That, combined with another close financial pay period (AC went out just as it started getting hot and a school fee for a large end of year trip was required on short notice, and of course I couldn't let him stay at home while his friends all went) and just being disrespected the last few days at work has really driven the jackhammer deeper.

Then last night I was invited to drinks with a VP who was visiting. Great career opportunity. I had to turn it down feigning no babysitter (I was given an hours notice).  Fortunately I think i saved face over lunch in the office today. But he mentioned I missed out on the bar they went to, which to be honest is an awesome barcade.   He even remembered my two favorite drinks.  And that's why I didn't go.  My son could have gone to a friends house.  But I couldn't trust myself to ""only have one"".  More than likely I would have had to uber back to their house to pick him up, and they would all know why i needed to uber... ugh.

I keep having to tell myself: I'm doing this because I need to be here for my son. I need to be here for me.  I need to be healthier.  And it fucking hurts to get sober.  I don't want another day 1.  Each day 1 has gotten harder.

IWNDWYT,"I’ve always used alcohol, like many of you, as a crutch. For social anxiety, for ‘a good time’, but also importantly to dull the pain. 

I’d reach for the bottle whenever I feel down, when I felt hopeless, when I felt that nothing was going right. I’d just want something to take away the pain, to calm the panic attacks, to sooth the heartbreak and hopelessness. I’d search for the answer at the bottom of the pint glass, or under the 8th shot of absinthe. I’d fuck up further when I was dead drunk, ruining friendships, relationships, and professional opportunities, which would send me into a deeper spiral.

In therapy we realized that when I was happy and was drinking socially, and my life was otherwise well balanced, I’d be absolutely fine. I’d be the life of the party and know when to stop. Then, alcohol was perhaps a supplement to a fun night. Something cool to have maybe but not necessary at all. But whenever I felt like I HAD to drink to get the monkey off my back, to take the edge off, or to get wasted to forget something or become someone else, I’d drink to the point of blacking out and fucking up.

This week has been one of the hardest in my life, with literally nothing going right. I’ve been having panic attacks and spent my time depressed and crying in my room. The only thing that has been going well is that I clearly recognized that drinking will only make it worst. I know that touching the bottle is not an option, because I can see my pattern of abuse and I’m deciding to end it. It’s taken so fucking long to know this, but amidst the heartbreak, the tears, and the long cold mornings, I will not drink with you today.

In a section about character development, the author lists some things you should know about your character to get a sense of your character's inner life, including, ""What would be the first thing they stopped doing if they found out they had six months to live? Would they start smoking again?""

I figured this isn't a bad question to ask about one's self, either! Especially for us SDers, who are on this journey of self-discovery now that alcohol is not in the way. 

I'm going to write what *I hope* I would do:
The first thing I would stop doing is wasting time on Social Media and the internet! I do think I would start vaping again because I enjoyed it and the main negative effects were on my physical health and the long-term psychological effects of being addicted to something (not as concerning if you only have six months). I hope I would NOT start drinking again because I think that would be a sure-fire way to not truly live my final months! Both alcohol and internet/social media distractions compete with life.

Observation: I would say quitting nicotine was harder in the short term, but quitting alcohol has been harder to maintain. This is ironic, because based on my answer above, and upon reflection, I value a alcohol-free life way more than I value a nicotine-free life. I think alcohol is just so much more ingrained in society.

I could write a lot more about the differences between going nicotine-free and alcohol-free but that is for another post or my journal!

Recently I went to an AA meeting, and noticed a lot of my friends were blowing me off. The one who would talk to me said that people didn’t like how I live. I have medical marijuana prescribed by a doctor. My friend said I was using pot as a crutch and was manipulating the doctor to get what I want (I have a disability that qualifies for m. marijuana). I don’t believe in a higher power- I’ve tried. I’ve prayed on my knees morning and night, asked for guidance. But after my last relapse I realize I just don’t believe in god or a higher power, personally. My friend said that I refuse to relinquish control to god because I just want to control everything in my life. They went on to list character defects, such as “arrogance, manipulative, immature, controlling.” I felt very sad after bc these were some of my oldest friends. I know they don’t necessarily agree with how I approach sobriety but I didn’t think they would be so harsh to me.


It says right in the big book;
“One may feel that for years their drinking has placed them on the wrong side of every argument. But now he has become a superior person with god on their side”
I feel like the people judging me are neglecting that paragraph. AA celebrates sobriety. They teach you to love those that are different, but my friends are not treating me as such. 


I moved to the city 3 months ago- homeless with nothing and one day of sobriety, coming out of a severe episode of psychosis. Since then, I’ve been promoted at work repeatedly, a job that I love, have regular doctor apps, and 93 days sober. My coworkers and other non AA friends are very supportive. 



To note, I’m not sure if it’s because they follow AA so strictly or that maybe they’re right. But no one around me besides them agreed with their criticism. I was wondering what any one else’s take on it was. Am I misunderstanding them?

Now, I don’t miss alcohol, but I think I’m starting to really understand why it was such a pervasive problem for me. 

It’s like I’m living as if I get unlimited attempts at life, and I’m not giving this attempt my full attention or effort. There are unlimited possibilities and yet I’m often unenthused about the path I’m on, feeling condemned to live out a lackluster life of barely rising above mediocrity. Alcohol created brief lapses in my consciousness that left me feeling worse afterward, but provided some relief in those fleeting moments. 

I often lay awake at night, exhausted but unable to rest; another thing I desperately tried to evade by drinking. I know in the morning the world will be brighter, but knowing that somehow never diminishes the angst and unsettled feeling residing in my chest. Drinking must have been a behavior my subconscious manifested to prevent that state of mind, because consciously I assumed I was drinking because I liked it. 

My life is unequivocally better sober, but it’s not so good that I feel fulfilled or even alive a lot of the time. There are, of course, times that optimism wells up and inspires me, but these times are often overshadowed by the feelings of lacking purpose and direction. I know these thoughts contributed to, and were used as false justification for my drinking, and I’m afraid that if they aren’t quelled that I’ll slip back into the old, self-defeating patterns I’ve worked so hard to get away from.

I am enjoying tinkering with things again. Ive bought all new tools and Ive pulled all my fishing reels apart and repaired them, built a bike, fixing things around my house, chopping firewood, organising and restoring my neglected camping gear, sharpening and remembering my passion for knives... ive started salting baits for fishing. Im in the process of applying to finance a small boat because i always wanted one and dont know if i want to kayak in open ocean. I want to learn to scuba dive and spearfish even though im terrified of open water. 

My minds going a million miles an hour. Which is good but its a reason i used to want to numb it. Drives me a bit insane. I think my relationship is suffering because im so interested in stuff and my partner doesnt seem to have any hobbies apart from travel and we cant do that 24/7. We are goin to germany and bali/japan as well as christmas island hopefully but in between i just seem to do my own thing and i have to keep busy or im worried ill drink out of boredom

I have no craving to drink but im starting to remember how much i need somethin to slow myself down a bit.

When people yet again canceled last minute on something I had been accommodating for in the afternoon, I felt unusually angry about it and for longer. Biking for an hour with 12 kg on my back for nothing isn't fun. About an hour later I remembered I had that bottle and when yet an hour later I still felt pretty pissed off, I started doubting whether I could trust myself with it. To stay ahead of any possible temptations, I decided to give it to my neighbors (who I barely know) for safekeeping until Friday; briefly explaining I have an alcohol problem and that something happened that day which caused me not to trust myself with it at that moment. She was very nice about it, even congratulating me on my 10 months and of course she didn't mind keeping it for a little while.

A while ago I probably would have been too ashamed to even consider something like that, let alone ask them. In fact, I didn't really ask any help from people in person (this subreddit was very helpful instead). I'm so glad now that in the meantime I've learned not to be afraid of showing my flaws, while simultaneously taking responsibility for them. It really adds to my self-respect and the confidence that people won't quickly reject you for your flaws.

Moments like this do humble me. Two months ago [I seriously considered](https://redd.it/f0ul6k) to slowly start to drinking again occasionally, which I rejected it. I have grown tremendously since my sobriety, and in January I felt that maybe I could handle it again. This situation really put me back in my place and empowers my decision.

Meta comment: My perspective on things has become so more positive, previously I could have seen this moment as a failure: ""I can't go with alcohol in my home"", but now I see that recognizing it on time and doing something to prevent anything from happening is actually a much more useful skill, as you're not going to be perfect at everything you do.",19,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9918632507324219}"

I find I can’t go more than 3-4 days without reaching for a drink. It’s not always an excessive amount but it’s always some. I’ve began to notice it is very much a stress coping mechanism for me. I workout about 5 times a week for an hour and a half, I have a full time professional career, great relationships with family and friends so I have always told myself I am not an alcoholic because I take care of myself, others around me and am good at what I do.

Additionally, when my fiends and I get together we always default to social drinking, it’s just easy. My boyfriend, however, does not drink and has never had a drink in his life. When I turned 26 my skin began to break out and I now have terrible cystic acne and lots of scarring.

So after his first meeting the first thing he did was open into a conversation about what they were learning there (loving with detachment). I told him that I was sincere about wanting us to be doing this independent of each other and that I didn't want to start sharing about what we did in our separate meetings. He got quiet after that, and I asked how he felt about what I said. He said that he was afraid to say the wrong thing but that he was ok. There was noticeable shift in the energy of the room and then he left to be alone. & Now I feel like a dick.

Part of my recovery is learning that I don't have to control how other people talk to me for me to be ok in a situation. At the same time, I also think that it is important for me to be able to walk my own path in AA and for him to walk his own path in Al-Anon.

 Love y'all!! IWNDWYT

2020-03-10 21:10:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fgou63/the_pressures_of_sobriety/,The pressures of sobriety,"I'm 31 years old and this is the longest I've stayed sober since I left high school. 100 days seemed impossible for so long but I've managed to stick it out on my own through books, blogs, fitness, support from my husband and truly, life is great right now. 

Something that I don't see discussed about sobriety a lot, though, has been on my mind since about Day 80: the pressure that comes with sobriety. I know that I've come so far but for some reason, I'm getting sudden, intense urges to drink again.  No new stressors in my life and I also keep myself very busy with exercise, work, meal prepping 3 meals a day, cleaning and reading so I don't think it's boredom either. 


 I think I have this big fear, bigger than it's ever been, of failure.  This feeling that if I make it 100 days+ and still relapse, I'm damaged for life and there is no escape.  I feel like the few people around me who know about my problem are just holding their breath around me, waiting for the hammer to fall.  I guess I worry the same thing, actually.   There's a pressure I've never felt before now that I beat my sobriety goal by a country mile and I hate that there's some impulse in me to sabotage myself.  


Has anyone else had this struggle? How do you make yourself, ""okay,"" with success? Is this even normal?  I thought after 3 months, it'd be smooth sailing.  I get urges when I'm not even stressed or unhappy (if I am, I work out), I'll just be bathing or driving or I'll find out I have the house to myself and suddenly, all I want is to sneak around buying bottles and hiding them.  Maybe I just also miss having a secret, even a pathetic one like squirreling away liquor all over my house.  I miss that feeling of having bulletproof sobriety.   I feel cheated somehow that I'm struggling so hard after 100 days, but I guess I didn't know exactly what to expect, never having surpassed day 58.

Clearly these all go hand in hand. One triggers another triggers another. 

I haven’t been taking my meds as prescribed and I haven’t been fighting to get the meds I really need. When I’m hungover I just don’t care so I don’t do anything about it. Other than drink some more, thinking that’ll fix it but it’s just a shitty bandaid. When I drink and don’t take my meds it’s a recipe for disaster. See also self harming ways and previous suicide attempt. I don’t want to go back there. But I don’t do anything to make it so it won’t happen, in fact I self sabotage and play with fire instead. 

I’ve gained a significant amount of weight from all this bingeing. Because bingeing for me means drinking my face off, bingeing on food late at night, feeling guilty and disgusting in the morning, not eating all day, and then starting the cycle all over at night. My weight is starting to really get in my way with my active lifestyle. And still, I don’t quit. Still that isn’t fire enough under my ass. I’m very self critical and a lot of my self worth is tied to how I look. Being the size I am right now is destroying my confidence. What little I had. 

And now I’ve added in weed. I actually don’t have a problem with marijuana and think it’s a much better drug, if one is to embibe. But when I drink I smoke and get extremely fucked up. I also tend to eat a whole lot more and blackout a whole lot easier. Like I did last night. And I stayed up until the wee hours of the morning. I can’t do all this to my body anymore. It’s rebelling. 

I called out of work. And I’m so anxious about that. I have a history of doing so and I can’t get back into that. I’ll be fired in a heartbeat and everything in my life will just be ruined. In so many ways. Ahhh.

It didn't start a downward spiral right away, my husband and I even said we were fine without drinking again for awhile after that Saturday night. We were until the next Saturday night when it was our birthday weekend (we are 362 days apart) and we wanted to drink at dinner with friends...and then someone bought us a bottle of Fireball, our favorite. We quickly started drinking again every day and were right back to where we were that summer. From October to January, we attempted to moderate and failed horribly. Even when I thought we were doing OK getting through the week sober, the weekends became forgotten days and nights of binging, blacking out, and some bad things happening. 

1/20/20 was day 1 and although this fucking sucks and it so fucking hard, I am so happy we are both at 50 days. He started going to the gym almost every day and drinking tea at night. I drink more coffee and threw myself into the move we just completed a couple weeks ago. Getting on a regular gym schedule with him is my next goal! We don't talk about it all the time, but we do check in with each other often and mention what day we are on. There's never a celebration and I guess the pink clouds everyone talks about were there for a week or two, but now it's just about every day living our lives the best we can and doing it without alcohol. We have been to events where others are drinking and always have a game plan before we leave that basically consists of ""Let's get food, hang out for a bit, and then peace out!"" We have both recognized we need this not only for ourselves, but for our marriage as well. 

Besides each other, we have a great support system. We have individual therapists that we have been able to be completely honest. That has helped us finally get the help we have needed for years to deal with other life issues and tackle our alcohol abuse. We have been honest with most of our family and most of our friends. The reactions have been interesting and definitely mixed. Most people knew we liked to drink, but had no idea we abused alcohol or any of the negative things that happened as a result. My stepdaughter is probably the only one that knew the extent because she grew up around us. She was the only one we felt like we needed to apologize to for anything that happened in the past. I was happy we were both able to last weekend without it turning into a cry fest. LOL Her Dad and I are criers, she is definitely not! She said things like ""It wasn't that big of a deal"", ""We always had so much fun"", and ""But did you die?"" trying to put a funny spin on it, but I know she knows the specific instances we felt the need to apologize for in the past.

Whew! I had no idea this was going to turn into a book, but it's cool. I love having this space to type out whatever needs to come out. I'm so happy I found all of you, too! Just reading everyone's accomplishments and struggles reminds me I am not alone or a bad person for having these issues.

I had nearly 2 years sober, relapsed for a week and ended up in A+E with acute pancreatitis (do not recommend, worst pain I've ever felt in my life) and that was AFTER almost dying in 2018, ending up in a coma on life support, left with a permanent disability and now being unable to work. 

I relapsed again about a month ago after having a cancer scare. Completely irrational response to the situation. I've thankfully got the all clear now and, incredibly, my liver function tests are completely normal. I had been exhausted since January which led to the investigations into my possible cancer symptoms, turns out that I'm severely anaemic (all 3 types, iron deficient, foliate deficient and B12 deficient). My doctor said that she was shocked i was able to get out of bed with such low levels. 

Anyway, I began treatment after getting the very relieving diagnosis this week. I am going to try again, I am scared of withdrawal symptoms but apart from a totally sleepless night last night the first 24 hours has gone ok. In fact, i went straight from drinking 500ml of vodka a day (or more) over the last 5/6 weeks to 50ml yesterday afternoon. I've had seizures in the past (I know how extra stupid this makes me for relapsing again!) so luckily have prescriptions for 3 different medications that prevent seizures including Clonozapam, as well as propranolol to stop the palpitations and codeine (prescribed for a serious  chronic back injury) to get me through the worst of it.

I can't face going to AA again, my experiences have been mixed but a lot of the time listening to others share reminded me of the 'good' things about drinking and i don't want to risk letting those thoughts in.

I'd also usually go way too far and be groggy if not hungover for (and more than likely having to apologize for something I couldn't even remember doing)  Saturday morning, which snowballed into a less than stellar weekend.

Recognizing this pattern helped me plan for NOT drinking last Friday. Knowing I just couldn't drink anything that evening helped me focus on finding other things to do that were healthier and once I made it over that hurdle, I managed to stay sober the rest of the weekend as well. Enjoyed time with the wife and rolled it into a good start to the week yesterday.

Today and yesterday I woke up with an intense urge to drink. My mind starts thinking “just drink a little bit and then stop, you can do it.” I know from evidence that I can’t. My mind tells me that it’ll make me happy, give me motivation, make me feel ok for a bit. My brain has a sick way of making me forget, and telling me it makes perfect sense that I drink.

My response lately has been: this could be the worst day of my life. I could lose my job, lose my fiance , lose my family, lose everything. I can stumble home smelling like death. I can wake up the next morning with anxiety and no one there to help me. I can spend the next few days unable to eat anything. I could end up in a hospital or rehab. All I need to do is drink. And then I try really hard to picture how that would feel like.

I put the bottle down then and there in a vein attempt to win her back.

If I dont drink, I've had seizures in the past, i puke blood. I cant move from bed and i overall cant function. I've been creeping on this sub for awhile getting a couple days here and there fighting to stay sober. I finally broke down and got my xanax script again, (also have bi polar and severe anxiety). I've been doing a little too much of the xanax, technically I should be on 3mg a day but my script is for 1mg right now. I've been taking 2mg a day. I still miss the bottle every second but I'm going back to AA and im with a new girl who's apart of the same punk scene (which for those who don't know, substance abuse runs rampant in the punk scene).

I’m still slogging through a brief illustrated history of China, just reading a page here and there in hardback. On the Kindle I just finished Book V of Karl Ove Knausgaard’s *My Struggle* series. I was saying last week how drinking seems to be the cause of so many of his problems and in the last quarter of the fifth book that is especially true. He also circles back to his father’s death by alcoholism at age 55 in this one (Book I pretty much centers on this). And yet he never seems to get angry at alcohol. I suppose he has his reasons, but he seems to mostly see alcohol as something he loves in spite of the many problems it causes him and in spite of watching it slowly killing his father. 

It’s odd to me that he never delves into alcohol itself as an evil in the world. I suppose he still doesn’t see it that way. It feels strange to be at a loss for something about him here because after 5 volumes of “radical self revelation” autobiography, I feel like I know this man so well. But I don’t, really, of course, and I can’t say why he doesn’t have more fear or anger at alcohol. I’m probably just projecting my own issues onto the text here, as one does.

I was and am a socially anxious person and that alcohol let me become a “normal” person and go out with people and later party and have fun. As I got into my mid 20s and I needed more and more I began self isolating and drinking alone so that I could consume what I wanted without judgement. I loved that feeling of relief it would bring after a long day being with people.

Anyway, fast forward it gets really out of hand and so I quit for 18 months.

During that 18 months I got my shit together. I studied, I got a new job, I moved from an apartment to a nice house with my partner. Life’s going in the right direction.

Except I get really depressed during that time and the anxiety doesn’t go away. Eventually I end up on anxiety medication.

At some point my relationship got rocky. My partner resented that I didn’t really want to do much. This partly because I felt I needed to recover from work and just wanted relax after a long day and partly because I didn’t have my crutch of alcohol when we did go out.

Anyway, my partner left. Suddenly I’m living alone again and free to drink. It starts as weekends then progresses into most nights of the week.

Couple of years on and I’m going sober again. This is day 3.

But I don’t want to become depressed again. Why would I be depressed when I’m sober?

I know I wanted to quit to improve my life, but nothing has changed. My family tell me that they don't believe it'll last, my wife has become more distant saying it was easier when I was passed out drunk. I haven't lost any weight (and I'm carrying plenty) and I've lurched from one back injury to the next.

She thought she was functional, and she had a baby and one day while holding/carrying her baby while under the influence, she lost her balance and the baby fell down and smashed her head open on an edge of a corner of an appliance in the kitchen and she died. (I think it was an old cast iron stove if I recall correctly, not that it really matters, you get the point). Since babies' heads are soft and not fully developed, the impact caused her brains and blood to spill out. The woman shrieked in horror at what had just happened. She immediately realized it was the alcohol and her drinking that caused it. Then the woman committed suicide from the grief and guilt of killing her baby. 
If you have little ones, think good and hard about that desire to drink around any children. It comprises your ability to take care of them. This is just one example of how alcohol can cause an accident. I hope this helps any parents out there; I know this story has really helped me manage my urges to drink around my little one.

Done plenty of field research. Read so many books, listened to so many podcasts. So if you're stuck, or chained to your bed hung over, beating yourself up, read on... Maybe you'll relate to some things.

I don't stop drinking until I blackout. The reason seems to be that my brain has been trained to counter a slew of drinks on the first one, and only having one or two induces anxiety until I have more. Once it enters my system, the next drink is first priority. It is the main event. This is permanent. Even if I wait ten years this will always happen.

Alcohol has an excitatory effect on my brain. An exaggerated pleasure effect. While most people stop once they feel sedated, I don't get that way. I get very sociable and active until my BAC is super high. My ordinarily timid and reserved nature gives way to the ""let's do this"" attitude.

I tend to not remember things going bad, and hangovers are so much later my brain does not associate them with drinking. But it does cling onto that initial pleasure effect. The pleasure is so strong it makes other things boring in comparison. Playing frisbee? Seeing an art gallery? Will there be booze? Eventually receptors down regulate again.

The big pleasure rush is essentially in opiate rush. (That's why naltrexone works.) The feelings we get being connected with others and love are also opiate responses. That's why addiction is so isolating. Alcohol is literally our friend. It's destructive, but we don't see why or care enough to strongly want to seek human connection. 

Alcohol has formed strong neural pathways that bypass my decision making. It has trained my brain to treat alcohol as necessary for survival. 

The brain rewiring tricks you into thinking relapse is really your idea. It's not. All these effects go on in the learning and decision making areas of your brain. When you ask ""how could I have been so dumb?"" You are being played like a fiddle, that's how.

Eventually we face consequences strong enough to resonate with our subconscious and overpower the drive. That can be the rock bottom. For example being sober on work nights is way easier because of the consequences. Or if drinking again means a year in jail. The ""tipping point"" is different for everyone. 

I don't believe that alcoholism is a moral failing or a spiritual disease. It's chemical manipulation of our primitive brain. There are some genetic components.

I challenge you to think about your last relapse, the thought process going in, whether you were really in control, and attempts to moderate and why they likely failed. See if you can pinpoint where logic failed - that is where biology took over.

Be kind to yourself getting sober. Your brain has been through a lot. Thanks to neuroplasticity you will adjust. Examine every impulse. Force it into words and say it out loud. Does it make sense? ""I'm going to be glad I drank tonight. I'll be fine in the morning.""

3rd March saw the second anniversary of my sister in law's death from haemmorages caused by alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver. She was 45 years old and left a nine year old daughter. We had a difficult relationship;  her illness led to behaviours that pushed all of us to the ends of our tethers, and towards the end she determinedly pushed us all away. But I will always be grateful and humbled that her legacy to me was the wake up call I needed to stop drinking before it was too late. It took me a year after her death to finally make the decision, and I am not going to muck that up now by undoing all the hard work.

She is actually the younger sister of a good childhood friend, so I didn't hang out with her as frequently, but when it was friend plus friend's sister I got to know her. I've known their family for many years (25+). I know this person has had a lot of struggles - but as I said, she and I weren't really close, so it was just from infrequent FB posts that I saw snippets of her life.

She called, in tears, saying that she had broken up with her BF for the 2nd time in 6 months, and that she went out drinking. She got pulled over, was intoxicated (not her first DUI, apparently). Her landlord kicked her out, and she's back to living in a local apartment owned by her family.

She was desperately seeking someone sober to be with, as she doesn't really have any friends - they're just people she hangs out with and drinks with. She reached out to me because I'm in the area, and she knows I don't drink.

We made plans for me to pick her up at her dad's the following evening and go to a Young People's meeting together.

Texted an hour before. No answer. Texted before I left to drive the ten minutes over there. No answer. I was pretty sure what had happened at this point, but wanted to give benefit of the doubt. Called when outside. No answer. Knocked, and got let in. Went up to guest room.

She was there and totally blasted. It was such a sad sight to see. She was a mess. She kept saying she wanted to go to the meeting, but she could barely keep her balance. I said we'd have to wait for another time. We sat and talked briefly. I gave her a hug, and said when she's ready for change and wants someone to go to a meeting with she can call.

It just is so sad to me, to watch someone I grew up with, with this raging illness. I went home and hugged my husband, and said I am so happy to be living a life I could not have dreamed of a decade earlier. I sat on the couch and cried, because it's just so painful seeing someone I care about hurting themselves.

Not really seeking advice, but just wanted to share. I cannot/will not share to friends because it would be pretty obvious who I'd be talking about. It's hard to witness that, especially from the other side, and not feel sad.",34,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9970964193344116}"

I'm going on a road trip next week, and road trips (specifically multiple days on the road alone) are terrific times for me to flirt with disaster.

I’m 20 years old and I have a drinking problem, depression, anxiety, and above all a serious motivation issue. A good day to me would be waking up at 2 and drinking till 4. I’m sick of living my life like this. 


I’m beyond scared to go into rehab (Rosecrance in IL) and I’m really fucking sad I won’t get to see my dogs for 30 days, but I know I need to change. I’m a two time college dropout already and I’ve only worked shitty menial dead end jobs and I have no real skills. 


I still want to go to college but I’m not sure if that’s going to happen this Fall, so I’m hoping to find gainful employment once I’m out of rehabilitation. I just don’t know if I’ll be able to do either because I’m currently going to court dates for my DUI I got a few months ago


This is the turning point in my life. I don’t want to stop drinking and wait til I’m 21 to pick it up again, I want to stop drinking for the rest of my life and honestly I don’t even know if that will be possible.



To end this post I have a few questions:


Have any of you guys been to a 30 day rehab program like Rosecrance? What’s it like? Any tips?


If you have a DUI, what did you do about a job or going to college? I’m just so scared of it’s a felony I won’t ever be able to find a good job or go to school. I’m afraid I’ve fucked my life up for good unfortunately.

However, I have a close friend, let call him Karl, who we usually hang out at his place and that is where I mess up most of the times, however I did not know how to stop going, feeling like I was abandoning him. I know he has a problem with his drinking as well, and sometimes he recognize it and sometimes not. And the last few weeks, he kept commenting to me that I do not have a problem, it's in my head, nothing wrong with enjoying a drink etc...

So this week end I messed up bad like bad, we had a row another friend had to get involved, his dealer left like hell was on his ass, it was humiliating as you can imagine. But after 2 anxiety, sleeplessness and stomach wrenching day I feel like a human being again, and I came to 2 realisation: 

1. I am messed up, there is no way around it, however it is not the end until I stop trying to get better.

2. I am messed up, and if others do not want to see that then they are detrimental to my getting better and I need to cut them lose. 

In other terms, my sobriety is my own and I have to take responsibility for it, playing the cool girl that can handle her drinks is not me anymore, I have to put it in my mind and accept the fact ( which I thought I did) that I am messed up, but it does not mean that I have to stay that way. What others thinks of me is not important because they cannot do my work for me or know my journey, even if they are close friends. And that, I should put myself first, a real friend would understand and accept that I have a problem and I am trying to get better, not keep me down.

After a long night of drinking (Started with wine after dinner. Moved to beer, then to whiskey.) I woke up in a dreadful state. I had developed this habit of drinking after working a second job as a bartender. I would go to my primary job from 8-5, then go pickup the kids from school/daycare, drop them off, get changed.. head off to the other job and be there by 6. I would work from anywhere from then until 10pm-1am. When I got off from that job, I'd go home and drink a half bottle of whiskey. I had gained about 10 lbs from eating at work because of lack of time to prepare a meal, and from all the drinking. I started that job as a ""hustle"" to steamroll our debt snowball my wife and I had talked about so much. We had talked it all over. On paper, everything was fine. IRL, everything sucked. The kids never saw me. My wife never saw me. I never had time for them or for myself. This went on from September to late November. One night, I came home from my second job. She was in tears. My oldest was struggling with every subject in school. My middle kid would stay up all night waiting for me to get home. My youngest cried for daddy until he fell asleep. The kids were too much for her to handle by herself.  

  
The worst part about all of it outside of the stress it put on ALL of my relationships... 

I started that job to make more money and to help us out financially. All it did was provide enough for me to get bombed every night by myself when I finally had some time to decompress.

Now, a year later... Life isn't perfect. My oldest struggles with math. My middle kid struggles with listening. My youngest is still a daddy's boy. But, from when I started this journey until now, I have lost all the weight I had gained. Almost all the debt has been paid off (with exception of house and student loans). My wife wanted to drink with some friends of ours that we went out to eat with. I told her to have all she wanted, I'll drive home.

Thank you all for reading. I hope your journey is going well for you, even if it isn't perfect. You all are awesome. Reading this subreddit helps me to see how far I have come, and how far I still have to go.

My experience facing social pressure,"First of all i wanted to say that I have massive respect for everyone trying to cut down/stop their alcohol usage. After reading some stories I wanted to share my experience.

Story:

New Years Eve I had my last drink. At first the idea was to complete Dry January and then go back to the old habit. This was drinking almost every friday and saturday evening. Fridays about 3/4 beers and saturday around 7-8 beers. And sometimes some liquor mixed with 7UP. 

Around January 25th or something my friends and I were walking the dog as we do every evening. I and friend Y said we could stop drinking for another 2-3 months easily. We just drink water instead. Friend O said we couldn't do it and here we are. Friend O started drinking again after January.  On March 28th it's my birthday, I'll be 19 years old then. On that date friend Y and me promised we were gonna have our first drink again.

Dry January was pretty easy for us. Why? Because we didn't do anything for the whole month. Everyone sat home playing some games and/or watching movies/series. 

When drinking we always sit in our garage. So in February we sat in our garage with some friends. Friend Y and I drank water. And damn social pressure is real. Every weekend hear from friends or colleagues at the supermarket how fucking stupid I am for not drinking, how boring I am. Everytime I see colleagues at work they jokingly ask me if I had a drink yet. No. Somewhere in February we did a drinking game. I was joking around that I would drink friend O. Damn was I hydrated. 

After March 28th I'll start drinking again, but less. Not that I'm drunk often or drink that much, but the idea that drinking less is good for my health and that it feels mature because I'm in control of myself feels good. And I really like going against the normal.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9925885200500488}"

I binge to the point where I'm physically ill enough that I can't stand the thought of a drink, I stop until I forget what it did to me and remember what it feels like beforehand, and then we get varying results from moderation to a full blown spiral back down the hill. I think I have a tendency to leap off the wagon willingly rather than fall off.

But it's always that same dangerous thought, that just this one time I can control it. And sometimes I can. But then there's the next, and the next, and then it gets closer together, and then it's making my meds stop working again, and then it's daily and all the time and starting to tear my gut lining to shreds again and 

Bam. 

Another relapse. Another night where someone else cleans up my vomit because I'm rambling too incoherently to even process I've been sick. Another day after when I can't keep anything down and a partner who cares for this mess way more than I'll ever deserve has to remind me which way is up because my neurons are fried and all I can see is the way down, to the gutter, where the alcohol is trying to take me. 

I'm done. I thought I could control myself and make the choice not to let it take me there, but no, addiction reigns again.

Checkin in.

The UFC event this weekend was pretty hype. I happened to be invited to a party where I knew no one, and walking in, there was copious amounts of alcohol around. I haven't feel the level of pressure (internal not external) to drink since I quit a few weeks ago.

I was invited to grab anything I wanted from the kitchen, and I walked in and the cases of beer were stacked high, liquor choices up the wazoo. Even with 10 people there we would've been hard pressed to finish. 

I opened the fridge and to my delight was a brand new bottle of cactus cooler, one of my personal favorites. I iced up, and that was my drink of choice.

I was asked if I don't drink, to which I kindly replied that I had decided to stop drinking. No weird looks, just a short question of why, which I answered honestly. I'm an alcoholic and I'm trying to get my life together. Everyone left it at that, and I met a lot of cool people and had great conversation.

The only lowlight was that maincard, what was that all about?

But I woke up and thought that I didn't deserve to live anymore. After losing my best friend to suicide several years ago (one of the major factors that took my drinking from social to a major problem) I knew that that voice wasn't coming from me and I never wanted to hear it again. I had a long talk and a lot of tears with my husband. He was supportive and said he would quit too, which proved easy for him but hard for me. And slowly but surely I put together a week. Then two. I remember trying to hide my tears at work while I texted with my husband that I wasn't going to be able to make it through without a way to take the edge off my life. My anxiety and depression raged and I struggled but I crawled my way through. About 6 months after I quit it felt like a fog lifted. I felt better and stronger than I had in years. I had worked my way back into school full time and managed to train for my first marathon. I went concerts and clubs and had felt great not drinking. I learned the difference between my anxiety and normal stress and normal stress for somone who works full-time and goes to school full time and trains for a marathon all at once. My relationships with just about everyone improved. Things were really really good and I felt so strong in my decision to quit.

About the time of hitting my one year things began to unravel and haven't really stop. It started when I woke up one morning to find my cat had thrown a blood clot over night and was paralyzed. 4 days of back 2 hours each way to the U Penn Vet hospital and a lot of money later the clot had broken up and she was improved. We were cautiously optimistic that the worst was behind us. I scheduled my appointment to get my first tattoo (a gift for myself for making it to a year). Midway through getting it done I passed out and started seizing, a pretty terrifying experience for all involved (although they were able to finish it and I still love it). 2 days later I wake up because I heard one of my cats screaming only to find out the water heater in the apartment upstairs burst flooding my entire apartment. Luckily our belongings weren't damaged but everything structural flloor to ceiling had to be replaced. Somewhere in the middle of that 3 month process my great uncle whom I was close to passed away. Because of school and work I remember leaving his funeral and feeling guilty because instead of staying to mourn with my family I had to write a 12 page paper that was due a day later. I had about 3 week break before my husband who occasionally suffers from so bad mental health episodes had a flair up that left us both physically, mentally, and emotionally depleted. We got through that and by the grace of who knows what I made it through my finals. I switched gears to only taking one class for the summer but working 4, 14 days a week between my regular job and the research position I needed for grad school, plus balancing dog sitting gigs to bring in extra money. About mid June I burned out hard. We had a trip to Florida for a week to look at graduation schools and I cried the majority of the time. My anxiety was the highest it had been since those first few weeks if sobriety. We got home and my mental health got worse before it got better, finally starting to improve mid July with the end of my summer class and me quitting my dog sitting business. But school started right up in early August. I was working full time, taking 18 credits, continuing my research position, applying to graduate school and getting ready for my GREs. I averaged a 60 hour week before eating, sleeping, or homework. I continued to mentally spiral down feeling like everything was going to collapse. I was ablr to scrape enough of myself together to try to make it through, looking forward to a 4 day trip to Florida to firm up some things for grad school but also take a well earned break, in mid November. The Wednesday before we left my best friend called me to tell me she had tried to take her own life earlier that day. I froze and sat curled up in a ball on my sofa for 3 hours until my husband returned home from the funeral of a family friend to find me sobbing uncontrollably. I knew there was no alcohol on the couch so I couldn't drink if I stayed on the couch so that's what I did. I laid in bed sobbing all day on Thursday and made it to school on Friday only to take a very important exam which I cried through most of and didn't do great on. We left on our trip that night, with the hopes of warm sunshine doing good things for me. I'm a warm weather person stuck in a cold weather place and sunshine and hot weather always helps my mental health. I was able to do very little but cry and sleep the entirety of our trip. We ended up spending most of it at the Airbnb because it was 45 degrees and raining the entire time in a place that averages 75 in November. The day we left the sun came out and we found a park where I found a manatee and felt a little but better before we left. But stepping away from your life for 4 days during the semester at the start of the holiday season (I work in retail) created an avalanche of responsibilities for us when we got home. I managed to get through it all and get to the end of my semester. I had a week off from school after finals and before Christmas where we even managed to get most of our Christmas shopping done earlier than the day before. I was actually given Christmas Eve off and decided to sleep late and then meet my father to go fishing. Instead I was woken by my husband and mother calling me to tell me my grandmother was being rushed to the hospital. We spent the better part of 48 with her at the hospital missing all of our Christmas plans. She started to improve and I started my winter session classes two days after New year's. After a lot of discussion with my husband we decided it was best if I didn't work since my class was every day on a campus that was a 2 hour commute each way. Without work and only having school to focus on I started to find my footing in the world again. It was intense but in a normal college is intense way. About 2 weeks in I was starting to get my footing when we had another emergency with the same cat, only this time it's an aggressive form of cancer. We got started with an oncologist and I take her for chemo every week near where I go to school. She has good days and bad days but had an exceptionally bad weekend at the beginning of February. My husband was away and I thought she was going to die while he was gone. The vet tweaked some of her meds and she had been much improved but even with the chemo she is not expected to make it to the end of the year. In the middle of that really bad weekend my washing machine flooded my laundry room and I had to handle that crisis alone.I spent the better part of that weekend on the couch because again there is no booze there and it felt safe(We don't have booze in the house period but if I'm sitting on the couch in but getting up to go but some). I was just starting to get my footing again when my grandmother who had been improving passes away 2 weeks ago. We were incredibly close and I miss her so much. Since she passed my car has stopped working and 3 different places have told us 3 different things yet noone can seem to fix it. My laptop died which means getting behind on schoolwork for my programming class until the new one comes next week. The ceiling work that was done last year was starting to crack so they spent the better part of last week tearing apart and redoing the work they did at this time last year. 

I feel like everything is constantly falling apart and I can't even get to the surface let alone try to get my head above water. My getting sober happened about 6 months after the passing of my mother in law in her early 60's from cancer. Everything about the 3 years leading to her death was traumatic for both my husband and I. I have stayed sober through everything the past two years but as things continue to get worse and worse every day it's harder to figure out why. My head says if everything is going to be terrible all the time why stay sober? I've gained about 75 pounds in the last year which has been dragging my confidence down even more. I have some really good things in the horizon but for every good thing there seems to be a problem or a crisis to go with it. I was selected as a ""woman of promise"" at my university, something a female mentor nominates female students for. It's a big school and about 100 students are chosen each year so it felt great, but now they taking about cancelling the whole event due to Coronavirus. My graduation ceremony is in jeopardy of being cancelled as well. I started my degree in 2004 and after failing and drinking my way out of school the first time around I'm finally going to graduate this year and I may not even get to celebrate it. 

I'm constantly on the lookout for the next crisis which is exhausting me. We're supposed to start looking for a house because we are supposed to move in August. Now I'm afraid to move away from my family and friends that have been so instrumental in keeping me going this past year. If things just keep getting worse all the time how will I get through it all with less help? Things are constantly falling apart for us should we really be buying a house? I haven't felt this level of anxiety since I first decided to stop drinking. I've gotten this far with the amazing support of my husband who is absolutely wonderful but even he is getting dragged under at this point. I feel like I'm fighting harder than ever to stay sober and am just desperate for a little breathing room.

Thanks for anyone who took the time to read all this. It really helps to just get it out there into the world. I know there are people who have things way worse than I do, just the constant emergencies day in and day out have worn me so thin. Someone cuts me off in traffic and I start crying. Going to the grocery store to get something for dinner I get overwhelmed  trying to balance finding something adorable but easy but good for me that I have an anxiety attack and leave with nothing. Everything feels like too much and has for so long that everyday is a struggle. I feel like I'm afraid to relax because if I do that's when the next crisis will appear.  Im afraid of relapse because all I want more than anything else is a break even if it's only for a few hours. I know all of this would be way worse if I was still drinking. I just need some sort of hope that I will be able to breathe again soon.

With the recent movies about Mr Rogers, I figured I'd go checkout some episodes of his show as it's been 25 years since I saw it last.

The moment he began to sing the intro song brought tears to my eyes. I was reminded of how life used to be when I was still innocent. Hearing the theme music made me feel like a kid again. A rush of memories populated my mind. I remember the little kiddie yellow table where I'd eat breakfast, the old rottweiler I would nap on when I was seven or eight years old, and the sound of bacon being cooked by my late granddad as he sang to himself.

I'm 32 years old watching a show for children, but hearing him say he likes me just the way I am saved my life. He reminded me that somewhere deep inside me lies a good person.

I grabbed some celery sticks and a bubly sat down and for the first time in years played video games for 3 hours. I grabbed Witcher 3 and started over a new game.

But, she wanted to do a full blood-panel ""to make sure nothing else is going on.""  Well, guess what?  I have the lowest level of Vitamin D she's ever seen (6.8 ng/Ml).  

I quit in November, I work in an office and this time of year I don't see the sun except through my office window.  I'd heard people suggest D supplements after quitting, but chalked it up to BS pseudo and part of the supplement marking crap.  She put me on a high dose prescription of Vitamin D for a couple months, and I'm hopeful this will help me feel like sobriety feels as good as some folks say.

2020-03-08 19:54:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fflmkg/remembering_whats_important/,Remembering what's important.,"Hi guys.

I'm coming up on 6 and a half years sober.  Wow!  Sometimes I can't even believe it myself.  I started young and hard... first drink at 18, and by 22 was getting DUIs, breaking limbs, and all other kinds of nasty stuff.  I'm so glad that I got sober in time to experience all the ups and downs of being a young man: figuring out who I am, what I want out of life, etc.  There's no way I could have done any of that while drinking.  I mean, I lived that phase, too.  But I'm glad I didn't get stuck there.  And I'm glad I didn't do anything irreversible.

The last few years have not necessarily been easy, but it's also not been totally unbearable.  To use language from AA, it's been ""manageable"".  Before life was not manageable.  It was always waiting for the next disaster, and nothing ever seemed to change.  Since getting sober, it's been difficult, but it's never been an uphill battle... it's always felt like life was on my side somehow.  And there's been moments of pure magic that have kept me going.  Sometimes it comes in major explosions, which usually is a sign that I've lost touch with it.  But it's always there, on some level... a deep restfulness, in spite of all the waves on the surface.

Well, I suppose you could say I've been going through a rough phase these last few months.  Nothing particular in my external life... all of that has remained the same.  But spiritually I've been feeling a bit lost.  I feel like I lost touch with that magic, and was desperately trying to find the way back to it.  

Finally, the other night, I somehow surrendered to the adversity.  I realized: this stuff is not easy.  And there's no ""magic bullet"" solution.  Doubts don't get cleared up overnight, and sometimes the best answer is being OK with having no answers at all.  

But that doesn't mean it's easy, or fun, or comfortable.  Sometimes, it isn't.

So, somehow, after months of fighting, I felt like I gave in.  It was not as profound as my first surrender when I first got sober, but it felt like a subtle reminder of that experience.  It was quite cool.   
And since then I've been feeling lighter.  I'm sure waves of doubt will come back.  But I don't know.  One day at a time, I feel more at rest, more trusting, more peaceful.

So once again I'm remembering what's important.  I may not have all the answers, and I may not be happy or comfortable all the time, but hey... I'm learning.  I'm growing.  I'm figuring things out little by little.  

And most of all, I'm still sober.

Going to reset my counter as I went off and started drinking tonight. See, I flew over 6 hours to meet up with someone I met in another country (foreign for both of us), and I’ve had nothing but bad relationships and stoped dating like 2 years ago but he seemed different.l Decided the trek would be good, even if it didn’t end together, as long as it didn’t end because of lies by him (cheating, doing cocaine) I thought I’d be happy... 

My last night here he abandoned me. 5 hours calling and calling trying to hear even a “go away, we’re over”. Nothing.. I can’t even get breakups right.

Anyways I’m sorry but I can’t handle reality, I can’t handle the pain. I’m just numbing myself. I have complex PTSD from childhood abuse and was raped by my ex boyfriend, while he was my ex. And those are just the worst things besides the cheating I’ve been through, last boyfriend hid a coke addiction while telling me that I was overly needy...

I don’t know what to do. I need help please. How do you deal with pain like this and stay sober? It just doesn’t seem worth it.. although back at work later this week so I’m hoping that’ll motivate me but my boss also is sexist and makes me feel like shit (trying to leave that as well but need the money): )

Idk, I just wish something was easy. No real friends, they’re all in their relationships, while I’m not good at getting I to romantic relationships myself (no one values friends in my city anymore) and the one thing I have, my smarts, get weighed down by sexist bosses. I feel like I was looking forward to Europe and some excitement while sober for 5 weeks and well, what a shit show :(

I rly need some kind words and maybe just some views from people who even semi understand. I feel rly alone. I’m trying to be careful with the drinks, sipping on beers but omg I can’t put it down because then I’ll feel and feeling is awful.

Cycled to another barbershop, also full of kids, so went home eventually, did my haircut home by myself, but in the middle of it the blade fell out when I dropped the trimmer, also my necronomicon keychain fell off. 
Aaaaaaaaaaaand for the grand finale, the date never showed up. It was a no show due to their hungover forgetfulness. So a sign maybe, but definitely a reason to say, no thank you.

Last day of double digit days. Perhaps it was a test, perhaps that's why today was as difficult as it was. Perhaps the gods of the old and the gods of the new wanted to play games with me today.

1. Litany against fear,  a litany I've taken to heart these past few days that has helped me through this difficult day which wanted to go wrong in every single way, and also thanks to my partial doing.
2. The strength to stay cool, calm and collected. 99 days are but a sliver of things yet to come and I shall enjoy the journey ahead in sobriety. 
3. AA and stopdrinking, I am grateful for having this great fellowship and the great community here in my life. With both of them these 99 days have been much easier than doing it on my own.

2020-03-08 17:50:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ffjtxg/im_not_a_real_alcoholic/,"""I'm not a REAL alcoholic""","For the past 6 years I would always be in denial that I had a problem. ""I'm not a REAL alcoholic, I don't even drink most days!"" I considered myself as ""just a binge drinker"" as I was sober most week days. I'm amazed by my denial over the past few years, I knew it was causing me major problems but I would kid myself that ""this weekend will be different"" on a weekly basis.

I would go out every Thursday or Friday aiming to have just a few, then would often end up chugging shots of whiskey, vodka, glasses of wine and pints of beer for the next few days straight. I would sometimes end up doing cocaine and other drugs just so I could drink for longer. I saw stimulants as a performance enhancing drug for my drinking.

I would consider it a good evening when I got back home before 1 in the morning. I often got back home at 4 or 5 in the morning. Sometimes I didn't get back home at all, I stayed awake all night partying, walking back across town when the sun had came up looking like a zombie and feeling almost psychotic and terrified of the crash that was creeping in.

I would often wake up after a night out terrified and shaking in pain. I would sneak a few beers out of the fridge when no one was looking just to ease my hangover, and drink them alone in my room. But I wasn't a ""REAL alcoholic"" I'm just having a hair of the dog or 3, that's a totally normal thing to do within an hour of waking, right?

I would stash empty beer cans and those small bottles of vodka at the back of drawers. Every once in a while I would load up a backpack of the empties to drop in a nearby recycling bin so no one I knew found them. ""Shit I can't remember there being this many! Guess it must have just got out of hand this time! It's ok though I'm not a REAL alcoholic it won't happen again!"" 

I was sat next to my dad on a train one Saturday morning. He pointed out I reeked of alcohol, I claimed it was from the night before. It was! It was also from the vodka I had chugged that morning so I could motivate myself to come along on a family day out without shaking so much it was obvious. Apparently brushing my teeth and chewing gum didn't work as well as I thought it did.

I would occasionally wake up with my head glued to the pillow with blood with no memories of how I got home the night before. I once got knocked unconscious in a fight my front teeth cracked with a bad concussion. I was threatened with a knife on a night out, because I had refused to pay a drug dealer I met on the street who tried to sell me fake drugs. I would sometimes wake up 40+ miles from home having missed my stop after passing out on the train the morning after a night out.

I embarrassed myself, could be loud and belligerent, burst into tears in front of strangers at parties. I threw up bile trying to keep vodka down whilst curled up on the bathroom floor at 3 in the afternoon. I had paranoid delusions, and lived in constant anxiety and depression. I'd fly into rage when questioned about my drinking by relatives and hide in my room for days after a binge. I blew thousands and thousands of pounds in savings, some on drugs, but mainly just on alcohol.

But it was ok, I wasnt a ""REAL alcoholic"", I managed to sober up and get to work on Monday, even if I was a shaking, sweating paranoid mess. Ok some of the time I missed the Monday, maybe the Tuesday off work. Thats until I had a mental breakdown and walked out of my job, but that was due to stress and anxiety, nothing to do with my drinking!

I'm not kidding my self anymore. I can't drink. And for the first time I've now accepted this. Strangely now that I've accepted it and made a clear decision not to ever have that first drink it's so much easier! I still get cravings, but is a few hours of feeling good worth the risk? Fuck no. 

I've now been sober for more than two months and for the first time in years I feel good about myself and optimistic about my future! The high I get from being sober may not be as intense as the one from alcohol, but it's constant and lasting, and isn't followed by suicidal lows and self hatred. Its surreal looking back, what was I thinking these past years?

Yep, Coming up to a year in about 10 days.  It's been quite a ride since quitting in terms of major life changes. Moved across country to stay away from temptation (was living in NYC so I could choose between 20+ bars in a 10 minute walk) . Things by and large have mostly been good. Started therapy, started taking meds which I badly needed, and I'm getting my financial house in order, getting ready to start a biz, and generally feel serene, if not a tad complacent. I am lightyears away from where I was when I first quit: suicidal, hated the world, hated myself, and was not functional.  The first 4 months sober for me were a hell on earth. Like I said, meds have been essential for me on this journey.

I've been very inactive lately, hardly even lurking here even though it was such a major help for me early on when I was craving non-stop, and had to do anything to resist temptation, which would sometimes take an hour or more of deliberation in my head.  Yet lately I've been really aching for the good times that I used to have. Towards the end, they were no longer there, but there was quite a long period where beer was the main connector of my social life.  

I just miss the wildness, and that feeling that ""everything is right"" that I used to get while drinking.  I would never blackout and honestly have a pretty good recollection of my nights out. Now I still have NO SOCIAL LIFE one year later, part of this no doubt due to moving.  I also have no interest in putting in the effort to meet people since I am possibly gonna move in 5-6 months.

IDK, this is kind of a meandering post, but my life is fucking boring. I get it... do things that aren't boring.  I started skating again, I went to a VR thing with my parents last night, I learned to weld, learned some software that I've been wanting to learn for forever, but... my life just feels like a subdued and FUCKING BORING version of its previous incarnation.  Do I want to be suicidal again? Do I want to have panic attacks when going out and trying to buy a box of cereal? No, of course I don't.  But I wish that I had a wider breadth of emotional experience.  Everything is blunted (very well could be my anti-d's).  I do feel I take my sobriety for granted often . 

Also, I'm still not solidly in the camp of alcoholism is forever, and I wonder sometimes if it was just because I worked in a bar that things got so fucking bad.  

I'll stop rambling and leave this here.  I have to go to work so will be slow to respond, but I'm not too worried about stopping for drinks or anything like that. I'm not craving, and I know it's a bad idea to drink again right now, but man I miss the good times so much over this dull, safe, stepford wives type existence I'm leading.",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9932683110237122}"

Friday night was rough. I found myself turning down the street of my favorite liquor store with the thought that I would treat myself to a bottle of whiskey. Thankfully for me I was able to think ahead to the weekend and what that would look like if I drank that night. Instead I am having a great weekend, getting things done around the house, working out and spending time with family! None of which I would be doing had I started drinking again. 

I have been thinking a lot about what motivates my cravings for alcohol. I can name so many positives of staying sober. The only thing I get from alcohol is scratching the itch of my craving. It’s insane to me that I would ever drink again but I can’t deny it isn’t a struggle every day. I am motivated though, to keep my eye on the goal of sobriety. I have been mostly using this sub to help me keep that in perspective. I have been thinking also about trying AA but honestly it is kind of intimidating and I feel very uncomfortable walking into a meeting not knowing anyone or how it works. I think I might try and read the AA book this week and start after that. We’ll see. I’ll keep you posted. Thank you for all the helpful posts. I wouldn’t be here without you all.

2020-03-08 16:12:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ffias5/just_celebrated_6_months/,Just celebrated 6 months!,"Back in August of last year, my drinking was out of control. My wife had kicked me out of the house, and I was living alone in a rented apartment. My drinking was steadily getting worse. Five or six days a week, I was drinking 8-10 beers a night. 

After a month, my wife agreed to let me move back into our apartment, and although there were no major conflicts, the drinking continued. In fact, it got worse. But as long as it didn’t create “problems” in the household, we both tried to ignore the issue.  My therapist was convinced that I needed inpatient treatment to curb my alcoholism, but again I ignored any and all warning signs.

Until one night when I drank more than usual... maybe 15-18 beers. I’m not sure. But that night, I got angry, which wasn’t really normal. And somewhere in there, I got violent. I didn’t hit my wife, thank god. I didn’t cross that line. But I grabbed her with force. I scared her. And I got loud, and even more aggressive, and although never physically hurting my partner, I crossed a line that I had never before. She woke up my son, in the middle of the night, and left, going to her moms house. She stayed there for several weeks, until I had to leave the country for 2 months on a work trip.

I spent the next few days drinking as much as I possibly could. Looking back on it, I think I was trying to forget that moment, and ignore the truth of what I had done. I think I wanted to die, and I may have been trying to accomplish that in the moment. And then, all of a sudden, I’m a tiny glimpse of clarity, I thought about my son: three years old. If I didn’t make a change, I wasn’t going to make it to the same age as when my father, at the age of 44, wrote a suicide note and drowned himself in a local lake after a night of heavy drinking. I was twelve years old.

My son wasn’t going to grow up like me: without a dad. I had to do something, and I had to break that cycle. I had been using alcohol as “crutch” - so I thought - but a more accurate comparison would be a “hurdle.”  It wasn’t help me move forward, it was creating a bigger obstacle for me to overcome. I clearly had no control over my drinking. And that had to change.

That was six months ago on March 6th.  Over the last 180 days, I have been working a lot more! Last year was a very bad year for me work-wise, and on top of the financial burden that can create, it became clear as well how much of a great distraction work provides, distraction from the troubles and worries that surrounded my life.  A steady work schedule over the last six months has not only provided me with more financial security, it has given me a positive outlet for creativity, problem-solving, and over-all more physical and mental activity!

I also find myself with SO MUCH MORE free time! Not only am I sleeping better, but when I need, I can work late or long hours without really feeling tired or drained. And my mental activity seems to be steadily increasing and expanding.  Instead of making excuses about why I couldn’t do something (not enough time, lack of knowledge, etc...), I was finding myself completing tasks and reading more than I had in years. Suddenly there were no more excuses, and instead of lists of things I wish I could do, it became lists of things I was already doing (or had already DONE!), and then came the need for more. More things, more lists, because now, I was DOING IT!  These lists were growing, and diminishing, because I was crossing things off and adding more!! And what I didn’t accomplish... it wasn’t defeat! I just feel like it moved further down the list because something more important is now at the top! But I’ll still get there... 

It hasn’t been easy all the time. I work in an industry where substance abuse can run rampant, and I am constantly in situations that could easily be very difficult for someone with alcoholism.  I try not to stress about it. That’s another thing that this whole experience has taught me: appreciation for important things in life, and the ability to try to let things less important have little or no impact on my mental well-being.  Almost losing my family has taught me what is really valuable, what’s worth fighting for, and what needs to be let go.  I’m still working on it, but every day feels like improvement. And that’s great!

And speaking of what’s really valuable, I have learned to love my wife in a completely new way. She has really showed me true love, compassion, and acceptance, all really important values in the foundation of any relationship.  Had she not extended this patience and understanding to me, I wouldn’t still have my family, all together. There’s no one in the world I could possibly love more than her, and it still isn’t enough. I’ll be happy to stand beside someone who stands as tall as she does. She is the embodiment of true love, and I am the luckiest man in the world to have found a love that deep anywhere on earth.

It has been so enriching, a truly spiritual experience, at least until last night, when I went to a big party by myself and got drunk and acted stupid, without going into the details. I'm staying in a nice lady's AirBNB and I probably offended her by coming in at 4 am and making noise and a godawful mess. There's a risk that my great memories of this festival will be buried under the memory of last night. And that is just sad.

This is not unusual for me. Many of my trips have ended this way. I have known I have a problem with drinking and drugs for a long time, more than a decade. I have done so many stupid and hurtful things while drunk. I could write an encyclopedia of my embarrassing drunken moments. Taken altogether they are shocking, and clearly indicate a problem, but because they were spaced out over many years, and because I have usually been in an environment where heavy drinking was acceptable if not admired, I and others have usually been able to overlook them. The tricky thing is that I usually have a good time when I drink. It really does help me bond with my wife and family and friends. I am self-conscious and socially awkward, always have been and always will be, and it helps me loosen up and enjoy myself around other people. But it is like Russian roulette -- one out of every five times, something really bad happens.

I have tried to quit many times, and have sometimes succeeded at doing so for long stretches. But I always find a way to justify doing it again. My wife pulls out a bottle of wine, and I join her because it is fun to drink with her, it promises intimacy. Or I am out with friends, and they drink, so I do too because that way we are on the same funny wavelength. Or I am on a vacation, and how could I not drink wine with this exquisite meal?

What I need to do is to remember the bad things drinking has made me do, and look at them for what they really are, not just brush them off as drunken hijinks, and remember, always, that I am capable of doing more such awful things if I continue to drink. I owe it to myself, and to humanity, not to drink.

The problem is my boyfriend. He is a drug addict and cannot seem to grasp the idea of sobriety as a means to a happier life and less rocky relationship. It seems like every time I’m not home for prolonged periods of time at work, he is unable to curb his urge to use and inevitably it leads to an incredibly unhappy and uncomfortable situation, which blows because I just got off a twelve hour shift and now my own fucking home isn’t a welcoming and relaxing place to be. 

He keeps saying all the right things while sober that he knows sobriety feels better and wants to do this with me and stay with me, but his actions directly contradict whatever he says. He can’t even act contrite when high, and even though I know it’s useless to talk to him while he’s high I can’t seem to stop myself from hurling insults and generally being an awful human being. I’m hurt. I keep giving ultimatums that ultimately mean nothing and I’m feeling as if no words will get through to either of us and action needs to be taken.

Also, wow can some drunk people be obnoxious. I can not believe I was acting that way at shows. I tried not to be upset as some people were just being jolly and dancing a bit too crazy, but man.

I will go through days, sometimes weeks at a time without craving alcohol, then suddenly the cravings hit like a freight truck. Yesterday was tough. I’ve been frustrated with being stuck at home full time due to illness, bad weather and being a full time parent, so I planned a solo fishing day yesterday to ease the stress because the temps finally rose enough to melt the ice. Fishing has historically been a drunk activity for me, and especially being on my own all day I was basically counting on having a cheat day, since my family is my main motivation for not drinking. Well, the fishing was terrible (no bites in 7 hours) which just made me more frustrated. I still felt sick, and I was bitter about my one day off being spoiled. I went to Walmart fully intending on buying some beer along with some lures to salvage the day and at least have a good time. As chance would have it,  the lures I wanted were locked in a cabinet, so I had to purchase them at the back of the store instead of carry them off to the beer aisle before checking out normally. I walked out of the store feeling torn, as if I had been cheated out of a chance to drink. I sat in my car for a few minutes feeling like a confused asshole. I drove around the parking lot 4 times. Then I went back into the store and straight to the beer aisle. I stared longingly for a few minutes and walked up and down the aisle. I picked up a 6pack if my favorite brew. In that moment,  I already felt the guilt of relapsing, of having to explain to my wife why I drank again. In a moment of inexplicable good judgement, I set the beer down and just hightailed it out of the store. I still felt guilty for robbing myself of the chance to drink. I got in my car and told myself I’d stop at the next liquor store. I saw a liquor store, and told myself I’d stop at the next one instead. I did that 3 times, passing by liquor stores and telling myself I was going to stop each time. But I didn’t stop. I eventually made it back to the fishing spot and just emotionally broke down in my car. I tried to fish again, but my heart wasn’t in it. I ended up driving home early. On the way home, I guess the cravings passed and I was (am) horrified at how close I was to slipping. 

Man, alcohol is a manipulative thing. I felt terrible for not drinking, guilty for ever drinking, and helpless for almost drinking. Wtf.

I posted some weeks ago about my alcohol story. I'm 19 years old and alcohol (only bingedrinking, I was not addicted) nearly destroyed everything I had: My relationship to my girlfriend, friends and family, my studying at university and my body.
The good news is, that I gained everything back, I only have to study harder for university, but I will take care of that too, because I found some really hard working friends there and I study with them and they motivate me.
My last steps to stay away from alcohol were only to tell my friends, that I won't drink again. 
I'm from bavaria and if you go to a party or some family meeting, there are always drinks and you are kind of considered a loser, if you don't drink. I have to add that I am a person, who many times falls for the pressure in a group to do certain things, for example drink as much as you can on a Party to be considered cool.

Now I'm so glad to announce, that nearly every friend of mine and my family accepted my quitting and understood me. 
As I'm not addicted, there's nothing what can bring be back to alcohol. I gained much confidence during the last months, because I tried to become better in every aspect of life, so I can continue to say no to alcohol and ignore the people, who call me lame or something like that because I don't drink any more. I'm also much more disgusted by alcohol than attracted, so I can't imaginäre anything which could convince me to drink again.
So I can finally announce, that I got my life back together and I have never been so happy in my life!
I wish all of you the best luck and hope, that everyone wins the battle against that poison!
Right now I have everything I ever wanted and worked for and the binge drinking nearly made me a nobody having nothing.
But now I have my beautiful and amazing girlfriend back for some months and it's going better than ever and I also make better gains at the gym and will slowly get my university studying back together. 
I wish you all the best and hope, that I can somehow motivate anyone in a similar situation as I was in to quit it and really go for your life instead of a drink!

As I'm reading all the literature I'm realizing just how bad my drinking had become. I'm seeing it through clear, fresh eyes. I'm seeing the drunken lush I must have appeared to be to my husband. 

My question for the spouses and partners...genuinely curious how you see us? Perceive our drinking? The damage it's done to you, your relationship? When or How have you been able to trust your spouse again? If ever? 

I grew up as the child of an alcoholic mother. The drink was her priority. As it was mine over my husband. 

I know time will be proof. Is there any insight spouses/partners care to share? 

Thanks in advance.

But I consumed alcohol pretty much every evening. Two glasses of wine or maybe a couple of beers on weekdays, more on the weekends. Then I might drink too much at dinners or celebrations with friends - but never to the extreme, I never really passed out. 

No problem you think? Compared to a full blown alcoholic, maybe not. But compared to someone who does not crave or need alcohol at all, I did have an addiction problem. Because I could not simply not drink. It felt good and tasted good I thought back then. I didn’t want to give it up. That is already an addiction. And over time, I always needed a bit more to feel good, to get that pleasant buzz. One day referenced this sub in another sub Reddit, and I came here to this fabulous group and read „if you think you might have a problem with alcohol, you most likely have one.“ 

That hit home. 

I stopped drinking and soon realised that this is a big deal. It’s nothing less than kicking a huge very nasty and very sticky habit. Not only for me but also for my environment. If you decide to kick this legal drug out of your life, you will soon discover that many around you will feel offended by your actions. Crazy!!! Absolutely crazy. Only now, after more than 2 years (!) do my friends and family fully accept that I no longer drink. They never ask me anymore if I want alcohol and they have relaxed around me when they consume their own booze. 

On New Years Day this year I had two small glasses of champagne. It was nice. I enjoyed the taste. But it didn’t trigger me at all and I never had another craving afterwards. 

I actually do not think about alcohol anymore. I think about food and nice coffee a lot, though. Often, I drink one alcohol free beer at dinner because I really like the taste. 

One should never say never but I cannot think about any reason of why I should start drinking alcohol again. It is a poison and more importantly, a very nasty habit that is deeply rooted in our society. 

Without all of you guys her I would have not been able to kick this habit for good back then. I came here daily, sometimes every few hours. Your stories and your community carried me through all this. Thanks!!

I left this sub Reddit a while ago but thought my story might inspire others that also wonder whether their moderate drinking is a problem or not.

It sure as hell wasn't on mine until my diagnosis a week ago. But, fuck if it wasn't the reason I drank.","Complex PTSD can have many sources, but it is also the result of childhood emotional and verbal abuse. My childhood was something I always downplayed and I think that's the core issue: messages you get about yourself in childhood become so deeply ingrained. Yes, I am selfish. Yes, I am careless. Yes, I was responsible for your feelings. Yes, I am stupid. 

I just sort of knew my mom yelled at me a lot, was always disappointed in me, and I have weird quirks today that I can't explain. Arguing people scare me, loud noises scare me, phone calls make me panic, my stomach drops when I see my parents name or my maiden name anywhere in everyday life, why everyday tasks make me feel ashamed and are never completed...and no, I never ever felt safe as a child. And no, I can't think of a single happy childhood memory.

Everything in that house was evidence of something I should be ashamed of. It's the weirdest thing if you take a step back and think about it. But to this day, almost 40 years old, I feel embarrassed, ashamed, and scared to even drive past the neighborhood I grew up in. I wasn't hit very often, which is what I would consider actual abuse. Everything else was likely me making a big deal out of nothing. Something I *always* did because it was my way of emotionally manipulating my mom and deflecting. Which I now see was bullshit. I was never manipulative. 

And, it would seem, these memories and emotions were repressed (which takes up a lot of brainpower) and resulted in my being an anxious mess. My thoughts were never-ending and I was never at peace. My default setting was ashamed and my thoughts never stopped. It I thought about it enough - a problem, a relationship, a conflict - if I thought about it enough I could figure out a way to approach it and somehow influence the emotions of others and that would keep me safe. If I could think it through and identify what they were thinking and feeling, I could do something proactive to prevent them from ever being mad or disappointed in my in the first place. And I would be safe. 

So, I drank. When I drank, I could quiet those thoughts and focus on new things. And I was amazing when I drank. I was my absolute most productive. I did some pretty remarkable things while drunk. It gave me energy and a sense of pride. I'm not lazy and worthless after all. Whoops! Tanks empty. Time to crack another one. 

And I drank to sleep. To quiet those never-ending thoughts that had no answers. And it worked, until it didn't. 

I guess I wanted to toss this out there...please don't minimize your childhood. Even if you think your experiences were common...just because they were common does not mean they weren't abusive. They shape who we are and define our perceptions of our place in this world.

A couple of weeks ago, I was at my parents house watching my nieces and nephews who've been staying with them lately. While I was there, I began rooting through their pantry and fridge, looking for beer. I did this for a couple of minutes before I stopped myself, thinking ""Why are you looking for beer if you aren't going to drink it?"".  Thus began my two weeks of hell.  I reported a few weeks ago that the cravings had diminished in severity and that I woke up every morning more or less secure that I wouldn't break my sobriety that day. This is no longer the case. I'm dealing with cravings stronger than anything I've had since the first 10 days. Though I haven't picked up a drink, and in fact I \*have\* turned down opportunities to drink, every day I'm noticing myself getting closer and closer to having ""just a few"". Just a couple weeks ago it felt like making it to 6 months or more was a foregone conclusion, now making it to 70 days is feeling like a major challenge.

I can't tell you how much I wish I could just go out with some friends and have a couple beers.

I know what I really don't want is to go back to a life where I just work and spend the rest of the time drinking. Coming home and immediately having two beers before I even sit down. Spending 5-6 hours or more every other night drinking sometimes until 8-9am if I had the next day off (sometimes even if I didn't). There are days where I started drinking in the early afternoon and still did it well well into the morning.  Passed the point where it stopped feeling good and I'd be stumbling around with a headache burping foam up into my mouth,  tiptoeing around the house because I was ashamed and didn't want my wife to know I was still up drinking and smoking cigarettes at 6:30 am.

In the time since I stopped drinking, I haven't done as much as I had hoped. I still haven't made it back to the gym, and my diet is horrible. On the other hand, I did complete my FAFSA paperwork and began the process of getting enrolled in school for the first time in years. Something tells me if I started drinking again that's as far as I'd go with it.

One day at a time to try to make it thru this 1 life.,"For the first few weeks after my last drink, the night of March 3rd, 2019, I was scared and depressed that I was attempting to never have another drink. I scoffed at the one day at a time and thought it was bullshit. Finally decided upon a mantra of sorts: focus on the day, dream about the life. 

For me, the first few weeks weren't that hard. I was strong and determined, plus I could still feel the hangover or waking up not knowing how long I had blacked out waiting to find out from my wife if I was mean to her or if my kids thought I was acting funny. But after about a month, the negatives faded away and I started trying to plan a way to drink again. I truly don't think it was one thing that allowed me to put down the shovel, but a culmination of many things. To this day my subconscious will try to take me down the spiral: you had a tough day, the kids are at a slumber party, the wife will have had a glass of wine with dinner, I can pull this off, she'll never know. Those thoughts use to scare me. Now I half chuckle and the other half of me is blown away that those thoughts still occur. 

Thanks to all of you. All of you inspire me to be a better husband, father and person: from the just reset my badge to the 2000 day people. Your stories were and continue to help me focus on the day and dream of the life.

Wahoo!","Seriously thought I'd put out a reminder.  If I got wasted Saturday night (earlier this evening) I'm certain I'd wake up confused.  *Clock says noon, phone says 1pm?  Huh?*

So I'm losing an hour of sleep, and I've never liked that!  But, I'll be sober and not hungover, and I won't be double dipping into the well of fucked sleep!  (Hangover + time change)

I've been at this for about 9 or 10 months now.  The longest I've gone was 28 days or so.  I'm just about a week from a tie.  But I'm feeling a bit better about this.  I'm getting way more comfortable with the idea I'll be dry from now on.  I've had very few temptations.  I have a trigger every other week when my ex wife picks my kids up for her week.   It makes me sad.  Big grown ass man - and it makes me misty eyed every time, after the kids are gone that is.  But the last two times?  I was still BUMMED, but I didn't even consider numbing my sorrow away with a fifth of whiskey.  I just let myself feel dad.  It's natural, it's normal, and I CAN deal with a fee minutes of bring bummed.  

So... I've added a new step to my plan!   I have set a date to start my own personal ""Boot Camp"".  90 days of focus.  Of course zero booze.  Workout every single day but Saturday.  Eat my max calories or a bit less daily (don't worry, I stand zero chance of replacing booze with an addiction to weight loss!). Get to bed on time.  Get up on time.  And I must get 3 household chores  knocked out daily. I hope to lose one or two lbs/week.  

The irony is I know God damn well that what I'm calling a Boot Camp is just regular daily routine for many.  As I've accepted I let booze dictate my life, I'm also accepting I need to be my own drill sergeant, and kick myself in the ass, I need to focus, I need to **hold myself accountable!**.  

So I too can live a healthy, and happy life once again!  😀

I haven't had a drink since Halloween last year. I'm 45, and have been drinking like a fish since I was 14  in 1989. Reagan was still POTUS and I'm sure a lot of you younger Redditors weren't even alive the first time I got drunk. I loved double shots of Jameson, Malort, Old Style beer (switched to Stella Artois after moving to New England from Chicago just because they don't have Old Style here), and my favorite cocktail Beefeater gin and Mountain Dew.

One of my relatives who was a doctor in his mid 60s was recently sent to prison after crashing his car into someone's house and getting his 8th DUI. It's time for me to stop and be sober for the rest of my life. It's hard because alcohol was so much a part of my routine, my identity. I don't know if I should go to AA meetings or not. So far I haven't and I have a bad feeling that if I did I might be the asshole who tries to talk other people into hitting the bar right after the meeting just to be a prick after listening to everyone's sob stories.

Most years I’d start with breakfast beers, blackout by about 1, and forget the rest of the day. This year, I woke up sober feeling great. Went to the grocery store to get a couple things and went with my wife and 7month old daughter to meet up with her family. They’re all 100% Irish. We walked downtown and a couple of them already had beers cracked. I bought some non-alcoholic Coors edge just in case I felt like I couldn’t handle it. A lot of my wife’s cousins also have young kids and it was just amazing to see how some of them can have one.. maybe two and just cut it off. I could never do that. After the parade, everybody headed to the bar. My daughter was fussy, hungry and probably cold so I opted to walk back to the house and hang out. A couple hours later everybody made their way back from the bar for the traditional corned beef dinner, and continued drinking.  I hung out, sipped my Coors edge, and honestly it wasn’t that bad. I wasn’t nearly as anxious as I thought I’d be. Now I’m back at home, hanging out with my dog, my daughters fast asleep and my wife is still hanging out with her family. But the most important thing is that I’m sober! 

This is my first time posting, but I’ve been a lurker for the better part of two years. I’ve been an alcoholic for the better part of my 20’s. I’ve done inpatient rehab, AA meetings and all of that, but by far the best thing that has helped me has been this sub. I relapsed about 3 years ago pretty much as soon as I left inpatient.. but kept telling myself I could control it by not drinking during the week, only having 2, all the usual lies. I’m not sure exactly what clicked on January 4th this year, but this time feels much different. I’m really finding it so much easier just to not drink at all than to try and control my alcoholic brain.. 

So cheers to being a better father to my daughter, my dog, and a better husband to my wife.

The rundown so far, all probably conservative estimates: 

Dollars saved: $1,050.00
Pints of beer not consumed: 280
Ounces of beer (IPA)  not consumed: 4,480
     (That's 35 gallons) 
Calories avoided approximately: 84,000 (seriously)
Pounds lost: probably around 12 

I can't say it's been all sunshine and koala bears and I have almost given up many times. Some days I just go to bed at like 6 pm so it doesn't suck anymore. But I will say that once I layered in a controlled diet and got back on my gym routine the upgrades are more noticeable and the ""sacrifice"" is more valuable. It's starting to feel more like a real chance to rewrite huge portions of my habits, outlook, and well being overall, which is great. I'm starting to not fear the mirror, which means more than almost anything else. 

My goal is another 40 lbs lost, which is probably going to take around 6 months, so I'm on this train until at least then, but if I'm honest the upsides of this are so undeniable it's likely a permanent decision. As they say, this might just be the way. 

So. Keep your heads up out there. You most definitely can do this. All it takes to succeed in the abstinence game is to do nothing at all, as impossible as that may seem at times.

I was always a steady drinker, never a binger. Over the years my one or two daily beers after work became more like 5 or 6 strong IPAs with 2 or 3 double-shot mixed drinks. And my urges got stronger, and earlier in the day. I found myself starting deceptive behaviors to hide how much I drank, and refusing invitations to any social event that would interfere with my drinking time. 

There was no rock bottom, but my life was an endless lethargic hangover and I was angry about being stuck in a rut with my work and family. Every day was just something to be endured until I could crack that first beer and catch a buzz, the only real joy I experienced any more. I tried quitting a few times, once lasting a couple of months, but always gave in to the cravings. 

On September 7th 2019 I went to urgent care with a stubbed toe that I thought I'd broken. The doctor ran some tests and told me it was gout. Gout! I knew that pain was not something I wanted to live with forever and decided to use it as a catalyst for change. 

That day I gave up drinking and started a keto diet. A few weeks later I started a C25K program. Three months in, I found the energy and passion to find a new job with more excitement, risk and reward. I am now 25+ pounds lighter and went from borderline obese to the middle of my target BMI range. 

I won't lie, there were many times I got a case of the fuck-its and nearly dove right back into the bottle but with the help of this sub, Annie Grace, William Porter and a little meditation I am now at the point where the urges are little more than passing ideas that I can reject by playing the tape forward to gout, obesity, cravings and misery. 

For all the people out there who haven't yet hit a rock bottom but know that alcohol is negatively affecting their lives, there's no need to wait.

Because your normal routine is to start drinking at 5, until you pass out at 10?     And you start eating at about 9pm, to get yourself into the perfect passout state?

But if you have to meet people to eat at 6 or 7,  then you're in panic mode because you can't get to your passout state.  You'll have way too much food in your tummy at 8pm, so drinking after that just won't work the same way.

So you isolate yourself and try to avoid people, or any kinds of meetings for dinner.

The night started out normally, went to the bar with some guys after work and got pretty drunk. On the way home I decided to stop in at my local spot to grab a few more. Long story short I saw another regular and he and I split a bag of coke. Many more drinks and the whole bag later I stumble home, scrape the rest of the bag out, put it up my nose then smoke a little weed. It's about 4 am and Im absolutely twisted but for some reason I decide I need more coke. I started calling every number in my phone to no avail, so I take to the streets. I meet I guy and ask him for coke, he tells me he has no coke but he has crystal so I go to a park with him and smoke it. This guy didn't look like any tweaker I'd seen and he kept talking about his wife and kids. I'm gonna preface this part by saying I'm not gay in the slightest. Eventually he grabs my dick and starts working it and even goes down on me a bit. I was basically asleep but still propped up by the coke and meth to know what was going on, but for some reason I didn't stop him. After, he helped me up picked up my wallet and phone off the ground and gave them to me and even walked me to my street. 

Waking up today I felt the most powerful sense of fear and self loathing I've ever experienced. I've already scheduled a doctor's appointment to get checked just in case. I know I need to stop doing coke because it's what pushes me to the extremes but I know drinking is what pushes me to do coke and I don't think I'm able to stop drinking. It helps me forget all the shit like this I've done and the thought of facing those memories and my unbridled inner dialogue terrifies me.

So first of all, let me say I don't have the cleanest background about this very sensitive topic. My father was a raging alcoholic. His father was a raging alcoholic before that. And since my birth, I feel doomed or judged by my family everytime I'm having a drink : ""you're going to be just like your father, it's in your genes"".

I know it's not, I can change it. But still. I always had problems, I never knew when to stop drinking during college or parties. I drink, I'm happy, I want to keep that level of happiness, I keep drinking, until I'm wasted, and then I promise myself to stop for a whole month, but I don't. 

Anyways, since a few weeks, I'm in a very bad shape. I'm a buff guy, very much into working out, so I could have a great body, but I don't because I love beers too much so I look like shit (like muscular but with a dad bod lol) The woman I loved more than anything broke my heart (she said she didn't love me that much...), my job doesn't fulfill me anymore so the only thing I enjoy is drinking after work. About 6-8 beers or more. Number one rule. Never vodka or whisky or anything too strong. I only drink things I enjoy. And all day long I'm thinking ""tonight is gonna be great, I'll feel better, my pain will be supressed.""

It has been two weeks and I'm fuckin afraid to become the thing I always feared. What can I do to stop it ?

I need to stop telling myself, it’s ok now, you’ve broken the habit, you can drink sensibly again because that ain’t happening. I was never a serious alcoholic, but it did affect relationships and decision I made - I have regrets, I miss people, mainly one person who was or is lovely and adventurous and ambitious and I never told her these things, I was just grumpy and volatile.

I promised myself if the two were ever connected I would stop drinking. So here I am. I guess the idea of stopping forever is SUPER difficult for me since so much of the time I am very good at moderation but the other part of the time I am balls to the wall, buying multiple bags of cocaine and hitting up my toxic exs.

This was so true for me. Most activities would revolve around drinking, and if they didn’t I really resented them.

My friend died.,"Coming back to this subreddit is like walking into a house that I used to live in. It was under a different username (but my badge is accurate) but I pretty much lived here when there were less than 4000 members. I was a fucking drunken, desperate, suicidal mess when I skidded in here. 

I now give partial credit to this subreddit for saving my life. 

I turned 25 and it scared the bejesus outta me. I got sober 3 months after that and haven't had a drop since. Haven't had a desire to. 

My friend died yesterday. We weren't as close as we used to be. We worked at the same restaurant for nine years and I lived in the same house with him for five. He was a good guy. He drank a lot. We used to drink a lot together. I got sober. He didn't. I moved out of that house.

About 6 months ago, he had a stroke. He was a pack a day smoker, at least, and his drink was Rum & Cokes. (One time, when I was living at The House, and still drinking, the five of us bachelors did a Spring cleaning that lasted several days. Him and I were both bottle hoarders. That Spring, I brought out probably 100 beer bottles I had scattered around my bedroom. He brought out maybe a dozen big trashbags full of empty 2 liter bottles of Coke and big handles of Captain Morgan.) And but so he had a stroke six months ago and he didn't quit drinking or smoking. 

It had been several months since I last talked to him but from what I have gathered in the past few hours, is that he tried to quit about 3 nights ago, cold turkey, no taper. About 12 hours before he passed, he was throwing up blood and decided not to go to the hospital. None of the other roommates knew about this. 

And then he died. I haven't heard the official cause of death yet. But I can guess some contributing factors. 

He was 34.

This is the first death of a peer that I've experienced. Someone who is not related to me. And it's pretty jarring. I'm not sure how to feel. I guess it hasn't really hit me yet but maybe this post will help. Coming back here just felt like the right thing to do. 

But I will tell you one thing. I am so, so glad that I am sober. If you are on the fence, I would urge you to stick around here.

It's been such a non issue for me lately that I lost count on how long it had been quiet awhile ago. This was after about 10 years of fairly heavy drinking. Over the last few days I have been in a very reflective and introspective mood, and when I think about what has changed over the last two and a half months, I feel like I am not the same person anymore. 

And I don't mean that in a bad way. In fact a lot of things have improved. My relationships with friends and family are a lot stronger than they were. I have significantly changed my diet and have lost 40 pounds. My health is unsurprisingly a lot better. I have become far better with money too. I'm paying off credit cards and no longer buying crap off of Amazon that I don't need. That is all kind of to be expected. But what I didn't expect were things like my taste in music and movies and TV is completely different now. My interests and hobbies are different than when I was drinking. My political views and general philosophy on life has evolved a lot over these past few months. What I want out of my career and where I want to work and live is not the same at all from a few months ago. And I feel much more bold about making such changes instead of being too afraid or feeling like everything was kind of stagnant and hopeless.

Some of that I can probably attribute to no longer having severe depression and anxiety that I had from drinking. But really this has been very unexpected. When I quit I expected life to be about the same just without the constant hangovers and maybe anxiety. But that was only the beginning.

This time the answer was different. “I was born that way”. Every time someone else asked, the story changed. “Shop class accident”, “Kitchen accident”, “Dog bit it off”, “Pencil sharpener”.  You name it, he said it.

“I don’t want it to effect the baby”
“I finished! I tried it all, and completed the list. Like Pokémon!”
“I was getting too good at it”
“I forgot how...”
“I heard it was bad for me. You know this stuff is addictive?”

I’m finding it easier to think logically and with care in situations where I previously would have reacted intensely, emotionally, and without regard for how my comments would land on the other person involved. I’m better equipped right now to avoid impulsive behaviors, thoughts, and reactions. My emotional equilibrium feels more balanced. I don’t feel constantly on edge, where the bad behavior of another person can push me right over the edge. (This is especially helpful as I work in close contact with the general public every day and it’s quite difficult at times.) I’m really loving this feeling of being more calm and centered.

I used to drink a bottle of wine every night on the light days, sometimes that wine would be coupled with half a 750 of whisky and sometimes some beers. 

My goal was to get so drunk I couldn’t think anymore. Every. Single. Day. 

I just wanted to let everyone know how I made it through yesterday and what it took in case other day oner’s are not sure how to do it, I didn’t think I could. 

Typically getting ready for work involved rolling out of bed at the last minute, chugging straight from the whisky bottle 2-5 ounces, then throwing whatever dirty clothes on and dousing myself in perfume. 

Not yesterday.  Woke up early, had a hot shower, made lunch and chugged two Perrier’s. 

Then I bought a small journal and a new phone case, silly, but figured a new phone case would help me remember a new start. It did. 

I asked my partner to leave me an encouraging note at home, because Friday nights are always hard for me since he’s at work until late (bartender), so I sit by myself and drown my loneliness. I stopped being interested in going out because I would always get way too drunk and embarrass myself. So I’d sit alone. 

I checked this sub at least 20 times throughout the day, reading reading reading. 

After work I wrote a list of things I need to do this weekend (mostly chores). I delegated each day to complete certain tasks. I decided, if I finish everything I was supposed to do that day, I would be allowed to decide if I want to drink. 

First on my list was to go to the grocery store. The idea was to stay away from the liquor store (conveniently across the street from my house), until it closes. When I got to the grocery, I forgot it sold wine. I stopped dead in my tracks and immediately speed walked into another aisle (lol). It’s crazy the amount of “oh shit” I felt in that moment. 

When I got home my partner had gotten me two cases of Perrier with notes of encouragement spread across the apartment, my favourite being in the liquor cabinet saying “we won’t drink wine tonight” . 

I cleaned up my whole apartment, the most liberating of which was locating my hidden bottles in closets and drawers and throwing them away.

I ended up completing my chore list and more from other days. My house was clean. I couldn’t believe it was midnight and I was sober. I knew I could now decide if I wanted to drink. 

I didn’t want to. It was so hard. But I knew I would be so pissed this morning if I had. 

There was nobody around, nobody would know. But I would know. 

The hardest part was falling asleep. It was actually scary. Every noise I heard I would jump because I’m so used to being so plastered I don’t give a shit. But I did fall asleep. I didn’t stay asleep. But I made it to the morning. Sober. 

I don’t feel hungover but I do feel kind of sick. Maybe it’s from the stress of yesterday. Maybe it’s withdrawal. But I wanted to make this post to show accountability. And let people know how I coped. And I am so proud of myself. 

Since I was productive yesterday, I will refuse my morning whisky because I know I won’t finish my list of things to do today. One of which is making my partner breakfast. 

I think for me what it comes down to is accountability and one step at a time. I will not drink this morning. I will do my projects. I am trying to take my life back. One step at a time.

Since then I have had many slip ups, but I think that made me start to get my shit together.

AA does not have any monopoly on sobriety. My uncle has 31 years sober and he's never gone to AA. His last drunk ended with a police chase and him getting pinned to the ground with 6 police pointing guns in his face.

I hope that you can get sober without such drastic consequences. My lover of 19 years wanting a break is the drastic consequence it took for me. Some people lose their jobs, others lose their freedom. I hope all it takes for you is getting sick and tired of being sick and tired.

I have a peace and hope that I've never known, and my worst days sober are better than my best days drunk and high.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

This pledge is a statement of intent.

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

What this is:

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

What this isn’t:

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hi y""all,

Today is my last day hosting the DCI so I thought I'd give you a quick update on my week. If you haven't been checking in all this week or reading my ramblings at the top of the DCI it won't make much sense today!

I've not discovered any more bags of hidden empties anywhere either in my house or the garage so I have not had to do another bottle bank trip of shame. Also following its quadrennial vacuuming the car is filling up nicely again with rubbish. 

My daughter has moved on to reading ""The Very Hungry Caterpillar"" so I am no longer empathising the FORO Sophies Dad must have felt when he found out a Tiger had drunk all his beer. The new book, however, is setting off some unusual cravings for food. On just one Saturday the Caterpillar eats one piece of chocolate cake, one ice-cream cone, one pickle, one slice of Swiss cheese, one slice of salami, one lollipop, one piece of cherry pie, one sausage, one cupcake, and one slice of watermelon. Wow!

I've now done three runs in my new running shoes, trainers, sneakers, plimsolls, fresh creps, kicks, daps, treads, runners, sandshoes, joggers, gutties, sneaks, tackies, canvers, sannies, tenni-runners, and now, just for the other runners in this group, my Saucony’s. I am loving them!

I've forgiven He-Man for not including the word alcohol in his rule about drugs.

I have decided to let my family and friends know that I am no longer drinking. This may help with the overload of wine, beer and gin come Christmas time and birthdays.

When I finally get down to my goal weight for the eighth time I have decided to burn my 'fat clothes'. Just putting them in the loft was obviously not enough of a deterrent to stop me gaining all the weight back.

Can anyone who would like to host the DCI please let u/SaintHomer know to get the down-low or is it the lowdown? Basically find out what to do.

Have a fab weekend folks and IWNDWYT.

One final word from He-Man:

**”We all fail sometimes, but we should never be afraid to try again. And we should always keep believing in ourselves. As the old saying goes ""if at first you don’t succeed, try, try again'.”**

Edit: He-Man isn't having the last word as I'm still a bit worried about his 'Ramming' advice. I just want to say what a lovely bunch of people you all are and what a warm, welcoming non judgy sub this is.

I hope I never forget how this works.  If I'd resolved to drink instead, even if I'd stayed under the limit of one or two drinks, it wouldn't have meant a net improvement of my evening, even without considering the consequences on its heels.  I hate smelling alcohol on my own breath, reflected back from the pillow.  It reminds me of how much I reviled the smell of tobacco on my breath, clothes, and hands after smoking, right before I quit that for good, twelve years ago.

Alcohol doesn't make the fun any better.  I don't even know where this potent association comes from: that if you're having a good time, alcohol goes with that somehow or makes it better.  Is this partly from learned experience?  Why weren't the minority of really fun, safe evenings in which alcohol was involved totally overridden by the vastly larger amount of contradictory experiences, in which drinking alcohol diminished my ability to enjoy my own hobbies, to do my chores or work, stifled my emotional intelligence, ruined my life.  I know the human mind isn't logical in an abstract way (yes I've read some Kahneman, which I do not recommend but that's a tale for another time), but it's another matter entirely to see my mind presenting to me as ideas about reality, or theories, if you will, things that have been consistently disproven by my own experience over the course of many years of hands-on research.

And then there's advertising and television, which probably doesn't help.  I wish I could rip all the advertising out of my brain and drop it on the floor like a soggy wet rag, splat.  Wouldn't that make things easier?  I guess that's why we need groups like this, so we can help each other solidify in our minds an alternative story, consisting of the facts: that this poison is incredibly bad for us, that it doesn't foster creativity (I fell into that trap), make one cool or more fun to be around, or even make the pain go away sustainably.

I can’t believe how much fun I had! Sounds crazy, right? 

I’m on day 12 alcohol free now. My head is clearing and I can see all the stupid shit I’ve done and am starting to feel the emotional pain from it now. 

I headed to that meeting full of grief, shame and sorrow about the breakdown of my relationship 2 weeks ago, my fault from being drunk for the whole thing, (10months) he just had enough of my shit. And I can’t blame him.

Anyways. I said hello to a couple of people. Sat through the meeting. We laughed, we cried and I introduced myself as a newcomer (they didn’t ask last week and I was too shy to say anything). The welcome I received was phenomenal!!

I hung around to help tidy up this week. Spoke with a few of the members. Looked at the literature. I’d been interested in the ‘big book’ as the short readings I’ve heard so far in each of the 3 meetings really rang true with me.
While looking at the book, the person who lead the meeting last night asked if I was going to buy it. I didn’t have enough cash on me, but said I’d get it next week. He asked me 4 times if I was definitely going to read it. I said yes. So he bought me the book, there and then. It was such a kind gesture, I can tell every single person in that group wished each and every other person in that group the very best; they really really want to help other alcoholics, like me.

That 3rd meeting last night turned my whole day around. I left feeling so elated like I was finally in the right place; and believe me when I say, I know I definitely haven’t had my ‘rock bottom’ yet. I don’t want it, either. With the power of everything in me (I don’t have a higher power yet, gonna start on the steps ASAP and hope it finds me) I hope that 3rd meeting is also the turning point in my life. 

I really feel like I can do this.

I opened my front door, stepped outside, and autopilot finally shut off for a second. I asked myself what the absolute fuck was I doing, and where was I going? I realized my autopilot was getting ready to leave to a bar, a liquor store...anywhere that had booze.  I lost control for a second.  I kind of went into a frenzy cleaning stuff that I cleaned earlier in the day.

I've been kicking ass for the last year and a half. I had urges to drink early in the sobriety process, but I never fully lost control like that and it terrifies me.

I am only in early days as you can see from my badge but something feels really different. I feel really like I don't want to put that poison in my body anymore. I was a binge drinker, usually just weekends but at times during the week a few times too. The longest I have had this toxic substance out of my life 100% is for 3 months and that was to lose weight, not because I was ready to say goodbye to this chemical addiction.   
I was outside just a while ago with my doggies potting a plant and the sun was beautiful, a gorgeous Aussie Autumnal day of 25 degrees. I caught myself with that familiar feeling of ""Ohh what a gorgeous day, sun feels sooo nice. A few drinks would be nice.."".. BUT NO .. the difference is I saw that thought and familiar 'story' my mind has created over the years but I paused and said back to myself, it's not the few drinks that makes this sun feel good, it's the sun it'self, the experience itself. I felt empowered and proud of myself. Baby steps and probably years of unlearning those false 'stories'to come but the difference now is I am ready, ready to say goodbye to a chemical addiction that took me so far away from my true self and blocked my growth.

I hope everyone is well :). Just for a warning, this might be a long one, as I've got a long ramble of emotions worked up, I'm not even sure where to start! 

So, tonight I went with my brother and niece to her Elementary school's annual spring carnival. I worked at the school up until last January when I left for student teaching, so getting the chance to go back for this and seeing some of the kids was really nice. Now though as I lie here in bed it's got me thinking about my time there, and the deep regret I have for my last 6 months there. 

This school was my first experience in education. I was a  para, I supervised the cafeteria (among other things) and as a result I got to see every kid in the building come through my space. It also gave me the chance to get to know a lot of the kids in a unique way, as I had the chance to speak with many of them, and see how they behaved around their peers during a free social time. I had some really great relationships with the kids,  and was nearly universally liked by them, for whatever reason. I really struggle to put into words the depth of emotion that I had/have for them. They were a really formative part of my experience and life.The best I can do is that after getting back tonight and thinking about it a little, I caught myself referring to them as ""my kids"" again, which is where the title of this post comes into play. 

When I started out at the school 3 years ago, I was right at the start of my troubles with alcohol, and for the first year or so, my day started late enough that my drinking didn't overly affect my duties. Then my hours switched up when my coworker left for another position elsewhere. The job became a bit more stressful as it was just me dealing with things, and my drinking didn't slow down. Then in my last 6 months it went crazy, although I didnt *truly* realize it at the time. It really impacted my performance as I lost patience more easily, started yelling a LOT more, and lost focus on how to run the cafeteria smoothly. When it finally came time for me to leave, I'm sure the principal was glad to see me go.  

I still love that school and those kids, and part of me wishes I could go back there again. Even more deeply, I wish that I could go back in time and give those kids a better me, who knew how to manage the behaviors of 60 odd kids at a time without resorting to yelling, and maintained his own dignity and theirs. This isn't the first time I've thought it, and it won't be the last, but I also need to recognize that as much as it hurts to say, I can't undo what's been done. 
I can only learn from it, and move forward. Thanks for coming to my TEDtalk.

I don't worry about money, my job, my relationship and it's all thanks to the anxiety and depression of drinking being gone that has given me the power of hope. I feel in control of my destiny. Not in the sense that I can control the outcome of every interaction and event but more in the sense that life is a stream and with a thoughtful and gentle nudging I have the capability to navigate to the calm and serene pool of success that I have always thought was out of reach. 125 more days to go before my first year and many more to come.

I was a 12 pack of double IPA and 750ml a night kind of guy, overweight, puking coffee grounds (blood) and actively trying to kill myself with booze. I had no hope and in the beginning of being sober I went through withdraws, learning how to feel emotions again which was scary and incredibly painful but a powerfully positive experience. During that time I found a thread. I didnt save it but I wish I did. Someone said something to the effect of ""you have to learn that emotions can't kill you but booze can."" Something clicked in side of me and I was off to the races of life.

When I was drinking everyone always told me I was a stoic person. That was just my persona covering up for the scared little boy I was inside. Now sober I actually try to live by the tenets of stoicism. Stoicism teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive emotions. Which I had many including self doubt and worthlessness ""I'm not worth it"" or ""I don't deserve it"". It was a spiral I thought had no return.

To be honest I didn't really know where I wanted to go with this but to say that none of this was possible for me with booze in my life. To those on the fence, You are worth it, you can make it, a well lived life is in your grasp, and it's never too late to start. But is it easy? Fuck no it's not an easy road but it's completely worth it.

So I quit drink like 6 weeks ago I think. I noticed I was getting weaker, fatter stomach, headaches in morning, doing worse at work and being more apathetic to progress in life.

Then all of a sudden I just decided to quit and start working out again despite having shitty 9-5 desk job (which fueled my alcoholism).

It surprisingly wasn't hard at all to quit for the first month. I didn't think about drinking at all and felt great about working out and started seeing some noob gains immediately (I've been athletic most my life so wasn't hard to jump back into it.)

But I'm so tired this week and my job searches are going no where two interviews that were promising turned to shit and I just want to get shitfaced and play video games all weekend like I used to. Alcohol used to be the best part of my life and I miss the fun of it. I was getting drunk or pretty buzzed every single day of the week. I'm only 21 and I know if I kept going at that rate there would be bad consequences but damn alcohol tastes great.

I can say with almost 100% certainty that I haven't gone this long without a drink in 32 years.  I had a lot of badge resets but this one was the hardest.  On my day 3 I was just about to buckle under the weight.  It's amazing the ways we try to justify alcohol.  I gritted my teeth and pressed on and slowly things got better.  I doubled-down on exercise and training.  Did an early spring-cleaning too.  Got a damn haircut, no matter what you think the dishevelled-older-guy-that-likes-to-party look is not cool.

It seems like 60 days is a long time but I know I'm only at the tip of the iceberg, assuming I can do the long haul.  But even in this short amount of time a few things are drastically different.  My relationship with my older son that lives with me is volatile at best.  There was an extreme incident during the first week of this reset that he instigated that would have gone very badly had I been in my 'normal' state at that time.  Looking back at how I handled it (I did have to call 911 unfortunately), and the fallout afterwards, I can't tell you how glad I am that I wasn't drinking that night.  Our relationship is still not perfect, but is now in a much better place.  Also, my finances are in better order.  I look and feel like a new man.  I can even tell that I interact better with people.  And if I want to hop on my motorcycle at midnight, I can now!  And my confidence has improved considerably.  I've rediscovered parts of myself I had completely forgotten about, things that at one time were important to me.  
For me it's not the drink anymore, it's the idea of the drink and what it promises to deliver, which I know to be a lie.  I still want a drink so bad sometimes.  I sweat walking past my favorite beer or wine at the grocery store.  I know it's an illusion and I'm just waiting patiently for my brain to rewire.

Today, thanks to your willingness to share your stories and the incredible support I've seen you show each other, I'm celebrating my first 30 days alcohol-free.

Like many others here, I really didn't have any kind of rock-bottom moment. I drank in a way that would be considered moderate by American standards. ~2 drinks a night 3 weeknights a week and 2-4 Friday and Saturday. It was incredibly easy to justify, especially given that beer is my drink of choice and I live a very brewery-saturated region. I wasn't an addict, I was a connoisseur! I wasn't eroding any relationships, there was no immediate threat to my health, and I wasn't jeopardizing my employment status, so it was a perfect storm of conditions within which I could continue on for the foreseeable future leisurely drinking myself into inevitable late-life health problems and even eventual physical dependency. 

The contrast between how I feel physically and mentally today vs. 30 days ago is indescribable. It's profoundly better by every measurable metric. Sleep, energy, mood, physical strength, appetite & eating habits, you name it. I have a beautiful 2-year-old daughter, and I can't stress enough how rewarding it is to know how positively this will affect our relationship in the long term. I owe so much of this accomplishment and these positive feelings to all of you and your willingness to show such a tremendous level of bravery and compassion toward each other. It's so encouraging and uplifting to see people expose their fears and vulnerabilities here and be met with such incredible love and support.

My bday was on the 4th and the only person that did anything for me was my 10 yo daughter. It was a very sweet note and some random trinkets. My wife didn't remember until she got to work but hey, I figured she has had a lot on her mind so no big deal. I thought maybe she had something planned even if it was just some sexy time later with one of the new lingerie sets she got for Christmas since she hasn't worn them yet. Well I was wrong and she ended up falling asleep before it was close to bedtime. 

To give some context, I have been an alcoholic for 15 years and have been trying to stay sober for the last year and a half. I did good for about 6 months but ended up drinking again and it lead to me getting a dui. We almost split after that but we started going to individual counseling and have been trying to work on our issues. I've been sober now for 172 days and have been keeping up with the house work and the kids all while working a full time job. I changed my shift so my wife could take a new job and feel I have more than picked up the slack around the house. 

Now this morning my wife got mad because she forgot to throw her work clothes into the dryer and she hates being late to work (even though she had 2 hours before her shift started). So she started blaming me for it because she had to drive me around the night before and said I had ruined our lives. She is right and I feel very guilty for putting us in this position. But since I stopped drinking, a lot has changed for the better. We are no longer living in overdraft and pay most of our bills on time. We have been able to keep her hair cut/colored, go to the doctor when we get sick, afford the our medications, and so much more. Hell we were even able to handle the alternator on our Lexus going out! 

So I did learn after we argued that she still resents me for being an alcoholic for so long and is upset that i haven't been making her feel sexy and desired even though she asked me to back off when we first started going to therapy. Here I've been waiting on her to want to be intimate again.... even though I have my own resentments because of her cheating on me and spending the time to make another man feel special...

First off, I went to my primary care doctor to discuss treatment options. Note, I am in the military and there are certain things that are mandatory. Alcohol treatment seems to be one of them. Anyway, I went through the government flavor of alcohol treatment in 2015 and it didn't seem to work. Part of it may be because I wasn't totally committed to the treatment as I should have been. Regardless, I want to see an addiction specialist in the area and use the military health care system to do so. However, I need to be seen by my doctor first and then given a referral. 

Unfortunately, the referral I received was right back to the ADAPT (Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment program) which I specifically told my doctor I didn't want to go through since it was unsuccessful the first time. Turns out that since I am military, my hands are tied and all treatment has to be tracked through this program. I feel disrespected as a patient as I wanted to operate under the umbrella of doctor-patient confidentiality and seek treatment in a manner that I believed would benefit me, but I've been told I have no choice. 

Moving forward, I have an ""intake"" appointment in a couple of weeks where they will determine the nature of my diagnosis. After that, maybe I can get the referrals that I need.

Anyway, I find myself rolling into a weekend, spring break, and another weekend. That's 9 days before I have to be back at work. 9 days of spring break weather in a beach town, perfect for day drinking. I check out the local events and see pub crawls, microbrew tasting, a taco and tequila fest (which was awesome last year), etc. I know I can have fun without drinking, but seeing all these activities that are built around a social drinking atmosphere is making it really hard to ignore. My wife mentioned wanting to go to the beach and lay out, which sounds great, but I always do that with a cooler of beer. Now just the thought of laying out on the beach without alcohol sounds boring. I don't know how to fix that but I hope it gets easier with each day of sobriety.

2020-03-06 11:48:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/feg84t/please_tell_me_why/,Please tell me why.,"It is a common theme I’ve encountered over the last month and a half, that big life decisions should not be made this early on in sobriety. Short backstory is that for many years I tried and failed to get my life on track and do what was needed to escape/dismantle the hold that alcohol had on my body and mind that affected all aspects of my life in a bad way, until now.

I have run into this “just wait”  sentiment from multiple sources. People close to me, councillors, and the valuable advice from this community. My question is simply this... who sets the timeline? If my circumstances are fixed, why am I not in possession of all the facts to make a rational decision? I get that even though I’m happy and feel better than I have in over a decade, that I’m still healing my brain back to balance and readjusting my behaviour and interactions with the world around me and that these are dynamic processes. 

I’m just not convinced that placing an arbitrary timetable on myself that delays me from making decisions about my life based on the facts of my reality as it is today is something that will be the best for me. I feel like I’m a child who is being told to be patient (oddly enough it sounds childish just to say that lol) I constantly remind myself that small baby steps are best and necessary when it comes to coping with daily stress, complex relationships and coming to terms with my addiction and my past. 

I’m asking for a different point of view so I can try and understand if there is an angle that I’m not seeing and should genuinely consider with regard to my feelings on this topic. Admittedly I do get impatient sometimes and seek definitive answers where are are none to be had. I haven’t encountered a black and white or clear cut situation yet in my life. I should have learned that by now lol but that’s why I’m here and lean on all of you. 

For a little more context, there is nothing wrong with my life right now. There are things that I desire greatly but sadly are not anything I can change to make a reality. I’m in a good place with amazing support and getting a bit better every day. I feel no overarching need to change anything and I remind myself of the “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” truism. As always I grateful for the insights and council that all of you are kind enough to provide by sharing your experiences and feelings with me.

I'm almost 4 weeks sober after a decade of heavy drinking and it's been wonderful. Like a pure rebirth. I've always been a highly emotional person and I thought I had learned to keep my emotions in check when in reality I was just numbing them with alcohol. As I'm sure many of you have experienced, part of sobriety means that we finally have to deal with all the feelings we've been avoiding over time. I'm at that point now and I'm starting to realize that the process takes months and even years for some and I'm excited for the journey because I feel like I'm rediscovering who I truly am.

I have a lot of people who I've hurt who I'd like to reach out to and let them know that I've decided to finally change for the better. This list includes my ex-girlfriend (who I care deeply about but who I deeply hurt by being a drunken ass) as well as several very close friends who had stopped speaking to me because of my outlandish behavior.

What I'm struggling with is trying to decide whether now is the right time, or whether I should wait until my recovery has progressed more and I understand my sober/'normal' self more deeply and more thoroughly. While part of me acknowledges I've already taken steps to make a major life change and that I should try and repair my relationships with these people, something deep inside me is telling me that now is *not* the right time for that. It's telling me that for now I should instead focus my energy and time on healing, recovery, and rediscovery. My best friend agrees and has been telling me not to focus on the other people but to take some time for myself since my recovery is still so fresh. It's hard to reconcile the two - I want to make amends but I also want to wait to see where this journey takes me and who I become as well.

Have any of you experienced a similar situation? Have any of you decided to wait and recover/rediscover yourself first, or do you try to do both at the same time?

It's taken a bit of isolation (to avoid old drinking buddies), but I'm surprisingly content hanging out in my home with my plants and pets.

No hangovers, no dread when signing in to my bank account, my house is in order, and I feel present. The past 15 years have been drunken chaos - broken bones, no regard for my finances, health problems, neglecting my responsibilities, unsafe sexual activity, etc. The gratification I've gained from abstaining (despite how boring my everyday could look to an outsider now) is something I'm going to fiercely protect, because I deserve a life of peace.

It might get a little long winded and I apologize in advance. 

 I have lurked in this sub for close to a year before I made my first attempt at sobriety. It was half hearted and I was still thinking ""I can moderate and control this. I'm not ready to give up parties and late night gaming sessions with the boys. I just need to get the other drinking nights under control.""

I made it 2 months the first time, and to my credit, the drinking was slow to come back after that, but it didn't take long before I was settled back into my routine. If I was done with work by 6pm or didn't work at all, I had a bottle of hard liquor and a mixer. It was never 1 drink to enjoy the taste it was minimum 3 drinks because 'you can't *waste* that liquor.... right?' I would try to end visits to my parents or friends simply because ""then I could be home before 8, which is enough time to enjoy a few drinks"" I got genuinely upset when something would prevent me from utilizing one of my days off to get drunk. 

I had a ton of excuses. ""Games are more fun when I'm drunk cause hand eye coordination goes, so there's more challenge!"" As I played games that required none to begin with. ""My job outs stressful and this helps me forget about work"" my job did suck to be fair, but the hangovers certainly didn't help. ""I'm young, I have to get my drinking in NOW before I'm to old to enjoy it."" ... yeah, looking back this is the stupidest one. 

It took me another 2 years of doing this and progressively getting worse, drinking closer to every day, drinking when I worked early the next day even though I knew the hangover could make me miss work and I did NOT have the sick time. Justifying another bottle purchase because ""I'm gonna have to use my credit card for X, so what's $20 more really?"" 

It took me finding a new job, and hurting my marriage by not being the person I should be and walking up at 2am shaking and nauseous to realize this is a fucking problem and if I don't do something now, I might not be able to in a month. I went to the bathroom and threw up and I looked in the mirror as I cleaned up to go back to bed and I hated who I saw. I went to lay back down and I heard my wife silently sobbing and it broke my heart. 

I confessed my feelings to my her the next day, I told her all this shit and all these excuses and how I felt like screaming every time I walked onei the liquor store because I knew I'd get a 1.75 and I knew it would be gone in 3 sessions. I hadn't gotten drunk at work and I've never driven drunk thankfully, but I had begun to think of ways to sneak alcohol to work to 'cope.' We poured my alcohol down the drain and looked up treatment, I learned AA isn't for me (to much church, but I advocate for it if it works for you) but I read all the literature and visited this sub every single day. 

Quitting has been the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. And that's why I knew I needed to do it. It sucked. It sucked hard. My first full weekend I drank an unhealthy amount of coffee and ate comfort pizza rolls to cope through. When I started, I never imagined I'd get the support I did from my wife and close friends who checked in every weekend. 6 months may not be much, but it's changed so much. I've been eating better, I have rediscovered hobbies i had forgotten about, and my relationship is stronger than i think it's been in 4 years of marriage.

There's still challenges in day to day life and there's still time I'll have something happen and go ""I could use a drink"" but I'm working through them 1 problem at a time and lurking here whenever I can to cheer you all on and remind myself of why I did this and why I'm here.

But when my indoor cycling studio celebrated a fitness milestone I achieved yesterday, it got me thinking about one of my very first rides there, two years ago, and how much has changed. 

I was still drinking a bottle or more of wine every night at that point, as I had for years. I knew I should probably stop, but couldn't imagine getting through an evening without it so I kept rationalizing how I wasn't that bad compared to other people. 

As the instructor was helping me set up my bike that morning, she pointed out the resistance knob and explained how it levels the playing field and allows people of different fitness levels to participate in the same class. ""You can turn it up or down to make it harder or easier, you know, like if someone is just coming back from an injury......or........if you drank a bottle of wine the night before and need to take it easy........"" 

My alcoholic brain at the time thought, ""What? She drinks entire bottles of wine too? And she's a fitness instructor? See, I'm not that bad after all."" 

In hindsight, my embarrassed sober brain realizes she said that because she could smell it on me. I never knew there was a smell until I stopped drinking, but now I notice it on others. 

So much has changed in two years...I'm in my early 40s and in the best shape I've been in for a very long time. I'm down 25 pounds from that class two years ago. I ride 3-4 times a week and run or walk outside on the other days. My skin looks better, my eyes looks better, I'm no longer puffy, I love my sober mornings. Life is all around better. 

If you're just starting out, keep going. I know it can seem daunting at times and you look at other people who have long periods of sobriety and it seems so unattainable, but I promise you can do it. It truly is one day, one decision at a time. And it is so worth it. IWNDWYT.",1048,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9907664060592651}"

I went on a first date.,"Last week I posted asking for advice on how to date without drinking. After 30+ year of heavy drinking I realized I had never been on a first date sober. The idea of it was stressing me out. Figured I should tell my story of my first sober date. 

A couple months ago I broke up with my girlfriend of 5+ years. We both struggled with addiction and enabled each other. So I started my new life in my mid 40s and it’s been great. The sleeping, weight loss, focus etc. have been fantastic but I was lonely. So I went online and met a woman. After a couple of weeks of talking we finally found a time to meet up for a first date. 

Then the panic set in. How in the world do I go out and be funny and charming without drinking? That’s something I’ve never done in my life. I told the woman I was meeting about my recovery and my anxiety before me met. I’m not in any way a shy man and have never had any issue talking to beautiful women but here I was in a panic because I knew I didn’t have my crutch. 

So we met for dinner. She had a few glasses of wine while I drank tea. I drank bottle after bottle of water. We talked for hours and it went great. We left and went to a bar. I told the bartender  I was recently sober and he made me a craft cocktail with no booze. Things were going really well. My date and I talked a lot about my life of drinking and my new life of not drinking. She was very supportive and encouraging. I figured I would just put everything out there and let her judge me herself. Something as simple as having drinks with a woman had turned me into a hot mess but I was figuring it out and it was awesome. 

She invited me to her place for tea. Then the panic set in again. How in the world do you kiss someone when you are sober? That’s just never happened in my adult life. What if it went further? 

I ended up leaving after a couple hours without kissing her. While I loved the date I just had no idea how to make a move sober. I felt like a kid again. Shy and awkward! 

Oh well. I’m happy I pushed myself to go out even if I’m not comfortable in my own skin anymore. If you are struggling with this my only advice is to be really open and honest with everyone. I told the woman after our date that I did want to kiss her and explained why I didn’t and she’s supportive and awesome. Everything is new again and while it’s scary and weird it’s also great. 

I’m going to keep learning and trying and not drinking with you all.",132,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9891899824142456}"

Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

This pledge is a statement of intent.

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

What this is:

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

What this isn’t:

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hello DCIers,

Sorry I've not responded very much to the comments of late I've been pretty tied up with work and family life! I've read every one though, thank you for your kind words. Here is my penultimate daily musing.

Whenever I've had time off from drinking in the past my primary motivation has been to lose weight. In my 20s I was pretty athletic, I drank but being young and active kept the pounds off. Then I guess into my 30s the drinking ramped up and the exercise ramped down and I ate pizzas, lots of pizzas. In 2007 I got married and at the wedding were lots of people who hadn't seen me for a good while. Distant relatives, old friends, those kinds of people. The less tactful of these would say things like ""Wow, haven't you put on weight?"" or simply just ""Haven't you changed?"" I took these questions to be rhetorical as I didn't respond and if they weren't meant to be rhetorical I didn't need to feel bad about being rude by ignoring them. Vanity has never really been an issue for me so I didn't take it to heart. The thing that I hated though was the feeling of being encumbered. I hated the fact that putting my socks on or tying my shoe laces had become a chore, in fact **everything** I did was now physically a chore. I didn't want to stop drinking but I did want to lose weight and these two desires are fairly conflicted. I think it's pretty apparent there are a load of empty calories in booze, 200 in a pint, 650 in a bottle of wine... and sure, you can get your diet mixers, your light beers, reds from the pinot noir grape but given the quantities I was drinking it wasn't going to make much difference. So how does a dependent drinker motivate themselves enough to stop drinking and start losing weight? They binge watch obesity and weight loss documentaries of course! Given the amount of bariatric surgeries I have seen performed I think I could carry out the procedure myself. I'd just need to tape my office stapler to a long pencil and I'd be good to go. Then there is the list of obesity related health issues you can scare yourself with, type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, heart disease, stroke, blood pressure, sleep apnea..... it's a long list.

So I would stop drinking and start losing weight and since I wasn't drinking I'd eat better, I'd start to exercise again and as I lost weight and got fitter I'd start to feel pretty good again. I'd buy myself new thin clothes and I'd put my old fat clothes in a bag in the loft (attic) with a label on saying ""Fat clothes, do not open"". I'd be pretty pleased with myself and as a reward I'd just have a few drinks but **only** at the weekend. Then, in the style of a puffer fish, I'd be fat again. Maybe even fatter than before! Ho-hum.

So what does a fat Andy now do who doesn't like feeling encumbered? He does it again. All of it. The full cycle. He loses 70lbs, feels great, starts drinking and puts it all back on. The loft ladder became my climb of shame. Digging out the bag with the big clothes in yet again. I'd changed the wording on the label to ""Fat clothes. Back again?"" a rhetorical question to myself!

Since 2007 I must have done this cycle 6 or 7 times. I can scroll back through my photos and one year I'd be thin and a year or so later I'd be big again. Every time I'd lose the weight I'd swear never again. Losing weight is hard, slow, demoralising and full of ups and downs and I'd managed to perfect the yo-yo effect of dieting.

It's taken me 13 years to realise that my weight issue is really just a consequence of my drinking. No that's not it, it's taken me 13 years to finally get sick and tired enough to face up to my drinking problem.

So here I am again. But this time my primary motivation is taking care of my drinking and my weight can take care of itself.

So many feelings came up. I used to drink Tennessee Honey alone in my room pretty much constantly. I went through a handle of the stuff every other day for a solid year. Tennessee Honey was what I was blacked out on the second time I was raped. It was what I was drinking when I tried to kill myself last year. I don’t think I’ve ever actually taken a shot of it. I don’t think I’ve ever drank it with other people. It’s always been straight out of the bottle and I’ve always been alone.

Walking into this party and seeing it on the table was a huuuuuge trigger. The thought of drinking whiskey makes my stomach turn. I’ve been sober for almost 6 months now and I’m grateful every single day that I was able to stop drinking. Nevertheless, I honestly thought about drinking it. I wanted to. I saw the bottle and it was like none of that even mattered. I just wanted to take a pull straight out of the bottle. I even briefly thought about stopping at the liquor store on my way home. 

Logically, I know I don’t want to drink. Obviously I should not go out and buy a handle of Jack Daniel’s to drink alone in my room. But that little voice in my head wants to get shit-faced *so bad* right now. Thank god all the liquor stores are closed. Addiction is wild. I love being sober and I’ve *really* enjoyed all the changes I’ve made. I love my life, and for the first time I love myself. I look back and feel ashamed of who I was when I was drinking. I really have no desire to drink again. But just seeing that bottle instantly had me thinking about drinking again. I’m just hoping my cravings simmer down by tomorrow.

I have a great career making decent money doing what I love. I love my girlfriend. I love my coworkers and my friends.
I feel like I provide value to others.
But, at night time when I'm at home and no longer at work, I feel inadequate and empty.
Looking back, I mistook this for ""boredom"" when in reality, I'm drinking to escape this feeling that's weighing on me like a ton of bricks.
It's easy to just turn off, until I wake up with a dry mouth, headache and struggle to replenish myself the next day.
I fill my time with hobbies. I enjoy calisthenics, playing and writing music, going for walks, and writing my feelings in this sub in hopes that it resonates and rings true with someone out there.
Life is an amazing journey.
My life has not been the easiest and I have always felt inadequate and empty no matter what I did to chase the feelings away.
But that's okay. 
My perception of life is that it's a constant stream of disappointment with beautiful brilliant moments in between.
And it's that disappointment and drudgery that makes the little things worth it.
I CHERISH the little things.
That's one of the greatest gifts I have.
I think I might be the only person that gets excited that I can choose ANY coffee creamer I want.
Or the fact any Ice cream flavor one could want is available nearly every where.
I haven't had a drink now in 21 days which is supposedly enough to break a habit.
I CANT drink though so this is different 
I am on house arrest for my dui I got arrested for last February. 
If I drink I go to jail.
But perhaps this was the push I needed.
Here I am though, the SAME feelings I had, except more intense because I face it through a sober lens.
I wish to keep this up. My girlfriend says I'm a different person when I'm sober, I'm not sure how to interpret that.
Never did I think I would be here at 25 in my life, but life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.
I hope all of you are having a good night and hopefully someone can FEEL what I'm saying.
Btw, topo Chico is fantastic

Today she told me I made her feel scared, that I showed her darkness that made her uncomfortable. 
I am not that person. I am when I'm drunk, but deep inside I'm not that man. I let myself get drunk. I showed her my dark side, my dark thoughts. I showered her with praise but I let her in on my biggest problem, alcohol. 
She told me she couldn't be with an alcoholic, sober or otherwise because she enjoys drinking in a healthy way 
I'm only 6 months out of another relationship that ended due in part to alcohol. She wanted a fun party guy and I was except for a few moments of darkness that I let out. Maybe I am that guy and alcohol brought it out of me more quickly.

Have a physical tmrw, long overdo. I’m certain there are prostrate issues. Nothing seems to be working down there, poo, pee, no sex drive. I thought the frequent trips to restroom in night was ok the alcohol I was drinking, then is sobriety all the water and sparkling water. But now frequent urges to go but can’t muster anything, and most of the time it’s weak flow. Same for number two. Fiber supplement helped a lot in the beginning and I can still have a good movement occasionally but most often seems to be more effort than needed, and frequent trips to fully finish function.

I said I would go online and read about but I did. Didn’t help. Also mention lower back pain. I thought it was soreness from exercise and deadlifts, but I do seem to need to constantly stretch out lower back.

On top of all that small pain underneath foot since Sunday. Not bad. I’ve maintained exercise schedule and get through exercises fine but crash pretty hard afterward. Takes an hour of just lying down to feel good again. Walking barefoot on hardwood hurts a little. I’m limping around.

I know I need to cut back on exercise but afraid to hat that means to my sobriety. And have irrational guilt about “scoring poorly” on 12 week program I am doing on app. That is stupid. I can always do another 12 week program if I allow myself to heal.

So I want physical to happen but also scared for what it might show. The old sting on contradiction when I had so many things moving in same positive direction, and my emotional level is still high throughout day.

Going to work hard to lean on the new healthier habits for dealing with stress I have been cultivating. If it turns out all I can do is swim or walk on treadmill, maybe that will provide the buzz.

I don’t feel tempted to drink, just a little frazzled as physical approaches.

Has anybody else had the experience of getting repeatedly sick during the early days of sobriety? I have about a month under my belt, though with one reset that taught me that a) I really like being sober, and b) if I start I really won’t just have one. (As many of you have already learned!)

During the course of that months I’ve had the flu/pneumonia three times. The first weekend was during the first days I was sober, so I attributed it to withdrawal symptoms, fairly I think. But then the next weekend I got sick again, started feeling better for about a week, and then started feeling worse. Today I had to go home from work sick even though all week I’ve been fine. 

Just curious if anybody else has had this experience of a week feeling good followed by two or three days of a cold or flu, over and over.

I’ve posted before so I’ll try to keep the background shorter. Quit drinking ~10 months ago, started on Zoloft and a ton of weed which I continued for about 6 months after. Was feeling “good” although I’m sure now that I was manic from the SSRI and just blasted using 90+% THC concentrate all day every day. Quit them both out of a desire to be totally substance free and have decided to stick to it despite feeling like I’m suffering 1, 2 or 3 different PAWS and struggling a fair amount the last couple months.

It’s definitely made me feel like I set back or convoluted my recovery process , and made it harder to relate to others in recovery who either got sober all at once or still use pot or meds to get by. Nothing against either, I just don’t want them in my body or brain anymore. Can’t seem to moderate my marijuana use, which has caused me a variety problems, and don’t want to play the game of trying different medications and doses that is often required for antidepressants as I’m pretty convinced the risks equal or outweigh the benefits for me.

I guess it just sucks to read about progress or recovery timelines  in quitting one or two of these things while realizing that my prospects may be considerably different. I’m going to keep on with my goal of cutting all mind altering substances as I seem to have plateaued or slightly improved recently, but also eager to hear anyone else’s experiences doing something similar.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9971840977668762}"

I was ordered three years max of probation, plus court fees and a hefty fine. This beats the alternative, though. I could be dead or in jail. At least I have an opportunity to enjoy all of the other beautiful things in life. 

Under the stipulations of the probation, I am to stay away from alcohol (and other drugs of course).
I thought it fitting. When I told my parents, they thought it was ridiculous that avoiding alcohol was included in the terms of probation. ""What's wrong with a glass of wine on a holiday? You should be fine as long as you dont drink and drive. Moderation is the key!"" 
I put feelers out before to see how they felt about me being sober and I knew this would be their response. Somehow it frightens them to think that I won't drink alcohol anymore? They know full well that I have a problem, and that's what got me in this mess in the first place.

My body was literally telling me it couldn't handle alcohol anymore but I kept telling it that ""today"" would be the last day. I went to my doctor who is well aware that I was drinking more than I should. When I got weighed I looked at the number and balked. I weighed more than I ever have in my life. My stomach was so bloated I looked pregnant. It wasn't that alcohol had done this to me, it's that I'd done this to myself WITH alcohol. My doctor immediately told me if I wanted more out of life, if I wanted better health, a baby, a future basically, I would have to get healthy. Her first recommendations for that was to stop drinking. Then she moved onto diet, exercise, etc. Stopping drinking was first.

Something in me finally clicked. I was putting everything else in my life 2nd to drinking. I let myself go and for what? Wine? I realized how immature and selfish I'd been. I was complaining to people about heartburn, my anxiety and my weight when I was actively robbing myself of the opportunity to fix all of those things. All because of my drinking. I went home and talked to my husband who is also a heavy drinker about what we wanted out of life and our future and we stopped that day. Having his support and knowing what each other was going through was huge.

I'm here now with only 10 days under my belt but that's 10 days of sobriety that I haven't had in a long, long time. It's incredible how much your life can change in those 10 days without alcohol. I've saved $115, 5,000 calories. My heartburn has gone away and holy shit, the sleep. I'm sleeping throughout the night. I've quit taking my anxiety medicine in the morning because I'm no longer waking up with a rapid heartbeat from going to bed wasted. I'm exhausted in the morning, don't get me wrong but that's only because my body is finally getting actual deep sleep at night. My house is cleaner and while I clean I'm finding wine stains on everything. I'm ashamed I've ruined so many shirts with a giant fucking wine stain because it was always, ""one more glass,"" that I'd end up sloshing on myself. I'm able to go outside and read a book without getting distracted or my legs cramping up because my circulation is poor and I've depleted all of my potassium with alcohol. My sugar cravings are sky high but I've found a soda water that tastes like Dr. Pepper! I'm burning through a case of that in 2 days. 

&#x200B;

I'm so happy being sober right now. I'm so happy being clear headed and following through with plans. I'm so happy in my relationship. It's incredible how we took alcohol out of the marriage and all of a sudden the pointless fighting stopped. We're both happy to have the other's support and the support of friends.

I still smoke pot which has lost some appeal without the booze.  It helps me stay sane when I need to.  I took mushrooms last weekend and really felt like at this stage of my life I am responsible to other people for my well being and so sobriety really does matter more than ever.

Yesterday was hard. The whole day I was in a funk, ashamed at my behavior. Today I feel better, but still feel shame. However, I do feel hope. I have an appointment with my doctor today to discuss treatment options to hopefully get me in the right direction. My wife is going to join me for the appointment because this is an issue that affects both of us. I just cant help but to feel bad. She is a busy woman with school and projects and other duties and then she comes home and has to deal with me. I wish I could be stronger for her. 

2-5 days is not really a big deal for me as I normally don't drink during the weekdays. However, this time is different because I am choosing sobriety rather than just waiting until it is more acceptable to drink (i.e. saturday). 

My wife asked me what I was thinking when I drank on Tuesday. Why did I decide to do it after we had discussed it earlier that weekend? Why did I choose to further put our relationship at risk when she had just two days prior expressed her dissatisfaction? I don't have an answer. I can't tell you why and that's what lets me know this is a problem. It is something that I couldn't control and it scares me.

Yet, I feel stronger already in admitting my weakness. I feel like I have regained some power but recognizing that this is something I can't do on my own, which helps to explain my failures over the last several years. 

Alcohol has been such an important part of my life that I am afraid of learning how to be without it. I know I can live a full life without intoxication like MOST PEOPLE DO! I just don't know how. 

Yet I know that sobriety is a daily choice. 10,000 days is a choice made 10,000 times.

Now I want to piggyback on Lent and keep going.,"Not drinking is so easy now! I don’t have anxiety like I used to about when I go out what alcohol will be available. I was using booze as a crutch and I’m so proud of myself now that I can watch a movie, meet a friend for dinner, or go to a museum without pregaming out of fear I won’t be drunk enough to “have fun”. 

No hangovers for 100 nights! I used to throw up every few days and threw up blood the morning I decided to go 100 days sober and I haven’t thrown up once this whole time. I had to allow myself to feel full again after meals without feeling uncomfortable-the urges to throw up was ingrained in me and I worked through it. 

I’m still on a weight loss journey and on the last desired 15#, so it’s slower going and I’m worried about falling into binge eating and drinking again if I start back up. I was talking to my Grandma about it and she gently reminded me that alcoholism runs on both sides of my family and that sometimes it’s better just not to drink instead of risking it getting out of control. She doesn’t know it’s already been out of control though, with the throwing up blood weekly and going through withdrawal. 

I still struggled with anxiety and depression, sobriety hasn’t magically fixed anything in my life, but it’s 200% easier to manage. And I’ve gained self respect when I need it the most.

We’d started hanging out with our puppies together, everyone happy to reap the benefits of worn out well exercised puppy.   

The husband of the group kept bringing alcohol up and I had a feeling they’re somewhat heavy drinkers so I’d been dreading dinner. Not because I’d drink, but because I was afraid of the questions and probing. No one questions you not drinking like someone who never questions their own drinking. I’m a somewhat private person. My reasons, like many of you, are steeped in a mug full of pain and shame that never seems to empty. I don’t really want to discuss it over dinner with people I barely know.   

So imagine my horror when my husband, casual, goes as we map out dinner “oh I don’t know if you know this but AT doesn’t drink so we have a DD if need be” only he said it way more awkwardly than that lol. I wanted to pause reality and just go “...bruh.” But it actually went over fine. The husband (wife was away at a conference) didn’t even get into it.   

It wasn’t until after dinner, they’d had whiskeys and I stuck to annoyingly tiny glasses of sodas water (but I did get lemon), when we ordered dessert that he asked if I’d drank prior or not. And I shrugged and said yeah, I gave it up for New Years. It just wasn’t serving me or any of my goals. And that was it, ya’ll. He even said “good for you, that’s awesome”.  I imagine he went home and told his wife this interesting tidbit about their new friends and next time we’re around the wife’ll like say something like “oh my husband said you don’t drink?” And I’ll go “yeah, gave it up for New Years.” And that’ll likely be it.  

AT officially knows people who know her as a non drinker. I can’t drink around these people without awkwardly taking that back. And I fucking love it.

I was at a Rose bowl party and I've been sober and you know two weeks almost at this point and there was a bottle of Bailey's and I was like oh I haven't had Bailey's so long and so tasty meals have a sip and I took a sip and I felt really guilty but eventually went back and had another one so that was great and then that was it. I called my mom and told her what I did and said I felt like I was still fine to drive and I was sober another two or three days and I picked up a handle of shady Irish creamer whatever and that's poor choice. so I get this bottle and then I drive up to my parents house and just you know do my due of hide the drinking and then get picked up some beers and a liquor store up there and just successfully hit my drinking that weekends and wow just isolated myself mostly. My mom found empty beer cans hitting by the bed house staying at and just walked in and she sat down and she said f*** f*** f***never heard my mother talk like that in her life so that was scary.  I was able to  stay sober about a week I think after that like a super bowl party I know I didn't drink so sober through that and then some reason every time it's I get this little bug in my head and doesn't get outside to make this so much better but it doesn't make it better The time it does but not after. I hate feeling so good for a week and then f****** it all up with a 5-day bender and then I miss work and my family becomes more and more consumed. today my family finally convinced me to go to a little more intensive care it's like a 4 days a week for 3 hours sort of near where I live and kind of scared about that and I never wanted to get to that point and now here I am and it's a whole mix of blah. I guess I'm just scared about these next steps and I was hoping for some comforting words and advice. I'm just really scared of change and how it will affect my life.

I've had a negative realtionship with alcohol since 16. Like one sip of booze would open the floodgates of consumption. Turns out addiction runs heavily in family and i just likely have a brain that reacts poorly(or perhaps way too well) to booze. 

I was also addicted to marijuana but quitting that was easy.

Cut to my senior year of college. Broke, unemployed, stealing booze for my thurs-sun binge. Emotionally abused my then girlfriend, had gotten the shit kicked out of me, and had been arrested.  I was fat(no shame if you are but i had always had an athletic build), and always the drunkest at the party. But most of all i was selfish. The only people i loved altrusitically was my mother and my niece who was closer to a sister for me. Just lazy, selfish, loud, but I'm pretty charismaric so i got by.

Eventually i saw a counseler at my university and started self improvement. 
Now I'm sober, fit, have a good job, a great girlfriend, and joined the national guard.

Why am i telling you all of this. Because quitting drinking allowed me to be a better sober person. I went from being all those awful things described above to being thoughtful, empathetic, reliable, and driven. 

This was such a severe personality shift, and those who didnt know i had a drinking problem were flabbergasted at my improvement.

I would wake up with panic attacks and figured out that Jim Beam at 3.00AM was the answer. Wake up at 6.00AM, and why not: another big glass of Beam. Basically, I was drinking all day--about a 1/2 handle a day but additional drinks at bars.

&#x200B;

After a month, I'm back in my house with my wife and daughter and living in the guest room with my friend Jim Beam. I was a lot sneaker this time around. Eventually, my wife asked me to quit doing whiskey and switch to vodka--because that makes sense. And I picked up where I left off for another 8 months.

&#x200B;

So then I have to meet my probation officer, and I really do need to get off the sauce. I used the taper method over the course of five days, and it worked fine. Very little withdrawal. And I didn't drink for a couple months. I should mention my wife is a heavy drinker too--all day White Claw kind of girl. One morning she wakes up and cracks a Claw, and I think 'Why not?' But I always kept to Claws until a few weeks ago when my buddy Jim Beam and I reconnected.

&#x200B;

So now basically, I'm coming off a really truncated taper, and I'm balls deep with withdrawal. I have a cup of soup in my belly, along bunch of cranberry juice. And it sucks really bad. This time I'm really done. I refuse to go through withdrawals again. I'm just tired of drinking to feel normal, and I'm doing this for my daughter. She got an athletic scholarship at a DII college, and I sorta think she's playing as a gift to me. Stopping drinking is the least I can do.

1) Have a slight buzz by the time I get home. Do my evening chores while slugging vodka straight from the bottle. Watch the TV show I’ve been looking forward to all week, but probably won’t remember what happens on it. Wake up in the middle of the night in a sweat, not remembering going to bed. Can’t go back to sleep so just lie there thirsty and wondering if I made any embarrassing social media posts or said anything bad when my boyfriend called (if he called....will have to check caller ID to see). Spend the new day ashamed and disappointed. 

2) Get in a great workout and eat a good supper. Get all my chores done in time to watch my show, which I will totally remember the next day. Have a great conversation with my BF, which I will also remember. Have a snack, work on a jigsaw puzzle, play with my cats, and read in bed before I fall asleep.

How I should just stay in and drink cause its cold and im tired anyway. But then I thought to myself ""Why?"" Im just gonna sit at home not doing anything when i Know i need to proactively try to lose weight. Its not just gonna lose itself. That I would get the spins eventually and gourge myself on as many carbs as possible to try to curb the slur. And then eventually pass out with heart palpitations and wake up disappointed with myself. So I made a cup of coffee and forced myself to go to the gym. Worked out for 2 hours. 

Im not even necessarily trying to stop drinking, but to stop in situations that arent appropriate. Sitting at home watching movies all day and getting drunk is not appropriate for me anymore. So today I chose sobriety.

I don't think I have a problem to the degree that I've read about on this sub, but its definitely not helping anything in my life.  I didn't have my first drink until I was 22, but now at 28 I usually keep some sort of alcohol in the house and have about 2-5 drinks a night.  I just miss the days when it wasn't even an idea to pick up a bottle of whiskey, and I want to get back to that. Plus I think removing it from the equation will help me focus on fitness, work, and stand-up. 

My wife drinks less than I do, she never really gets drunk but she likes a few glasses of wine every so often. I know she enjoys it and doesn't have any desire to stop because its not a problem for her.  There was a period of 18 months when we first met where her and I did A LOT of cocaine.  When I say a lot, I mean seriously scary amounts.  After a sincere coked out conversation at 5am, We were able to stop completely on a dime and haven't touched it in 3+ years.  So I believe we don't have addictive personalities, our vices just stem from a place of habit. 

My issue/weakness is always wanting to join her when she pours one.  My question is do you guys think its fair for me to ask her to stop drinking for the time being while I start my journey into sobriety, or should I just man up and let her do her thing while I do mine?",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9755473732948303}"

2020-03-04 12:57:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fdguvw/back_again/,Back again,"Hello SD. Its been awhile since I've checked in. I am long overdue, but I hope to be better this time.

For years, my wife has expressed that she believed I had a bad relationship with alcohol. I always thought that she was judging me from a perspective that came from her having an alcoholic father. ""I'm not your dad!"" I'd say and deflect this issue. After all, it wasn't a big deal, right? It was always her having a problem with my drinking. I'd get upset that she would be mad at me for being drunk. I'd resent her for forcing me into sobriety. Once things got back to normal, I'd drink a little bit again. She seemed okay with me having a few, as long as I could control it. 

The thing is, I can't.

I can't tell you how many times she has told me that I needed to get healthy or she was leaving. I can't tell you how many times I said I'd do/be better. I can't tell you how many times I've gotten drunk and then cried and felt so much shame for letting her down and pushing her away. I can't tell you how many times we've gone through this cycle. I'm so tired of doing it. 

I went through a program 5 years ago that checked the box of me getting better. Really, it was to appease my wife so she wouldn't leave me, but nothing really changed. I was sober for 3 months and then went back to it. ""Responsible drinking"" was what they called it. Maybe it works for some people, but I have a hard time. 

Many people drink to cope with something. Stress, relationships, etc. I never found drinking to be a coping mechanism because I just enjoy the way it makes me feel. How do you fix that? I never found a trigger as it was always a constant craving. Always thinking about the next drink. Wife went to the bathroom? Quick - take a couple of swigs off the bottle so she doesn't notice! Wife went to the grocery store? That'll give me 45 minutes...I can get drunk in that amount of time.

I'm tired, SD. So is my wife. 

I took the day off yesterday while my wife still went to school. That gave me an opportunity to get caught up on chores, mow the lawn etc. Sure enough, wife comes home to find me drunk. You know what? I wasn't even trying to get drunk. It just happened. Here's the thing though, how does one accidentally get drunk? Its just...not a thing! I accidentally made a decision to drink and then was surprised when my wife got home to find a word slurring husband. 

I feel so disappointed in myself. My wife is amazing. She is the best thing I have going for me in this world and I am pushing her away. It pains me to see her in despair after giving me ultimatums that I ultimately ignore and push my luck. 

Yesterday was different than the other times. Before, it was her trying to control me. What I realized though is that she was never trying to control me, she was trying to help me. You know who has really been in control this whole time? Alcohol. I'm always thinking about the next drink, wondering when I can drink again. Trying to find new ways to mask my breath so my wife doesn't say, ""You smell like alcohol"" and then look away sad and disappointed. 

Yesterday I finally accepted something that I've been avoiding for a long time. I accepted the truth. **The truth is that I am an alcoholic and I have a drinking problem**. One that I can't fix by myself.

I need to get better. For me, and for her. I dream about our future together all the time, but I fear that if I keep doing this, we won't have a future together.

I have an appointment with my Dr. tomorrow to discuss counseling options. I'm tired of being a disappointment. I'm tired of being controlled by alcohol. 

I need to change.

It is true, it initially helped me pass out after a long day/stressful day/normal day/good day (it didn’t really take anything for me to make an excuse to drink). What I was lying to myself about is the quality of sleep I was getting. After drinking a pint of whisky or a few bottles of wine, sure, I fell right asleep quicker than a toddler after a tantrum. But I would wake up several times throughout the night with searing heart burn. It got to the point I was taking a pill each evening when I started drinking and then eating 4-6 tums when I would wake up throughout the night. Since I stopped drinking I haven’t taken the pill and haven’t woken up once because of heart burn. Alcohol really played me like a fiddle. I’m gonna do my best not to be a fool to it again.

I do well, usually a month under my belt before some event gets me to drink again, which turns into a 5 day stint of drinking, especially if I don't have anything pressing to do.  I've known for quite some time that I wanted to quit, but the allure is something we all know very well.  It's not quitting that's hard, or even quitting for long periods of time for me, it's that if I do it even once, I'm right back to how I was months prior.

In that time I've tried to approach my wife of nearly 9 years and explain to her that I have an issue and would like her to understand this many times.  I can remember three very clearly, but I've spoken about it far more often in a serious manner.  She's usually very supportive, understanding, and pushes me to do whatever I want to do in life, but when it comes to admitting an issue with drinking, her reason shuts down completely and she starts getting angry with me.  Thing is, she doesn't even drink.  She's been drunk around me maybe 10 times in our time together, so I would assume it wouldn't matter to her, but it makes her angry with me.  I've tried to explain I'm not using it as an excuse for anything, I'm not trying to change anything EXCEPT drinking, but she believes that I, and I quote, ""can't be an alcoholic because I'm not drinking the mouth wash and the hand sanitizer if there's no alcohol in the house"".

This frustrating experience has led me many, many times to drinking again.  When I say I've been trying to quit for 2 years, that's actively.

I've never told her not to drink, or not to drink around me, but she's admitted that she thinks if I'm not drinking that I will be judging her and that our ""fun nights out"" can no longer be fun, even though most of our time spent together wasn't spent drinking.  She's pressured me back into drinking by acting like I'm lying, or acting like I'm just being weak and that it's something I could easily overcome, many many times.  I'm about two weeks in again after a monster hangover and a serious conversation with her about it.  She claims to understand and says she gets it, but I know that it's probably a matter of weeks before she wants to get dinner out and thinks I'm going to judge her for her rare drink.

I know this is about personal resolve, but I could have never imagined that something you'd think your wife would wholeheartedly understand and support would become such a contentious issue.  I'm holding out, and my resolve is strong because I don't want my drinking to affect my health, but it's definitely very difficult when your closest and frankly, only, support makes you feel bad about wanting to do something healthy for yourself.

I suppose she just doesn't find it attractive that I could admit a weakness to alcohol.

Anyone have similar experiences?

Discipline is tough, it requires...well...discipline, but that seems a vague and shapeless idea. i get what it  literally means, but how do you get it? how do you do it? how do you hold onto something without a shape?

which led me to the idea of consistency. i have had an enjoyable 5 months, without a doubt the happiest i have been in my adult life. a big part of that happiness has been consistency; the clean diet, the meal prep, the exercise, the hobbies and so on. one of things i want in my life is stability, and it occurs to me that consistency is stable, that is the nature of it. as a drunk i was very unstable, when i am consistent i am more stable.

yesterday, i had a bit of a reason to celebrate. i completed a solid rough-draft of a short script, and showed it to my sister who is and has been on the periphery of the movie/commercial business. she knows her way around a script, and is highly intelligent and hard working if a little overbearing and nothing short of a perfectionist. she's type A, i'm very much type B. while we have had major disagreements, to the point of not speaking for many years, on ideas of religion we can typically find common ground on artistic stuff and when it comes to that kind of stuff i value her opinion. she also thought it was solid, gave some excellent notes, that i not only agreed with, but felt the same things as i was writing it; an awkward phrase that wasn't sitting right, story momentum bogging in certain places - what have you. it was a pleasant text conversation that lasted near 20 minutes, and i got some good stuff out of it for the re-write.

with this accomplishment i found motivation for other creative interests dwindle some. last night i took the night off, a well-deserved celebration, solitary celebration, but celebration none the less. i even had an extra sparkling water, damned be the frequent night trips to the restroom - full speed ahead!

this morning, however, i was aware that i was procrastinating the morning animation practice and that didn't feel good. so, i forced my self into the chair, and told myself, ""just 30 minutes today"" and ended up having productive session. during the session i also noticed that, even as a total noob to animation, i was improving. i was getting better at the controls, i was navigating the endless menus that do all sorts of different things and that can be overwhelming, with more ease and knowledge. over the past week i even made a couple of basic 3-d models - one of my playstation. it's certainly basic but you know what it is right away.

this improvement came about through discipline and consistency. in this case; butt in chair, do the work. in consistency is discipline. in discipline is self-love. in self-love is hope - and well, who knows how far that goes.

I relapsed and pretty much went back to old patterns, the difference being my partner and I just stay home after work and drink. I am ""functioning"" on the surface level (work, etc.).

However, I have been struggling the last few weeks with heart issues. At first, it was a really high resting heart rate and blood pressure. I mean, this hit me hard and fast. One day I was fine, still going to my HIIT classes, the next day, I was struggling. I went to my primary care, and while they saw everything was elevated, my EKG and physical/blood-work were ""perfect"", so I was sent home with a beta-blocker and told I'm stressed. 

Sunday was a pretty heavy drinking day. It's my only day off, which is my excuse. Monday morning around 3:30am, I woke up with a racing heart, anxiety. I mean, I've been at that point before, but it usually settles. However, I took my beta blocker and tried to lay back down. All day at work was a bit of a struggle. My chest hurt so bad. Very tight. I could feel it in my upper back. I took heavy doses of NSAIDS and still nothing. Zero appetite.

I finally went to an ER just to get checked out. Fortunately, all my levels were good. EKG was fine. I talked to the doctor about how drinking makes it worse. I was diagnosed with ""anxiety"" (well duh, I knew that, that's why I drink). I was given Ativan to take for the next few days, which I am too scared to drink on anyway even if I wanted to. But I don't really want to. I'm so tired of thinking/worrying about this, so alcohol, at this point, is not worth it. 

I'm on day 3 right now. I feel overall better just because I'm sleeping like a rock. I still feel the pain/discomfort in my back, but my chest doesn't feel tight. I can take a deep breath. I'm just taking the beta-blocker in the morning and the Ativan at night. (They wanted me to take Ativan 3x/day, but it basically knocks me out, so I wait until I'm home from work!) 

I know I have a list of things to do like follow-up with a cardiologist just to triple-check any underlying conditions. Probably see a psychiatrist to be properly medicated for my anxiety. While exercise is wonderful for my anxiety, I need to put that on the back-burner until my heart is more normalized.

Finding healthy substitutes for drinking is no easy process and often frustrating, even depressing on some days. But step after step, you find yourself, new ways of doing things, or reinvent things you liked about you that you thought were long gone. 

So, when I felt depressed, I got out on the street, took a walk, had a coffee, met people, took time for my hobby and: Gave myself some time! I got better! Right now, I am overwhelmed with joy, unfiltered by poison. And that's when the real fun begins 🙂

Someone I can talk to.,"This may sound a bit uneducated, I am not in the right mindset right now. All my life I have been depressed and have always felt as if I never belonged, blah blah blah. Fast forward to now I am 19 years old. I hit rock bottom at the beginning of the year and slit my wrist open and was hospitalized twice in a week because of being suicidal. (After this I got kicked out of my house) I smoked 24/7 no matter where I was before everything I did etc. my parents are divorced, and what I am about to explain is why I feel as if I am struggling with addiction. My dad has been an alcoholic since the day he was 15. He is 53 years old now. His eyes are turning yellow and he has been in rehab so many times and always does so good but then relapses. He is such a great lerson and it kills me every time to watch him struggle because of how bad his addiction is. He has addictive personality as do I. I have never felt like I belonged anywhere. Since I got kicked out of my house I lived at a ""friends"" who wasn’t a smart choice to be around/live with at such a hard time in my life. While living with him I chose to go out and party every night feeling bad for myself. Then I ran into a close friends family who I hadn’t talked to in awhile and they took me in. I am now living in a beautiful house. With an amazing family that knows how to take care of me and who has made me feel truly loved and accepted. But not I have started to feel that I am taking advantage of them as I did my parents when I lived with them, not coming home at nifht making up excuses and lying. But to the point when I quit smoking weed (had been dependent on it for 3 years 24/7) I began drinking. I drink all the time. Everyone I hang with and meet always wants to get drunk. And I’ve also started doing cocaine.. I have no self control and feel as if I am relapsing so hard. I have been living with the family for about 2 months now and was happy for the first time and went from feeling suicidal everyday to happy for the first time in my life. Now I’m right back where I was before. I need help . I want to talk to someone anyone who understands",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9890350103378296}"

So... enough is enough, until it's not anymore. I suppose we are all familiar with this feeling and that's why i asked for an Antabuse prescription to my doctor... i need ""a little"" help, some sort of crutch if you will so i can start healing. Antabuse does work very well as a deterrent (e.g. only by taking one pill i have **guaranteed** myself 1-2 weeks alcohol free) but as i said, it's more of a crutch than a cure. The problem is the way we alcoholics *think* and that's what needs to change, not just taking a pill. But if that pill gives us some sort of inner peace and a chance to break the cycle,  sober up and start thinking straight that's a LOT in my book. And that pill IS medicine; we are ill and need medical help.


I've already dealt with heavy alcoholism years ago (like 2L vodka/day  starting in the morning) and have taken Antabuse before, so i know that while on it i cannot* drink. I just can't... like pretty much every alcoholic out there i've tried to have a beer or two while on Antabuse (which could be potentially LETHAL btw) and let me tell you, i don't want to feel like that **ever again**. It's the most unpleasant feeling i've experienced in my life.

But as i said in the title it's not for everyone. Besides having potential side effects, you have to be determined enough to take the pill. There are too many alcoholics that ""forget to take it"" to count (i also kinda did in the past, but i was MUCH better by then) so therapy is pretty much mandatory too. Be it AA or your psychiatrist, but Antabuse on its own won't change the way YOU think (for the vast majority of people anyway) but it can gain you some precious time so you can start working on that. Plus while on the med, you really stop thinking about drinking for the most part; you just can't drink, **period**.

Aaand as usual, i think i extended myself more than i had intended to, and since i just woke up i think this post is a bit of a mess but anyway i hope someone, somewhere, finds this a bit useful.

I dont have a choice but to quit.","Ive been a follower of this group for awhile. Probably because ive known for awhile that my drinking is somewhat problematic and abnormal. However, i think i have finally hit rock bottom and cant sustain the life ive been living. 

Ive always enjoyed alcohol the most above all other substances, but its ebbed and flowed over the years. I have Bi Polar 2 and when i am not keeping that in check, is when my drinking and other substance use gets out of control. I lost my insurance in Jan of 2019, so have been off meds for 15 months now. In the last year and a half i got out of a really toxic relationship that ended with him breaking into my home and waking up to him beating the shit out of me and strangling me. My drinking increased after that because my anxiety took over. I couldnt sleep, i couldn't be at home. I was in constant fear. So i drank. About a month after that, i ran into a long time friend of mine at a bar and you guessed it.... We got wasted. I blacked out to the point of throwing up on myself and falling asleep at the bar, and he took me home and sexually assaulted me. I, of course, cut off contact with him. 

Shortly after that i voluntarily gave up custody of my children to their father because i didnt feel safe in our home and didn't want them to see anything young children shouldn't have to see. I eventually started seeing a man, and hes genuinely the best guy ive ever been with. He treats me amazingly, and has been nothing short of wonderful to me. We decided to move in together, and as you can see how the story goes so far, my drinking persisted regardless. I work at a bar, so that definitely doesnt help. Nights at work turned into nights of heavy drinking and blow to keep me conscious. Its been increasingly causing fights between us. 

I got a DUI not long ago and wound up serving my time on house arrest instead of doing probation. I got released from house arrest this past Sunday morning. I went out that same night to ""celebrate"" being able to get out of the house again. I woke up in Jail with potentially a broken hand, in the mental health unit where i was on lockdown and on a 23/1 schedule, while getting librium shoved down my throat to help with alcohol withdrawals.  I destroyed a bunch of my boyfriend's property in a drunken rage when i got home and got charged as such, along with disturbing the peace. 

I have officially ruined the best relationship ive ever been in, gave up my children, and now started myself quite the legal record. I cant believe i ever let it get this bad.

But I think today (or tomorrow, since its after 2AM) is the day for a new start.

GABA slowed you down, relaxing you, making the worries of the day seem small. However, that feeling becomes a coping mechanism for many. And then a habit. But here's the rub. In your early drinking days, dopamine (your brain's reward neurotransmitter) actually thanked you everytime you got loaded. Chocolate sends off reward codes. So does sex. So do opiates. This increasing pattern could be dangerous enough, but seratonin gets it's hand in the game so to speak, and now you're feeling that any activity you do...is just monumentally thrilling. Bars aren't dirty dark dens, they're sexy, intriguing social mysteries. Serotonin paints that picture for you, and dopamine rewards you for the decision to step in the door. It's ""Cheers"" right? But then after years of neurotransmitting that game, the dopamine, and seratonin, fall off, kind of like that spouse, or job, or opportunity that dissapears. The only thing that continues to fuel your desire is a very real craving for acetone (a byproduct of alcohol) It's the conductor, and you're not getting off the train, if acetone can help it. This is when most people decide their drinking might be more depressing, and troublesome than not. Keep in mind GABA nerotranmission is still in play. You're still sloppy as ever, you say inappropriate things, but the true buzz is gone. It becomes such a lack of seritonin, and dopamine, that clinical depression sets in. This is when most people choose to drink to death, or quit. When you DO quit (please don't die, you're so close to nailing this battle) you will feel awful. Dopamine receptors, and seritonin are like resentful children, they will take their sweet old time, to learn a new route to rewire, and neurotransmit into your synapses. But they, in turn, have no choice, they MUST adapt. And when you least expect it, in your sobriety, something will make you smile, and that small act Demands a dopamine response in the brain. Seritonin is released, and a new pathway is constructed in, and through the synapses. Unfortunately, it takes awhile, but it most certainly will happen. If nothing like alcohol interrupts it. If you're angry, and don't enjoy anything, and you're edgy, well, you SHOULD be. Your brain is desperately screwed up. You have to retrain it through habits. Calm down a tad, and cut yourself some slack. Many dopamine rewards, researchers have found, relate to very simply triggers, many that mimic the behaviors of your childhood. A book. Art. Peace and Quiet. Putting on some music you really used to enjoy before it all got weird. It's pretty simple stuff. Trust me, it will come back. Get off the train, and stay away from the track, and your brain will start looking around to find new, and interesting things, that will, indeed make you happy. Give yourself a fighting chance. Remember, that after all the crap, and toxicity you've been through, you deserve this. Just remember, you don't train a dog to crap on the floor for 10 years, and the day you get sick of smelling piss and shit all over your carpet, you demand of it, ""Knock it off...TODAY."" It takes work, and patience to retrain a dog, it takes patience, and NOT DRINKING to retrain a brain. You'll be glad you did it. Within 2 or three months, you'll be firing on all cylinders again. Don't be surprised, if you catch yourself, getting excited about your appearance again, rediscover a Dusty old piano, go to a party, and genuinely have fun. And have a good night's sleep.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

This pledge is a statement of intent.

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

What this is:

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

What this isn’t:

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

When I had a rummage around in my memories for some life lesson type quotes that may have had some influence on me as I was growing up all I found was He-Man. Now, as I am sure you all already know, He-Man was the alter ego of Prince Adam and also the twin brother of She-Ra. He-Man and his friends defended Eternia and the secrets of Castle Grayskull from the evil forces of Skeletor.

Anyway, at the end of every show in the 80's He-Man gave me a little bit of wisdom for my eight year old brain to digest and reflect on for the remainder of that day.

Here are seven of them. (I had to look these up, 35 years later I wasn't able to remember the exact phrasings).

**1) “The People Who Succeed Are The Ones Who Work For What They Want”**

I don't know He-Man. Some people work very hard and life gives them lemons and some people seem to toss it off and they end up smelling of roses. I don't think it is as black and white as you have made out.

**2) “Drugs Don’t Make Your Problems Go Away, They Just Create More”**

I must have taken heed of He-Man on this as I have mostly avoided ""drugs""... but I see the problem here, everyone knows that the umbrella term ""drugs"" does not include alcohol. It's always Drugs AND Alcohol.

**3) “Remember, It’s Your Body And No-One Should Touch You In A Way You Feel Is Wrong”**

Good advice He-Man. I once went for a job interview where the interviewer was a bit touchy-feely. For me a hand-shake should be pretty much the extent of all the touching required at an interview. The interviewer and I would be sitting talking and every now and then the guy would touch my knee! I started to wonder if anyone had ever punched their interviewer and still got the job. Probably not, I decided. As it goes I didn't punch him and I got the job but I spent the next two years trying to avoid him (he was the boss!). One thing this boss was big on was 'team huddles' or 'team cuddles' or whatever the hell they called them. At 10am every day the team would meet by the vending machine for the ritual hug. Fortunately my body came to the rescue by aligning its requirement for a bowel movement to this time of the morning. ""Andy, are you coming for the team huddle?"" he would ask.

2020-03-04 00:20:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fd88au/normal_drinkers/,“Normal Drinkers“,"Hi all… I have often asked myself, and have seen many people in this sub ask too, “Why can’t I just be a “normal drinker“? The type of person who can appear to take it or leave it or can go out and have one or two drinks without becoming consumed by it?

What makes me different? Am I a bad person? Am I weak? Am I somehow broken? No, no and no. 

How did this happen to me? At one time… I didn’t drink it all. And then for the longest time, I was one of those “take it or leave it“ sorts, and then pretty soon I would take it at every chance I got and shortly after that… I couldn’t leave it. How did this happen?

I found this really interesting video that explains the “stages of alcoholism”. The fellow presenting it seems to feel that those people who are considered “moderate“ drinkers or normal drinkers are actually in the early stages of alcoholism. 

The exact progression of alcoholism that he discusses is exactly how this happened to me. I am beginning to change my way of thinking. I used to look at “moderate drinkers” and feel somewhat envious, and that life was somehow unfair. How come these people were able to go out and enjoy one or two drinks with friends over dinner without ending up totally slammed and humiliating themselves? 

I am no longer envious… Now I feel more sad and afraid for them. I know that very much like my one time self… They are balancing on a tight rope over a moat of alligators, but they don’t know it.

Let me preface this post by saying I'm going to talk this out with my therapist on Thursday, but I'd love to get some feedback from others who may have some experience with what I'm going through. Also, sorry this is so long!

So, I've been sober just about 4 months. I went to an intensive outpatient program for a month, supplemented with AA (which I got pretty into). Right before I ""graduated"" from the IOP, I got myself a sponsor and all was going well. Without the IOP, I went to AA meetings every day (with the exception of the one day I went to aftercare at the IOP). I met with my sponsor weekly, but it was very difficult because she worked nights and I worked days, so I ended up having to switch sponsors. It's worth it to mention that while I thought my sponsor was a cool person, we were definitely not on our way to being besties.

Anyway, so about a month ago, I was still really struggling, not with drinking per se, but with food (which was making me miserable enough that I almost wanted to start drinking again). I went to my doc, who said I likely have an eating disorder, and that I should do another IOP. At first I was PISSED because I'd only been out of the IOP for alcohol about a month. But, we play the cards we're dealt and I started treatment.

Honestly, this new treatment program couldn't be a better decision. However, unlike the previous treatment program for alcohol, which was basically 3 hours a day of AA meetings and readings, this program focuses more on trauma, resolving that, and DBT skills to deal with everyday life (with, of course, a lot of things specific to the eating disorder behaviors).

Here's the issue: right about the time I started the ED program, I had been feeling a little unsettled about AA. When I changed sponsors, I had already been feeling with my previous sponsor that I wasn't connecting to anyone in the program (including her), and I definitely wasn't connecting to the program itself (mostly the notion that I have to find a Higher Power, and while I know it can be of my own understanding, I just don't feel ready to put that much faith in, well, ANYTHING, and most sponsors don't give you time or energy to baby step it). My new sponsor is like a complete stranger in that I feel no connection to her whatsoever. Like, I couldn't say whether she's a cool person or not, I have no opinion of her. We just meet, go over AA stuff, go our separate ways. I haven't been to a meeting in 2 - 3 weeks, haven't contacted anyone from the meetings I go to, only one person has contacted me and that was to check and see if I'd be making the coffee this week at the one meeting I have a commitment at. I feel like, I don't know, like AA has done a really good job of keeping me sober the past 4 months, but maybe it's no longer working for me?

But what if that's not it, and I'm just doing my old pattern of throwing myself into something new, and when that new thing stops being shiny and new, I move onto something else? Yes, resolving past trauma and DBT coping skills are great, but am I giving up too soon on AA? And if I do give up on AA for this new shiny thing, what happens when new, shiny thing is no longer new and shiny?",10,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9982699155807495}"

Today is day 5 with no alcohol. I have wanted to drink and probably would have if there was alcohol in the house, preferably whiskey, though I had been getting in to wine lately also. It seemed easier to “manage” or “control” my drunk level. With whiskey, I would drink and think “I don’t feel it yet, I can have more” and it would all hit at once.

My real self control is when I’m out running errands by myself. It would be so easy to just pop in to the store and buy something. That’s where my willpower comes in. I tell myself to just drive past, keep going, don’t pull in to that parking lot. As long as I avoid that, I’m good! My husband knows I’m a homebody so it wouldn’t make sense for me to “run an errand” after dinner or after the kids go to bed.

It's not a person I originally thought of getting as a sponsor as I originally wanted to go for someone that was an atheist, but decided to go with someone that was LGBT like myself, as I figured that but might make things a bit easier. 
First thing that was asked of me was reading the big book, which I, really, not even that I don't want to, but feel that I can't. I suggested going through a secular book of sorts, I have 'Staying Sober without God', but would be willing to follow along any other literature that's a closer secular version of the big book of AA. And I have to let my sponsor know this when we have our initial meet. The big book not just rubs me the wrong way, but the night I had read from it, at a meeting, from the chapter of we agnostics, I got so worked up that I ran into Tesco's wanting to get a drink, but stopped myself in my tracks, negotiating myself down to having a donut, then an angry dump in the store's toilets late, felt calmer and instead of that donut, just got some yogurt. The anger out of my system helped 😂.  
So what do I do? I'll meet with my would be sponsor, I'll tell them what I need, what I can't do and ask them what they can do for me. If it isn't a match, so be it. I'll look for someone that would be willing to work through a secular twelve step program with me. And hell, if I have to, I'll even go down to London to find the person with the intersectionality of atheism and lgbt, that'd be willing to sponsor. 
And if not, I'll just start my own casino, with hookers, and blackjack, just no booze.

It's been so long, and I've changed so much since then. Surely I can control my consumption now. 

I didn't plan to drink, but I didn't fully believe I couldn't drink anymore. I got a new job as a software engineer and I was having a business dinner with our head of sales. In my mind, I thought I didn't even have an option. If I didn't drink they would think something was wrong with me. Funny to think of this in retrospect, but I ended up sacrificing my well being to impress someone I haven't even seen since, and for a company I'm not even proud to work at.

But in truth, it wasn't that one-off event that got me. In my last 3 years of sobriety, I grew soft to the suffering and pain that drinking creates. Is falling back inevitable? Maybe for me it was. Either way, I'm back on the path to a better life now. Stay vigilant my friends.

I started writing a response to it, so many others had great advice back but it started to piss me off...

Why do we have to come up with excuses or reasons why we chose health over poisoning ourselves? It’s just been pissing me off lately now that I’m clean, sober and making better decisions about my life and my health. Why do we have to allow the bullies to be in control? If the majority of social scenes were all laying around shooting needles up their veins instead would we be trying to quickly come up with a witty answer/excuse and/or “be strong” and make it through as best as possible? 

We choose health, so why are we the victims? Why do have to grin and bear the peer pressure? Because majority rules? Even though we choose to make better, safer, healthier decisions in life? It just seems so sad. It’s so sad how accepted, glorified and glamorized alcohol is, until you end up in a gutter passed out or make a total ass out of yourself because then you’re a “problem”. But when you pick yourself up, dust yourself off and loose the poison, oh fuck, you have another problem, dealing with drinkers that push you to drink. 

And why do we have to put ourselves in the underdog level, like cowards, that we have a problem? We are owning it, isn’t it the alcohol drinkers that have the problem? Even one drink of poison, however well you control the amount is still a poor choice. “Everything in moderation”...so a moderate does of heroine is fine?

I lived most of my life in a progressive big city where health is glamorized, it’s where Whole Foods started (originally Mrs. Gooches and was bought by WF). Where fitness is a huge thing, eating whole food vs. processed and fast food. It’s all about salads, low carbs, kombucha, kimchi, protein, organic and naturally grown. Erewhons and Trader Joe’s, probiotics and açaí. So how does alcohol fit into all this? It’s so hypocritical it makes me sick. And on top of it all we have to brace ourselves, prepare and put shields of amour on from the alcohol bullies. 

And while I rant, I have to say, I am so sick of watching/streaming tv. Alcohol is everywhere, in every actors hands, downing it and drowning in it, for “fun” and sorrows, brainwashing away the young, fooling the general viewers and trying to get us to drink more and more. I wish there was a N/A option to switch our viewing pleasure to.

We, as a couple of couples, usually drink pretty heavily but my wife abstained and neither of them asked us about it at all. It was a big relief and I had a great time. It was an added bonus that I remember the entire evening, not something that usually happens when we get together.

The second trial I passed? My wife worked overnight last night. When that happens I usually spend the evening playing video games and drinking whiskey until I pass out. I was really tempted to run to the corner for a pint but I got on here and read through some posts which strengthened my resolve. I decided to go to the fridge for a la croix instead. That’s when I saw that my friend, who had come over Sunday, left two IPA’s in the back of the fridge. It was all I could do to keep myself from cracking them open. I was thinking, “what’s two beers? I’ll feel fine in the morning.” 

I was able to play the tape forward though. I saw myself drinking those two beers then certainly running to the corner for whiskey.

I'm on depression medication and going to therapy. I make myself exercise and meditate regularly and eat healthily. I've worked the AA steps with a sponsor. I do volunteer work. I am staying connected with my friends and family, who have been really supportive of my sobriety.

Any yet, despite doing what I think are the 'right things', I have trouble getting out of bed in the morning, and have to force myself to get even easy tasks done at work. I've lost interest in old hobbies that I used to love (mountain climbing because I had a near-death accident a few years ago, creative writing because I only wrote while drinking) and have dabbled in new things but nothing is sparking interest. I still have euphoric recall of how much more passionate and productive I was in the ""good old days"" when I was drinking, and have a daily battle reminding myself it's not an option due to how far my addiction progressed.

I understand this might be PAWS but it feels odd that I'm more unmotivated and sadder sober than I was for many years of my drinking 'career' (until the last 9 months of my drinking, when things escalated and I stopped functioning).

Anyone with tips on how they've faced similar things in the past would be much appreciated. I'm worried if I keep feeling like this I'll give in to my cravings and start drinking again.

Stress, anxiety, pain led me back to drinking. Time to get a grip.","Been reading this sub for quite awhile now, always debating on posting. Well, here I am now. I guess I’ve known for quite a while that I was on the slope of becoming dependent on alcohol. 

Basically I quite drinking years ago, just simply walked away. Wasn’t an everyday drinker just 2 nights a week depending mostly beer but way too many shots back then while out with a friend. So I just decided to quit!  I quite for about 6 years with no problems. 

Fast forward 3 or so years ago found myself craving sleep( due to menopause kicking my ass waking up after 2-3 hours) also-tapering a benzo which after 20 long years we’re still trying to taper me down . I UNKNOWINGLY became dependent due to trusting doctors. A nightmare in itself which I thought alcohol would help. I’m fully aware of this mix and the GABA receptors. 

I slowly started drinking at home due to the above plus chronic pain, loneliness and and other stressors. Was doing ok just a few drinks here and there but it’s now gotten out of hand. No hard liquor, used to drink wine went to beer and changed brands. The last few months have gotten out way out of control. . Drinking beer basically every night. Here and there I can stop for 2-3 nights. Now I’m finding it harder. 

 I’m not so sure I can handle just one or two beers now. I can also be the impulsive drinker. Something sets me off and boom even though I’m old enough to know better.  I open a darn beer and before I know it I’ve drank 7-10.  Worst nights more. I’ve had some close calls where I’ve Actually taking a Benadryl or two with alcohol not all the time but gets dangerous. 

Also many embarrassing moments as I’m sure most of us are aware such as stupid text messages. 

This last year has really kicked my ass with deaths in the family, An elderly mom I’m trying to help out and we don’t live close. I’m an only child who’s now older herself. And I am battling where I’m living, battling a friendship, and those are some of my triggers. 
I am on disability so limited income, if you saw me you wouldn’t think I was disabled, have invisible illnesses I deal with, that one would only know if you actually knew me. That’s been pretty tough on me at times, hence, drinking. 

All I know is I’m older now and this is not helping me at all! Not one bit with my health just turning to alcohol to try and solve my loneliness and my chronic pain, all my problems.  I have no one in my personal life that is very supportive.  I understand that change has to start with me. 

So I thought I would  finallypost here and try and get support. I’m not sure if there’s many older people on here. I’ve seen some posts, comments 55+ up.
I know no matter what the age though we’re all in a struggle. I’m not sure if anybody else in my age group has found themselves just alone, full of uncertainty and dealing with many life issues. Not shrugging off the younger generation for I do understand you face many uncertainties yourselves.

I can’t believe I let this happen to me drinking at home.  I feel so foolish. I don’t drink during the day either only once in a blue moon and it would be on a weekend. 

When my only friend is here we battle so much lately. We used to get along so well. We have our differences in personalities too but my drinking is not helping the situation. 

I’m not into AA and the meetings are too far. Not many Smart recovery meetings around and also too far and one closed up that was the closest.  I’ve seen some online meetings I’m not so sure that’s for me. 

I know alcohol isn’t helping the sweats, anxiety or depression not anything in my life. I just would like to feel normal again without the effects of alcohol.  I don’t know even what it’s like to feel normal and to get a good nights sleep anymore without alcohol many times, then you can still wake up 4- 5 hours later feeling hot, heart racing, feeling like crap depending on how much you drank. 

I know this is me now and I need to slow it down big-time and hopefully, be able to completely quit or get to that person I used to be just drinking only on rare occasions and not over due it. Only time will tell if I am able to handle that. 

Frightened of this journey alone. Any advice / support would be appreciated.

I’m still super shaken up from last Saturday, it’s been over a week and I can’t stop thinking about that night. I’m not beating myself up over the relapse or anything like that, I’m just kinda in shock from how close to death I felt. It probably wasn’t as serious as it felt, and I don’t remembered much of the night, but things are slowly still coming back to me. 

I remember getting to a certain point and knowing I needed to stop drinking because I was growing suicidal and didn’t know what more alcohol would do to me, but I kept on. I had a sharp pain in my side, it’s like my body was begging me to stop, but I didn’t. I kept drinking and eventually my body wouldn’t even allow me to swallow more alcohol, it was just running back out of my mouth. I stumbled into the shower at some point, I was too drunk to sit up so I layed down. I remember trying to stay awake out of fear of passing out and drowning since I was laying on the drain. I eventually pulled myself onto my hands and knees and began to vomit what I’m pretty sure was blood. I remember begging for death and crying in that moment. There’s a gap in my memory after that. I eventually ended up on the bathroom floor, absolutely delirious. I couldn’t form thoughts. I dozed off for a bit, then pulled myself into bed. I felt peace at that point, I didn’t think I’d wake up. 



And yeaah. All that has me really fucked up still. I haven’t really talked through it with anyone, I start to, but end up holding back on details. I’ve told my therapist, my sponsor, and others that that night fucked me up and that I was scared.

I feel better mentally and physically, I am still working on creating healthier habits. I think about drinking often, and I have had a few serious cravings when I've seen other people drink. Those cravings/thoughts are relatively fleeting. They pass very quickly, even though they are frequent. 

Last night I was on the couch watching Netflix and my younger brother (25) gave me some big news. He is not particularly thrilled, but I am going to be an aunt. I think my heart stopped for a full ten seconds. To put this as delicately as possible, things are quite tumultuous in his life at the moment, so this is BIG and Scary news. We talked for a while. 

The most disturbing part of this situation is that as I was trying to remind myself to breathe and convince my heart to start beating again, I had the most intense desire to drink that I've had in months. This was not a fleeting thought, this was a desperate and deep desire from somewhere inside my core. I actually stood up off the couch with every intention to go fill my glass with alcohol.  My apartment is booze-free, so I just sat back down. I debated leaving to go get booze for a few seconds before I shut that down. This craving though, it lasted at full strength for probably 15 minutes. It was not a pleasant feeling. I spent an hour or two just generally being restless before I went to bed. 

I was not expecting that craving to hit. I knew he was going to tell me something big (he's one of those... ""I have something to tell you."" Ok, start with the thing to tell me next time, I don't need the intro). His news isn't the most stressful thing I've dealt with in the last two weeks. Our conversation had a hidden trigger somewhere, and I was blindsided. I am proud of myself for stumbling through that somehow. I didn't deal with it in the most productive fashion - I should have gone for a walk or something. I am feeling some leftover feelings today - mostly frustration from being hit so hard unexpectedly. I am trying to make today a productive and mindful day, and I can't wait to go to bed sober again (and catch up on the sleep I lost last night).

For instance, i've been meaning to make an dr appt for the over 40 physical (i'm 44), but because of ultra unhealthy habits, irrational guilt about missing work, and yeah, financial reasons i never had, but set yesterday as the day to do it. Only, i forgot my insurance info at home, and said, ""ah, well, i'll just do it tmrw"". Luckily i live real close to my job, and set everything down, to go get it, and make the appt.

Also, for some reason, the area by my cube is a gathering point, and many times throughout the days people congregate there, and have conversations. i participate some times, some times not, but often these conversation are loud, and inane, and it gives me anxiety, and anger. In this sober streak i have been doing better by going to the break-room (yeah, we have a large break-room where these conversations can happen), removing myself from the situation, waiting for them to disburse. Yesterday, i told myself to deal with it, and i asked my boss if we could make some kind of rule, that extended conversations should happen in the break room, or at least away from my cube. he was very understanding, and together we went back there and addressed the situation together. my coworkers were also understanding, and are congregating else where.

without sobriety i would let the anger, and anxiety, and hatred fester, until i could get home and drown them for 30 minutes or so, before letting them all come back only this time being really drunk - so, they were worse ten-fold . this led to horrible nights, and mornings, to start all over again - we know the drill. with sobriety i am able to clear these ""little"" things from my path, and anger, anxiety, and hatred are so much less.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9819559454917908}"

Come home at 2am and face-time some of my friends in America and eat something greasy and disgusting.

**Saturday:** Wake up groggy at about 10 or 11 am.

Tell myself I am not hungover ""just tired"".

Look outside and decide not to workout as I said I would because it's *too cold*, *too late*, *too whatever*. Eat something fried and watch a few hours of TV.

Start to feel anxious that I don't remember what I said when I face timed my friends.

Lie around the house instead of getting my washing, cleaning, etc done so that I can have a restful Sunday.

Cancel a day trip somewhere.

Maybe have a few drinks later on with a takeaway.

**Sunday:** Dry mouth, fast heartbeat.

Sleep in even later than Saturday.

Rushing around to go grocery shopping and clean the house and do the laundry.

Feel exhausted by 5pm, but I have to shower and get ready for the week.

Still anxious from Friday night, but it is wearing off.

Feeling guilty and sad because I didn't exercise this weekend and I spent a whole day hungover.

**Monday:** Anxiety is kind of wearing down.

Trouble focusing on my work.

All I want to do is listen to podcasts and not think about the anxiety anymore.

Still don't exercise, because I am too tired from the weekend.

**Tuesday-Thursday:** Feeling 'normal' again.

Starting to wake up easier, feel like exercising again, and proud of my healthy eating.

Being more productive at work, because I can actually focus on what I am doing without having brain fog and anxiety.

Sleeping a bit better.

I won't drink this weekend- I want to exercise and cook and relax.

**Friday:** Drink again.

My wife was getting home late, and we’d planned to have a drink together. Well, I had a pre-drink. That one pre-drink turned into 5-6 while I was with our kids. She came home, called me out on it, understandably pissed off. 

I don’t think moderation is working for me. I poured out my beers. Today, I just feel like crying, idk why. I know I messed up. I know I need to be done drinking entirely. I suppose I feel like I lost a good friend last night. 

It seems like alcohol is one of the few great rewards for all my hard work and adulting. I think I may have a bigger issue with alcohol than I expected and this journey will be tougher than anticipated. 

I have some things that I don’t understand. I like craft beer. When it’s in the fridge, it taunts me. That’s the reason I poured it out. The red wine we have, the few bottles of liquor, my wife’s hard ciders, and some lite beer belonging to my in-laws is absolutely not tempting.  What’s with that.

The last time I had any extended period of time sober was in 2009 at age 26. I made it almost 8 months and then decided I wasn't an alcoholic and returned to drinking alcoholically until July 4th 2019. So I had 8 months sobriety and then went 10 years off the wagon until it became too much for me again.

This time around is different. I am SO much happier sober than I was ten years ago. I'm learning coping skills, I have real friends, I'm married to a very supportive partner who I love more than anything. Don't get me wrong, it was extremely hard to GET and STAY sober this time around. It took me over a year of stopping and starting to even get more than a couple weeks or a month. But I finally did it and I felt like I was in a place of never going back.

My experience on this subreddit is that sobriety can be fragile at times, but I don't have to give in. I'm not even seriously considering drinking right now, but I recognize these new thoughts I'm having as dangerous and as the beginning of a downward spiral towards actually drinking and then being miserable and hating myself for it. 

&#x200B;

I wrote this on my sobriety counter on July 4, 2019: ""I hate waking up feeling shaky, anxious, and buzzing. I hate being paranoid that I smell like alcohol. I hate not thinking quickly or clearly. I hate the self-hatred and lack of self-esteem. When I stop drinking, I love the feelings of pride and self love. I love feeling quick, funny, and smart. The world seems brighter and more vibrant. I never want to wake up from a blackout again."" 

&#x200B;

I need to remember these things. It's true. I forgot how dark things were when I was drinking daily and hiding it so well. I never drank during the day time but I could smell the alcohol on my own breath from the night before and I was constantly paranoid. I had a habit of 1-2 bottles of wine a day on weeknights and more on the weekends. When I told a friend that she was astounded and said she had no idea I drank that much. I'm a professional employee in a professional setting and nobody seemed to notice. But I felt like a liar and a sham. It was awful.  I know I can't moderate. There is no reason to moderate poison. Why would I want to drink just a little bit of poison to give me a 15 minute buzz and then make me feel like shit? I don't. IWNDWYT",54,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9612659215927124}"

Been 10 months no booze and I feel great. The last few years prior to quitting I had been suffering some significant depression and suicidal thoughts partly due to bereavement and other issues negatively affecting my life. I was a binge drinker. I would be off work for stretches (shift pattern) and I would drink heavily and get my self in bother and feel terrible mentally and physically for it. Since quitting I have progressively felt better and better mentally and physically. It has taken time but for the last few months the depression, anxiety and bad thoughts are gone. Now I'm not saying it is all down to quitting drinking. But I think it has given me a level playing field to deal with the issues I have been suffering with. Basically rather than hindering my life further I got the booze out of the way and I have been able to make progress in my life and how I feel.

My main read is still Karl Ove Knausgaard's *My Struggle Book V*. This one is set in his college years and there is a ton of drinking. I suppose a lot of people would think that's normal these days but from my perspective it's so crazy and scary. He drinks, he blacks out, he does something horrible, he feels ashamed for days afterward, he finally feels better a few days later, then he does it again. Over and over and over throughout his teens and twenties. Yet he never describes himself in all of these books-- at least not yet-- as a problem drinker.  It hits close to home for me and is hard to read at times. I hate looking back at the incidents from my own early 20s, which were my worst ever. Even 25 years later I burn with shame to think of them and just try not to but this book is dredging them up. I've spent countless hours getting this far in the series though so of course I'll see the whole thing through.

On a much lighter note, I am watching Better Call Saul but haven’t seen last night’s yet. No spoilers please! I can't wait to see it. I swore I'd never love a TV drama again after GoT S8 broke my heart last year but here I am, so excited to see a show that I make popcorn and turn off my phone for it. One thing that is very cool to me about this one-- I've never had to rewatch because of being too drunk when watching it to remember what happened the next day. I've been sober for all of it.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

This pledge is a statement of intent.

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

What this is:

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

What this isn’t:

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hello again Sober Heroes,

What's with the wall of words at the start of the DCI these last two days and the stories about vacuums called Henry and beer drinking Tigers? Can't that guy UK4ndy4 just type IWNDWYT and have done with it? I hear you ask.

Well today is a brief one. Not IWNDWYT brief, I meant it's a briefer one.

At the weekend I bought myself a new pair of running shoes, trainers, sneakers, plimsolls, fresh creps, kicks, daps, treads, runners, sandshoes, joggers, gutties, sneaks, tackies, canvers, sannies, tenni-runners.... (I'm trying to cater for the international audience here); basically the things I strap to my feet when I want to go for a run. Now they weren't cheap as I went to a 'proper' running shop and the staff were pretty keen to get me running on the treadmill in the middle of the shop to make sure I was getting the correct ones for my feet, or my running style, or whatever it was they said. I wasn't dressed in my running attire though, rather my 'winter woolies' so I ended up being the guy running on the treadmill with his jeans rolled up to his knees sweating under a good few layers of clothing. Anyway, I was treating myself because according to my 'Easy Quit Drinking' app I should be £1007 better off since I stopped drinking 71 days ago. Woah! I thought. That can't be right.

It turns out it isn't far off, I checked. I mean some of my drinking was in pubs and that ain't cheap and sometimes I would fall for that expensive wine bullshit that the industry likes to peddle to us suckers. But... £1007!! It's great that I've saved it but it's batshit crazy I was spending it!

Anyway, (and here is the brief bit) I'm off for a run in them today and whilst I'm running I'm not gonna think about anything at all. My mind is going to be blank.

Have a nice day folks. IWNDWYT.

It's a wrecking ball to my self illusions to realize that. To have thought 'Oh it wasn't that bad, there was ... no wait.. Okay here, there was that time.. no, nevermind. HA I've got it, what about when.. hmm, no not then either.. HMM' for the past ten years.  
Already my brain is hissing in my ear that I've learned my lesson, surely I can manage it more responsibly this time. It won't be like that this time. It won't get bad again. Except I learned when I quit smoking that -THAT- particular voice is a cruel, lying bastard and can't be trusted not to drop a rubber ball, much less my health.  
So I enlisted help. I found a friend I could trust and told them about what I was attempting to do, so that I'd have some kind of non-anonymous accountability. Someone who, as much as I could lie to myself, I don't think I'd risk our relationship to lie about what day I'm on. Someone to... Not necessarily 'report to', but to be able to proudly announce that Hey! Today's day Four! For Real! And it turns out that their partner also has a historied and troubled relationship with alcohol recovery so we're teaming up!  My friend's partner is a lot more experienced than me, and has been offering advice on dealing with cravings and temptations, but agrees that it's pretty great to know someone to commiserate hurdles with as well as share victories.

It took about an hour, but I reconnected with my desire to stop, reconnected with the part of me that told myself I'd stop, and realized I'd be letting that person down. I also remembered that something I wanted to watch was on YouTube, and so that helped me decide to stay at home and cook and not go out drinking (because let's face it, that glass of wine with dinner would \*not\* have been the end of it).

Today I am so happy that I was able to make that connection with my decisions! I am so happy I didn't let myself down last night, and the cravings aren't anywhere near as bad today.

I meant to have a Dry January. I made it 4 days and felt wonderful, but the part of my brain that wants/needs alcohol came back with a vengeance and I've since spent the most of the last 2 months drunk. I read on this sub a while ago about in regards to falling off the wagon, ""Just because you step in shit, doesn't mean you need to roll in it."" and I spent the last 2 months thinking to myself, screw it, I'm rolling in it, whether I want to or not.

I surprised my marathon-running Wife on Valentine's day by signing up for my first half marathon in May. I've got 2 months to train and get my shit together, so my Dry January has turned into Dry March & April. I've downloaded a sober day-tracking app, I've purchased the books Stop Drinking Now, and The Naked Mind: Control Alcohol. I plan on spending some time reading posts from you fine people every day. I'll run, read, count calories, lose weight, and run some more.

There was a great post a few days ago I really identified with, with someone considering themself sort of in the middle of the alcoholic abuser spectrum. I related, but I also know with each passing day and month that the slider bar on the spectrum slowly ekes closer to an inevitable rock bottom situation, I plan on being proactive before that happens.

I took a bunch of notes as reminders of why I was going to start day one again on March 1st. I wrote it all basically on the Leap Day in preparation for starting the following day, while drinking all of a 750ml of vodka:

What issues I'd like to get rid of:

\- Hiding whole bottles of vodka, sneaking away to make giant, strong mixed drinks nearly every night. On one hand I think I'm getting away with it, but on the other hand, she HAS to know. I forget everything she tells me, I've stopped asking her about plans we've made because I know what will follow is, ""you don't remember me telling you about that?"" I get mean and become an overly critical asshole, and by that point I'm blacked out so she goes to bed. I stay up to continue drinking, sometimes I remember to write down what I said to her in case it gets brought up the next morning.

\- When I retire to my office at 7:00pm to have my drinks and she comes in because she wants to spend time with me, I hide my drink and get annoyed that I can't drink from it, and ask her why she's there, and encourage her to leave. I must sound like Jack Torrence in front of the typewriter.

\- Waking up, feeling awful, and either immediately looking for whether my blacked out self left me giant mixed drink leftovers, and if not, make a new one and just start again. It might make me feel better that day, but I'll feel even worse the following morning, and therefore that much more likely to do it all again

\- Short attention span, inability to concentrate

\- Physical pain and pounding in my chest, easily winded doing the smallest physical task

\- Clammy and cold hands and feet

\- Red, blotchy complexion, sunken eyes

\- Heartburn and indigestion, possible gastritis

\- Excessive sweating, and smelling particularly bad because of it, sweating through my sheets

\- Brittle, ridged, peeling thumbnails (maybe related?)

\- Unexplained bruises, cuts, or even cooking related burns due to being blacked out

\- Trembling hands the next few days after a bender, being unable to write legibly

\- The feeling of ""imposter syndrome"" at work even though I've earned my job and where I stack up. I never contribute, never speak, hide away, do the bare minimum because I'm hungover every day. I used to wear glasses instead of contacts to try to hide looking like shit before I had eye surgery, now I wear a hat with the brim pulled low nearly all day, every day.

\- Inability to fall asleep on the odd night I don't drink due to my mind racing, cotton mouth, indigestion, dull pain around/behind my eyes, and the feeling of my heart bounding.

My growing habit has become a huge boundary between success at work and in my marriage. I want and need to do right by myself and my Wife and get back to being a man I respect again when I look in the mirror.

If you read all that, thanks for sticking in there. I figure doing this might add a layer of commitment. I made it public, so it may end up holding me more accountable. We'll see. But I know for now at least, IWNDWYT!",11,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9988150596618652}"

We did this amazing drive round this remote and mountainous area in the North, meeting lots of people, and we went to a big wedding - the niece of a friend of mine. Everyone was drinking a lot, and inviting me to join them. It was remarkably easy to say ""no thanks, I don't drink"", and that was that! The few people who pushed a little bit were the ones already drunk, including one (already reeling drunk at 11 am) 'drunkle' who just wouldn't let it go. I wasn't about to get into AA, recovery, or sobriety with him (how would I even have translated that!), so I just said that the Dr said I couldn't drink. He kept pushing, asking why what kind of medicine, etc, so I said that after the birth of my last child there had been a problem and now I could never drink again otherwise my womb might fall out. He looked so appalled it was hilarious, so now - mental note - harness the power of the vagina to scare off anyone who wont leave me alone...

Apart from that win, here are others I noticed:

It was amazing to wake up clear headed. 

To read with my kids every night and just enjoy their company. 

To save so much money and buy new jewelry instead. 

To remember every detail of every conversation and not worry that I did something stupid. 

To come back from holiday and discover that although I didn't really pay attention to what I ate, had a dessert most days, and ate whatever was going, I didn't put on any weight.

No moment of clarity, no rock bottom. High functioning; Never yelled at my family, never late for work. My partner (she's a nurse and sees the worst of alcohol abuse) mentions occasionally that she's worried for my health but nothing really drove the decision other hearing about Naked Mind (Annie Grace is mentioned in the FAQ, so I assume it's ok to name drop her program) and figuring ""eh, why not"". So I arbitrarily decided to start the next day and have been 100% intoxicant free since then.

And I don't feel anything different. 

I'm sleeping a little bit better and I only note that because I'm looking so hard to see if anything has improved. I didn't get the shakes or even a little sick. I'm still just doing the same everything from  before. I get up, go to work, go home, feed the family, play with the kids, spend some time with the lady, and go sleep. The only different I feel is that the Urge hits around 7:30-8 when I usually would start drinking just before the kid's bed time then it's gone . I eat a little more junk food now - my body still wants the empty calories even when I'm depriving it of alcohol and there's only so many vices I'm willing to fight off at once - I quit a 30+ year cigarette habit in the fall.

I'm sure this sounds familiar to some of you. What do you do when you're several months or even years into sobriety and you need a reason to not relapse? What keeps you on the straight and narrow when you don't really feel like anything is different? I know there will be stronger temptations ahead of me and I do genuinely want to not be that daily drinker that I was. I don't know if I will dedicate to a lifetime of sobriety or if I'll try to see if I can ever be a mindful social drinker again; too soon to think about those kind of ideas right now, just keeping on the wagon is the only goal with no future expectations.",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9974790215492249}"

I’m sorry if this is long, and stream-of-conscious, but it’s the first time I’ve put it in words anywhere. I found this group of strangers — you all — via a google search and you seem like a really supportive bunch. I literally created a Reddit account for this!

I watched a TED Talk on “gray area drinking” and identified so hard. I don’t \*physically\* crave or need alcohol, so I don’t feel comfortable with labels. I think that’s why I would feel weird showing up to, say, an AA meeting, because I’d feel like an imposter, yet I want the support. I don’t think I’ve gone longer than 2-3 weeks without drinking in the last 10 years. (Even if it was just a glass or two here or there). In a way, my drinking was more problematic in the past, in that it was more frequent, or I’d drink alone after work as way to reward myself, because my job exhausts me, and I don’t like it. I know jobs are part of adulting and perhaps shouldn’t need a reward, but I have ADHD, depression, and anxiety, and I think this plays a role in my self-medication for sure. (I know the irony in that, as alcohol is a depressant…). But I have always been “high functioning” enough to the outside observer. I’ve excelled in my job and most people probably wouldn’t peg me for either of those things… having periods of drinking alone, or the mental health issues. But a few times I’ve not shown up for work, called out “sick” because of terrible hangovers. A few times over the past five years, but still enough that it bothers me.

But in general lately, over 80% of the time when I drink, it’s in moderation. In many ways, I’ve gotten better. If I stop after 2-3 drinks, I’m good. I’ve stopped drinking alone and I don’t keep alcohol at my house. I put those barriers on myself because I felt like I needed it. But the other 20% of the time, if I go out, I still lose track of myself and it spirals. It’s usually in a social setting. I’m the life of the party, I’m funny, I’m ridiculous and uninhibited and people tend to have fun with me. But I’m tired of myself. I’d say once a month I wake up with a hangover from hell — I’ve always had a tendency for horrible hangovers. It seems my peers can drink the same as me and function the next day, but I can’t. Or, I forget exactly how much I drank. I’d say these days are once a month or every other month, but they’re bad enough that it feels like rock bottom. I hate myself. It’s pitiful. I want to punch myself. I’m puking everything for hours, even after the alcohol is out of my system. I’m too weak to crawl to my bathroom and I’ve pissed in garbage cans as a last resort. I’m trying to put together the pieces of what I said or did. Usually, there’s no damage to anyone else, except my own dignity and self-esteem. These moments were perhaps funny when I was 21, but I’m 29. I say it won’t happen again, but then two months down the line, it does, and I hate myself even more, and I feel like a failure.

In early February, I had a bad stomach infection. I was prescribed strong antibiotics and told NOT to drink with them. Like, googled it and people posted horror stories of ending up in the hospital for the reaction. I didn’t drink for two weeks. I felt sad, like I would lose a pleasure or a way to relax or socialize, but in general I did feel better. I slept well. People would ask why I wasn’t drinking, but I had a clear valid reason that no one questioned.

I am not sure what I want to do permanently, or not. I don’t want to commit to being permanently sober, because I’m afraid of commitments and setting myself up for failure. But although I’m not religious, I’ve considered adopting the practice of Lent. Of stopping drinking for \~40 days. I don’t know if it’s what I need forever, but I think it’s what I need now. Maybe that means I don’t belong here, because I’m not as committed. But at least if I have a short-term goal, I can see how it feels. I’m kind of scared of how it will affect my social and dating life. I’m in a band, and we always play gigs at bars. I live in France, where drinking is more of the national culture than in the States. (Sure, less to an extreme, but abstaining is far less normalized).

I can tell my dad loves me, but he's pretty much her hostage in this mess and as much as it breaks my heart, I know I can't help him, because I need to take care of myself first. I cut ties with both of them over 2 years ago and it was one of the best decisions in my life, however sad.

But the nightmares, man. Like every night. I often dream about my parents and my brother, I dreamt about them the last night too. It wasn't pretty. Most of the time when I dream about them, it's just fighting, getting hurt, crying and yelling. It got so normal to me that sometimes I forget I need to warn people who'd sleep in the same room/bed as me, that I am a very restless sleeper. I know my last ex didn't like that; he often woke up in the morning deadly tired after sleeping with me and it made me feel both guilty and upset. In the end he started to avoid sleeping with me. Even if his presence calmed me down, I was still too restless for him.

I feel so broken and inadequate, in general. I have the most loving and caring people around me, but on the inside? It's just ice. A hole in the place of where the heart used to be. I'm not afraid to love, I'm not afraid to get close to people and/or get hurt (which sometimes happens, but not too often, luckily). I'll try my best to help people, to be kind and caring, to spread smile and be someone people can count on. But I just can't with this sadness, this neverending melancholy. 

I feel like I'm starting to close off. And at the same time - I drink more often than before, and in larger quantities. I used to be ""done"" after 3 glasses of wine, but now I can consume two whole bottles and still feel the ice in my chest. I know it's depression, I'm being treated for that - but sadly no therapy nor drugs can help me, if I insist on mixing it with alcohol. It's such a vicious cycle to me, because the doses seem to be working for me, therapy seem to be going somewhere, and yet, I have absolutely no will to stay sober on this planet any longer than I need to be. I love my work, I do it right, but then I come home and I just hit it off to neverland. I feel too tired to spend time with people, I just want to turn myself off.

And I feel so calm in all of it. As if I could just lay down and wait for all of it to finally end. I try reviving the hope in me, and as the days go by, I'm afraid if I ever get it back. My heart is permanently broken and I don't know how to fix it. I feel like I'm too much of a burden in the state I'm in. I've fought with my friend over this. We still haven't really recovered from that, I feel like he used some very hurtful words which made me doubt if he ever truly knew me for who I am. I simply can't deal with it right now, I'm not ready to face the truth that the person that I believed to be my best friend, my closest family, may have taken me for someone I'm not.

How can one stop destroying themselves so much?

I'm a small employer - about 15 to 20 employees on any given day - so I get to know and care about anyone of them that lasts more than a month.  It's a difficult and challenging industry so many don't last.  The ones that do, by the mere fact they are still employed with us after 30 days, are hard-working, tough, reliable guys (all of them male right now).  

One of our crew (who has been with us a few months) has been AWOL since last Wednesday and we've determined that he's been drinking pretty steadily since Tuesday.  What, if anything, can I do as his employer?  I genuinely like him and he's an excellent employee, but this is the second time in two months that he's disappeared like this and when he does, it affects all of us - we're too small to not notice his absence.  So, solely as an employer, he should be fired, though I still would prefer not to do that. 

I have no idea what the ""right"" thing to do is. Obviously, my first priority is the business and all the other employees, but I would like to at least make every effort to help him without enabling him to keep doing this b/c, frankly, we can't afford it.   I, and several other employees, have called, texted and emailed, asking him to reach out and/or just come back to work but he remains silent.  We had proof of life as of last Friday (one of us actually spoke directly to him and he admitted his drinking) but nothing since (though he said he would be back at work at least by today).  He lives alone so he could be dead over the weekend.  Should I send an officer to do a wellness check?  Not crazy about that idea.  Should I go? I'm not confident in my ability to say the right things b/c I don't fully understand what he's going through.  

And what kind of help does he need? Where to start? What's the best way to get him assessed and into treatment, assuming he's on board with it?  Honestly, him saying ""no thanks"" or F/off would be easier b/c if he says, ""yes, I will take help,"" I wouldn't even know what kind of help to offer.  He has insurance but I don't know what it will cover; it is incredibly frustrating to me how hard it is to find help and how expensive these ""treatment centers"" are.  I mean really - how does anyone with a substance issue afford help?  

I know we can't save him, but if there's anything we can do to help him save himself, we'd like to put it out there for him.  He and I aren't friends really, but I genuinely like him and I don't think he wants - or anyone wants - to be an addict.

I've gone 237 days without a drop of alcohol, I've been in some of the most trying situations and came out of it with sobriety and pride. But now, one little foul tasting cupcake slipped through my defense and hit me right between the eyes. I found the nearest garbage can and spit the whole thing out. I didn't even want to swallow before I could rinse out my mouth.

In the day to day struggle, it often seems that things are not getting better. My marriage ended, my health is worse and my financial and professional situation are all worse now then when I was drinking.

But, none of that is what matters. When I look at what truly matters, who I am as a person, I’ve grown exponentially in sobriety. Practically, drinking has been replaced with reading, walking the dog, sober time with my son, volunteering, trying new things, meeting new people and AA meetings (I even chair one now!). 

But emotionally and spiritually is where I’ve grown the most. My life used to be consumed by fear. Fear someone would discover all the lies I told to keep the image others had of me pristine. A constant fear I wasn’t good enough. That everyone was watching and judging me. But that fear has been lifted. I can examine my thoughts and behaviors objectively for the first time ever. Sure I still screw up and feel crappy but I can examine why and have strategies to try and more importantly people to talk to.

Like many contributors on r/stopdrinking, I decided to stop drinking before I hit rock bottom. Honestly, I was terrified of the idea of discovering what rock bottom even looked like, because I already felt like I was being dragged across the bottom of the barrel by my addiction, and yet no one else seemed to have any clue.

I knew I had a distinct drinking problem for at least a year, but I was starting to get even more sneaky than usual; hiding wine bottles that my girlfriend didn't know I'd purchased, masking my breath and drunkenness with mouthwash and by doing dishes / cleaning the house ""busily"" when she came home from work, so she wouldn't suspect that I'd been slamming red wine just a few minutes prior. I felt myself slipping away. And I was spending money I couldn't afford to lose on alcohol almost every day. 

My father's life was basically ruined by his drinking, even though he quit when I was 14. He's still a dry drunk, if you don't know what that means, look it up. He never really dealt with the underlying issues and is miserable to this day.

So, I stopped drinking. Cold turkey. This was not as difficult at first as I had anticipated, in part because I had just completed a week-long binge drink where I found a ""reason"" to get drunk almost every night, *but only socially and responsibly, of course*. But in truth, I was feeling like a bloated, bleary-eyed turd of a human. I felt like enough was enough.

Anyway, I made it to one month sober at the end of last week. I was feeling really good about myself, my head was clearer, I didn't have the daily guilt monster following me around, whispering in my ear. I lost about 10 pounds despite having a more pronounced sweet tooth. And I certainly welcomed the extra few hundred dollars I had lying around from simply not getting drunk anymore. Funny how that works. 

But I was dreading an upcoming musical gig + afterparty (read: huge fricking all-night dancing, eating, and drinking party) that is renowned for its excess. I was convinced I was not going to make it sober through this night with my bandmates. And I was beginning to allow myself to listen to that guilt-monster whispering in my ear again, only now he was a sweet little Furby on my shoulder, and wasn't he just adorable, and oh-so-persuasive about how it was okay to let myself ride through the night on a river of booze...

I play the snare drum in a large, festive, super-friendly Brazilian samba band. I'd say 3 out of 4 members are moderate to heavy drinkers. Drinking is second-nature to the band; the fridge at our rehearsal space is always stocked with beer, and there are several people who bring liquor to rehearsal 2x/week. 

So, the big event. Every year, to coincide with the *Carnaval do Rio de Janeiro* in Brazil, we play a huge Carnaval festival concert in town. If you aren't familiar with Carnaval, it is the pre-Lent plethora of festivities that many countries celebrate. Well, Rio Carnaval is the biggest of all. It's like, a week long there. It's madness. It's also home to amazing, incredible percussion music. So in my Wisconsin city, we put on a good show in honor of the Brazilian one. It's a long story how the band came to exist in Wisconsin, but basically, samba music is an addiction all of its own. Just not an unhealthy one.

Normally, on the day of our Carnaval show, I would start drinking at 2pm for sound check. That would be 3 or 4 beers. Then we'd go out for dinner before the show. There's 2 fancy cocktails, to treat myself for all my hard work. Then we show up to the venue, go straight to the green room and have more free beer from the 30-case in the fridge. Then the show would go on an hour later, and I'd be a blurry, stumbling mess by the time I had to go on stage and play music. The crowd of 700-800 people would be a dull roar in the darkness, not even registering an emotion in me. The show would be over quickly due to my perception of time, and thank goodness - by then I would be dying for a drink. We'd take down the lights and decorations, and head over to our rehearsal spot to drink until the sun came up. Of course, we'd then hit a local brunch spot for more booze and some pancakes. I'd laugh with my friends, say how much fun it was and how long I'm going to sleep for when I get home...

Then I would wander to my apartment. Drop my coat on the floor. Half-heartedly pet my cat. I'd lie awake, woozy, lonesome, and with tears in my eyes. Wishing I could remember the feeling of being onstage, when really it was all a chaotic blur. Wishing I hadn't drawn that extra 80 from the ATM between sets, or bought those two rounds of shots for people I'd just met and would never see again. Wishing I had actually felt the happiness the night before, instead of making it all feel like a distant dream, yet again.

Well, that's what would have happened if I'd drank alcohol. 

Instead, I remember literally every beautiful moment with my friends, every moment onstage playing the SHIT out of my drum, and was even able to stay up til 4:30 a.m. dancing, eating great food, and laughing like a real human being. I've never been able to say that before. 

It wasn't easy. I had several moments that tested me. A good friend (who was very drunk, belching and sweaty) said he wished I would start drinking again. I hope he remembers that. But my girlfriend was very supportive and kissed me whenever I said I wanted a drink. 

In case you are wondering, I will not drink with you today.

I was never addicted, but I was certainly a dependent. Naturally I'm a very shy guy, and when drinking I was actually fun, and would typically drink when chatting up other girls or people in general. Most times, it actually went very well.. made a lot of friends, and girls always thought I was a fun cool guy. Where it began to become an issue? When I'd go overboard, and not realize just how drunk I was, making a fool out of myself. Or when I eventually began pouring cheap vodka daily in my yeti to function sociably at my job, or always drinking when attending events like funerals, weddings, family get togethers, which ultimately just made me embarrass myself so much to my family.

What's worst, is I would even DRINK AND DRIVE to feel safe. How stupid. And eventually this all came crashing down on me when I got a DUI, AND creeped out a woman so much from being so illiterately drunk, and trying to hit on her in the most awkward disgusting way. I felt like a monster, and honestly it made quitting drinking incredibly easy. The thought of alcohol literally turned my stomach because it just reminded me of all the hell I put myself through because of it. Now, a year later sober, I've been able to obtain a great job and do well at it, an also be somewhat sociable (Which I'm still working on.)

The past doesn't bother me nearly as much now that time has passed, but I still think about moving on. When I say moving on, I mean confidently being able to pick up a beer and know that I'm not getting shitfaced, but simply enjoying the taste with food and maybe even light buzz. I'm so scared that it'll all just spin out of control, and it'll start small and gradually work it's way up again because I got a taste of the feeling again.

They faked their emotions and had thinly-veiled attempts making people believe nothing was wrong. Nobody bought it. But to tolerate each other at family or social gatherings they’d drink. And drink some more.  

In the let 3 months he has had three car accidents. I’d like to believe he isn’t drinking on the clock but when he leaves his night shift he starts drinking on his drive home. Out running errands - drinking and driving. Doesn’t matter who is in the car with him. He broke his toe on Saturday and yesterday mixed pills and alcohol and hit the soon to be ex-wife’s car (or at least that’s what I was told) while his daughter was in the car. He has anger issues and he always has to have his way.  

So...wonderful people of Reddit...how do I help somebody that doesn’t want help. If he doesn’t get it he’s gonna end up dead. If you have questions or need more details let me know.  Please help me find a way to get through to him.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9986114501953125}"

2020-03-02 10:38:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fcdtmr/7_years_today/,7 years today,"7 years ago today I made the decision to take back control of my life.

7 years ago yesterday, I got myself into trouble. I was severely depressed and decided to go to a bar.  I left the bar in my car, and almost immediately got pulled over.  I blew over .05 BAC, but under .08, which is an automatic suspension of my license.  Since it was my second one in two years, it was a seven day suspension,  impoundment of my vehicle, and mandatory classes to get my license back.

In the morning, I poured all the alcohol in my house down the kitchen sink.  I curled up in a ball in my bed and cried.  I called family members, told them what happened, and that I had decided to change.  I went through an even deeper trough of my depression.  I told my boss, and I thought I was going to lose my job.  Thankfully, he was understanding and gave me the opportunity to heal.

I went to my doctor and told him.  He worked with me to find the best way to withdraw, and helped me get support.  I found a recovery group locally that offered group sessions and one on one counselling.  I did two years of this, and it was instrumental in my recovery.  They helped me through some rough patches, helped me celebrate my successes, and really helped me work through my emotions and some deep seated feelings I had about myself that underpinned my drinking.

I transitioned into a volunteer role, and did that for two years.  It helped me drive my recovery even deeper.  It helped me as I lost my job and kept me sober through a tough eight months.

So here I am, seven years later.  I'm happy, I'm sober, and I'm feeling good.  I'm looking forward to another seven, then another seven, and so on",118,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9904560446739197}"

I’ve been struggling with my drinking for awhile now and the relationship I started with my boyfriend almost 4 years ago is what made a lightbulb go off. 
I admitted to him that I would get blackout drunk frequently and he said he wasn’t sure if he could continue to get into anything with me. 
I started going back to therapy and it helped somewhat.. I was kind of able to tone it down with just an occasional slip up of drinking too much.
It usually happens while I’m out in a public setting, I don’t know how or when to stop and I think I’m capable of keeping up with everyone else. When I’m drinking at home though, it’s just one or two drinks a night. 
Anyway. Last night my boyfriend sent me an email after I had passed out on the couch and he explained everything that happened. 
I apparently spilled my drink at the bar and got pissed (this was probably drink number 5)
Then on the drive home I became extremely upset and was hitting my boyfriend while he was driving and also tried to open the car door multiple times to jump out.. and also apparently the cops showed up at our place because we accidentally dialed 911... 
This is not the first time cops have showed up and definitely not the first time I have threatened to kill myself while I’m drunk. 
We were having a good day and I really don’t know what made me flip the switch but now he is saying he isn’t sure if we can be together if I continue to drink. I don’t want to lose him to a shitty substance but I also have major FOMO around drinking. It’s all anyone seems to do or at least we all accompany any activity with drinking. On top of that, I do love beer and wine. Like I actually enjoy them. 
I’m confused and sad and hurt and I don’t know what to do. I have been eyeballing this group for awhile and the last time I backed out I intended to post something but didn’t. 

Help. I am lost. Afraid. I don’t know how to even tell my best friend about this. I hate sitting with my emotions too so that is where alcohol comes in.

I pinpointed that it may be because I have a lack of fun in my life since drinking left...

Its hard to admit it, but booze really did at least make the opportunity to have fun easier to come by. I'm less motivated to go to parties or bars... for obvious reasons.

I feel a bit at a loss.

I feel like I just work... and then in my time off I do more work (clean, cook, workout etc). I'll get a coffee with a friend here and there and its nice, but I miss the chaos and the wildness and the fun. 

I am a reformed party girl - was always on the guest list, pack of Marlboro lights and booze from 6 pm until the early hours. I know that's not a great way to live and caused me pain in the aftermath, but I do miss the adventure.

I’m probably going to have a slice of tiramisu from my favorite bakery at some point. I will lay my sober head on the pillow tonight full gratitude and contentment. 
     
Q: What do all of these wonderful things have in common?     
     
A: I would not have been able to do any of these things if I were still drinking.     
    
What would’ve my day looked like if I was still drinking? Wake up late, hungover and anxious because I decided to go out to a bar to “celebrate early.” Drive to the gas station and buy some breakfast beers to chase away the shakes and the anxiety. Go to a bar for lunch. Shots of Jagermeister. Go home lay on the couch. Try to sober up before my wife got home from work so she could take me out to dinner. Drink more before dinner. Blackout. Act like an asshole. Get in a fight with my wife. Pass out in the guest room. Wake up hungover and anxious not being able to remember my birthday or what we fought about. Go get breakfast beers from the gas station...    
     
I am so grateful to have broken free from the vicious cycle. Now I am living my life. Now I am happy. Now I have found inner peace.

I signed up to reddit a year ago specifically for r/stopdrinking.  The fact that today I am 30 days sober, and have been hanging around here for a year says a lot about my journey.  I heard somewhere (maybe on the SMART recovery site) that recovery doesn't really go in a straight line, but is more of an upward spiral, and that has been very true for me so far.  I searched, and tried, and failed, and lamented, and learned, and searched, and tried, and failed, despaired, believed, hoped, tried, failed, hoped, searched, learned, despaired, tried, etc, over and over in what at times seemed to be an endless and impossible quest to get free of alcohol.  I consumed anything and everything sobriety-related that I could get my hands, eyes or ears on.  I had only two hobbies: drinking and trying to quit drinking. A year ago when I signed up here (and even long before that) I wanted so badly to reach 30 days, but I struggled to even get 2 or 3.  I saw people posting with weeks, or months or years and I felt a certain kind of awe.  I felt inspired, but also like, ""How??!!"" I wanted that so bad, but it felt about as attainable as an Olympic gold medal from where I was.  But here I am with 30 days, feeling great (in fact, I'd take my 30 days over an Olympic gold medal any day), and with no intention or desire to go back, and I'm so incredibly grateful.  This community has been invaluable to me.  You guys are my tribe, and I love you  each one of you.

So while I might not be a seasoned veteran just yet, I want to give a shout out and a word of encouragement to all you lurkers out there who are like I was for most of the past year.  Keep trying.  Keep searching.  Keep reaching.  Don't give up no matter how many day ones it takes.  You might slip up, but you haven't really failed unless you give up trying.  And keep coming here to SD.

I drink alcohol to feel more comfortable and confident and recently this has been my way to get the relaxation that I need. I'm self employed and spend a lot of time running round helping other people and rarely get time off so found myself drinking whilst doing paperwork so I can have the ""fun"". When I have a day off I want to drink loads and do nothing. So I posted on here that I think I'm developing a need for drink and wanted advice. 

A comment that helped was about how I could let this problem pass through me like a ghost. It got me thinking  how if I continued down this path that I wouldn't be able to just walk away and that I am lucky enough that it is possible to stop now. And that the monster of drinking has just passed through me rather than me fighting it. 

My biggest problem though was that when I quit drinking before I felt like I was missing out on social events and because of this feeling that everyone else is getting what they want, from my work and them having time off, that I needed something to relax with. I wanted to stop but felt like i didn't know how to relax without my brain chattering with thoughts of work and pressure.

Even my girlfriend wants me to cut back and not drink every night and finds drinking an issue as it was a struggle in her family. This also made me think about all the people I have met in my life that have mentioned about how they want to cut down and those who ""dont have a drinking problem"". All normal people from all walks of life. If it can affect anyone then in can affect me too.

r/stopdrinking is going to be the help I need to feel supported but I'm also going to get counselling to work on my low confidence issues. I also will schedule in more time off for non drinking activities. I want to believe that I can do better without alcohol and that I can feel happy in myself and make sober time to do my hobbies.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

This pledge is a statement of intent.

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

What this is:

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

What this isn’t:

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hello again fellow Sobernauts.

My youngest daughters favourite book at the moment is ""The Tiger Who Came to Tea"" by Judith Kerr. It was originally published in 1968 and tells the story of a young girl named Sophie who has to stay home with her mum because it's too rainy to go to the park. In this story dad has gone to work and during the course of the day a giant hungry Tiger turns up at the house asking if he can stay for tea. Basically the Tiger then eats and drinks everything in the house, including ""daddy's beer"". It's right at this point in the story I would think fuuuuu#%@cck!! The Tigers only gone and drunk all the beer!! I picture poor dad sat at work dreaming about home time and how he's gonna mash that beer up when he gets in. When he does get home his daughter and his wife tell him about The Tiger coming. He doesn't appear overly concerned until of course he finds out the beer has gone! Quick thinking Dad ponders this situation for a moment and then decides they can all go out for tea. Which cafe will we go to Dad? The one that serves beer of course. How will we get there Dad? We'll walk there he decides. There is a picture near the end of the book where they are all sat around the table in the cafe. Now Mum and Sofie look happy and engaged in their tea (sausages and chips). Dad on the other hand sits there with a desolate expression on his face clutching his pint of beer, his tea untouched!

The FORO (fear of running out). When I was drinking a lot I kept a mental tally of how much beer and wine was left in the house at all times. Under no circumstances did I want to start a session that I couldn't finish because I'd run out of beer and wine and didn't have any options for getting more. I'd rather not have any than risk that situation! Occasionally I'd get caught out by my own doing. I was buying the wine with the screw caps and after a particularly heavy session where I'd drunk more bottles than normal I'd put the cap(s) back on the empty ones and return them to the wine rack in order to disguise how much had gone. What a clever chappy I was, drunken me would think.  My wife will never know! Of course I'd forget I'd done this and I'd include these empty bottles in my tally of what I had left. Fuuuuu#%@cck I'd think to myself a few days and another session later.  Where has all the wine gone!

In February I decided it was time to stop drinking. I was able to do a week which was probably the best I did in 15 years. I had a relapse and drank much less, wasn't very happy but I tried again to stop. The worst for me was the fact that I couldn't sleep ( I would fall asleep at around 6 am to then wake up at 10 am ). I had some valium left so I took them which was helpful but when I ran out I went again on that can't sleep cycle which made me very angry and anxious. I did also quit smoking  at almost the same time which I guess didn't help the anxiety but I still manage to be a non-smoker.

The whole month I exercised like a beast. Hard training with heavy weights, cycling and running. Maintained a diet in low-carbs, quit coffee, ate only healthy non-processed food. I also did yoga everyday as well as 15 minutes meditation.

Today I am super happy and proud of myself. Two day's ago I tried something like I did with the cigarette. Instead of saying today I quit, I said tonight is the last night ( I don't suggest it as a solution, that just works for me ). So I did that on Saturday. Had 4 beers and 1 glass of wine ( didn't enjoyed it ). Woke up not very good.

Yesterday, as it was time for sleep, I couldn't do it. It was 1 am and had massive cravings of just drinking a couple of beer to put me asleep. It was really massive but I said to myself that I already had my last night with it. So I came here to this sub with massive night mode screen ON. After 10 minutes, it happened. I fell asleep, by myself without any use of medicine or alcohol. 

Today I just feel incredible. I guess all that hard work and sacrifice I did finally paid off. I really feel like a big amount of depression is gone. I feel happy and I will not drink today !",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9876256585121155}"

Each time I allow myself to let go, totally surrender, and sit with the uncomfortable SOBER sorrow, my eyes instantly overflow with tears.  After each good cry I feel like my soul has been cleansed a little bit more.

Today, was a particularly emotional day for me.  I feel so alone.  Like it’s just Me VS Me— yet like I’m right where I’m supposed to be.  I feel like there’s no more excuses and not a minute left to waste.  No turning back— I made it to shore and burned down the boat I came in.  No other choice except to walk into the fire and let it purify my heart like gold.

&#x200B;

I see alot of posts saying ""i want to do x month clean"" or ""x days"" and if you are a true goal setter and keeper, go for it.  for the rest of us, there is a fear that these are empty words.  so many posts recently saying how they ""failed febuary"" or slipped up.  yea in my mind, i failed feb. but i also failed every other month of my life so far so how is it any different.  i speak personally, but i know from other posts some people will read this and need to hear it. you didnt fail. it doesnt matter how many days dave down the hall has, this is your journey.  day one sucks for even the casual drinkers here to the hard core thirty year bottle veterans, but thats one thing we have in common, day one.

so, and i hate that im using an AA line here but it really is true and its why we end most of our posts with IWNDWYT. key word is today.  i can tell myself i wont drink for a month when everthing is in the dumps, but personally i know that is an empty statement in my own head.  i have no idea what a month will be like from now and to make a statement or promise almost puts more pressure and anxiety on the possibility of a relapse and makes a relapse feel even worse knowing you broke that promise of x amount of days to not only yourself but others.

&#x200B;

take the pressure off folks. dont worry about the wedding you have to go to in june, or the night out with friends next friday. you can sit here and go over and over how that nights gonna go. somethings wrong when you regret things that havent even happened yet.  personally, im struggling.  i want to make it to the end of the week, but its just adding more and more onto my plate obsessing over getting to next friday safe and sober. so for now its just today, just a few hours i gotta worry about. when the time comes im trying to get a good network to work with on those days i know i am gonna struggle, but for now, todays the only day that matters because i cant stop myself from drinking last week and i sure cant stop myself three weeks in the future from today. so maybe its me, but im taking the pressure off and saying i made it through today.",12,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9988101720809937}"

What I forgot about the first time I got sober (it was a long time ago) was that to not drink in the first bit--not just days, but also months--is that not drinking is an actual activity. It is how you learn to be sober and replace drinking with other, better reactions, actions, activities, etc. I have spent the past 2 years slipping too easily into my alcoholic mindset of drinking to get drunk and now here I am, needing and wanting to get out of it. But I was utterly deluding myself that I could simply stop without putting the work in. That only happens a long time later if you're successful. I had that--and then I literally forgot how hard and how important the work is.

I had great memories at the old bar. I’m a loner and could walk in and it was the type of place where you could make friends with anybody. Low ceilings, grungy, divey, metal music or just good music in general. Bartenders and the owners were the shit. Anyways.

I had meaning to check out the new spot since they opened a few months ago. I of course had less desire to go to a bar since I quit drinking 5 months ago. I felt ready yesterday though. I went in the new place and while it was beautiful it just wasn’t the same feel as the other place. One of the bartenders from the old spot was there though. It was good to see him. At one point I said “I didn’t know what to do with myself sometimes after the other spot closed”. It was mildly true. 

I sampled this beer that was on draft, it was a rum carrot cake flavor. It just sounded really interesting. I had about 3 oz of it. It made my face flushed and I could feel that slight little fuzz. It made me nervous. I finished my food and left.

I realized after that experience that things change, because they have to. My old favorite bar is gone. And it was fun while it lasted. And now I don’t drink. And now I don’t have a favorite bar. But now I’m not getting shit faced anymore and making an ass out of myself.  I can’t hold onto the past. I can’t be stuck in yesterday, last week, last year or years ago. Change is good. I’m being more of an “adult”. Alcohol is cheap fun. It doesn’t give you what you really need. It’s not deeply satisfying. It’s placebo. The real good stuff you remember and feel and are present for. I’m ready to keep moving forward and not look back. I can’t be a slave to my old identity or what should or could have been. It is what is now and I can atleast work on that to be really good.

I have drank almost everyday for the past 4 years, most days just like 3 or 4 whiskey drinks, but many days where I drank much more, feeling so sick going into work that I would run from the prep station to the bathroom to throw up, and go back to working. I used to work in a high stress fine dining kitchen, where I first learned to use alcohol to cope with stress. After every shift, we would get 'shift beers' or cocktails while we closed up our stations. For me, and I didnt realize, but I have a highly addictive personality. So this quickly turned into drinking a few more when I got home. And this seemed normal, bc of the environment I was in. Everyone drank everyday. Everyone drank at work, and when they got home. Half the kitchen staff had a previous DUI, and some had two. One guy had an ankle bracelet. This toxic environment seemed normal, bc everybody was doing it. Making jokes about 'functional alcoholism', but laughing at it, not meaning it. During this time, most of the time the drinking didnt result in hangovers, bc I drank everyday, but not a lot, and drank lot of water and that seemed to help. But I started binge drinking on weekends, and making terrible choices. I cheated on my boyfriend of the time (he wasnt a great guy anyways, but no excuse for cheating, that's never okay). I got a DUI.  I starting feeling more stressed at work and bringing my own liquor to drink while closing at night bc one beer wasnt enough. I felt increasingly depressed when I woke in the morning, dreading going to work (something that used to excite me). The environment steadily became more toxic, and my boyfriend, who also worked there, be came more distant (unrelated to the alcohol, he also drank heavily, and was a gamer. He just stopped putting effort in and hanging out with me, and would come straight home to drink a 6 pack of tall boys and game until 3am everynight). Eventually, I found a new job, he moved out, and I moved out. I started seeing someone new right away, who was the complete opposite. He wanted to spend all his time with me, and we would drink and laugh and wrestle and do the intimate things late into the night. That part was great. Things seemed to be on the up and up. I was drinking more at one time, but I wasnt drinking everyday, or to deal with stress. I was drinking to have fun and be silly. I got several promotions at work, and am now the General Manager of the company. But with success has come again- lots of work stress.  And I started slowly drinking at work again. It was a slow start- bc this environment is way different. It's a laid back office, we dont drink everyday, but sometimes someone will bring in a case of beer, and we'll have a beer at the end of the night. (I didnt drink in the office for the first 2 months working there. I didnt know we could). So once I became the boss, my stress level in the evening increased, and I started having a cocktail or two while finishing work every other shift. Then every shift. And now, I've had several times when I've driven home so drunk that I had double vision, and would have to keep one eye closed the whole way home to properly see the lines on the road.  Other ppl drink in the office too, but it's pretty obvious that I do it everyday. And I'm embarrased bc I need to be respected and taken seriously. Especially since I'm a 24 yr old female, and most ppl are older than me here. 
The last few hours of the shift are the worst bc I get most of my work done earlier and I start getting incredibly bored and tense. Alcohol loosens me up and passes the time. (I have to be present in the office for 52 hrs a week, regardless of if I have anything directly pressing I need to work on. I just have to be here, to handle anything should it come up)
So I come to you. 3 hours until I can leave the office tonight and finish my 3rd day of not drinking. Just needed to let someone know what I'm going through. Different ppl in my life know different mistakes I've made, but no one person knows all of it. And no one knows that I think I might be an alcoholic, and am trying to quit. I'm embarrased to tell my sister, or dad. They already worry about me. So I cant tell them. But I can tell you guys. (Sorry if that wasnt all that coherent, I was going to write something short, but it felt really good putting it all out there). Thank you.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9950504899024963}"

Along with the weight loss brought on simply by just not drinking consuming a thousand+ calories a night , I've also felt much more in control and disciplined enough to start intermittent fasting and I've lowered my overall daily calorie count by not overeating thanks to drunkenness. I've had the energy to cycle a lot more other than just my daily commute and I've also started HIIT circuit gym sessions, so all those factors combined have shone through. Losing 13kg (~28lbs), and 13cm(5"") off my waist and packing on some muscle has definitely had an effect, and in turn a boost of confidence has skyrocketed.

I'm a 30 year old woman, formerly a very social drinker, working in the hospitality industry. 

Recently I've been feeling a loss of identity. As we know, drinking takes up so much space in our lives, and when you cut it out there's a big gap in how you feel about yourself, the way you talk to yourself, the things you talk to others about, the things you do for fun, even the things you think about. 

My life has changed so much since I stopped drinking (for the better). I've begun reading more, I've been going to yoga, I've started art projects and I've been getting more rest and practicing more self-care. I have become more of a home-body (happily) and don't care to be 'out' much. I want to spend my time socializing with family and a few friends in my close circle and not out at bars with many people or out with friends who don't have much else to talk about other than their drinking escapades. I do not miss the bars, the late nights, drunk people, any of it. I'm happy and grateful for my new life. But, I didn't realize how much of who I am was linked to drinking. Now that I don't drink anymore, and I've begun these new habits, I feel like I don't know who I am anymore. I thought the main hurdle was going to be overcoming the shame and guilt of drunk actions and wasted time, but now I see that this is a big one as well. This has been such a massive shift from the last 10 years of my life, so I'm having a hard time reconciling who I am with these new habits. 

Has anyone else experienced this? How did you overcome/manage this new direction in your life?

i dont remember where i left off in my last post.  i was and am exhausted and my brain feels like its in a pickle jar.  im cold, soaking wet, a bit shaky, and slept through my first round of meds. more on that later.

&#x200B;

so guess where i left off things were just getting on the bad shakes.  my day one consisted on me laying around on reddit, trying not to puke, and counting til my next dose.  somewhere around dark was my official 24 hour mark and since the alcohol was now officially gone symptoms started ramping up pretty hard pretty quickly. even with the librium i was sweating and shaking pretty hard. i also was an emotional wreck reminiscing about my family and how much i miss them. it wasnt until around midnight i turned out my light and layed in the darkness waiting for sleep. 

I was covered, i mean fucking buckets were coming off me so i know its another gatorade day today.  and while trying to not get to into detail my diarhea was acting up makeing falling asleep on my side very difficult. one wrong move and i would have completly shat myself and i only brought one change of clothes.  it was also around 2 am now and i needed some fiber tablets in hopes it might slow down this crazy train of poop, i was even scared of sneezing at one point.  and lastly my mind was racing.  i was in high anxiety mode for a good long while.  ive been dreading today since the ER on friday knowing today is my last day with a comfy bed and no appointments or classes to worry about shitting myself, puking, or not being able to write all of which are coming up tomorrow.  even my night class has a no laptop policy and im a llittle worried about my ability to hold a pen. i also am so far behind in every class, flunking out maybe a legit thing that might happen this year.  i have a meeting with the dean of students at one point.  as i said the last week is a total blur from dawn til when every i passed out that day.  i know i missed assignments, class, some bills, and rescheduled all my appointments because i was waaaaaay to drunk by even 9 am to go without being totally called out.  today i have to kind of put my week together on how to pick up the pieces of what i fucked up.  its also the last day i can stay at my friends, and after literally two days of locking myself in her guestroom in the dark the room is full of random meds i need,  cash i brought has fallen out of coat pockets and is literally all over the room and bed and i have no idea how much i brought, and as i mentioned the sheets are SOAKED with sweat.  i feel like such shit.  idk im somewhere around 36 hours, just over since that was about 8 am my time i think.  i spent the night in fever dreams waking up after i assume about 20 min intervals and being freezing in sweat. only making things worse was being jolted awake and the realizing my sudden movement turned some things up and i needed toilet now.  i just hope i didnt wake  friend up with all my trips.  then id slink back under the wet comforter and  hope for a better run of sleep.

&#x200B;

all night, my anxiety was through the rough, and my dreams were reflecting some of that.  one where my family was leaving me again, one where this detox didnt matter and i was already on my way to death. lots of very intense dreams but that instant feeling of even though they were intensive, better still than where i am now and just get back to sleep fast.  i also worry that i wouldnt wake up at a time to leave enough time in the day to get my paper in at five and organize and get home before im too much of an inconvience to my friend.  

&#x200B;

slowly the sun did rise, fuck i wish i had a few more hours of darkness, and put in some ear phones for the dog, youll understand more about kirk and his morning noise in previous posts and tried to get some sleep. afraid id sleep til three for some reason with not enough time to get what i needed done, i heard the church bells at one point and tried to count.  theres three churches within a mile so sometimes this is hard.  i thought i counted 12 and literally my heart sank. i decided to say fuck it and try one more round of sleep. 

&#x200B;

when i finally did get up, the first thing i checked was the time and luckily itwas only 10 am.  i wasnt feeling too bad at first but already my stomach is in knots and my librium hasnt kicked in.  if today is gonna be anything like last night, fuck man idk how i am gonna do it.  im not gonna leave her house the way it is, plus i fear some of the things i brought like my niccarette are so strewn about that a dog could get into it if i am not carefil and lastly the bedding.  i have to get all this done, write a paper, organize my week, and get back to my place before the landlord picks up checks tonight. this all seems like so much to me right now.  i just want to stay in bed.  idk its like 11 am right now.  im gonna keep trying to hydrate and around one ill start writing my paper.  hopefully i can draft it out, and get the cleaning done with somewhat minimal nausea or other consequences and lug myself back to my trash heap. fuck if today is anything like last night, im terrified what tomorrow brings.

My life isn’t at rock bottom or anything but I don’t like the place that I’m at, both mentally and psychically. Before I went to college I never drank, I was super shredded and knew what I wanted in life. But after an entire semester of god knows how much alchohol, weed and Xanax I fell into depression. One night when I was on a cocktail mix of xanex and tequila I completely blacked out, threw up five times and fell on the pavement. Ever since then I haven’t felt the same, I’m not sure if it’s brain damage or something else but the depression got worse, along with anxiety, depersonalization and just overall brain fog. Last summer was probably the most miserable I’ve ever been, alone in my room crying while all my friends went out and had the time of their lives. Lovely.

Now you’re probably wondering why I’m quitting now. It’s pretty simple but I’m not happy with the place I’m in right now. I realized I like drunk me better than sober me. Drunk me is funny, seems confident, meets countless individuals and can make groups of people laugh, while sober me is just....me. This is a toxic mentality, leading to me drinking before any social event. Also seeing everyone drinking like degenerates every other day was sad, alcohol IS a carciconen.

Long walks turned into sporadic runs, I sought out a good gym and have been losing some weight. Nothing drastic but clothes sure fit better.

I've been available too many times to count now at moments when I would otherwise have been hungover or homebound, and my still, inner voice has gotten a whole lot louder when it comes to observing, rather than reacting.

I've survived some major triggers and navigated some major tests, been the only one not drinking at just about every kind of thing by now and found it's just fine, if you don't mind watching other people get stupid and smelling them afterwards.

Do i miss it? Hell no. I'm only 1/3 to my first year without it and already understand I've had enough.

It’s a slow burn. It’s definitely not a race and I never really got the chance to experience the pink cloud. 

But....here I am. Thankful for the little things. Reminding myself if anything in life was easy-we would all achieve it. I don’t have a holier than thou attitude but I am grateful I am able to recognize that discipline and wanting a better life-is something to strive for and be proud of. 

I could not and still would not be able to do this without this forum. I barely even know what a “subreddit is” but here I am because it’s what works and helps. 

I still romantize alcohol. Drinking wine with my girlfriends. Celebrating. Friends and social settings that was my “identity” - knowing good wine and cocktails. I’m still that person but still figuring it out. 

I spent 2 hours working out today. Combo of cardio and strength and yoga and meditation. I treat myself to expensive makeup and bathroom products. And now I’m having a Sunday morning bath. This is stuff I could do before but just never bothered. Some days it helps more than others but I am getting to the core of my problems and realize this is going to be a lifelong challenge that I need to welcome and embrace. And stop running away from - and USED to “forget” with alcohol. Although, unsuccessfully. 

Anyway - just random thoughts. Not exactly sure why even but again - if I can get here. Anyone can. Have I lost weight and got better looking, smarter, richer and all my life problems solved? Absolutely not. Do I hope it will and would - duh. But being an adult and life doesn’t work that way. 

I have decided I need to show up in life. I need to show up for myself. And I need to try at all aspects at life - I don’t get a pass at the personal part. We can achieve anything but not if we don’t put the effort in. Self effort seems daunting but it’s the key - the true happiness.

After that I had about 5 beers (2 sat and sun one Monday). Honestly, it was because before I decided to quit drinking for a bit, I had purchased a mix pack and I had wanted to at least taste some of the beers in the mix pack which could go bad over a year.  (They are ipas deteriorate with age) I tasted (literally a sip) about four or five different beers and poured the remainder of the bottle out just because I wanted to get the taste of them and not have them go to waste.  After that, I returned to not drinking, and I haven't drank since then.  think that I had an unhealthy relationship with alcohol at the time, and that it's something that I'm changing. I don't think I'm an alcoholic, because in the past I've been able to moderate my drinking whenever I chose to. For example I drank once as an underage person in college when I was 17 yeah, and didn't drink again until I turn 21. additionally I've been able to moderate to try to lose weight, before I decided to stop drinking this year, I reduced my input from about six beers a week to two or three.  When I was drinking 6 beers a week it was never more than three a day then usually, it was one or two during the week three on Friday and then one on Sunday before work.  Some weeks I drink less than that.  my goal, is to make it until about December or November, before I make a decision on whether I want to introduce moderate drinking into my life again. Most of the time I'm pretty okay, but sometimes on weekends I get angry over the fact that I can't have a beer. I used to go to breweries a lot as a social event and as a way to unwind after work. And I just kind of miss that aspect of being a young professional.  the anger usually subsides after about an hour or so and I find something else to do. But it also makes me feel bad.  I've been very lonely recently in my life, and my alcohol consumption experiencing up tech because of that. I'm not ready to swear off alcohol for the rest of my life, but I am ready to acknowledge that it needs to take less of a central role in my life, and that before I drink again, I need to develop the non-drinking core of my life.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9972770810127258}"

I was doing really well.  Gave up in October after my second “rock bottom” experience. Promised my wife I’d never drink again. 

Got through Christmas and all the events without drinking,but by the start of February I started to get “the itch” again. It wouldn’t go away despite all my best efforts. 

I tried to make it stop by taking black market sourced Xanax in the evenings, my intake of N/a  beers was growing daily and then I graduated to a gram of cocaine at a recent work event. It backfired spectacularly. it blew my head off so much that I started drinking anyway and lost complete control of myself. Was very drunk in front clients and my boss. Ended up waking up on the street outside the event with a massive bump on the back of my head. Total blackout, no idea what happened to me other than I was on the street for at least 2 hours asleep on a cold winters windy evening. 

I am so ashamed of myself. Luckily, my wife was away so she doesn’t know I failed her. I’ve taken secret drinks most days since as I can’t handle the feelings of shame and remorse.  This shall be known as my 3rd rock bottom in 3 years.

I’m now back at day 4 without alcohol but still taking the Xanax until it runs out. Safe to say I won’t be doing the cocaine experiment again.  I have a meeting with my addiction counselor tommorow and I’m so ashamed to tell him about this slip up. 

Sigh. Moral of story : other drugs don’t help you stay sober, who would have thought it? Idiot.

As a side note, go see your doctor asap if you are quitting. Take B vitamins and folic acid. Alcohol sucks the B out of your body like a vampire.

Anyway, just a PSA to see the doc. And don't let them bully you into blaming quitting drinking as your source of any concern. Yes, it's going to be impactful, but so is anxiety.

Anyway. I am so mad at myself. I would never do something like this sober.

This was a good reminder that even though I technically stuck to my three-drink limit... it's still a shitty drug. It felt so, so good at drink two. But if this is the kind of behaviour that that feeling leads to? It's just not even vaguely worth it.

It feels ridiculous to blame this on three drinks. Maybe I'm letting myself off too easily. But the fact is that it happened, and I'm horrified that I let it happen, and alcohol was a major factor.

I don't think this is something we'd break up over, but still. Alcohol isn't fucking up my life? Just because I'm not hiding bottles of vodka at work? Yeeeaaaah.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

This pledge is a statement of intent.

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

What this is:

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

What this isn’t:

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hello SDers. It seems I've been handed the DCI starting pistol this week and it is my pleasure to attempt to not mess it up.

Firstly, fuck Jim! What a twat. Secondly I have 69 days sober today which seems nice.

Once every four years on February 29th I like to vac the car. Anyone with kids will attest to just how much crap accumulates in a family car in a single day nevermind four years. I thought this would be a perfect job for Henry. Now Henry lives in the garage these days. I love him and we've been through a lot together but he got upgraded a few years back and isn't allowed in the house any more. Anyway, when I fired him up he wasn't being his usual sucky self. It turned out his bag was not only full but had split! Convinced I had some more bags I returned to the garage for a proper rummage. On moving a few boxes aside I discovered five large carrier bags filled with empty beer and wine bottles that I must have hidden there at some point in an attempt to cover up just how much I had been drinking that month. I promptly put them in the car and set off down to the bottle bank. Now the bottle bank trip I used to somehow find quite cathartic; purging the previous months misery one bottle at a time. I used to pay particular attention to the other purgers who were there on the day, trying to gauge whether my shame was greater or less than theirs. Some days though there would only be people who had empty washed out jam jars and cooking sauce jars to re-cycle and my heart would sink. On those days in particular I would abjectly call to the shop on the way home to stock back up on more beer and wine.

A stark, sobering reminder of just one of the ways I'd try mask my habit!

This community right here makes me feel so hopeful and strong everyday that I no longer feel ashamed of the fact I have a problem with alcohol. The shame is such a huge factor in why I drank so much; it was like I was so ashamed of my drunken stupidity that I drank again to not feel the shame.
